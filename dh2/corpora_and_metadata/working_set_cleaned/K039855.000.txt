horaces head fleet street mdcclxxxix  advertisement the author of the following letters takes the liberty with all proper deference of laying before the public his idea of parochial history which he thinks ought to consist of natural productions and occurrences as well as antiquities he is also of opinion that if stationary men would pay some attention to the districts on which they reside and would publish their thoughts respecting the objects that surround them from such materials might be drawn the most complete countyhistories which are still wanting in several parts of this kingdom and in particular in the county of southampton  and here he seizes the first opportunity though a late one of returning his most grateful acknowledgments to the reverend the president and the reverend and worthy the fellows of magdalen college in the university of oxford for their liberal behavior in permitting their archives to be searched by a member of their own society so far as the evidences therein contained might respect the parish and priory of selborne to that gentleman also and his assistant whose labors and attention could only be equalled by the very kind manner in which they were bestowed many and great obligations are also due  of the authenticity of the documents abovementioned there can be no doubt since they consist of the identical deeds and records that were removed to the college from the priory at the time of it is dissolution and being carefully copied on the spot may be depended on as genuine and never having been made public before may gratify the curiosity of the antiquary as well as establish the credit of the history  if the writer should at all appear to have induced any of his readers to pay a more ready attention to the wonders of the creation too frequently overlooked as common occurrences or if he should by any means through his researches have lent an helping hand toward the enlargement of the boundaries of historical and topographical knowledge or if he should have thrown some small light upon ancient customs and manners and especially on those that were monastic his purpose will be fully answered but if he should not have been successful in any of these his intentions yet there remains this consolation behind  that these his pursuits by keeping the body and mind employed have under providence contributed to much health and cheerfulness of spirits even to old age and what still adds to his happiness have led him to the knowledge of a circle of gentlemen whose intelligent communications as they have afforded him much pleasing information so could he flatter himself with a continuation of them would they ever be deemed a matter of singular satisfaction and improvement  gil white selborne january  st      the

fidelis and simplex and fautrix suorum regio cicero orat pro cn plancio the natural history of selborne letter i to thomas pennant esquire the parish of selborne lies in the extreme eastern corner of the county of hampshire bordering on the county of sussex and not far from the county of surrey is about fifty miles southwest of london in latitude    and near midway between the towns of alton and petersfield being very large and extensive it abuts on twelve parishes two of which are in sussex viz trotton and rogate if you begin from the south and proceed westward the adjacent parishes are emshot newton valence faringdon harteley mauduit great ward le ham kingsley hedleigh bramshot trotton rogate lysse and greatham the soils of this district are almost as various and diversified as the views and aspects the high part to the southwest consists of a vast hill of chalk rising three hundred feet above the village and is divided into a sheep down the high wood and a long hanging wood called the hanger the covert of this eminence is altogether beech the most lovely of all forest trees whether we consider it is smooth rind or bark it is glossy foliage or graceful pendulous boughs the down or sheepwalk is a pleasing parklike spot of about one mile by half that space jutting out on the verge of the hillcountry where it begins to break down into the plains and commanding a very engaging view being an assemblage of hill dale woodlands heath and water the prospect is bounded to the southeast and east by the vast range of mountains called the sussex downs by guilddown near guildford and by the downs round dorking and ryegate in surrey to the northeast which altogether with the country beyond alton and farnham form a noble and extensive outline  at the foot of this hill one stage or step from the uplands lies the village which consists of one single straggling street three quarters of a mile in length in a sheltered vale and running parallel with the hanger the houses are divided from the hill by a vein of stiff clay good wheatland yet stand on a rock of white stone little in appearance removed from chalk but seems so far from being calcarious that it endures extreme heat yet that the freestone still preserves somewhat that is analogous to chalk is plain from the beeches which descend as low as those rocks extend and no farther and thrive as well on them where the ground is steep as on the chalks  the cartway of the village divides in a remarkable manner two very incongruous soils to the southwest is a rank clay that requires the labor of years to render it mellow while the gardens to the northeast and small enclosures behind consist of a warm forward crumbling mould called black malm which seems highly saturated with vegetable and animal manure and these may perhaps have been the original site of the town while the woods and coverts might extend down to the opposite bank  at each end of the village which runs from southeast to northwest arises a small rivulet that at the northwest end frequently fails but the other is a fine perennial spring little influenced by drought or wet seasons called wellhead this spring produced september         after a severe hot summer and a preceding dry spring and winter nine gallons of water in a minute which is five hundred and forty in an hour and twelve thousand nine hundred and sixty or two hundred and sixteen hogsheads in twentyfour hours or one natural day at this time many of the wells failed and all the ponds in the vales were dry  this breaks out of some high grounds joining to nore hill a noble chalk promontory remarkable for sending forth two streams into two different seas the one to the south becomes a branch of the arun running to arundel and so falling into the british channel the other to the north the selborne stream makes one branch of the wey and meeting the blackdown stream at hedleigh and the alton and farnham stream at tilfordbridge swells into a considerable river navigable at godalming from whence it passes to guildford and so into the thames at weybridge and thus at the nore into the german ocean  our wells at an average run to about sixtythree feet and when sunk to that depth seldon fail but produce a fine limpid water soft to the taste and much commended by those who drink the pure element but which does not lather well with soap  to the northwest north and east of the village is a range of fair enclosures consisting of what is called a white malm a sort of rotten or rubble stone which when turned up to the frost and rain moulders to pieces and becomes manure to itself this soil produces good wheat and clover   still on to the northeast and a step lower is a kind of white land neither chalk nor clay neither fit for pasture nor for the plough yet kindly for hops which root deep into the freestone and have their poles and wood for charcoal growing just at hand this white soil produces the brightest hops  as the parish still inclines down toward wolmerforest at the juncture of the clays and sand the soil becomes a wet sandy loam remarkable for timber and infamous for roads the oaks of temple and blackmoor stand high in the estimation of purveyors and have furnished much naval timber while the trees on the freestone grow large but are what workmen call shakey and so brittle as often to fall to pieces in sawing beyond the sandy loam the soil becomes an hungry lean sand till it mingles with the forest and will produce little without the assistance of lime and turnips  letter ii to the same in the court of norton farm house a manor farm to the northwest of the village on the white malms stood within these twenty years a broadleaved elm or wych hazel ulmus folio latissimo scabro of ray which though it had lost a considerable leading bough in the great storm in the year   0  equal to a moderate tree yet when felled contained eight loads of timber and being too bulky for a carriage was sawn off at seven feet above the butt where it measured near eight feet in the diameter this elm i mention to show to what a bulk planted elms may attain as this tree must certainly have been such from it is situation  in the center of the village and near the church is a square piece of ground surrounded by houses and vulgarly called the plestor vide the plate in the antiquities  in the midst of this spot stood in old times a vast oak with a short squat body and huge horizontal arms extending almost to the extremity of the area this venerable tree surrounded with stone steps and seats above them was the delight of old and young and a place of much resort in summer evenings where the former sat in grave debate while the latter frolicked and danced before them long might it have stood had not the amazing tempest in   0  overturned it at once to the infinite regret of the inhabitants and the vicar who bestowed several pounds in setting it in it is place again but all his care could not avail the tree sprouted for a time then withered and died this oak i mention to show to what a bulk planted oaks also may arrive and planted this tree must certainly have been as will appear from what will be said farther concerning this area when we enter on the antiquities of selborne  on the blackmoor estate there is a small wood called losels of a few acres that was lately furnished with a set of oaks of a peculiar growth and great value they were tall and taper like firs but standing near together had very small heads only a little brush without any large limbs about twenty years ago the bridge at the toy near hampton court being much decayed some trees were wanted for the repairs that were fifty feet long without bough and would measure twelve inches diameter at the little end twenty such trees did a purveyor find in this little wood with this advantage that many of them answered the description at sixty feet these trees were sold for twenty pounds apiece  in the center of this grove there stood an oak which though shapely and tall on the whole bulged out into a large excrescence about the middle of the stem on this a pair of ravens had fixed their residence for such a series of years that the oak was distinguished by the title of the raventree many were the attempts of the neighboring youths to get at this eyry the difficulty whetted their inclinations and each was ambitious of surmounting the arduous task but when they arrived at the swelling it jutted out so in their way and was so far beyond their grasp that the most daring lads were awed and acknowledged the undertaking to be too hazardous so the ravens built on nest upon nest in perfect security till the fatal day arrived in which the wood was to be levelled it was in the month of february when those birds usually sit the saw was applied to the butt the wedges were inserted into the opening the woods echoed to the heavy blows of the beetle or mallet the tree nodded to it is fall but still the dam sat on at last when it gave way the bird was flung from her nest and though her parental affection deserved a better fate was whipped down by the twigs which brought her dead to the ground  depiction of a fossil pl iii pa    mytilus crista galli published        by b white     letter iii to the same the fossilshells of this district and sorts of stone such as have fallen within my observation must not be passed over in silence and first i must mention as a great curiosity a specimen that was plowed up in the chalky fields near the side of the down and given to me for the singularity of it is appearance which to an incurious eye seems like a petrified fish of about four inches long the cardo passing for an head and mouth it is in reality a bivalve of the linnaean genus of mytilus and the species of crista galli called by lister rastellum by rumphius ostreum plicatum minus by dargenville auris porci s crista galli and by those who make collections cocks comb though i applied to several such in london i never could meet with an entire specimen nor could i ever find in books any engraving from a perfect one in the superb museum at leicesterhouse permission was given me to examine for this article and though i was disappointed as to the fossil i was highly gratified with the sight of several of the shells themselves in high preservation this bivalve is only known to inhabit the indian ocean where it fixes itself to a zoophyte known by the name gorgonia the curious foldings of the suture the one into the other the alternate flutings or grooves and the curved form of my specimen being much easier expressed by the pencil than by words i have caused it to be drawn and engraved  cornua ammonis are very common about this village as we were cutting an inclining path up the hanger the laborers found them frequently on that steep just under the soil in the chalk and of a considerable size in the lane above wellhead in the way to emshot they abound in the bank in a darkish sort of marl and are usually very small and soft but in clays pond a little farther on at the end of the pit where the soil is dug out for manure i have occasionally observed them of large dimensions perhaps fourteen or sixteen inches in diameter but as these did not consist of firm stone but were formed of a kind of terra lapidosa or hardened clay as soon as they were exposed to the rains and frost they mouldered away these seemed as if they were a very recent production in the chalkpit at the northwest end of the hanger large nautili are sometimes observed  in the very thickest strata of our freestone and at considerable depths welldiggers often find large scallops or pectines having both shells deeply striated and ridged and furrowed alternately they are highly impregnated with if not wholly composed of the stone of the quarry  letter iv to the same as in a former letter the freestone of this place has been only mentioned incidentally i shall here become more particular  this stone is in great request for hearthstones and the beds of ovens and in lining of limekilns it turns to good account for the workmen use sandy loam instead of mortar the sand of which fluxes there may probably be also in the chalk itself that is burnt for lime a proportion of sand for few chalks are so pure as to have none and runs by the intense heat and so cases over the whole face of the kiln with a strong vitrified coat like glass that it is well preserved from injuries of weather and endures thirty or forty years when chiseled smooth it makes elegant fronts for houses equal in color and grain to the bath stone and superior in one respect that when seasoned it does not scale decent chimneypieces are worked from it of much closer and finer grain than portland and rooms are floored with it but it proves rather too soft for this purpose it is a freestone cutting in all directions yet has something of a grain parallel with the horizon and therefore should not be surbedded but laid in the same position that it grows in the quarry to surbed stone is to set it edgewise contrary to the posture it had in the quarry says dr plot oxfordsh p    but surbedding does not succeed in our dry walls neither do we use it so in ovens though he says it is best for teynton stone  on the ground abroad this firestone will not succeed for pavements because probably some degree of saltness prevailing within it the rain tears the slabs to pieces firestone is full of salts and has no sulphur must be close grained and have no interstices nothing supports fire like salts saltstone perishes exposed to wet and frost plots staff p      though this stone is too hard to be acted on by vinegar yet both the white part and even the blue rag ferments strongly in mineral acids though the white stone will not bear wet yet in every quarry at intervals there are thin strata of blue rag which resist rain and frost and are excellent for pitching of stables paths and courts and for building of dry walls against banks a valuable species of fencing much in use in this village and for mending of roads this rag is rugged and stubborn and will not hew to a smooth face but is very durable yet as these strata are shallow and lie deep large quantities cannot be procured but at considerable expense among the blue rags turn up some blocks tinged with a stain of yellow or rust color which seem to be nearly as lasting as the blue and every now and then balls of a friable substance like rust of iron called rust balls  in wolmer forest i see but one sort of stone called by the workmen sand or foreststone this is generally of the color of rusty iron and might probably be worked as iron ore is very hard and heavy and of a firm compact texture and composed of a small roundish crystalline grit cemented together by a brown terrene ferruginous matter will not cut without difficulty nor easily strike fire with steel being often found in broad flat pieces it makes good pavement for paths about houses never becoming slippery in frost or rain is excellent for dry walls and is sometimes used in buildings in many parts of that waste it lies scattered on the surface of the ground but is dug on weavers down a vast hill on the eastern verge of that forest where the pits are shallow and the stratum thin this stone is imperishable  from a notion of rendering their work the more elegant and giving it a finish masons chip this stone into small fragments about the size of the head of a large nail and then stick the pieces into the wet mortar along the joints of their freestone walls this embellishment carries an odd appearance and has occasioned strangers sometimes to ask us pleasantly whether we fastened our walls together with tenpenny nails  letter v to the same among the singularities of this place the two rocky hollow lanes the one to alton and the other to the forest deserve our attention these roads running through the malm lands are by the traffic of ages and the fretting of water worn down through the first stratum of our freestone and partly through the second so that they look more like watercourse than roads and are bedded with naked rag for furlongs together in many places they are reduced sixteen or eighteen feet beneath the level of the fields and after floods and in frosts exhibit very grotesque and wild appearances from the tangled roots that are twisted among the strata and from the torrents rushing down their broken sides and especially when those cascades are frozen into icicles hanging in all the fanciful shapes of frostwork these rugged gloomy scences affright the ladies when they peep down into them from the paths above and make timid horsemen shudder while they ride along them but delight the naturalist with their various botany and particularly with their curious filices with which they abound  the manor of selborne was it strictly looked after with all it is kindly aspects and all it is sloping coverts would swarm with game even now hares partridges and pheasants abound and in old days woodcocks were as plentiful there are few quails because they more affect open fields than enclosures after harvest some few landrails are seen  the parish of selborne by taking in so much of the forest is a vast district those who tread the bounds are employed part of three days in the business and are of opinion that the outline in all it is curves and indentings does not comprise less than thirty miles  the village stands in a sheltered spot secured by the hanger from the strong westerly winds the air is soft but rather moist from the effluvia of so many trees yet perfectly healthy and free from agues  the quantity of rain that falls on it is very considerable as may be supposed in so woody and mountainous a district as my experience in measuring the water is but of short date i am not qualified to give the mean quantity a very intelligent gentleman assures me and he speaks from upwards of forty years experience that the mean rain of any place cannot be ascertained till a person has measured it for a very long period if i had only measured the rain says he for the four first years from    0 to      i should have said the mean rain at lyndon was     hf inch for the year if from    0 to    0     hf inches the mean rain before      was  0  qr from      and since     hf from    0 to    0    if only           and      had been measured lyndon mean rain would have been called    inches  i only know that inch hund from may        to the end of the year there fell       from jan      0 to jan

we abound with poor many of whom are sober and industrious and live comfortably in good stone or brick cottages which are glazed and have chambers above stairs mud buildings we have none besides the employment from husbandry the men work in hop gardens of which we have many and fell and bark timber in the spring and summer the women weed the corn and enjoy a second harvest in september by hop picking formerly in the dead months they availed themselves greatly by spinning wool for making of barragons a genteel corded stuff much in vogue at that time for summer wear and chiefly manufactured at alton a neighboring town by some of the people called quakers but from circumstances this trade is at an end since the passage above was written i am happy in being able to say that the spinning employment is a little revived to the no small comfort of the industrious housewife  the inhabitants enjoy a good share of health and longevity and the parish swarms with children  letter vi to the same should i omit to describe with some exactness the forest of wolmer of which three fifths perhaps lie in this parish my account of selborne would be very imperfect as it is a district abounding with many curious productions both animal and vegetable and has often afforded me much entertainment both as a sportsman and as a naturalist  the royal forest of wolmer is a tract of land of about seven miles in length by two and a half in breadth running nearly from north to south and is abutted on to begin to the south and so to proceed eastward by the parishes of greatham lysse rogate and trotton in the county of sussex by bramshot hedleigh and kingsley this royalty consists entirely of sand covered with heath and fern but is somewhat diversified with hills and dales without having one standing tree in the whole extent in the bottoms where the waters stagnate are many bogs which formerly abounded with subterraneous trees though dr plot says positively see his hist of staffordshire  that there never were any fallen trees hidden in the mosses of the southern counties but he was mistaken for i myself have seen cottages on the verge of this wild district whose timbers consisted of a black hard wood looking like oak which the owners assured me they procured from the bogs by probing the soil with spits or some such instruments but the peat is so much cut out and the moors have been so well examined that none has been found of late old people have assured me that on a winters morning they have discovered these trees in the bogs by the hoar frost which lay longer over the space where they were concealed than on the surrounding morass nor does this seem to be a fanciful notion but consistent with true philosophy dr hales says that the warmth of the earth at some depth under ground has an influence in promoting a thaw as well as the change of the weather from a freezing to a thawing state is manifest from this observation viz nov         a little snow having fallen in the night it was by eleven the next morning mostly melted away on the surface of the earth except in several places in bushypark where there were drains dug and covered with earth on which the snow continued to lie whether those drains were full of water or dry as also where clmpipes lay under ground a plain proof this that those drains intercepted the warmth of the earth from ascending from greater depths below them for the snow lay where the drain had more than four feet depth of earth over it it continued also to lie on thatch tiles and the tops of walls see haless haemastatics p   0 quere might not such observations be reduced to domestic use by promoting the discovery of old obliterated drains and wells about houses and in roman stations and camps lead to the finding of pavements baths and graves and other hidden relics of curious antiquity  besides the oak i have also been shown pieces of fossilwood of a paler color and softer nature which the inhabitants called fir but upon a nice examination and trial by fire i could discover nothing resinous in them and therefore rather suppose that they were parts of a willow or alder or some such aquatic tree  this lonely domain is a very agreeable haunt for many sorts of wild fowls which not only frequent it in the winter but breed there in the summer such as lapwings snipes wildducks and as i have discovered within these few years teals partridges in vast plenty are bred in good seasons on the verge of this forest into which they love to make excursions and in particular in the dry summer of    0 and      and some years after they swarmed to such a degree that parties of unreasonable sportsmen killed twenty and sometimes thirty brace in a day  but there was a nobler species of game in this forest now extinct which i have heard old people say abounded much before shooting flying became so common and that was the heathcock black game or grouse when i was a little boy i recollect one coming now and then to my fathers table the last pack remembered was killed about thirtyfive years ago and within these ten years one solitary gray hen was sprung by some beagles in beating for a hare the sportsmen cried out a hen pheasant but a gentleman present who had often seen grouse in the north of england assured me that it was a greyhen  nor does the loss of our black game prove the only gap in the fauna selborniensis for another beautiful link in the chain of beings is wanting i mean the red deer which toward the beginning of this century amounted to about five hundred head and made a stately appearance there is an old keeper now alive named adams whose great grandfather mentioned in a perambulation taken in      grandfather father and self enjoyed the head keepership of wolmer forest in succession for more than an hundred years this person assures me that his father has often told him that queen anne as she was journeying on the portsmouth road did not think the forest of wolmer beneath her royal regard for she came out of the great road at lippock which is just by and reposing herself on a bank smoothed for that purpose lying about half a mile to the east of wolmerpond and still called queensbank saw with great complacency and satisfaction the whole herd of red deer brought by the keepers along the yale before her consisting then of about five hundred head a sight this worthy the attention of the greatest sovereign but he farther adds that by means of the waltham blacks or to use his own expression as soon as they began blacking they were reduced to about fifty head and so continued decreasing till the time of the late duke of cumberland it is now more than thirty years ago that his highness sent down an huntsman and six yeomenprickers in scarlet jackets laced with gold attended by the staghounds ordering them to take every deer in this forest alive and to convey them in carts to windsor in the course of the summer they caught every stag some of which showed extraordinary diversion but in the following winter when the hinds were also carried off such fine chases were exhibited as served the country people for matter of talk and wonder for years afterward i saw myself one of the yeomenprickers single out a stag from the herd and must confess that it was the most curious feat of activity i ever beheld superior to any thing in mr astleys ridingschool the exertions made by the horse and deer much exceeded all my expectations though the former greatly excelled the latter in speed when the devoted deer was separated from his companions they gave him by their watches law as they called it for twenty minutes when sounding their horns the stopdogs were permitted to pursue and a most gallant scene ensued  letter vii to the same though large herds of deer do much harm to the neighborhood yet the injury to the morals of the people is of more moment than the loss of their crops the temptation is irresistible for most men are sportsmen by constitution and there is such an inherent spirit for hunting in human nature as scarce any inhibitions can restrain hence toward the beginning of this century all this country was wild about deerstealing unless he was a hunter as they affected to call themselves no young person was allowed to be possessed of manhood or gallantry the waltham blacks at length committed such enormities that government was forced to interfere with that severe and sanguinary act called the black act statute   geo i c     which now comprehends more felonies than any law that ever was framed before and therefore a late bishop of winchester when urged to restock walthamchase this chase remains unstocked to this day the bishop was dr hoadly  refused from a motive worthy of a prelate replying that it had done mischief enough already  our old race of deerstealers are hardly extinct yet it was but a little while ago that over their ale they used to recount the exploits of their youth such as watching the pregnant hind to her lair and when the calf was dropped paring it is feet with a penknife to the quick to prevent it is escape till it was large and fat enough to be killed the shooting at one of their neighbors with a bullet in a turnipfield by moonshine mistaking him for a deer and the losing a dog in the following extraordinary manner  some fellows suspecting that a calf newfallen was deposited in a certain spot of thick fern went with a lurcher to surprise it when the parenthind rushed out of the brake and taking a vast spring with all her feet close together pitched upon the neck of the dog and broke it short in two  another temptation to idleness and sporting was a number of rabbits which possessed all the hillocks and dry places but these being inconvenient to the huntsmen on account of their burrows when they came to take away the deer they permitted the country people to destroy them all  such forests and wastes when their allurements to irregularities are removed are of considerable service to neighbourhoods that verge upon them by furnishing them with peat and turf for their firing with fuel for the burning their lime and with ashes for their grasses and by maintaining their geese and their stock of young cattle at little or no expense  the manorfarm of the parish of greatham has an admitted claim i see by an old record taken from the tower of london of turning all live stock on the forest at proper seasons bidentibus exceptis for this privilege the owner of that estate used to pay to the king annually seven bushels of oats  the reason i presume why sheep in the holt where a full stock of fallowdeer has been kept up till lately no sheep are admitted to this day are excluded is because being such close grazers they would pick out all the finest grasses and hinder the deer from thriving  though by statute   and   w and mary c    to burn on any waste between candlemas and midsummer any grig ling heath and furze goss or fern is punishable with whipping and confinement in the house of correction yet in this forest about march or april according to the dryness of the season such vast heathfires are lighted up that they often get to a masterless head and catching the hedges have sometimes been communicated to the underwoods woods and coppices where great damage has ensued the plea for these burnings is that when the old coat of heath etc is consumed young will sprout up and afford much tender brouze for cattle but where there is large old furze the fire following the roots consumes the very ground so that for hundreds of acres nothing is to be seen but smother and desolation the whole circuit round looking like the cinders of a volcano and the soil being quite exhausted no traces of vegetation are to be found for years these conflagrations as they take place usually with a northeast or east wind much annoy this village with their smoke and often alarm the country and once in particular i remember that a gentleman who lives beyond andover coming to my house when he got on the downs between that town and winchester at twentyfive miles distance was surprised much with smoke and a hot smell of fire and concluded that alresford was in flames but when he came to that town he then had apprehensions for the next village and so on to the end of his journey  on two of the most conspicuous eminences of this forest stand two arbours or bowers made of the boughs of oaks the one called waldonlodge the other brimstonelodge these the keepers renew annually on the feast of st barnabas taking the old materials for a perquisite the farm called blackmoor in this parish is obliged to find the posts and brushwood for the former while the farms at greatham in rotation furnish for the latter and are all enjoined to cut and deliver the materials at the spot this custom i mention because i look upon it to be of very remote antiquity  letter viii to the same on the verge of the forest as it is now circumscribed are three considerable lakes two in oakhanger of which i have nothing particular to say and one called bins or beans pond which is worthy the attention of a naturalist or a sportsman for being crowded at the upper end with willows and with the carex cespitosa i mean that sort which rising into tall hassocks is called by the foresters torrets a corruption i suppose of turrets  note in the beginning of the summer      the royal forests of wolmer and holt were measured by persons sent down by government    it affords such a safe and pleasing shelter to wild ducks teals snipes etc that they breed there in the winter this covert is also frequented by foxes and sometimes by pheasants and the bogs produce many curious plants for which consult letter xlii to mr barrington  by a perambulation of wolmer forest and the holt made in      and in the eleventh year of charles the first which now lies before me it appears that the limits of the former are much circumscribed for to say nothing of the farther side with which i am not so well acquainted the bounds on this side in old times came into binswood and extended to the ditch of ward le hampark in which stands the curious mount called king johns hill and lodge hill and to the verge of hartley mauduit called mauduithatch comprehending also shortheath oakhanger and oakwoods a large district now private property though once belonging to the royal domain  it is remarkable that the term purlieu is never once mentioned in this long roll of parchment it contains besides the perambulation a rough estimate of the value of the timbers which were considerable growing at that time in the district of the holt and enumerates the officers superior and inferior of those joint forests for the time being and their ostensible fees and perquisites in those days as at present there were hardly any trees in wolmer forest  within the present limits of the forest are three considerable lakes hogmer cranmer and wolmer all of which are stocked with carp tench eels and perch but the fish do not thrive well because the water is hungry and the bottoms are a naked sand  a circumstance respecting these ponds though by no means peculiar to them i cannot pass over in silence and that is that instinct by which in summer all the kine whether oxen cows calves or heifers retire constantly to the water during the hotter hours where being more exempt from flies and inhaling the coolness of that element some belly deep and some only to midleg they ruminate and solace themselves from about ten in the morning till four in the afternoon and then return to their feeding during this great proportion of the day they drop much dung in which insects nestle and so supply food for the fish which would be poorly subsisted but from this contingency thus nature who is a great economist converts the recreation of one animal to the support of another thomson who was a nice observer of natural occurrences did not let this pleasing circumstance escape him he says in his summer a various group the herds and flocks compose   on the grassy bank some ruminating lie while others stand half in the flood and often bending sip the circling surface   wolmerpond so called i suppose for eminence sake is a vast lake for this part of the world containing in it is whole circumference      yards or very near a mile and an half the length of the northwest and opposite side is about  0  yards and the breadth of the southwest end about     yards this measurement which i caused to be made with good exactness gives an area of about sixtysix acres exclusive of a large irregular arm at the northeast corner which we did not take into the reckoning  on the face of this expanse of waters and perfectly secure from fowlers lie all day long in the winter season vast flocks of ducks teals and wigeons of various denominations where they preen and solace and rest themselves till toward sunset when they issue forth in little parties for in their natural state they are all birds of the night to feed in the brooks and meadows returning again with the dawn of the morning had this lake an arm or two more and were it planted round with thick covert for now it is perfectly naked it might make a valuable decoy  yet neither it is extent nor the clearness of it is water nor the resort of various and curious fowls nor it is picturesque groups of cattle can render this mere so remarkable as the great quantity of coins that were found in it is bed about forty years ago but as such discoveries more properly belong to the antiquities of this place i shall suppress all particulars for the present till i enter professedly on my series of letters respecting the more remote history of this village and district  letter ix to the same by way of supplement i shall trouble you once more on this subject to inform you that wolmer with her sister forest ails holt alias alice holt in rot inquisit de statu forest in scaccar    ed   it is called aisholt  in the same tit woolmer and aisholt hantisc dominus rex habet unam capellam in haia sua de kingesle  haia sepes sepimentum parcus a gall haie and hay spelmans glossary    as it is called in old records is held by grant from the crown for a term of years  the grantees that the author remembers are brigadiergeneral emanuel scroope how and his lady ruperta who was a natural daughter of prince rupert by margaret hughs a mr mordaunt of the peterborough family who married a dowager lady pembroke henry bilson leg and lady and now lord stawel their son  the lady of general how lived to an advanced age long surviving her husband and at her death left behind her many curious pieces of mechanism of her fathers constructing who was a distinguished mechanic and artist this prince was the inventor of mezzotinto  as well as warrior and among the rest a very complicated clock lately in possession of mr elmer the celebrated gamepainter at farnham in the county of surrey  though these two forests are only parted by a narrow range of enclosures yet no two soils can be more different for the holt consists of a strong loam of a miry nature carrying a good turf and abounding with oaks that grow to be large timber while wolmer is nothing but a hungry sandy barren waste  the former being all in the parish of binsted is about two miles in extent from north to south and near as much from east to west and contains within it many woodlands and lawns and the great lodge where the grantees reside and a smaller lodge called goosegreen and is abutted on by the parishes of kingsley frinsham farnham and bentley all of which have right of common  one thing is remarkable that though the holt has been of old well stocked with fallowdeer unrestrained by any pales or fences more than a common hedge yet they were never seen within the limits of wolmer nor were the red deer of wolmer ever known to haunt the thickets or glades of the holt  at present the deer of the holt are much thinned and reduced by the nighthunters who perpetually harass them in spite of the efforts of numerous keepers and the severe penalties that have been put in force against them as often as they have been detected and rendered liable to the lash of the law neither fines nor imprisonments can deter them so impossible is it to extinguish the spirit of sporting which seems to be inherent in human nature  general how turned out some german wild boars and sows in his forests to the great terror of the neighborhood and at one time a wild bull or buffalo but the country rose upon them and destroyed them  a very large fall of timber consisting of about one thousand oaks has been cut this spring viz      in the holt forest one fifth of which it is said belongs to the grantee lord stawel he lays claim also to the lop and top but the poor of the parishes of binsted and frinsham bentley and kingsley assert that it belongs to them and assembling in a riotous manner have actually taken it all away one man who keeps a team has carried home for his share forty stacks of wood fortyfive of these people his lordship has served with actions these trees which were very sound and in high perfection were wintercut viz in february and march before the bark would run in old times the holt was estimated to be eighteen miles computed measure from watercarriage viz from the town of chertsey on the thames but now it is not half that distance since the wey is made navigable up to the town of godalming in the county of surrey  letter x to the same august        it has been my misfortune never to have had any neighbors whose studies have led them toward the pursuit of natural knowledge so that for want of a companion to quicken my industry and sharpen my attention i have made but slender progress in a kind of information to which i have been attached from my childhood  as to swallows hirundines rusticae being found in a torpid state during the winter in the isle of wight or any part of this country i never heard any such account worth attending to but a clergyman of an inquisitive turn assures me that when he was a great boy some workmen in pulling down the battlements of a church tower early in the spring found two or three swifts hirundines apodes among the rubbish which were at first appearance dead but on being carried toward the fire revived he told me that out of his great care to preserve them he put them in a paperbag and hung them by the kitchen fire where they were suffocated  another intelligent person has informed me that while he was a schoolboy at brighthelmstone in sussex a great fragment of the chalkcliff fell down one stormy winter on the beach and that many people found swallows among the rubbish but on my questioning him whether he saw any of those birds himself to my no small disappointment he answered me in the negative but that others assured him they did  young broods of swallows began to appear this year on july the eleventh and young martins hirundines urbicae were then fledged in their nests both species will breed again once for i see by my fauna of last year that young broods came forth so late as september the eighteenth are not these late hatchings more in favor of hiding than migration nay some young martins remained in their nests last year so late as september the twentyninth and yet they totally disappeared with us by the fifth of october  how strange is it that the swift which seems to live exactly the same life with the swallow and housemartin should leave us before the middle of august invariably while the latter stay often till the middle of october and once i saw numbers of housemartins on the seventh of november the martins and redwing fieldfares were flying in sight together an uncommon assemblage of summer and winterbirds  a little yellow bird it is either a species of the alauda trivialis or rather perhaps of the motacilla trochilus still continues to make a sibilous shivering noise in the tops of tall woods the stoparola of ray for which we have as yet no name in these parts is called in your zoology the flycatcher there is one circumstance characteristic of this bird which seems to have escaped observation and that is it takes it is stand on the top of some stake or post from whence it springs forth on it is prey catching a fly in the air and hardly ever touching the ground but returning still to the same stand for many times together  i perceive there are more than one species of the motacilla trochilus mr derham supposes in rays philos letters that he has discovered three in these there is again an instance of some very common birds that have as yet no english name  mr stillingfleet makes a question whether the blackcap motacilla atricapilla be a bird of passage or not i think there is no doubt of it for in april in the first fine weather they come trooping all at once into these parts but are never seen in the winter they are delicate songsters  numbers of snipes breed every summer in some moory ground on the verge of this parish it is very amusing to see the cock bird on wing at that time and to hear his piping and humming notes  i have had no opportunity yet of procuring any of those mice which i mentioned to you in town the person that brought me the last says they are plenty in harvest at which time i will take care to get more and will endeavor to put the matter out of doubt whether it be a nondescript species or not  i suspect much there may be two species of waterrats ray says and linnaeus after him that the waterrat is webfooted behind now i have discovered a rat on the banks of our little stream that is not webfooted and yet is an exellent swimmer and diver it answers exactly to the mus amphibius of linnaeus see syst not which he says  natat in fossis and urinatur i should be glad to procure one  plantis palmatis linnaeus seems to be in a puzzle about his mus amphibius and to doubt whether it differs from his mus terrestris which if it be as he allows the  mus agrestis capite grandi brachyuros of ray is widely different from the waterrat both in size make and manner of life  as to the falco which i mentioned in town i shall take the liberty to send it down to you into wales presuming on your candor that you will excuse me if it should appear as familiar to you as it is strange to me though mutilated  qualem dices antehac fuisse tales cum sint reliquiae  it haunted a marshy piece of ground in quest of wildducks and snipes but when it was shot had just knocked down a rook which it was tearing in pieces i cannot make it answer to any of our english hawks neither could i find any like it at the curious exhibition of stuffed birds in springgardens i found it nailed up at the end of a barn which is the countrymans museum  the parish i live in is a very abrupt uneven country full of hills and woods and therefore full of birds  letter xi to the same selborne september        it will not be without impatience that i shall wait for your thoughts with regard to the falco as to it is weight breadth etc i wish i had set them down at the time but to the best of my remembrance it weighed two pounds and eight ounces and measured from wing to wing thirtyeight inches it is cere and feet were yellow and the circle of it is eyelids a bright yellow as it had been killed some days and the eyes were sunk i could make no good observation on the color of the pupils and the irides  the most unusual birds i ever observed in these parts were a pair of hoopoes upupa which came several years ago in the summer and frequented an ornamented piece of ground which joins to my garden for some weeks they used to march about in a stately manner feeding in the walks many times in the day and seemed disposed to breed in my outlet but were frighted and persecuted by idle boys who would never let them be at rest  three grossbeaks loxia coccothraustes appeared some years ago in my fields in the winter one of which i shot since that now and then one is occasionally seen in the same dead season  a crossbill loxia curvirostra was killed last year in this neighborhood  our streams which are small and rise only at the end of the village yield nothing but the bullshead or millersthumb gobius fluviatilis capitatus the trout trutta fluviatilis the eel anguilla the lampern lampaetra parva et fluviatilis and the stickleback pisciculus aculeatus  we are twenty miles from the sea and almost as many from a great river and therefore see but little of seabirds as to wild fowls we have a few teems of ducks bred in the moors where the snipes breed and multitudes of widgeons and teals in hard weather frequent our lakes in the forest  having some acquaintance with a tame brown owl i find that it casts up the fur of mice and the feathers of birds in pellets after the manner of hawks when full like a dog it hides what it cannot eat  the young of the barnowl are not easily raised as they want a constant supply of fresh mice whereas the young of the brown owl will eat indiscriminately all that is brought snails rats kittens puppies magpies and any kind of carrion or offal  the housemartins have eggs still and squabyoung the last swift i observed was about the twentyfirst of august it was a straggler  redstarts flycatchers whitethroats and reguli non cristati still appear but i have seen no blackcaps lately  i forgot to mention that i once saw in christ church college quadrangle in oxford on a very sunny warm morning a house martin flying about and settling on the parapets so late as the twentieth of november  at present i know only two species of bats the common vespertilio murinus and the vespertilio auribus  i was much entertained last summer with a tame bat which would take flies out of a persons hand if you gave it any thing to eat it brought it is wings round before the mouth hovering and hiding it is head in the manner of birds of prey when they feed the adroitness it showed in shearing off the wings of the flies which were always rejected was worthy of observation and pleased me much insects seemed to be most acceptable though it did not refuse raw flesh when offered so that the notion that bats go down chimnies and gnaw mens bacon seems no improbable story while i amused myself with this wonderful quadruped i saw it several times confute the vulgar opinion that bats when down on a flat furface cannot get on the wing again by rising with great ease from the floor it ran i observed with more dispatch than i was aware of but in a most ridiculous and grotesque manner  bats drink on the wing like swallows by sipping the surface as they play over pools and streams they love to frequent waters not only for the sake of drinking but on account of insects which are found over them in the greatest plenty as i was going some years ago pretty late in a boat from richmond to sunbury on a warm summers evening i think i saw myriads of bats between the two places the air swarmed with them all along the thames so that hundreds were in sight at a time  i am etc  letter xii to the same november        sir it gave me no small satisfaction to hear that the falco this hawk proved to be the falco peregrinus a variety turned out an uncommon one i must confess i should have been better pleased to have heard that i had sent you a bird that you had never seen before but that i find would be a difficult task  i have procured some of the mice mentioned in my former letters a young one and a female with young both of which i have preserved in brandy from the color shape size and manner of nesting i make no doubt but that the species is nondescript they are much smaller and more slender than the mus domesticus medius of ray and have more of the squirrel or dormouse color their belly is white a straight line along their sides divides the shades of their back and belly they never enter into houses are carried into ricks and barns with the sheaves abound in harvest and build their nests amidst the straws of the corn above the ground and sometimes in thistles they breed as many as eight at a litter in a little round nest composed of the blades of grass or wheat  one of these nests i procured this autumn most artificially platted and composed of the blades of wheat perfectly round and about the size of a cricketball with the aperture so ingeniously closed that there was no discovering to what part it belonged it was so compact and well filled that it would roll across the table without being discomposed though it contained eight little mice that were naked and blind as this nest was perfectly full how could the dam come at her litter respectively so as to administer a teat to each perhaps she opens different places for that purpose adjusting them again when the business is over but she could not possibly be contained herself in the ball with her young which moreover would be daily increasing in bulk this wonderful procreant cradle an elegant instance of the efforts of instinct was found in a wheatfield suspended in the head of a thistle  a gentleman curious in birds wrote me word that his servant had shot one last january in that severe weather which he believed would puzzle me i called to see it this summer not knowing what to expect but the moment i took it in hand i pronounced it the male garrulus bohemicus or german silktail from the five peculiar crimson tags or points which it carries at the ends of five of the short remiges it cannot i suppose with any propriety be called an english bird and yet i see by rays philosoph letters that great flocks of them feeding on haws appeared in this kingdom in the winter of       the mention of haws puts me in mind that there is a total failure of that wild fruit so conducive to the support of many of the winged nation for the same severe weather late in the spring which cut off all the produce of the more tender and curious trees destroyed also that of the more hardy and common  some birds haunting with the misselthrushes and feeding on the berries of the yewtree which answered to the description of the merula torquata or ringouzel were lately seen in this neighborhood i employed some people to procure me a specimen but without success see letter viii  query  might not canary birds be naturalized to this climate provided their eggs were put in the spring into the nests of some of their congeners as goldfinches greenfinches etc before winter perhaps they might be hardened and able to shift for themselves  about ten years ago i used to spend some weeks yearly at sunbury which is one of those pleasant villages lying on the thames near hampton court in the autumn i could not help being much amused with those myriads of the swallow kind which assemble in those parts but what struck me most was that from the time they began to congregate forsaking the chimnies and houses they roosted every night in the osierbeds of the aits of that river now this resorting toward that element at that season of the year seems to give some countenance to the northern opinion strange as it is of their retiring under water a swedish naturalist is so much persuaded of that fact that he talks in his calendar of flora as familiarly of the swallows going under water in the beginning of september as he would of his poultry going to roost a little before sunset  an observing gentleman in london writes me word that he saw an housemartin on the twentythird of last october flying in and out of it is nest in the borough and i myself on the twentyninth of last october as i was traveling through oxford saw four or five swallows hovering round and settling on the roof of the countyhospital  now is it likely that these poor little birds which perhaps had not been hatched but a few weeks should at that late season of the year and from so midland a county attempt a voyage to goree or senegal almost as far as the equator see adansons voyage to senegal   i acquiesce entirely in your opinion  that though most of the swallow kind may migrate yet that some do stay behind and hide with us during the winter  as to the shortwinged softbilled birds which come trooping in such numbers in the spring i am at a loss even what to suspect about them i watched them narrowly this year and saw them abound till about michaelmas when they appeared no longer subsist they cannot openly among us and yet elude the eyes of the inquisitive and as to their hiding no man pretends to have found any of them in a torpid state in the winter but with regard to their migration what difficulties attend that supposition that such feeble bad fliers who the summer long never flit but from hedge to hedge should be able to traverse vast seas and continents in order to enjoy milder seasons amidst the regions of africa  letter xiii to the same selborne jan         sir as in one of your former letters you expressed the more satisfaction from my correspondence on account of my living in the most southerly county so now i may return the compliment and expect to have my curiosity gratified by your living much more to the north  for many years past i have observed that toward christmas vast flocks of chaffinches have appeared in the fields many more i used to think than could be hatched in any one neighborhood but when i came to observe them more narrowly i was amazed to find that they seemed to me to be almost all hens i communicated my suspicions to some intelligent neighbors who after taking pains about the matter declared that they also thought them all mostly females at least fifty to one this extraordinary occurrence brought to my mind the remark of linnaeus that before winter all their hen chaffinches migrate through holland into italy now i want to know from some curious person in the north whether there are any large flocks of these finches with them in the winter and of which sex they mostly consist for from such intelligence one might be able to judge whether our female flocks migrate from the other end of the island or whether they come over to us from the continent  we have in the winter vast flocks of the common linnets more i think than can be bred in any one district these i observe when the spring advances assemble on some tree in the sunshine and join all in a gentle sort of chirping as if they were about to break up their winter quarters and betake themselves to their proper summer homes it is well known at least that the swallows and the fieldfares do congregate with a gentle twittering before they make their respective departure  you may depend on it that the bunting emberiza miliaria does not leave this county in the winter in january      i saw several dozen of them in the midst of a severe frost among the bushes on the downs near andover in our woodland enclosed district it is a rare bird  wagtails both white and yellow are with us all the winter quails crowd to our southern coast and are often killed in numbers by people that go on purpose  mr stillingfleet in his tracts says that if the wheatear aenanthe does not quit england it certainly shifts places for about harvest they are not to be found where there was before great plenty of them this well accounts for the vast quantities that are caught about that time on the south downs near jews where they are esteemed a delicacy there have been shepherds i have been credibly informed that have made many pounds in a season by catching them in traps and though such multitudes are taken i never saw and i am well acquainted with those parts above two or three at a time for they are never gregarious they may perhaps migrate in general and for that purpose draw toward the coast of sussex in autumn but that they do not all withdraw i am sure because i see a few stragglers in many counties at all times of the year especially about warrens and stone quarries  i have no acquaintance at present among the gentlemen of the navy but have written to a friend who was a seachaplain in the late war desiring him to look into his minutes with respect to birds that settled on their rigging during their voyage up or down the channel what hasselquist says on that subject is remarkable there were little shortwinged birds frequently coming on board his ship all the way from our channel quite up to the levant especially before squally weather  what you suggest with regard to spain is highly probable the winters of andalusia are so mild that in all likelihood the softbilled birds that leave us at that season may find insects sufficient to support them there  some young man possessed of fortune health and leisure should make an autumnal voyage into that kingdom and should spend a year there investigating the natural history of that vast country mr willughby see rays travels p     passed through that kingdom on such an errand but he seems to have skirted along in a superficial manner and an ill humor being much disgusted at the rude dissolute manners of the people  i have no friend left now at sunbury to apply to about the swallows roosting on the aits of the thames nor can i hear any more about those birds which i suspected were merulae torquatae  as to the small mice i have farther to remark that though they hang their nests for breeding up amidst the straws of the standing corn above the ground yet i find that in the winter they burrow deep in the earth and make warm beds of grass but their grand rendezvous seems to be in cornricks into which they are carried at harvest a neighbor housed an oatrick lately under the thatch of which were assembled near an hundred most of which were taken and some i saw i measured them and found that from nose to tail they were just two inches and a quarter and their tails just two inches long two of them in a scale weighed down just one copper halfpenny which is about the third of an ounce avoirdupois so that i suppose they are the smallest quadrupeds in this island a fullgrown mus medius domesticus weighs i find one ounce lumping weight which is more than six times as much as the mouse above and measures from nose to rump four inches and a quarter and the same in it is tail we have had a very severe frost and deep snow this month my thermometer was one day fourteen degrees and an half below the freezing point within doors the tender evergreens were injured pretty much it was very providential that the air was still and the ground well covered with snow else vegetation in general must have suffered prodigiously there is reason to believe that some days were more severe than any since the year      0  i am etc etc  letter xiv to the same selborne march         dear sir if some curious gentleman would procure the head of a fallowdeer and have it dissected he would find it furnished with two spiracula or breathingplaces besides the nostrils probably analogous to the puncta lachrymalia in the human head when deer are thirsty they plunge their noses like some horses very deep under water while in the act of drinking and continue them in that situation for a considerable time but to obviate any inconveniency they can open two vents one at the inner corner of each eye having a communication with the nose here seems to be an extraordinary provision of nature worthy our attention and which has not that i know of been noticed by any naturalist for it looks as if these creatures would not be suffocated though both their mouths and nostrils were stopped this curious formation of the head may be of singular service to beasts of chase by affording them free respiration and no doubt these additional nostrils are thrown open when they are hard run in answer to this account mr pennant sent me the following curious and pertinent reply i was much surprised to find in the ant elope something analogous to what you mention as so remarkable in deer this animal also has a long slit beneath each eye which can be opened and shut at pleasure on holding an orange to one the creature made as much use of those orifices as of his nostrils applying them to the fruit and seeming to smell it through them  mr ray observed that at malta the owners slit up the nostrils of such asses as were hard worked for they being naturally strait or small did not admit air sufficient to serve them when they traveled or labored in that hot climate and we know that grooms and gentlemen of the turf think large nostrils necessary and a perfection in hunters and running horses  oppian the greek poet by the following line seems to have had some notion that stags have four spiracula  quadrifidae nares quadruplices ad respirationem canales opp cyn lib ii l      writers copying from one another make aristotle say that goats breathe at their ears whereas he asserts just the contrary    alcmaeon does not advance0 what is true when he avers that goats breathe through their ears  history of animals book i chap xi  letter xv to the same selborne march  0      dear sir some intelligent country people have a notion that we have in these parts a species of the genus mustelinum besides the weasel stoat ferret and polecat a little reddish beast not much bigger than a field mouse but much longer which they call a cane this piece of intelligence can be little depended on but farther inquiry may be made  a gentleman in this neighborhood had two milkwhite rooks in one nest a booby of a carter finding them before they were able to fly threw them down and destroyed them to the regret of the owner who would have been glad to have preserved such a curiofity in his rookery i saw the birds myself nailed against the end of a barn and was surprised to find that their bills legs feet and claws were milkwhite  a shepherd saw as he thought some white larks on a down above my house this winter were not these the emberiza nivalis the snowflake of the brit zool no doubt they were  a few years ago i saw a cock bullfinch in a cage which had been caught in the fields after it was come to it is full colors in about a year it began to look dingy and blackening every succeeding year it became coalblack at the end of four it is chief food was hempseed such influence has food on the color of animals the pied and mottled colors of domesticated animals are supposed to be owing to high various and unusual food  i had remarked for years that the root of the cuckoopint arum was frequently scratched out of the dry banks of hedges and eaten in severe snowy weather after observing with some exactness myself and getting others to do the same we found it was the thrush kind that searched it out the root of the arum is remarkably warm and pungent  our flocks of female chaffinches have not yet forsaken us the blackbirds and thrushes are very much thinned down by that fierce weather in january  in the middle of february i discovered in my tall hedges a little bird that raised my curiosity it was of that yellowgreen color that belongs to the salicaria kind and i think was softbilled it was no parus and was too long and too big for the goldencrowned wren appearing most like the largest willowwren it hung sometimes with it is back downwards but never continuing one moment in the same place i shot at it but it was so desultory that i missed my aim  i wonder that the stone curlew charadrius oedicnemus should be mentioned by the writers as a rare bird it abounds in all the campaign parts of hampshire and sussex and breeds i think all the summer having young ones i know very late in the autumn already they begin clamouring in the evening they cannot i think with any propriety be called as they are by mr ray  circa aquas versantes for with us by day at least they haunt only the most dry open upland fields and sheep walks far removed from water what they may do in the night i cannot say worms are their usual food but they also eat toads and frogs  i can show you some good specimens of my new mice linnaeus perhaps would call the species mus minimus  letter xvi to the same selborne april         dear sir the history of the stone curlew charadrius oedicnemus is as follows it lays it is eggs usually two never more than three on the bare ground without any nest in the field so that the countryman in stirring his fallows often destroys them the young run immediately from the egg like partridges etc and are withdrawn to some flinty field by the dam where they sculk among the stones which are their best security for their feathers are so exactly of the color of our gray spotted flints that the most exact observer unless he catches the eye of the young bird may be eluded the eggs are short and round of a dirty white spotted with dark bloody blotches though i might not be able just when i pleased to procure you a bird yet i could show you them almost any day and any evening you may hear them round the village for they make a clamor which may be heard a mile oedicnemus is a most apt and expressive name for them since their legs seem swollen like those of a gouty man after harvest i have shot them before the pointers in turnipfields  i make no doubt but there are three species of the willowwrens two i know perfectly but have not been able yet to procure the third no two birds can differ more in their notes and that constantly than those two that i am acquainted with for the one has a joyous easy laughing note the other a harsh loud chirp the former is every way larger and three quarters of an inch longer and weighs two drams and an half while the latter weighs but two so the songster is one fifth heavier than the chirper the chirper being the first summerbird of passage that is heard the wryneck sometimes excepted begins his two notes in the middle of march and continues them through the spring and summer till the end of august as appears by my journals the legs of the larger of these two are fleshcoloured of the less black  the grasshopperlark began his sibilous note in my fields last saturday nothing can be more amusing than the whisper of this little bird which seems to be close by though at an hundred yards distance and when close at your ear is scarce any louder than when a great way off had i not been a little acquainted with insects and known that the grasshopper kind is not yet hatched i should have hardly believed but that it had been a locusta whispering in the bushes the country people laugh when you tell them that it is the note of a bird it is a most artful creature sculking in the thickest part of a bush and will sing at a yard distance provided it be concealed i was obliged to get a person to go on the other side of the hedge where it haunted and then it would run creeping like a mouse before us for an hundred yards together through the bottom of the thorns yet it would not come into fair sight but in a morning early and when undisturbed it sings on the top of a twig gaping and shivering with it is wings mr ray himself had no knowledge of this bird but received his account from mr johnson who apparently confounds it with the reguli non cristati from which it is very distinct see rays philos letters p  0   the flycatcher  stoparola has not yet appeared it usually breeds in my vine the redstart begins to sing it is note is short and imperfect but is continued till about the middle of june the willowwrens

etc  letter xvii to the same selborne june         dear sir on wednesday last arrived your agreeable letter of june the  0th it gives me great satisfaction to find that you pursue these studies still with such vigor and are in such forwardness with regard to reptiles and fishes  the reptiles few as they are i am not acquainted with so well as i could wish with regard to their natural history there is a degree of dubiousness and obscurity attending the propagation of this class of animals something analagous to that of the cryptogamia in the sexual system of plants and the case is the same with regard to some of the fishes as the eel etc  the method in which toads procreate and bring forth seems to be very much in the dark some authors say that they are viviparous and yet ray classes them among his oviparous animals and is silent with regard to the manner of their bringing forth perhaps they may be  as is known to be the case with the viper  the copulation of frogs or at least the appearance of it for swammerdam proves that the male has no penis intrans is notorious to every body because we see them sticking upon each others backs for a month together in the spring and yet i never saw or read of toads being observed in the same situation it is strange that the matter with regard to the venom of toads has not been yet settled that they are not noxious to some animals is plain for ducks buzzards owls stone curlews and snakes eat them to my knowledge with impunity and i well remember the time but was not eyewitness to the fact though numbers of persons were when a quack at this village ate a toad to make the country people stare afterward he drank oil  i have been informed also from undoubted authority that some ladies ladies you will say of peculiar taste took a fancy to a toad which they nourished summer after summer for many years till he grew to a monstrous size with the maggots which turn to flesh flies the reptile used to come forth every evening from an hole under the gardensteps and was taken up after supper on the table to be fed but at last a tame raven kenning him as he put forth his head gave him such a severe stroke with his horny beak as put out one eye after this accident the creature languished for some time and died  i need not remind a gentleman of your extensive reading of the excellent account there is from mr derham in rays wisdom of god in the creation p     concerning the migration of frogs from their breeding ponds in this account he at once subverts that foolish opinion of their dropping from the clouds in rain showing that it is from the grateful coolness and moisture of those showers that they are tempted to set out on their travels which they defer till those fall frogs are as yet in their tadpole state but in a few weeks our lanes paths fields will swarm for a few days with myriads of those emigrants no larger than my little finger nail swammerdam gives a most accurate account of the method and situation in which the male impregnates the spawn of the female how wonderful is the economy of providence with regard to the limbs of so vile a reptile while it is an aquatic it has a fishlike tail and no legs as soon as the legs sprout the tail drops off as useless and the animal betakes itself to the land  merret i trust is widely mistaken when he advances that the rana arborea is an english reptile it abounds in germany and switzerland  it is to be remembered that the salamandra aquatica of ray the waternewt or eft will frequently bite at the anglers bait and is often caught on his hook i used to take it for granted that the salamandra aquatica was hatched lived and died in the water but john ellis esquire frs the coralline ellis asserts in a letter to the royal society dated june the  th      in his account of the mud inguana an amphibious bipes from south carolina that the watereft or newt is only the larva of the landeft as tadpoles are of frogs lest i should be suspected to misunderstand his meaning i shall give it in his own words speaking of the opercula or coverings to the gills of the mud inguana he proceeds to say that the form of these pennated coverings approach very near to what i have some time ago observed in the larva or aquatic state of our english lacerta known by the name of eft or newt which serve them for coverings to their gills and for fins to swim with while in this state and which they lose as well as the fins of their tails when they change their state and become land animals as i have observed by keeping them alive for some time myself  linnaeus in his systema naturae hints at what mr ellis advances more than once  providence has been so indulgent to us as to allow of but one venomous reptile of the serpent kind in these kingdoms and that is the viper as you propose the good of mankind to be an object of your publications you will not omit to mention common salladoil as a sovereign remedy against the bite of the viper as to the blind worm  anguis fragilis so called because it snaps in sunder with a small blow i have found on examination that it is perfectly innocuous a neighboring yeoman to whom i am indebted for some good hints killed and opened a female viper about the twentyseventh of may he found her filled with a chain of eleven eggs about the size of those of a blackbird but none of them were advanced so far toward a state of maturity as to contain any rudiments of young though they are oviparous yet they are viviparous also hatching their young within their bellies and then bringing them forth whereas snakes lay chains of eggs every summer in my melon beds in spite of all that my people can do to prevent them which eggs do not hatch till the spring following as i have often experienced several intelligent folks assure me that they have seen the viper open her mouth and admit her helpless young down her throat on sudden surprises just as the female opossum does her brood into the pouch under her belly upon the like emergencies and yet the london vipercatchers insist on it to mr barrington that no such thing ever happens the serpent kind eat i believe but once in a year or rather but only just at one season of the year country people talk much of a watersnake but i am pretty sure without any reason for the common snake  coluber natrix delights much to sport in the water perhaps with a view to procure frogs and other food  i cannot well guess how you are to make out your twelve species of reptiles unless it be by the various species or rather varieties of our lacerti of which ray enumerates five i have not had opportunity of ascertaining these but remember well to have seen formerly several beautiful green lacerti on the sunny sandbanks near farnham in surrey and ray admits there are such in ireland  letter xviii to the same selborne july         dear sir i received your obliging and communicative letter of june the   th while i was on a visit at a gentlemans house where i had neither books to turn to nor leisure to sit down to return you an answer to many queries which i wanted to resolve in the best manner that i am able  a person by my order has searched our brooks but could find no such fish as the gasterosteus pungitius he found the gasterosteus aculeatus in plenty this morning in a basket i packed a little earthen pot full of wet moss and in it some sticklebacks male and female the females big with spawn some lamperns some bulls heads but i could procure no minnows this basket will be in fleet street by eight this evening so i hope mazel will have them fresh and fair tomorrow morning i gave some directions in a letter to what particulars the engraver should be attentive  finding while i was on a visit that i was within a reasonable distance of ambresbury i sent a servant over to that town and procured several living specimens of loaches which he brought safe and brisk in a glass decanter they were taken in the gullies that were cut for watering the meadows from these fishes which measured from two to four inches in length i took the following description the loach in it is general aspect has a pellucid appearance it is back is mottled with irregular collections of small black dots not reaching much below the linea lateralis as are the back and tail fins a black line runs from each eye down to the nose it is belly is of a silvery white the upper jaw projects beyond the lower and is surrounded with six feelers three on each side it is pectoral fins are large it is ventral much smaller the fin behind it is anus small it is dorsalfin large containing eight spines it is tail where it joins to the tailfin remarkably broad without any taperness so as to be characteristic of this genus the tailfin is broad and square at the end from the breadth and muscular strength of the tail it appears to be an active nimble fish  in my visit i was not very far from hungerford and did not forget to make some inquiries concerning the wonderful method of curing cancers by means of toads several intelligent persons both gentry and clergy do i find give a great deal of credit to what was asserted in the papers and i myself dined with a clergyman who seemed to be persuaded that what is related is matter of fact but when i came to attend to his account i thought i discerned circumstances which did not a little invalidate the womans story of the manner in which she came by her skill she says of herself that laboring under a virulent cancer she went to some church where there was a vast crowd on going into a pew show was accosted by a strange clergyman who after expressing compassion for her situation told her that if she would make such an application of living toads as is mentioned she would be well now is it likely that this unknown gentleman should express so much tenderness for this single sufferer and not feel any for the many thousands that daily languish under this terrible disorder would he not have made use of this invaluable nostrum for his own emolument or at least by some means of publication or other have found a method of making it public for the good of mankind in short this woman as it appears to me having set up for a cancerdoctress finds it expedient to amuse the country with this dark and mysterious relation  the watereft has not that i can discern the least appearance of any gills for want of which it is continually rising to the surface of the water to take in fresh air i opened a bigbellied one indeed and found it full of spawn not that this circumstance at all invalidates the assertion that they are larvae for the larvae of insects are full of eggs which they exclude the instant they enter their last state the watereft is continually climbing over the brims of the vessel within which we keep it in water and wandering away and people every summer see numbers crawling out of the pools where they are hatched up the dry banks there are varieties of them differing in color and some have fins up their tail and back and some have not  letter xix to the same selborne aug         dear sir i have now past dispute made out three distinct species of the willowwrens motacillae trochili which constantly and invariably use distinct notes but at the same time i am obliged to confess that i know nothing of your willowlark brit zool edit      octavo p      in my letter of april the   th i had told you peremptorily that i knew your willowlark but had not seen it then but when i came to procure it it proved in all respects a very motacilla trochilus only that it is a size larger than the two other and the yellowgreen of the whole upper part of the body is more vivid and the belly of a clearer white i have specimens of the three sorts now lying before me and can discern that there are three gradations of sizes and that the least has black legs and the other two fleshcoloured ones the yellowest bird is considerably the largest and has it is quillfeathers and secondary feathers tipped with white which the others have not this last haunts only the tops of trees in high beechen woods and makes a sibilous grasshopperlike noise now and then at short intervals shivering a little with it is wings when it sings and is i make no doubt now the regulus non cristatus of ray which he says  cantat voce stridula locustae yet this great ornithologist never suspected that there were three species  letter xx to the same selborne october        it is i find in zoology as it is in botany all nature is so full that that district produces the greatest variety which is the most examined several birds which are said to belong to the north only are it seems often in the south i have discovered this summer three species of birds with us which writers mention as only to be seen in the northern counties the first that was brought me on the   th of may was the sandpiper tringa hypoleucus it was a cock bird and haunted the banks of some ponds near the village and as it had a companion doubtless intended to have bred near that water besides the owner has told me since that on recollection he has seen some of the same birds round his ponds in former summers  the next bird that i procured on the   st of may was a male redbacked butcher bird lanius collurio my neighbor who shot it says that it might easily have escaped his notice had not the outcries and chattering of the whitethroats and other small birds drawn his attention to the bush where it was it is craw was filled with the legs and wings of beetles  the next rare birds which were procured for me last week were some ringousels turdi torquati  this week twelve months a gentleman from london being with us was amusing himself with a gun and found he told us on an old yew hedge where there were berries some birds like blackbirds with rings of white round their necks a neighboring farmer also at the same time observed the same but as no specimens were procured little notice was taken i mentioned this circumstance to you in my letter of november the  th      you however paid but small regard to what i said as i had not seen these birds myself but last week the aforesaid farmer seeing a large flock twenty or thirty of these birds shot two cocks and two hens and says on recollection that he remembers to have observed these birds again last spring about lady day as it were on their return to the north now perhaps these ousels are not the ousels of the north of england but belong to the more northern parts of europe and may retire before the excessive rigor of the frosts in those parts and return to breed in the spring when the cold abates if this be the case here is discovered a new bird of winter passage concerning whose migrations the writers are silent but if these birds should prove the ousels of the north of england then here is a migration disclosed within our own kingdom never before remarked it does not yet appear whether they retire beyond the bounds of our island to the south but it is most probable that they usually do or else one cannot suppose that they would have continued so long unnoticed in the southern counties the ousel is larger than a blackbird and feeds on haws but last autumn when there were no haws it fed on yewberries in the spring it feeds on ivyberries which ripen only at that season in march and april  i must not omit to tell you as you have been so lately on the study of reptiles that my people every now and then of late draw up with a bucket of water from my well which is    feet deep a large black warty lizard with a fintail and yellow belly how they first came down at that depth and how they were ever to have got out thence without help is more than i am able to say  my thanks are due to you for your trouble and care in the examination of a bucks head as far as your discoveries reach at present they seem much to corroborate my suspicions and i hope mr  may find reason to give his decision in my favor and then i think we may advance this extraordinary provision of nature as a new instance of the wisdom of god in the creation  as yet i have not quite done with my history of the oedicnemus or stonecurlew for i shall desire a gentleman in sussex near whose house these birds congregate in vast flocks in the autumn to observe nicely when they leave him if they do leave him and when they return again in the spring i was with this gentleman lately and saw several single birds  letter xxi to the same selborne nov         dear sir with regard to the oedicnemus or stonecurlew i intend to write very soon to my friend near chichester in whose neighborhood these birds seem most to abound and shall urge him to take particular notice when they begin to congregate and afterward to watch them most narrowly whether they do not withdraw themselves during the dead of the winter when i have obtained information with respect to this circumstance i shall have finished my history of the stonecurlew which i hope will prove to your satisfaction as it will be i trust very near the truth this gentleman as he occupies a large farm of his own and is abroad early and late will be a very proper spy upon the motions of these birds and besides as i have prevailed on him to buy the naturalists journal with which he is much delighted i shall expect that he will be very exact in his dates it is very extraordinary as you observe that a bird so common with us should never straggle to you  and here will be the properest place to mention while i think of it an anecdote which the abovementioned gentleman told me when i was last at his house which was that in a warren joining to his outlet many daws corvi monedulae build every year in the rabbitburrows under ground the way he and his brothers used to take their nests while they were boys was by listening at the mouths of the holes and if they heard the young ones cry they twisted the nest out with a forked stick some waterfowls  viz the puffins breed i know in that manner but i should never have suspected the daws of building in holes on the flat ground  another very unlikely spot is made use of by daws as a place to breed in and that is stonehenge these birds deposit their nests in the interstices between the upright and the impost stones of that amazing work of antiquity which circumstance alone speaks the prodigious height of the upright stones that they should be tall enough to secure those nests from the annoyance of shepherdboys who are always idling round that place  one of my neighbors last saturday november the   th saw a martin in a sheltered bottom the sun shone warm and the bird was hawking briskly after flies i am now perfectly satisfied that they do not all leave this island in the winter  you judge very right i think in speaking with reserve and caution concerning the cures done by toads for let people advance what they will on such subjects yet there is such a propensity in mankind toward deceiving and being deceived that one cannot safely relate any thing from common report especially in print without expressing some degree of doubt and suspicion  your approbation with regard to my new discovery of the migration of the ringousel gives me satisfaction and i find you concur with me in suspecting that they are foreign birds which visit us you will be sure i hope not to omit to make inquiry whether your ringousels leave your rocks in the autumn what puzzles me most is the very short stay they make with us for in about three weeks they are all gone i shall be very curious to remark whether they will call on us at their return in the spring as they did last year  i want to be better informed with regard to icthyology if fortune had settled me near the seaside or near some great river my natural propensity would soon have urged me to have made myself acquainted with their productions but as i have lived mostly in inland parts and in an upland district my knowledge of fishes extends little farther than to those common sorts which our brooks and lakes produce  i am etc  letter xxii to the same selborne jan        dear sir as to the peculiarity of jackdaws building with us under the ground in rabbitburrows you have in part hit upon the reason for in reality there are hardly any towers or steeples in all this country and perhaps norfolk excepted hampshire and sussex are as meanly furnished with churches as almost any counties in the kingdom we have many livings of two or three hundred pounds a year whose houses of worship make little better appearance than dovecots when i first saw northamptonshire cambridgeshire and huntingdonshire and the fens of lincolnshire i was amazed at the number of spires which presented themselves in every point of view as an admirer of prospects i have reason to lament this want in my own country for such objects are very necessary ingredients in an elegant landscape  what you mention with respect to reclaimed toads raises my curiosity an ancient author though no naturalist has well remarked that  every kind of beasts and of birds and of serpents and things in the sea is tamed and has been tamed of mankind james chap iii     it is a satisfaction to me to find that a green lizard has actually been procured for you in devonshire because it corroborates my discovery which i made many years ago of the same sort on a sunny sandbank near farnham in surrey i am well acquainted with the south hams of devonshire and can suppose that district from it is southerly situation to be a proper habitation for such animals in their best colors  since the ringousels of your vast mountains do certainly not forsake them against winter our suspicions that those which visit this neighborhood about michaelmas are not english birds but driven from the more northern parts of europe by the frosts are still more reasonable and it will be worth your pains to endeavor to trace from whence they come and to inquire why they make so very short a stay  in your account of your error with regard to the two species of herons you incidentally gave me great entertainment in your description of the heronry at cressihall which is a curiosity i never could manage to see fourscore nests of such a bird on one tree is a rarity which i would ride half as many miles to have a sight of pray be sure to tell me in your next whose seat cressihall is and near what town it lies cressihall is near spalding in lincolnshire  i have often thought that those vast extents of fens have never been sufficiently explored if half a dozen gentlemen furnished with a good strength of waterspaniels were to beat them over for a week they would certainly find more species  there is no bird i believe whose manners i have studied more than that of the caprimulgus the goatsucker as it is a wonderful and curious creature but i have always found that though sometimes it may chatter as it flies as i know it does yet in general it utters it is jarring note sitting on a bough and i have for many an half hour watched it as it sat with it is under mandible quivering and particularly this summer it perches usually on a bare twig with it is head lower than it is tail in an attitude well expressed by your draughtsman in the folio british zoology this bird is most punctual in beginning it is song exactly at the close of day so exactly that i have known it strike up more than once or twice just at the report of the portsmouth evening gun which we can hear when the weather is still it appears to me past all doubt that it is notes are formed by organic impulse by the powers of the parts of it is windpipe formed for sound just as cats put you will credit me i hope when i assure you that as my neighbors were assembled in an see the vignette in this book hermitage on the side of a steep hill where we drink tea one of these churnowls came and settled on the cross of that little straw edifice and began to chatter and continued his note for many minutes and we were all struck with wonder to find that the organs of that little animal when put in motion gave a sensible vibration to the whole building this bird also sometimes makes a small squeak repeated four or five times and i have observed that to happen when the cock has been pursuing the hen in a toying way through the boughs of a tree  it would not be at all strange if your bat which you have procured should prove a new one since five species have been found in a neighboring kingdom the great sort that i mentioned is certainly a nondescript i saw but one this summer and that i had no opportunity of taking  your account of the indiangrass was entertaining i am no angler myself but inquiring of those that are what they supposed that part of their tackle to be made of they replied of the intestines of a silkworm  though i must not pretend to great skill in entomology yet i cannot say that i am ignorant of that kind of knowledge i may now and then perhaps be able to furnish you with a little information  the vast rains ceased with us much about the same time as with you and since we have had delicate weather mr barker who has measured the rain for more than thirty years says in a late letter that more has fallen this year than in any he ever attended to though from july      to january      more fell than in any seven months of this year  letter xxiii to the same selborne february         dear sir it is not improbable that the guernsey lizard and our green lizards may be specifically the same all that i know is that when some years ago many guernsey lizards were turned loose in pembroke college garden in the university of oxford they lived a great while and seemed to enjoy themselves very well but never bred whether this circumstance will prove any thing either way i shall not pretend to say  i return you thanks for your account of cressihall but recollect not without regret that in june      i was visiting for a week together at spalding without ever being told that such a curiosity was just at hand pray send me word in your next what sort of tree it is that contains such a quantity of herons nests and whether the heronry consists of a whole grove or wood or only of a few trees  it gave me satisfaction to find we accorded so well about the caprimulgus all i contended for was to prove that it often chatters sitting as well as flying and therefore the noise was voluntary and from organic impulse and not from the resistance of the air against the hollow of it is mouth and throat  if ever i saw any thing like actual migration it was last michaelmasday i was traveling and out early in the morning at first there was a vast fog but by the time that i was got seven or eight miles from home toward the coast the sun broke out into a delicate warm day we were then on a large heath or common and i could discern as the mist began to break away great numbers of swallows  hirundines rusticae clustering on the stunted shrubs and bushes as if they had roosted there all night as soon as the air became clear and pleasant they all were on the wing at once and by a placid and easy flight proceeded on southward toward the sea after this i did not see any more flocks only now and then a straggler  i cannot agree with those persons that assert that the swallow kind disappear some and some gradually as they come for the bulk of them seem to withdraw at once only some stragglers stay behind a long while and do never there is the greatest reason to believe leave this island swallows seem to lay themselves up and to come forth in a warm day as bats do continually of a warm evening after they have disappeared for weeks for a very respectable gentleman assured me that as he was walking with some friends under mertonwall on a remarkably hot noon either in the last week in december or the first week in january he espied three or four swallows huddled together on the moulding of one of the windows of that college i have frequently remarked that swallows are seen later at oxford than elsewhere is it owing to the vast massy buildings of that place to the many waters round it or to what else  when i used to rise in a morning last autumn and see the swallows and martins clustering on the chimnies and thatch of the neighboring cottages i could not help being touched with a secret delight mixed with some degree of mortification with delight to observe with how much ardour and punctuality those poor little birds obeyed the strong impulse toward migration or hiding imprinted on their minds by their great creator and with some degree of mortification when i reflected that after all our pains and inquiries we are yet not quite certain to what regions they do migrate and are still farther embarassed to find that some do not actually migrate at all  these reflections made so strong an impression on my imagination that they became productive of a composition that may perhaps amuse you for a quarter of an hour when next i have the honor of writing to you  letter xxiv to the same selborne may         dear sir the scarabaeus fullo i know very well having seen it in collections but have never been able to discover one wild in it is natural state mr banks told me he thought it might be found on the seacoast  on the thirteenth of april i went to the sheepdown where the ringousels have been observed to make their appearance at spring and fall in their way perhaps to the north or south and was much pleased to see three birds about the usual spot we shot a cock and a hen they were plump and in high condition the hen had but very small rudiments of eggs within her which proves they are late breeders whereas those species of the thrush kind that remain with us the whole year have fledged young before that time in their crops was nothing very distinguishable but somewhat that seemed like blades of vegetables nearly digested in autumn they feed on haws and yewberries and in the spring on ivyberries i dressed one of these birds and found it juicy and well flavoured it is remarkable that they make but a few days stay in their spring visit but rest near a fortnight at michaelmas these birds from the observations of three springs and two autumns are most punctual in their return and exhibit a new migration unnoticed by the writers who supposed they never were to be seen in any of the southern counties  one of my neighbors lately brought me a new salicaria which at first i suspected might have proved your willowlark for this salicaria see letter august  0       but on a nicer examination it answered much better to the description of that species which you shot at revesby in lincolnshire my bird i describe thus it is a size less than the grasshopperlark the head back and coverts of the wings of a dusky brown without those dark spots of the grasshopperlark over each eye is a milkwhite stroke the chin and throat are white and the under parts of a yellowish white the rump is tawny and the feathers of the tail sharppointed the bill is dusky and sharp and the legs are dusky the hinder claw long and crooked the person that shot it says that it sung so like a reedsparrow that he took it for one and that it sings all night but this account merits farther inquiry for my part i suspect it is a second sort of locustella hinted at by dr derham in rays letters see p  0  he also procured me a grasshopperlark  the question that you put with regard to those genera of animals that are peculiar to america viz how they came there and whence is too puzzling for me to answer and yet so obvious as often to have struck me with wonder if one looks into the writers on that subject little satisfaction is to be found ingenious men will readily advance plausible

pleases you you put a very shrewd question when you ask me how i know that their autumnal migration is southward was not candor and openness the very life of natural history i should pass over this query just as a sly commentator does over a crabbed passage in a classic but common ingenuousness obliges me to confess not without some degree of shame that i only reasoned in that case from analogy for as all other autumnal birds migrate from the northward to us to partake of our milder winters and return to the northward again when the rigorous cold abates so i concluded that the ringousels did the same as well as their congeners the fieldfares and especially as ringousels are known to haunt cold mountainous countries but i have good reason to suspect since that they may come to us from the westward because i hear from very good authority that they breed on dartmore and that they forsake that wild district about the time that our visitors appear and do not return till late in the spring  i have taken a great deal of pains about your salicaria and mine with a white stroke over it is eye and a tawny rump i have surveyed it alive and dead and have procured several specimens and am perfectly persuaded myself and trust you will soon be convinced of the same that it is no more nor less than the passer arundinaceus minor of ray this bird by some means or other seems to be entirely omitted in the british zoology and one reason probably was because it is so strangely classed in ray who ranges it among his picis affines it ought no doubt to have gone among his aviculae cauda unicolore and among your slenderbilled small birds of the same division linnaeus might with great propriety have put it into his genus of motacilla and the motacilla salicaria of his fauna suecica seems to come the nearest to it it is no uncommon bird haunting the sides of ponds and rivers where there is covert and the reeds and sedges of moors the country people in some places call it the sedgebird it sings incessantly night and day during the breedingtime imitating the note of a sparrow a swallow a skylark and has a strange hurrying manner in it is song my specimens correspond most minutely to the description of your fen salicaria shot near revesby mr ray has given an excellent characteristic of it when he says  rostrum and pedes in hac avicula multo majores sunt quam pro corporis ratione see letter may          i have got you the egg of an oedicnemus or stonecurlew which was picked up in a fallow on the naked ground there were two but the finder inadvertently crushed one with his foot before he saw them  when i wrote to you last year on reptiles i wish i had not forgot to mention the faculty that snakes have of stinking se defendendo i knew a gentleman who kept a tame snake which was in it is person as sweet as any animal while in good humor and unalarmed but as soon as a stranger or a dog or cat came in it fell to hissing and filled the room with such nauseous effluvia as rendered it hardly supportable thus the squnck or stonck of rays synop quadr is an innocuous and sweet animal but when pressed hard by dogs and men it can eject such a most pestilent and fetid smell and excrement that nothing can be more horrible  a gentleman sent me lately a fine specimen of the lanius minor cinerascens cum macula in scapulis alba raii which is a bird that at the time of your publishing your two first volumes of british zoology i find you had not seen you have described it well from edwardss drawing  letter xxvi to the same selborne december        dear sir i was much gratified by your communicative letter on your return from scotland where you spent i find some considerable time and gave yourself good room to examine the natural curiosities of that extensive kingdom both those of the islands as well as those of the highlands the usual bane of such expeditions is hurry because men seldom allot themselves half the time they should do but fixing on a day for their return post from place to place rather as if they were on a journey that required dispatch than as philosophers investigating the works of nature you must have made no doubt many discoveries and laid up a good fund of materials for a future edition of the british zoology and will have no reason to repent that you have bestowed so much pains on a part of greatbritian that perhaps was never so well examined before  it has always been matter of wonder to me that fieldfares which are so congenerous to thrushes and blackbirds should never choose to breed in england but that they should not think even the highlands cold and northerly and sequestered enough is a circumstance still more strange and wonderful the ringousel you find stays in scotland the whole year round so that we have reason to conclude that those migrators that visit us for a short space every autumn do not come from thence  and here i think will be the proper place to mention that those birds were most punctual again in their migration this autumn appearing as before about the  0th of september but their flocks were larger than common and their stay protracted somewhat beyond the usual time if they came to spend the whole winter with us as some of their congeners do and then left us as they do in spring i should not be so much struck with the occurrence since it would be similar to that of the other winter birds of passage but when i see them for a fortnight at michaelmas and again for about a week in the middle of april i am seized with wonder and long to be informed whence these travelers come and whither they go since they seem to use our hills merely as an inn or baiting place  your account of the greater brambling or snowfleck is very amusing and strange it is that such a shortwinged bird should delight in such perilous voyages over the northern ocean some country people in the winter time have every now and then told me that they have seen two or three white larks on our downs but on considering the matter i begin to suspect that these are some stragglers of the birds we are talking of which sometimes perhaps may rove so far to the southward  it pleases me to find that white hares are so frequent on the scottish mountains and especially as you inform me that it is a distinct species for the quadrupeds of britain are so few that every new species is a great acquisition  the eagleowl could it be proved to belong to us is so majestic a bird that it would grace our fauna much i never was informed before where wildgeese are known to breed  you admit i find that i have proved your fensalicaria to be the lesser reedsparrow of ray and i think you may be secure that i am right for i took very particular pains to clear up that matter and had some fair specimens but as they were not well preserved they are decayed already you will no doubt insert it in it is proper place in your next edition your additional plates will much improve your work  de buffon i know has described the water shrewmouse but still i am pleased to find you have discovered it in lincolnshire for the reason i have given in the article of the white hare  as a neighbor was lately plowing in a dry chalky field far removed from any water he turned out a waterrat that was curiously laid up in an hybernaculum artificially formed of grass and leaves at one end of the burrow lay above a gallon of potatoes regularly stowed on which it was to have supported itself for the winter but the difficulty with me is how this amphibius mus came to fix it is winter station at such a distance from the water was it determined in it is choice of that place by the mere accident of finding the potatoes which were planted there or is it the constant practice of the aquaticrat to forsake the neighborhood of the water in the colder months  though i delight very little in analogous reasoning knowing how fallacious it is with respect to natural history yet in the following instance i cannot help being inclined to think it may conduce toward the explanation of a difficulty that i have mentioned before with respect to the invariable early retreat of the hirundo apus or swift so many weeks before it is congeners and that not only with us but also in andalusia where they also begin to retire about the beginning of august  the great large bat the little bat appears almost every month in the year but i have never seen the large ones till the end of april nor after july they are most common in june but never in any plenty are a rare species with us which by the by is at present a nondescript in england and what i have never been able yet to procure retires or migrates very early in the summer it also ranges very high for it is food feeding in a different region of the air and that is the reason i never could procure one now this is exactly the case with the swifts for they take their food in a more exalted region than the other species and are very seldom seen hawking for flies near the ground or over the surface of the water from hence i would conclude that these hirundines and the larger bats are supported by some sorts of highflying gnats scarabs or phalaenae that are of short continuance and that the short stay of these strangers is regulated by the defect of their food  by my journal it appears that curlews clamoured on to october the thirtyfirst since which i have not seen or heard any swallows were observed on to november the third  letter xxvii to the same selborne feb       0 dear sir hedgehogs abound in my gardens and fields the manner in which they eat their roots of the plantain in my grasswalks is very curious with their upper mandible which is much longer than their lower they bore under the plant and so eat the root off upwards leaving the tuft of leaves untouched in this respect they are serviceable as they destroy a very troublesome weed but they deface the walks in some measure by digging little round holes it appears by the dung that they drop upon the turf that beetles are no inconsiderable part of their food in june last i procured a litter of four or five young hedgehogs which appeared to be about five or six days old they i find like puppies are born blind and could not see when they came to my hands no doubt their spines are soft and flexible at the time of their birth or else the poor dam would have but a bad time of it in the critical moment of parturition but it is plain that they soon harden for these little pigs had such stiff prickles on their backs and sides as would easily have fetched blood had they not been handled with caution their spines are quite white at this age and they have little hanging ears which i do not remember to be discernible in the old ones they can in part at this age draw their skin down over their faces but are not able to contract themselves into a ball as they do for the sake of defense when full grown the reason i suppose is because the curious muscle that enables the creature to roll itself up in a ball was not then arrived at it is full tone and firmness hedgehogs make a deep and warm hybernaculum with leaves and moss in which they conceal themselves for the winter but i never could find that they stored in any winter provision as some quadrupeds certainly do  i have discovered an anecdote with respect to the fieldfare turdus pilaris which i think is particular enough this bird though it sits on trees in the daytime and procures the greatest part of it is food from whitethorn hedges yea moreover builds on very high trees as may be seen by the fauna suecica yet always appears with us to roost on the ground they are seen to come in flocks just before it is dark and to settle and nestle among the heath on our forest and besides the larkers in dragging their nets by night frequently catch them in the wheatstubbles while the batfowlers who take many redwings in the hedges never entangle any of this species why these birds in the matter of roosting should differ from all their congeners and from themselves also with respect to their proceedings by day is a fact for which i am by no means able to account  i have somewhat to inform you of concerning the moosedeer but in general foreign animals fall seldom in my way my little intelligence is confined to the narrow sphere of my own observations at home  letter xxviii to the same selborne march    0 on michaelmasday      i managed to get a sight of the female moose belonging to the duke of richmond at goodwood but was greatly disappointed when i arrived at the spot to find that it died after having appeared in a languishing way for some time on the morning before however understanding that it was not stripped i proceeded to examine this rare quadruped i found it in an old greenhouse slung under the belly and chin by ropes and in a standing posture but though it had been dead for so short a time it was in so putrid a state that the stench was hardly supportable the grand distinction between this deer and any other species that i have ever met with consisted in the strange length of it is legs on which it was tilted up much in the manner of the birds of the grallae order i measured it as they do an horse and found that from the ground to the wither it was just five feet four inches which height answers exactly to sixteen hands a growth that few horses arrive at but then with this length of legs it is neck was remarkably short no more than twelve inches so that by straddling with one foot forward and the other backward it grazed on the plain ground with the greatest difficulty between it is legs the ears were vast and lopping and as long as the neck the head was about twenty inches long and asslike and had such a redundancy of upper lip as i never saw before with huge nostrils this lip travelers say is esteemed a dainty dish in north america it is very reasonable to suppose that this creature supports itself chiefly by browsing of trees and by wading after water plants toward which way of livelihood the length of legs and great lip must contribute much i have read somewhere that it delights in eating the nymphaea or waterlily from the forefeet to the belly behind the shoulder it measured three feet and eight inches the length of the legs before and behind consisted a great deal in the tibia which was strangely long but in my haste to get out of the stench i forgot to measure that joint exactly it is scut seemed to be about an inch long the color was a grizzly black the mane about four inches long the forehoofs were upright and shapely the hind flat and splayed the spring before it was only two years old so that most probably it was not then come to it is growth what a vast tall beast must a full grown stag be i have been told some arrive at ten feet and an half this poor creature had at first a female companion of the same species which died the spring before in the same garden was a young stag or red deer between whom and this moose it was hoped that there might have been a breed but their inequality of height must have always been a bar to any commerce of the amorous kind i should have been glad to have examined the teeth tongue lips hoofs etc minutely but the putrefaction precluded all farther curiosity this animal the keeper told me seemed to enjoy itself best in the extreme frost of the former winter in the house they showed me the horn of a male moose which had no frontantlers but only a broad palm with some snags on the edge the noble owner of the dead moose proposed to make a skeleton of her bones  please to let me hear if my female moose corresponds with that you saw and whether you think still that the american moose and european elk are the same creature  i am with the greatest esteem etc  letter xxix to the same selborne may       0 dear sir last month we had such a series of cold turbulent weather such a constant succession of frost and snow and hail and tempest that the regular migration or appearance of the summer birds was much interrupted some did not show themselves at least were not heard till weeks after their usual time as the blackcap and whitethroat and some have not been heard yet as the grasshopperlark and largest willowwren as to the flycatcher i have not seen it it is indeed one of the latest but should appear about this time and yet amidst all this meteorous strife and war of the elements two swallows discovered themselves as long ago as the eleventh of april in frost and snow but they withdrew quickly and were not visible again for many days housemartins which are always more backward than swallows were not observed till may came in  among the monogamous birds several are to be found after pairingtime single and of each sex but whether this state of celibacy is matter of choice or necessity is not so easily discoverable when the housesparrows deprive my martins of their nests as soon as i cause one to be shot the other be it cock or hen presently procures a mate and so for several times following  i have known a dovehouse infested by a pair of white owls which made great havoc among the young pigeons one of the owls was shot as soon as possible but the survivor readily found a mate and the mischief went on after some time the new pair were both destroyed and the annoyance ceased  another instance i remember of a sportsman whose zeal for the increase of his game being greater than his humanity after pairingtime he always shot the cockbird of every couple of partridges upon his grounds supposing that the rivalry of many males interrupted the breed he used to say that though he had widowed the same hen several times yet he found she was still provided with a fresh paramour that did not take her away from her usual haunt  again i knew a lover of setting an old sportsman who has often told me that soon after harvest he has frequently taken small coveys of partridges consisting of cockbirds alone these he pleasantly used to call old bachelors  there is a propensity belonging to common housecats that is very remarkable i mean their violent fondness for fish which appears to be their most favorite food and yet nature in this instance seems to have planted in them an appetite that unassisted they know not how to gratify for of all quadrupeds cats are the least disposed toward water and will not when they can avoid it deign to wet a foot much less to plunge into that element  quadrupeds that prey on fish are amphibious such is the otter which by nature is so well formed for diving that it makes great havoc among the inhabitants of the waters not supposing that we had any of those beasts in our shallow brooks i was much pleased to see a male otter brought to me weighing twentyone pounds that had been shot on the bank of our stream below the priory where the rivulet divides the parish of selborne from harteleywood  letter xxx to the same selborne aug      0 dear sir the french i think in general are strangely prolix in their natural history what linnaeus says with respect to insects holds good in every other branch  verbositas praesentis saeculi calamitas artis  pray how do you approve of scopolis new work as i admire his entomologia i long to see it  i forgot to mention in my last letter and had not room to insert in the former that the male moose in rutting time swims from island to island in the lakes and rivers of north america in pursuit of the females my friend the chaplain saw one killed in the water as it was on that errand in the river st lawrence it was a monstrous beast he told me but he did not take the dimensions  when i was last in town our friend mr barrington most obligingly carried me to see many curious sights as you were then writing to him about horns he carried me to see many strange and wonderful specimens there is i remember at lord pembrokes at wilton an horn room furnished with more than thirty different pairs but i have not seen that house lately  mr barrington showed me many astonishing collections of stuffed and living birds from all quarters of the world after i had studied over the latter for a time i remarked that every species almost that came from distant regions such as south america the coast of guinea etc were thickbilled birds of the loxia and fringilla genera and no motacillae or muscicapae were to be met with when i came to consider the reason was obvious enough for the hardbilled birds subsist on seeds which are easily carried on board while the softbilled birds which are supported by worms and insects or what is a succedaneum for them fresh raw meat can meet with neither in long and tedious voyages it is from this defect of food that our collections curious as they are are defective and we are deprived of some of the most delicate and lively genera  i am etc  letter xxxi to the same selborne sept       0 dear sir you saw i find the ringousels again among their native crags and are farther assured that they continue resident in those cold regions the whole year from whence then do our ringousels migrate so regularly every september and make their appearance again as if in their return every april they are more early this year than common for some were seen at the usual hill on the fourth of this month  an observing devonshire gentleman tells me that they frequent some parts of dartmoor and breed there but leave those haunts about the end of september or beginning of october and return again about the end of march  another intelligent person assures me that they breed in great abundance all over the peak of derby and are called there torousels withdraw in october and november and return in spring this information seems to throw some light on my new migration  scopolis annus primus historiconaturalis new work which i have just procured has it is merit in ascertaining many of the birds of the tirol and carniola monographers come from whence they may have i think fair pretense to challenge some regard and approbation from the lovers of natural history for as no man can alone investigate all the works of nature these partial writers may each in their department be more accurate in their discoveries and freer from errors than more general writers and so by degrees may pave the way to an universal correct natural history not that scopoli is so circumstantial and attentive to the life and conversation of his birds as i could wish he advances some false facts as when he says of the hirundo urbica that  pullos extra nidum non nutrit this assertion i know to be wrong from repeated observation this summer for housemartins do feed their young flying though it must be acknowledged not so commonly as the houseswallow and the feat is done in so quick a manner as not to be perceptible to indifferent observers he also advances some i was going to say improbable facts as when he says of the woodcock that  pullos rostro portat fugiens ab host but candor forbids me to say absolutely that any fact is false because i have never been witness to such a fact i have only to remark that the long unweildy bill of the woodcock is perhaps the worst adapted of any among the winged creation for such a feat of natural affection  i am etc  letter xxxii to the same selborne october       0 dear sir after an ineffectual search in linnaeus brisson etc i begin to suspect that i discern my brothers hirundo hyberna in scopolis new discovered hirundo rupestris p     his description of  supra murina subtus albida rectrices macula ovali alba in latere interno pedes nudi nigri rostrum nigrum remiges obscuriores quam plumae dorsales rectrices remigibus concolores cauda emarginata nec forcipata agrees very well with the bird in question but when he comes to advance that it is  statura hirundinis urbicae and that  definitio hirundinis ripariae linnaei huic quoque convenit he in some measure invalidates all he has said at least he shows at once that he compares them to these species merely from memory for i have compared the birds themselves and find they differ widely in every circumstance of shape size and color however as you will have a specimen i shall be glad to hear what your judgment is in the matter  whether my brother is forestalled in his nondescript or not he will have the credit of first discovering that they spend their winters under the warm and sheltery shores of gibraltar and barbary  scopolis characters of his ordines and genera are clean just and expressive and much in the spirit of linnaeus these few remarks are the result of my first perusal of scopolis annus primus  the bane of our science is the comparing one animal to the other by memory for want of caution in this particular scopoli falls into errors he is not so full with regard to the manners of his indigenous birds as might be wished as you justly observe his latin is easy elegant and expressive and very superior to kramers see his elenchus vegetabilium et animalium per austriam inferiorem etc   i am pleased to see that my description of the moose corresponds so well with yours  i am etc  letter xxxiii to the same selborne nov       0 dear sir i was much pleased to see among the collection of birds from gibraltar some of those shortwinged english summerbirds of passage concerning whose departure we have made so much inquiry now if these birds are found in andalusia to migrate to and from barbary it may easily be supposed that those that come to us may migrate back to the continent and spend their winters in some of the warmer parts of europe this is certain that many softbilled birds that come to gibraltar appear there only in spring and autumn seeming to advance in pairs toward the northward for the sake of breeding during the summer months and retiring in parties and broods toward the south at the decline of the year so that the rock of gibraltar is the great rendezvous and place of observation from whence they take their departure each way toward europe or africa it is therefore no mean discovery i think to find that our small shortwinged summer birds of passage are to be seen spring and autumn on the very skirts of europe it is a presumptive proof of their emigrations  scopoli seems to me to have found the hirundo melba the great gibraltar swift in tirol without knowing it for what is his hirundo alpina but the aforementioned bird in other words says he  omnia prioris meaning the swift  sed pectus album paulo major priore i do not suppose this to be a new species it is true also of the melba that  nidificat in excelsis alpium rupibus vid annum primum  my sussex friend a man of observation and good sense but no naturalist to whom i applied on account of the stonecurlew oedicnemus sends me the following account in looking over my naturalists journal for the month of april i find the stonecurlews are first mentioned on the seventeenth and eighteenth which date seems to me rather late they live with us all the spring and summer and at the beginning of autumn prepare to take leave by getting together in flocks they seem to me a bird of passage that may travel into some dry hilly country south of us probably spain because of the abundance of sheepwalks in that country for they spend their summers with us in such districts this conjecture i hazard as i have never met with any one that has seen them in england in the winter i believe they are not fond of going near the water but feed on earthworms that are common on sheepwalks and downs they breed on fallows and layfields abounding with gray mossy flints which much resemble their young in color among which they skulk and conceal themselves they make no nest but lay their eggs on the bare ground producing in common but two at a time there is reason to think their young run soon after they are hatched and that the old ones do not feed them but only lead them about at the time of feeding which for the most part is in the night thus far my friend  in the manners of this bird you see there is something very analogous to the bustard whom it also somewhat resembles in aspect and make and in the structure of it is feet  for a long time i have desired my relation to look out for these birds in andalusia and now he writes me word that for the first time he saw one dead in the market on the third of september  when the oedicnemus flies it stretches out it is legs straight behind like an heron  i am etc  letter xxxiv to the same selborne march  0      dear sir there is an insect with us especially on chalky districts which is very troublesome and teasing all the latter end of the summer getting into peoples skins especially those of women and children and raising tumors which itch intolerably this animal which we call an harvest bug is very minute scarce discernible to the naked eye of a bright scarlet color and of the genus of acarus they are to be met with in gardens on kidneybeans or any legumens but prevail only in the hot months of summer warreners as some have assured me are much infested by them on chalky downs where these insects swarm sometimes to so infinite a degree as to discolor their nets and to give them a reddish cast while the men are so bitten as to be thrown into fevers  there is a small long shining fly in these parts very troublesome to the housewife by getting into the chimnies and laying it is eggs in the bacon while it is drying these eggs produce maggots called jumpers which harboring in the gammons and best parts of the hogs eat down to the bone and make great waste this fly i suspect to be a variety of the musca putris of linnaeus it is to be seen in the summer in farmkitchens on the baconracks and about the mantlepieces and on the ceilings  the insect that infests turnips and many crops in the garden destroying often whole fields while in their seedling leaves is an animal that wants to be better known the country people here call it the turnipfly and blackdolphin but i know it to be one of the coleoptera the  chrysomela oleracea saltatoria femoribus posticis crassissimis in very hot summers they abound to an amazing degree and as you walk in a field or in a garden make a pattering like rain by jumping on the leaves of the turnips or cabbages  there is an oestrus known in these parts to every ploughboy which because it is omitted by linnaeus is also passed over by late writers and that is the curvicauda of old moufet mentioned by derham in his physicotheology p   0 an insect worthy of remark for depositing it is eggs as it flies in so dextrous a manner on the single hairs of the legs and flanks of grasshorses but then derham is mistaken when he advances that this oestrus is the parent of that wonderful startailed maggot which he mentions afterward for more modern entomologists have discovered that singular production to be derived from the egg or the musca chamaeleon see geoffroy t    f    a full history of noxious insects hurtful in the field garden and house suggesting all the known and likely means of destroying them would be allowed by the public to be a most useful and important work what knowledge there is of this sort lies scattered and wants to be collected great improvements would soon follow of course a knowledge of the properties economy propagation and in short of the life and conversation of these animals is a necessary step to lead us to some method of preventing their depredations  as far as i am a judge nothing would recommend entomology more than some neat plates that should well express the generic distinctions of insects according to linnaeus for i am well assured that many people would study insects could they set out with a more adequate notion of those distinctions than can be conveyed at first by words alone  letter xxxv to the same selborne      dear sir happening to make a visit to my neighbors peacocks i could not help observing that the trains of those magnificent birds appear by no means to be their tails those long feathers growing not from their uropygium but all up their backs a range of short brown stiff feathers about six inches long fixed in the uropygium is the real tail and serves as the fulcrum to prop the train which is long and topheavy when set an end when the train is up nothing appears of the bird before but it is head and neck but this would not be the case were those long feathers fixed only in the rump as may be seen by the turkeycock when in a strutting attitude by a strong muscular vibration these birds can make the shafts of their long feathers clatter like the swords of a sworddancer they then trample very quick with their feet and run backwards toward the females  i should tell you that i have got an uncommon calculus aegogropila taken out of the stomach of a fat ox it is perfectly round and about the size of a large seville orange such are i think usually flat  letter xxxvi to the same sept      dear sir the summer through i have seen but two of that large species of bat which i call vespertilio altivolans from it is manner of feeding high in the air i procured one of them and found it to be a male and made no doubt as they accompanied together that the other was a female but happening in an evening or two to procure the other likewise i was somewhat disappointed when it appeared to be also of the same sex this circumstance and the great scarcity of this sort at least in these parts occasions some suspicions in my mind whether it is really a species or whether it may not be the male part of the more known species one of which may supply many females as is known to be the case in sheep and some other quadrupeds but this doubt can only be cleared by a farther examination and some attention to the sex of more specimens all that i know at present is that my two were amply furnished with the parts of generation much resembling those of a boar  in the extent of their wings they measured fourteen inches and an half and four inches and an half from the nose to the tip of the tail their heads were large their nostrils bilobated their shoulders broad and muscular and their whole bodies fleshy and plump nothing could be more sleek and soft than their fur which was of a bright chestnut color their maws were full of food but so macerated that the quality could not be distinguished their livers kidneys and hearts were large and their bowels covered with fat they weighed each when entire full one ounce and one dram within the ear there was somewhat of a peculiar structure that i did not understand perfectly but refer it to the observation of the curious anatomist these creatures sent forth a very rancid and offensive smell  letter xxxvii to the same selborne      dear sir on the twelfth of july i had a fair opportunity of contemplating the motions of the caprimulgus or fernowl as it was playing round a large oak that swarmed with scarabaei solstitiales or fernchafers the powers of it is wing were wonderful exceeding if possible the various evolutions and quick turns of the swallow genus but the circumstance that pleased me most was that i saw it distinctly more than once put out it is short leg while on the wing and by a bend of the head deliver somewhat into it is mouth if it takes any part of it is prey with it is foot as i have now the greatest reason to suppose it does these chafers i no longer wonder at the use of it is middle toe which is curiously furnished with a serrated claw  swallows and martins the bulk of them i mean have forsaken us sooner this year than usual for on september the twentysecond they rendezvoused in a neighbors walnuttree where it seemed probable they had taken up their lodging for the night at the dawn of the day which was foggy they arose all together in infinite numbers occasioning such a rushing from the strokes of their wings against the hazy air as might be heard to a considerable distance since that no flock has appeared only a few stragglers  some swifts staid late till the twentysecond of august  a rare instance for they usually withdraw within the first week see letter liii to mr barrington   on september the twentyfourth three or four ringousels appeared in my fields for the first time this season how punctual are these visitors in their autumnal and spring migrations  letter xxxviii to the same selborne march         dear sir by my journal for last autumn it appears that the housemartins bred very late and staid very late in these parts for on the first of october i saw young martins in their nest nearly fledged and again on the twentyfirst of october we had at the next house a nest full of young martins just ready to fly and the old ones were hawking for insects with great alertness the next morning the brood forsook their nest and were flying round the village from this day i never saw one of the swallow kind till november the third when twenty or perhaps thirty housemartins were playing all day long by the side of the hanging wood and over my fields did these small weak birds some of which were nestlings twelve days ago shift their quarters at this late season of the year to the other side of the northern tropic or rather is it not more probable that the next church ruin chalkcliff steep covert or perhaps sandbank lake or pool as a more northern naturalist would say may become their hybernaculum and afford them a ready and obvious retreat  we now begin to expect our vernal migration of ringousels every week persons worthy of credit assure me that ringousels were seen at christmas    0 in the forest of bear on the southern verge of this county hence we may conclude that their migrations are only internal and not extended to the continent southward if they do at first come at all from the northern parts of this island only and not from the north of europe come from whence they will it is plain from the fearless disregard that they show for men or guns that they have been little accustomed to places of much resort navigators mention that in the isle of ascension and other such desolate districts birds are so little acquainted with the human form that they settle on mens shoulders and have no more dread of a sailor than they would have of a goat that was grazing a young man at jews in sussex assured me that about seven years ago ringousels abounded so about that town in the autumn that he killed sixteen himself in one afternoon he added further that some had appeared since in every autumn but he could not find that any had been observed before the season in which he shot so many i myself have found these birds in little parties in the autumn cantoned all along the sussex downs wherever there were shrubs and bushes from chichester to jews particularly in the autumn of    0  i am etc  letter xxxix to the same selborne nov        dear sir as you desire me to send you such observations as may occur i take the liberty of making the following remarks that you may according as you think me right or wrong admit or reject what i here advance in your intended new edition of the british zoology  the osprey british zoology vol   p     was shot about a year ago at frinshampond a great lake at about six miles from hence while it was sitting on the handle of a plough and devouring a fish it used to precipitate itself into the water and so take it is prey by surprise  a great ashcolored p     butcherbird was shot last winter in tistedpark and a red backed butcherbird at selborne they are rarae aves in this county  crows p     go in pairs the whole year round  cornish choughs p     abound and breed on beachyhead and on all the cliffs of the sussex coast  the common wildpigeon p     or stockdove is a bird of passage in the south of england seldom appearing till toward the end of november is usually the latest winterbird of passage before our beechen woods were so much destroyed we had myriads of them reaching in strings for a mile together as they went out in a morning to feed they leave us early in spring where do they breed  the people of hampshire and sussex call the misselbird p     the stormcock because it sings early in the spring in blowing showery weather it is song often commences with the year with us it builds much in orchards  a gentleman assures me he has taken the nests of ringousels p     on dartmoor they build in banks on the sides of streams  titlarks vol   p     not only sing sweetly as they sit on trees but also as they play and toy about on the wing and particularly while they are descending and sometimes as they stand on the ground  adansons p     testimony seems to me to be a very poor evidence that european swallows migrate during our winter to senegal he does not talk at all like an ornithologist and probably saw only the swallows of that country which i know build within governor oharas hall against the roof had he known european swallows would he not have mentioned the species  the houseswallow washes by dropping into the water as it flies this species appears commonly about a week before the housemartin and about ten or twelve days before the swift  in      there were young housemartins     in their nest till october the twentythird  the swift     appears about ten or twelve days later than the houseswallow viz about the twentyfourth or twentysixth of april  whinchats and stonechatters   0     stay with us the whole year  some wheatears     continue with us the winter through  wagtails all sorts remain with us all the winter  bulfinches  00 when fed on hempseed often become wholly black  we have vast flocks of female chaffinches  0  all the winter with hardly any males among them  when you say that in breedingtime the cocksnipes     make a bleating noise and i a drumming perhaps i should have rather said an humming i suspect we mean the same thing however while they are playing about on the wing they certainly make a loud piping with their mouths but whether that bleating or humming is ventriloquous or proceeds from the motion of their wings i cannot say but this i know that when this noise happens the bird is always descending and his wings are violently agitated  soon after the lapwings   0 have done breeding they congregate and leaving the moors and marshes betake themselves to downs and sheepwalks  two years ago  0  last spring the little auk was found alive and unhurt but fluttering and unable to rise in a lane a few miles from alresford where there is a great lake it was kept awhile but died  i saw young teals     taken alive in the ponds of wolmerforest in the beginning of july last along with slappers or young wildducks  speaking of the swift p    that page says  it is drink the dew whereas it should be it drinks on the wing for all the swallow kind sip their water as they sweep over the face of pools or rivers like virgils bees they drink flying  flumina summa libant in this method of drinking perhaps this genus may be peculiar  of the sedgebird p    be pleased to say it sings most part of the night it is notes are hurrying but not unpleasing and imitative of several birds as the sparrow swallow skylark when it happens to be silent in the night by throwing a stone or clod into the bushes where it sits you immediately set it a singing or in other words though it slumbers sometimes yet as soon as it is awakened it reassumes it is song  letter xl to the same selborne sept        dear sir before your letter arrived and of my own accord i had been remarking and comparing the tails of the male and female swallow and this ere any young broods appeared so that there was no danger of confounding the dams with their pulli and besides as they were then always in pairs and busied in the employ of nidification there could be no room for mistaking the sexes nor the individuals of different chimnies the one for the other from all my observations it constantly appeared that each sex has the long feathers in it is tail that give it that forked shape with this difference that they are longer in the tail of the male than in that of the female  nightingales when their young first come abroad and are helpless make a plaintive and a jarring noise and also a snapping or cracking pursuing people along the hedges as they walk these last sounds seem intended for menace and defiance  the grasshopperlark chirps all night in the height of summer  swans turn white the second year and breed the third  weasels prey on moles as appears by their being sometimes caught in moletraps  sparrowhawks sometimes breed in old crows nests and the kestril in churches and ruins  there are supposed to be two sorts of eels in the island of ely the threads sometimes discovered in eels are perhaps their young the generation of eels is very dark and mysterious  henharriers breed on the ground and seem never to settle on trees  when redstarts shake their tails they move them horizontally as dogs do when they fawn the tail of a wagtail when in motion bobs up and down like that of a jaded horse  hedgesparrows have a remarkable flirt with their wings in breedingtime as soon as frosty mornings come they make a very piping plaintive noise  many birds which become silent about midsummer reassume their notes again in september as the thrush blackbird woodlark willowwren etc hence august is by much the most mute month the spring summer and autumn through are birds induced to sing again because the temperament of autumn resembles that of spring  linnaeus ranges plants geographically palms inhabit the tropics grasses the temperate zones and mosses and lichens the polar circles no doubt animals may be classed in the same manner with propriety  housesparrows build under eaves in the spring as the weather becomes hotter they get out for coolness and nest in plumtrees and apple trees these birds have been known sometimes to build in rooks nests and sometimes in the forks of boughs under rooks nests  as my neighbor was housing a rick he observed that his dogs devoured all the little red mice that they could catch but rejected the common mice and that his cats ate the common mice refusing the red  redbreasts sing all through the spring summer and autumn the reason that they are called autumn songsters is because in the two first seasons their voices are drowned and lost in the general chorus in the latter their song becomes distinguishable many songsters of the autumn seem to be the young cock redbreasts of that year notwithstanding the prejudices in their favor they do much mischief in gardens to the summerfruits they eat also the berries of the ivy the honeysuckle and the euonymus europaeus or spindletree   the titmouse which early in february begins to make two quaint notes like the whetting of a saw is the marsh titmouse the great titmouse sings with three cheerful joyous notes and begins about the same time  wrens sing all the winter through frost excepted  housemartins came remarkably late this year both in hampshire and devonshire is this circumstance for or against either hiding or migration  most birds drink sipping at intervals but pigeons take a long continued draught like quadrupeds  notwithstanding what i have said in a former letter no gray crows were ever known to breed on dartmoor it was my mistake  the appearance and flying of the scarabaeus solstitialis or fernchafer commence with the month of july and cease about the end of it these scarabs are the constant food of caprimulgi or fern owls through that period they abound on the chalky downs and in some sandy districts but not in the clays  in the garden of the blackbear inn in the town of reading is a stream or canal running under the stables and out into the fields on the other side of the road in this water are many carps which lie rolling about in sight being fed by travelers who amuse themselves by tossing them bread but as soon as the weather grows at all severe these fishes are no longer seen because they retire under the stables where they remain till the return of spring do they lie in a torpid state if they do not how are they supported  the note of the whitethroat which is continually repeated and often attended with odd gesticulations on the wing is harsh and displeasing these birds seem of a pugnacious disposition for they sing with an erected crest and attitudes of rivalry and defiance are shy and wild in breedingtime avoiding neighbourhoods and haunting lonely lanes and commons nay even the very tops of the sussexdowns where there are bushes and covert but in july and august they bring their broods into gardens and orchards and make great havoc among the summerfruits  the blackcap has in common a full sweet deep loud and wild pipe yet that strain is of short continuance and his motions are desultory but when that bird sits calmly and engages in song in earnest he pours forth very sweet but inward melody and expresses great variety of soft and gentle modulations superior perhaps to those of any of our warblers the nightingale excepted  blackcaps mostly haunt orchards and gardens while they warble their throats are wonderfully distended  the song of the redstart is superior though somewhat like that of the whitethroat some birds have a few more notes than others sitting very placidly on the top of a tall tree in a village the cock sings from morning to night he affects neighbourhoods and avoids solitude and loves to build in orchards and about houses with us he perches on the vane of a tall maypole  the flycatcher is of all our summer birds the most mute and the most familiar it also appears the last of any it builds in a vine or a sweetbriar against the wall of an house or in the hole of a wall or on the end of a beam or plate and often close to the post of a door where people are going in and out all day long this bird does not make the least pretension to song but uses a little inward wailing note when it thinks it is young in danger from cats or other annoyances it breeds but once and retires early  selborne parish alone can and has exhibited at times more than half the birds that are ever seen in all sweden the former has produced more than one hundred and twenty species the latter only two hundred and twentyone let me add also that it has shown near half the species that were ever known in greatbritian sweden     greatbritian     species   on a retrospect i observe that my long letter carries with it a quaint and magisterial air and is very sententious but when i recollect that you requested stricture and anecdote i hope you will pardon the didactic manner for the sake of the information it may happen to contain  letter xli to the same it is matter of curious inquiry to trace out how those species of softbilled birds that continue with us the winter through subsist during the dead months the imbecility of birds seems not to be the only reason why they shun the rigor of our winters for the robust wryneck so much resembling the hardy race of woodpeckers migrates while the feeble little goldencrowned wren that shadow of a bird braves our severest frosts without availing himself of houses or villages to which most of our winterbirds crowd in distressful seasons while this keeps aloof in fields and woods but perhaps this may be the reason why they may often perish and why they are almost as rare as any bird we know  i have no reason to doubt but that the softbilled birds which winter with us subsist chiefly on insects in their aurelia state all the species of wagtails in severe weather haunt shallow streams near their springheads where they never freeze and by wading pick out the aurelias of the genus of see derhams physicotheology p     phryganeae etc  hedgesparrows frequent sinks and gutters in hard weather where they pick up crumbs and other sweepings and in mild weather they procure worms which are stirring every month in the year as any one may see that will only be at the trouble of taking a candle to a grassplot on any mild winters night redbreasts and wrens in the winter haunt outhouses stables and barns where they find spiders and flies that have laid themselves up during the cold season but the grand support of the softbilled birds in winter is that infinite profusion of aureliae of the lepidoptera ordo which is fastened to the twigs of trees and their trunks to the pales and walls of gardens and buildings and is found in every cranny and cleft of rock or rubbish and even in the ground itself  every species of titmouse winters with us they have what i call a kind of intermediate bill between the hard and the soft between the linnaean genera of fringilla and motacilla one species alone spends it is whole time in the woods and fields never retreating for succor in the severest seasons to houses and neighbourhoods and that is the delicate longtailed titmouse which is almost as minute as the goldencrowned wren but the blue titmouse or nun parus caeruleus the colemouse parus ater the great blackheaded titmouse fringillago and the marsh titmouse parus palustris all resort at times to buildings and in hard weather particularly the great titmouse driven by stress of weather much frequents houses and in deep snows i have seen this bird while it hung with it is back downwards to my no small delight and admiration draw straws lengthwise from out the eaves of thatched houses in order to pull out the flies that were concealed between them and that in such numbers that they quite defaced the thatch and gave it a ragged appearance  the blue titmouse or nun is a great frequenter of houses and a general devourer besides insects it is very fond of flesh for it frequently picks bones on dunghills it is a vast admirer of suet and haunts butchers shops when a boy i have known twenty in a morning caught with snap mousetraps baited with tallow or suet it will also pick holes in apples left on the ground and be well entertained with the seeds on the head of a sunflower the blue marsh and great titmice will in very severe weather carry away barley and oat straws from the sides of ricks  how the wheatear and whinchat support themselves in winter cannot be so easily ascertained since they spend their time on wild heaths and warrens the former especially where there are stone quarries most probably it is that their maintenance arises from the aureliae of the lepidoptera ordo which furnish them with a plentiful table in the wilderness  i am etc  letter xlii to the same selborne march        dear sir some future faunist a man of fortune will i hope extend his visits to the kingdom of ireland a new field and a country little known to the naturalist he will not it is to be wished undertake that tour unaccompanied by a botanist because the mountains have scarcely been sufficiently examined and the southerly counties of so mild an island may possibly afford some plants little to be expected within the british dominions a person of a thinking turn of mind will draw many just remarks from the modern improvements of that country both in arts and agriculture where premiums obtained long before they were heard of with us the manners of the wild natives their superstitions their prejudices their sordid way of life will extort from him many useful reflections he should also take with him an able draughtsman for he must by no means pass over the noble castles and seats the extensive and picturesque lakes and waterfalls and the lofty stupendous mountains so little known and so engaging to the imagination when described and exhibited in a lively manner such a work would be well received  as i have seen no modern map of scotland i cannot pretend to say how accurate or particular any such may be but this i know that the best old maps of that kingdom are very defective  the great obvious defect that i have remarked in all maps of scotland that have fallen in my way is a want of a colored line or stroke that shall exactly define the just limits of that district called the highlands moreover all the great avenues to that mountainous and romantic country want to be well distinguished the military roads formed by general wade are so great and romanlike an undertaking that they well merit attention my old map molls map takes notice of fort william but could not mention the other forts that have been erected long since therefore a good representation of the chain of forts should not be omitted  the celebrated zigzag up the coryarich must not be passed over moll takes notice of hamilton and drumlanrig and such capital houses but a new survey no doubt should represent every seat and castle remarkable for any great event or celebrated for it is paintings etc lord breadalbanes seat and beautiful policy are too curious and extraordinary to be omitted  the seat of the earl of eglintoun near glasgow is worthy of notice the pineplantations of that nobleman are very grand and extensive indeed  i am etc  letter xliii to the same a pair of honeybuzzards buteo apivorus five vespivorus raii built them a large shallow nest composed of twigs and lined with dead beechen leaves upon a tall slender beech near the middle of selbornehanger in the summer of    0 in the middle of the month of june a bold boy climbed this tree though standing on so steep and dizzy a situation and brought down an egg the only one in the nest which had been sat on for some time and contained the embrio of a young bird the egg was smaller and not so round as those of the common buzzard was dotted at each end with small red spots and surrounded in the middle with a broad bloody zone  the henbird was shot and answered exactly to mr rays description of that species had a black cere short thick legs and a long tail when on the wing this species may be easily distinguished from the common buzzard by it is hawklike appearance small head wings not so blunt and longer tail this specimen contained in it is craw some limbs of frogs and many gray snails without shells the irides of the eyes of this bird were of a beautiful bright yellow color  about the tenth of july in the same summer a pair of sparrowhawks bred in an old crows nest on a low beech in the same hanger and as their brood which was numerous began to grow up became so daring and ravenous that they were a terror to all the dames in the village that had chickens or ducklings under their care a boy climbed the tree and found the young so fledged that they all escaped from him but discovered that a good house had been kept the larder was wellstored with provisions for he brought down a young blackbird jay and housemartin all clean picked and some half devoured the old birds had been observed to make sad havoc for some days among the newflown swallows and martins which being but lately out of their nests had not acquired those powers and command of wing that enable them when more mature to set such enemies at defiance  letter xliv to the same selborne nov  0    0 dear sir every incident that occasions a renewal of our correspondence will ever be pleasing and agreeable to me  as to the wild woodpigeon the oenas or vinago of ray i am much of your mind and see no reason for making it the origin of the common housedove but suppose those that have advanced that opinion may have been misled by another appellation often given to the oenas which is that of stockdove  unless the stockdove in the winter varies greatly in manners from itself in summer no species seems more unlikely to be domesticated and to make an housedove we very rarely see the latter settle on trees at all nor does it ever haunt the woods but the former as long as it stays with us from november perhaps to february lives the same wild life with the ringdove palumbus torquatus frequents coppices and groves supports itself chiefly by mast and delights to roost in the tallest beeches could it be known in what manner stockdoves build the doubt would be settled with me at once provided they construct their nests on trees like the ringdove as i much suspect they do  you received you say last spring a stockdove from sussex and are informed that they sometimes breed in that country but why did not your correspondent determine the place of it is nidification whether on rocks cliffs or trees if he was not an adroit ornithologist i should doubt the fact because people with us perpetually confound the stockdove with the ringdove  for my own part i readily concur with you in supposing that housedoves are derived from the small blue rockpigeon for many reasons in the first place the wild stockdove is manifestly larger than the common housedove against the usual rule of domestication which generally enlarges the breed again those two remarkable black spots on the remiges of each wing of the stockdove which are so characteristic of the species would not one should think be totally lost by it is being reclaimed but would often break out among its descendants but what is worth an hundred arguments is the instance you give in sir roger moslyns housedoves in caernarvonshire which though tempted by plenty of food and gentle treatment can never be prevailed on to inhabit their cote for any time but as soon as they begin to breed betake themselves to the fastnesses of ormshead and deposit their young in safety amidst the inaccessible caverns and precipices of that stupendous promontory  naturam expellas furca tamen usque recurret i have consulted a sportsman now in his seventyeighth year who tells me that fifty or sixty years back when the beechen woods were much more extensive than at present the number of woodpigeons was astonishing that he has often killed near twenty in a day and that with a long wildfowl piece he has shot seven or eight at a time on the wing as they came wheeling over his head he moreover adds which i was not aware of that often there were among them little parties of small blue doves which he calls rockiers the food of these numberless emigrants was beechmast and some acorns and particularly barley which they collected in the stubbles but of late years since the vast increase of turnips that vegetable has furnished a great part of their support in hard weather and the holes they pick in these roots greatly damage the crop from this food their flesh has contracted a rancidness which occasions them to be rejected by nicer judges of eating who thought them before a delicate dish they were shot not only as they were feeding in the fields and especially in snowy weather but also at the close of the evening by men who lay in ambush among the woods and groves to kill them as they came in to roost some old sportsmen say that the main part of these flocks used to withdraw as soon as the heavy christmas frosts were over  these are the principal circumstances relating to this wonderful internal migration which with us takes place toward the end of november and ceases early in the spring last winter we had in selborne high wood about an hundred of these doves but in former times the flocks were so vast not only with us but all the district round that on mornings and evenings they traversed the air like rooks in strings reaching for a mile together when they thus rendezvoused here by thousands if they happened to be suddenly roused from their roosttrees on an evening their rising all at once was like the sound of thunder heard remote    it will by no means be foreign to the present purpose to add that i had a relation in this neighborhood who made it a practice for a time whenever he could procure the eggs of a ringdove to place them under a pair of doves that were sitting in his own pigeonhouse hoping thereby if he could bring about a coalition to enlarge his breed and teach his own doves to beat out into the woods and to support themselves by mast the plan was plausible but something always interrupted the success for though the birds were usually hatched and sometimes grew to half their size yet none ever arrived at maturity i myself have seen these foundlings in their nest displaying a strange ferocity of nature so as scarcely to bear to be looked at and snapping with their bills by way of menace in short they always died perhaps for want of proper sustenance but the owner thought that by their fierce and wild demeanor they frighted their fostermothers and so were starved  virgil as a familiar occurrence by way of simile describes a dove haunting the cavern of a rock in such engaging numbers that i cannot refrain from quoting the passage and john dryden has rendered it so happily in our language that without farther excuse i shall add his translation also  qualis spelunca subito commota columba cui domus et dulces latebroso in pumice nidi fertur in arva volans plausumque exterrita pennis dat tecto ingentem  mox aere lapsa quieto radit iter liquidum celeres neque commovet alas as when a dove her rocky hold forsakes roused in a fright her sounding wings she shakes the cavern rings with clattering  out she flies and leaves her callow care and cleaves the skies at first she flutters  but at length she springs to smoother flight and shoots upon her wings i am etc  letter i to the honorable daines barrington

in full song till after midsummer appear to me to breed more than once  most kinds of birds seem to me to be wild and shy somewhat in proportion to their bulk i mean in this island where they are much pursued and annoyed but in ascension island and many other desolate places mariners have found fowls so unacquainted with an human figure that they would stand still to be taken as is the case with boobies etc as an example of what is advanced i remark that the goldencrested wren the smallest british bird will stand unconcerned till you come within three or four yards of it while the bustard otis the largest british land fowl does not care to admit a person within so many furlongs  i am etc  letter iii to the same selborne jan       0 dear sir it was no small matter of satisfaction to me to find that you were not displeased with my little methodus of birds if there was any merit in the sketch it must be owing to it is punctuality for many months i carried a list in my pocket of the birds that were to be remarked and as i rode or walked about my business i noted each day the continuance or omission of each birds song so that i am as sure of the certainty of my facts as a man can be of any transaction whatsoever  i shall now proceed to answer the several queries which you put in your two obliging letters in the best manner that i am able perhaps eastwick and it is environs where you heard so very few birds is not a woodland country and therefore not stocked with such songsters if you will cast your eye on my last letter you will find that many species continued to warble after the beginning of july  the titlark and yellowhammer breed late the latter very late and therefore it is no wonder that they protract their song for i lay it down as a maxim in ornithology that as long as there is any incubation going on there is music as to the redbreast and wren it is well known to the most incurious observer that they whistle the year round hard frost excepted especially the latter  it was not in my power to procure you a blackcap or a less reedsparrow or sedgebird alive as the first is undoubtedly and the last as far as i can yet see a summer bird of passage they would require more nice and curious management in a cage than i should be able to give them they are both distinguished songsters the note of the former has such a wild sweetness that it always brings to my mind those lines in a song in  as you like it and tune his merry note unto the wild birds throat shakespeare  the latter has a surprising variety of notes resembling the song of several other birds but then it has also an hurrying manner not at all to it is advantage it is notwithstanding a delicate polyglot  it is new to me that titlarks in cages sing in the night perhaps only caged birds do so i once knew a tame redbreast in a cage that always sang as long as candles were in the room but in their wild state no one supposes they sing in the night  i should be almost ready to doubt the fact that there are to be seen much fewer birds in july than in any former month notwithstanding so many young are hatched daily sure i am that it is far otherwise with respect to the swallow tribe which increases prodigiously as the summer advances and i saw at the time mentioned many hundreds of young wagtails on the banks of the cherwell which almost covered the meadows if the matter appears as you say in the other species may it not be owing to the dams being engaged in incubation while the young are concealed by the leaves  many times have i had the curiosity to open the stomachs of woodcocks and snipes but nothing ever occurred that helped to explain to me what their subsistence might be all that i could ever find was a soft mucus among which lay many pellucid small gravels  i am etc  letter iv to the same selborne feb       0 dear sir your observation that the cuckoo does not deposit it is egg indiscriminately in the nest of the first bird that comes in it is way but probably looks out a nurse in some degree congenerous with whom to entrust it is young is perfectly new to me and struck me so forcibly that i naturally fell into a train of thought that led me to consider whether the fact was so and what reason there was for it when i came to recollect and inquire i could not find that any cuckoo had ever been seen in these parts except in the nest of the wagtail the hedgesparrow the titlark the whitethroat and the redbreast all softbilled insectivorous birds the excellent mr willughby mentions the nest of the palumbus ringdove and of the fringilla chaffinch birds that subsist on acorns and grains and such hard food but then he does not mention them as of his own knowledge but says afterward that he saw himself a wagtail feeding a cuckoo it appears hardly possible that a softbilled bird should subsist on the same food with the hardbilled for the former have thin membranaceous stomachs suited to their soft food while the latter the granivorous tribe have strong muscular gizzards which like mills grind by the help of small gravels and pebbles what is swallowed this proceeding of the cuckoo of dropping it is eggs as it were by chance is such a monstrous outrage on maternal affection one of the first great dictates of nature and such a violence on instinct that had it only been related of a bird in the brasils or peru it would never have merited our belief but yet should it farther appear that this simple bird when divested of that natural  that seems to raise the kind in general above themselves and inspire them with extraordinary degrees of cunning and address may be still endued with a more enlarged faculty of discerning what species are suitable and congenerous nursingmothers for it is disregarded eggs and young and may deposit them only under their care this would be adding wonder to wonder and instancing in a fresh manner that the methods of providence are not subjected to any mode or rule but astonish us in new lights and in various and changeable appearances  what was said by a very ancient and sublime writer concerning the defect of natural affection in the ostrich may be well applied to the bird we are talking of  she is hardened against her young ones as though they were not here is  because god has deprived her of wisdom neither has he imparted to her understanding job xxxix          query does each female cuckoo lay but one egg in a season or does she drop several in different nests according as opportunity offers  i am etc  letter v to the same selborne april       0 dear sir i heard many birds of several species sing last year after midsummer enough to prove that the summer solstice is not the period that puts a stop to the music of the woods the yellowhammer no doubt persists with more steadiness than any other but the woodlark the wren the redbreast the swallow the whitethroat the goldfinch the common linnet are all undoubted instances of the truth of what i advanced  if this severe season does not interrupt the regularity of the summer migrations the blackcap will be here in two or three days i wish it was in my power to procure you one of those songsters but i am no birdcatcher and so little used to birds in a cage that i fear if i had one it would soon die for want of skill in feeding  was your reedsparrow which you kept in a cage the thickbilled reedsparrow of the zoology p   0 or was it the less reedsparrow of ray the sedgebird of mr pennants last publication p     as to the matter of longbilled birds growing fatter in moderate frosts i have no doubt within myself what should be the reason the thriving at those times appears to me to arise altogether from the gentle check which the cold throws upon insensible perspiration the case is just the same with blackbirds etc and farmers and warreners observe the first that their hogs fat more kindly at such times and the latter that their rabbits are never in such good case as in a gentle frost but when frosts are severe and of long continuance the case is soon altered for then a want of food soon overbalances the repletion occasioned by a checked perspiration i have observed moreover that some human constitutions are more inclined to plumpness in winter than in summer  when birds come to suffer by severe frost i find that the first that fail and die are the redwingfieldfares and then the songthrushes  you wonder with good reason that the hedgesparrows etc can be induced at all to sit on the egg of the cuckoo without being scandalized at the vast disproportioned size of the supposititious egg but the brute creation i suppose have very little idea of size color or number for the common hen i know when the fury of incubation is on her will sit on a single shapeless stone instead of a nest full of eggs that have been withdrawn and moreover a henturkey in the same circumstances would sit on in the empty nest till she perished with hunger  i think the matter might easily be determined whether a cuckoo lays one or two eggs or more in a season by opening a female during the layingtime if more than one was come down out of the ovary and advanced to a good size doubtless then she would that spring lay more than one  i will endeavor to get a hen and to examine  your supposition that there may be some natural obstruction in singing birds while they are mute and that when this is removed the song recommences is new and bold i wish you could discover some good grounds for this suspicion  i was glad you were pleased with my specimen of the caprimulgus or fernowl you were i find acquainted with the bird before  when we meet i shall be glad to have some conversation with you concerning the proposal you make of my drawing up an account of the animals in this neighborhood your partiality toward my small abilities persuades you i fear that i am able to do more than is in my power for it is no small undertaking for a man unsupported and alone to begin a natural history from his own autopsia though there is endless room for observation in the field of nature which is boundless yet investigation where a man endeavors to be sure of his facts can make but slow progress and all that one could collect in many years would go into a very narrow compass  some extracts from your ingenious investigations of the difference between the present temperature of the air in italy etc have fallen in my way and gave me great satisfaction they have removed the objections that always arose in my mind whenever i came to the passages which you quote surely the judicious virgil when writing a didactic poem for the region of italy could never think of describing freezing rivers unless such severity of weather pretty frequently occurred  ps swallows appear amidst snows and frost    letter vi to the same selborne may       0 dear sir the severity and turbulence of last month so interrupted the regular process of summer migration that some of the birds do but just begin to show themselves and others are apparently thinner than usual as the whitethroat the blackcap the redstart the flycatcher i well remember that after the very severe spring in the year      0 summer birds of passage were very scarce they come probably hither with a southeast wind or when it blows between those points but in that unfavourable year the winds blowed the whole spring and summer through from the opposite quarters and yet amidst all these disadvantages two swallows as i mentioned in my last appeared this year as early as the eleventh of april amidst frost and snow but they withdrew again for a time  i am not pleased to find that some people seem so little satisfied with scopolis new publication this work he calls his annus primus historico naturalis  there is room to expect great things from the hands of that man who is a good naturalist and one would think that an history of the birds of so distant and southern a region as carniola would be new and interesting i could wish to see that work and hope to get it sent down dr scopoli is physician to the wretches that work in the quicksilver mines of that district  when you talked of keeping a reedsparrow and giving it seeds i could not help wondering because the reedsparrow which i mentioned to you passer arundinaceus minor raii is a softbilled bird and most probably migrates hence before winter whereas the bird you kept passer torquatus raii abides all the year and is a thickbilled bird i question whether the latter be much of a songster but in this matter i want to be better informed the former has a variety of hurrying notes and sings all night some part of the song of the former i suspect is attributed to the latter we have plenty of the softbilled sort which mr pennant had entirely left out of his british zoology till i reminded him of his omission see british zoology last published p    see letter xxv to mr pennant   i have somewhat to advance on the different manners in which different birds fly and walk but as this is a subject that i have not enough considered and is of such a nature as not to be contained in a small space i shall say nothing further about it at present see letter xlii to mr barrington   no doubt the reason why the sex of birds in their first plumage is so difficult to be distinguished is as you say because they are not to pair and discharge their parental functions till the ensuing spring as colors seem to be the chief external sexual distinction in many birds these colors do not take place till sexual attachments begin to obtain and the case is the same in quadrupeds among whom in their younger days the sexes differ but little but as they advance to maturity horns and shaggy manes beards and brawny necks etc etc strongly discriminate the male from the female we may instance still farther in our own species where a beard and stronger features are usually characteristic of the male sex but this sexual diversity does not take place in earlier life for a beautiful youth shall be so like a beautiful girl that the difference shall not be discernible quem si puellarum insereres choro mire sagaces falleret hospites discrimen obscurum solutis crinibus ambiguoque vultu hor  letter vii to the same ringmer near jews oct      0 dear sir i am glad to hear that kuckalm is to furnish you with the birds of jamaica a sight of the hirundines of that hot and distant island would be a great entertainment to me  the anni of scopoli are now in my possession and i have read the annus primus with satisfaction for though some parts of this work are exceptionable and he may advance some mistaken observations yet the ornithology of so distant a country as carniola is very curious men that undertake only one district are much more likely to advance natural knowledge than those that grasp at more than they can possibly be acquainted with every kingdom every province should have it is own monographer  the reason perhaps why he mentions nothing of rays ornithology may be the extreme poverty and distance of his country into which the works of our great naturalist may have never yet found their way you have doubts i know whether this ornithology is genuine and really the work of scopoli as to myself i think i discover strong tokens of authenticity the style corresponds with that of his entomology and his characters of his ordines and genera are many of them new expressive and masterly he has ventured to alter some of the linnaean genera with sufficient show of reason  it might perhaps be mere accident that you saw so many swifts and no swallows at stains because in my long observation of those birds i never could discover the least degree of rivalry or hostility between the species  ray remarks that birds of the gallinae order as cocks and hens partridges and pheasants etc are pulveratrices such as dust themselves using that method of cleansing their feathers and ridding themselves of their vermin as far as i can observe many birds that dust themselves never wash and i once thought that those birds that wash themselves would never dust but here i find myself mistaken for common housesparrows are great pulveratrices being frequently seen grovelling and wallowing in dusty roads and yet they are great washers does not the skylark dust  query might not mahomet and his followers take one method of purification from these pulveratrices because i find from travelers of credit that if a strict mussulman is journeying in a sandy desert where no water is to be found at stated hours he strips off his clothes and most scrupulously rubs his body over with sand or dust  a countryman told me he had found a young fernowl in the nest of a small bird on the ground and that it was fed by the little bird i went to see this extraordinary phenomenon and found that it was a young cuckoo hatched in the nest of a titlark it was become vastly too big for it is nest appearing  in tenui re majores pennas nido extendisse  and was very fierce and pugnacious pursuing my finger as i teazed it for many feet from the nest and sparring and buffetting with it is wings like a gamecock the dupe of a dam appeared at a distance hovering about with meat in it is mouth and expressing the greatest solicitude  in july i saw several cuckoos skimming over a large pond and found after some observation that they were feeding on the libellulae or dragonflies some of which they caught as they settled on the weeds and some as they were on the wing notwithstanding what linnaeus says i cannot be induced to believe that they are birds of prey  this district affords some birds that are hardly ever heard of at selborne in the first place considerable flocks of crossbeaks loxiae curvirostrae have appeared this summer in the pinegroves belonging to this house the waterousel is said to haunt the mouth of the jews river near newhaven and the cornish chough builds i know all along the chalky cliffs of the sussex shore  i was greatly pleased to see little parties of ringousels my newly discovered migraters scattered at intervals all along the sussex downs from chichester to jews let them come from whence they will it looks very suspicious that they are cantoned along the coast in order to pass the channel when severe weather advances they visit us again in april as it should seem in their return and are not to be found in the dead of winter it is remarkable that they are very tame and seem to have no manner of apprehensions of danger from a person with a gun there are bustards on the wide downs near brighthelmstone no doubt you are acquainted with the sussex downs the prospects and rides round jews are most lovely  as i rode along near the coast i kept a very sharp look out in the lanes and woods hoping i might at this time of the year have discovered some of the summer shortwinged birds of passage crowding toward the coast in order for their departure but it was very extraordinary that i never saw a redstart whitethroat blackcap uncrested wren slycatcher etc and i remember to have made the same remark in former years as i usually come to this place annually about this time the birds most common along the coast at present are the stonechatters whinchats buntings linnets some few wheatears titlarks etc swallows and housemartins abound yet induced to prolong their stay by this soft still dry season  a land tortoise which has been kept for thirty years in a little walled court belonging to the house where i now am visiting retires under ground about the middle of november and comes forth again about the middle of april when it first appears in the spring it discovers very little inclination toward food but in the height of summer grows voracious and then as the summer declines it is appetite declines so that for the last six weeks in autumn it hardly eats at all milky plants such as lettuces dandelions sowthistles are it is favorite dish in a neighboring village one was kept till by tradition it was supposed to be an hundred years old an instance of vast longevity in such a poor reptile  letter viii to the same selborne dec  0    0 dear sir the birds that i took for aberdavines were reedsparrows passeres torquati  there are doubtless many home internal migrations within this kingdom that want to be better understood witness those vast slocks of hen chaffinches that appear with us in the winter without hardly any cocks among them now was there a due proportion of each sex it should seem very improbable that any one district should produce such numbers of these little birds and much more when only one half of the species appears therefore we may conclude that the fringillae caelebes for some good purposes have a peculiar migration of their own in which the sexes part nor should it seem so wonderful that the intercourse of sexes in this species of birds should be interrupted in winter since in many animals and particularly in bucks and does the sexes herd separately except at the season when commerce is necessary for the continuance of the breed for this matter of the chaffinches see fauna suecica p    and systema naturae p     i see every winter vast flights of hen chaffinches but none of cocks  your method of accounting for the periodical motions of the british singing birds or birds of flight is a very probable one since the matter of food is a great regulator of the actions and proceedings of the brute creation there is but one that can be set in competition with it and that is love but i cannot quite acquiesce with you in one circumstance when you advance that when they have thus feasted they again separate into small parties of five or six and get the best fare they can within a certain district having no inducement to go in quest of freshturned earth now if you mean that the business of congregating is quite at an end from the conclusion of wheatsowing to the season of barley and oats it is not the case with us for larks and chaffinches and particularly linnets flock and congregate as much in the very dead of winter as when the husbandman is busy with his ploughs and harrows  sure there can be no doubt but that woodcocks and fieldfares leave us in the spring in order to cross the seas and to retire to some districts more suitable to the purpose of breeding that the former pair before they retire and that the hens are forward with egg i myself when i was a sportsman have often experienced it cannot indeed be denied but that now and then we hear of a woodcocks nest or young birds discovered in some part or other of this island but then they are always mentioned as rarities and somewhat out of the common course of things but as to redwings and fieldfares no sportsman or naturalist has ever yet that i could hear pretended to have found the nest or young of those species in any part of these kingdoms and i the more admire at this instance as extraordinary since to all appearance the same food in summer as well as in winter might support them here which maintains their congeners the blackbirds and thrushes did they choose to stay the summer through from hence it appears that it is not food alone which determines some species of birds with regard to their stay or departure fieldfares and redwings disappear sooner or later according as the warm weather comes on earlier or later for i well remember after that dreadful winter      0 that cold northeast winds continued to blow on through april and may and that these kinds of birds what few remained of them did not depart as usual but were seen lingering about till the beginning of june  the best authority that we can have for the nidisication of the birds above mentioned in any district is the testimony of faunists that have written professedly the natural history of particular countries now as to the fieldfare linnaeus in his fauna suecica says of it that  maximis in arboribus nidificat and of the redwing he says in the same place that  nidificat in mediis arbusculis sive sepibus ova sex caeruleoviridia maculis nigris variis hence we may be assured that fieldfares and redwings breed in sweden scopoli says in his annus primus of the woodcock that  nupta ad nos venit circa aequinoctium vernale meaning in tirol of which he is a native and afterward he adds  nidificat in paludibus alpinis ova ponit      it does not appear from kramer that woodcocks breed at all in austria but he says  avis haec septentrionalium provinciarum astivo tempore incola est ubi plerumque nidificat appropinquante hyeme australiores provincias petit hinc circa plenilunium mensis octobris plerumque austriam transmigrat tunc rursus circa plenilunium potissimum mensis martii per austriam matrimonio juncta ad septentrionales provincias redit for the whole passage which i have abridged see elenchus etc p     this seems to be a full proof of the migration of woodcocks though little is proved concerning the place of breeding  ps there fell in the county of rutland in three weeks of this present very wet weather seven inches and an half of rain which is more than has fallen in any three weeks for these thirty years past in that part of the world a mean quantity in that county for one year is twenty inches and an half    letter ix to the same fyfield near andover feb         dear sir you are i know no great friend to migration and the well attested accounts from various parts of the kingdom seem to justify you in your suspicions that at least many of the swallow kind do not leave us in the winter but lay themselves up like insects and bats in a torpid state and slumber away the more uncomfortable months till the return of the sun and fine weather awakens them  but then we must not i think deny migration in general because migration certainly does subsist in some places as my brother in andalusia has fully informed me of the motions of these birds he has ocular demonstration for many weeks together both spring and fall during which periods myriads of the swallow kind traverse the straits from north to south and from south to north according to the season and these vast migrations consist not only of hirundines but of beebirds hoopoes oro pendolos or golden thrushes etc etc and also of many of our softbilled summer birds of passage and moreover of birds which never leave us such as all the various sorts of hawks and kites old belon two hundred years ago gives a curious account of the incredible armies of hawks and kites which he saw in the springtime traversing the thracian bosphorus from asia to europe besides the above mentioned he remarks that the procession is swelled by whole troops of eagles and vultures  now it is no wonder that birds residing in africa should retreat before the sun as it advances and retire to milder regions and especially birds of prey whose blood being heated with hot animal food are more impatient of a sultry climate but then i cannot help wondering why kites and hawks and such hardy birds as are known to defy all the severity of england and even of sweden and all north europe should want to migrate from the south of europe and be dissatisfied with the winters of andalusia  it does not appear to me that much stress may be laid on the difficulty and hazard that birds must run in their migrations by reason of vast oceans cross winds etc because if we reflect a bird may travel from england to the equator without launching out and exposing itself to boundless seas and that by crossing the water at dover and again at gibraltar and i with the more confidence advance this obvious remark because my brother has always found that some of his birds and particularly the swallow kind are very sparing of their pains in crossing the mediterranean for when arrived at gibraltar they do not  ranged in figure wedge their way  and set forth their airy caravan high over seas flying and over lands with mutual wing easing their flight  milton but scout and hurry along in little detached parties of six or seven in a company and sweeping low just over the surface of the land and water direct their course to the opposite continent at the narrowest passage they can find they usually slope across the bay to the southwest and so pass over opposite to tangier which it seems is the narrowest space  in former letters we have considered whether it was probable that woodcocks in moonshiny nights cross the german ocean from scandinavia as a proof that birds of less speed may pass that sea considerable as it is i shall relate the following incident which though mentioned to have happened so many years ago was strictly matter of fact  as some people were shooting in the parish of trotton in the county of sussex they killed a duck in that dreadful winter   0   with a silver collar about it is neck i have read a like anecdote of a swan  on which were engraven the arms of the king of denmark this anecdote the rector of trotton at that time has often told to a near relation of mine and to the best of my remembrance the collar was in the possession of the rector  at present i do not know any body near the seaside that will take the trouble to remark at what time of the moon woodcocks first come if i lived near the sea myself i would soon tell you more of the matter one thing i used to observe when i was a sportsman that there were times in which woodcocks were so sluggish and sleepy that they would drop again when flushed just before the spaniels nay just at the muzzle of a gun that had been fired at them whether this strange laziness was the effect of a recent fatiguing journey i shall not presume to say  nightingales not only never reach northumberland and scotland but also as i have been always told devonshire and cornwall in those two last counties we cannot attribute the failure of them to the want of warmth the defect in the west is rather a presumptive argument that these birds come over to us from the continent at the narrowest passage and do not stroll so far westward  let me hear from your own observation whether skylarks do not dust i think they do and if they do whether they wash also  the alauda pratensis of ray was the poor dupe that was educating the booby of a cuckoo mentioned in my letter of october last  your letter came too late for me to procure a ringousel for mr tunstal during their autumnal visit but i will endeavor to get him one when they call on us again in april i am glad that you and that gentleman saw my andalusian birds i hope they answered your expectation royston or gray crows are winter birds that come much about the same time with the woodcock they like the fieldfare and redwing have no apparent reason for migration for as they fare in the winter like their congeners so might they in all appearance in the summer was not tenant when a boy mistaken did he not find a misselthrushs nest and take it for the nest of a fieldfare  the stockdove or woodpigeon oenas raii is the last winter bird of passage which appears with us and is not seen till toward the end of november about twenty years ago they abounded in the district of selborne and strings of them were seen morning and evening that reached a mile or more but since the beechen woods have been greatly thinned they are much decreased in number the ringdove palumbus raii stays with us the whole year and breeds several times through the summer  before i received your letter of october last i had just remarked in my journal that the trees were unusually green this uncommon verdure lasted on late into november and may be accounted for from a late spring a cool and moist summer but more particularly from vast armies of chafers or treebeetles which in many places reduced whole woods to a leafless naked state these trees shot again at midsummer and then retained their foliage till very late in the year  my musical friend at whose house i am now visiting has tried all the owls that are his near neighbors with a pitchpipe set at concertpitch and finds they all hoot in b flat he will examine the nightingales next spring  i am etc etc  letter x to the same selborne aug        dear sir from what follows it will appear that neither owls nor cuckoos keep to one note a friend remarks that many most of his owls hoot in b flat but that one went almost half a note below a the pipe he tried their notes by was a common halfcrown pitchpipe such as masters use for tuning of harpsichords it was the common london pitch  a neighbor of mine who is said to have a nice ear remarks that the owls about this village hoot in three different keys in g flat or f sharp in b flat and a flat he heard two hooting to each other the one in a flat and the other in b flat query do these different notes proceed from different species or only from various individuals the same person finds upon trial that the note of the cuckoo of which we have but one species varies in different individuals for about selborne wood he found they were mostly in d he heard two sing together the one in d the other in d sharp who made a disagreeable concert he afterward heard one in d sharp and about woolmerforest some in c as to nightingales he says that their notes are so short and their transitions so rapid that he cannot well ascertain their key perhaps in a cage and in a room their notes may be more distinguishable this person has tried to settle the notes of a swift and of several other small birds but cannot bring them to any criterion  as i have often remarked that redwings are some of the first birds that suffer with us in severe weather it is no wonder at all that they retreat from scandinavian winters and much more the ordo of grallae who all to a bird forsake the northern parts of europe at the approach of winter  grallae tanquam conjuratae unanimiter in fugam se conjiciunt ne earum unicam quidem inter nos habitantem invenire possimus ut enim aestate in australibus degere nequeunt ob defectum lumbricorum terramque siccam ita nec in frigidis ob eandem causam says ekmarck the swede in his ingenious little treatise called migrationes avium which by all means you ought to read while your thoughts run on the subject of migration see amaenitates academicae vol   p      birds may be so circumstanced as to be obliged to migrate in one country and not in another but the grallae which procure their food from marshes and boggy grounds must in winter forsake the more northerly parts of europe or perish for want of food  i am glad you are making inquiries from linnaeus concerning the woodcock it is expected of him that he should be able to account for the motions and manner of life of the animals of his own fauna  faunists as you observe are too apt to acquiesce in bare descriptions and a few synonyms the reason is plain because all that may be done at home in a mans study but the investigation of the life and conversation of animals is a concern of much more trouble and difficulty and is not to be attained but by the active and inquisitive and by those that reside much in the country  foreign systematics are i observe much too vague in their specific differences which are almost universally constituted by one or two particular marks the rest of the description running in general terms but our countryman the excellent mr ray is the only describer that conveys some precise idea in every term or word maintaining his superiority over his followers and imitators in spite of the advantage of fresh discoveries and modern information  at this distance of years it is not in my power to recollect at what periods woodcocks used to be sluggish or alert when i was a sportsman but upon my mentioning this circumstance to a friend he thinks he has observed them to be remarkably listless against snowy foul weather if this should be the case then the inaptitude for flying arises only from an eagerness for food as sheep are observed to be very intent on grazing against stormy wet evenings  i am etc etc  letter xi to the same selborne feb        dear sir when i ride about in the winter and see such prodigious flocks of various kinds of birds i cannot help admiring at these congregations and wishing that it was in my power to account for those appearances almost peculiar to the season the two great motives which regulate the proceedings of the brute creation are love and hunger the former incites animals to perpetuate their kind the latter induces them to preserve individuals whether either of these should seem to be the ruling passion in the matter of congregating is to be considered as to love that is out of the question at a time of the year when that soft passion is not indulged besides during the amorous season such a jealousy prevails between the male birds that they can hardly bear to be together in the same hedge or field most of the singing and elation of spirits of that time seem to me to be the effect of rivalry and emulation and it is to this spirit of jealousy that i chiefly attribute the equal dispersion of birds in the spring over the face of the country  now as to the business of food as these animals are actuated by instinct to hunt for necessary food they should not one would suppose crowd together in pursuit of sustenance at a time when it is most likely to fail yet such associations do take place in hard weather chiefly and thicken as the severity increases as some kind of selfinterest and selfdefence is no doubt the motive for the proceeding may it not arise from the helplessness of their state in such rigorous seasons as men crowd together when under great calamities though they know not why perhaps approximation may dispel some degree of cold and a crowd may make each individual appear safer from the ravages of birds of prey and other dangers  if i admire when i see how much congenerous birds love to congregate i am the more struck when i see incongruous ones in such strict amity if we do not much wonder to see a flock of rooks usually attended by a train of daws yet it is strange that the former should so frequently have a flight of starlings for their satellites is it because rooks have a more discerning scent than their attenddants and can lead them to spots more productive of food anatomists say that rooks by reason of two large nerves which run down between the eyes into the upper mandible have a more delicate feeling in their beaks than other roundbilled birds and can grope for their meat when out of sight perhaps then their associates attend them on the motive of interest as greyhounds wait on the motions of their finders and as lions are said to do on the yelpings of jackalls lapwings and starlings sometimes associate  letter xii to the same march        dear sir as a gentleman and myself were walking on the fourth of last november round the seabanks at newhaven near the mouth of the jews river in pursuit of natural knowledge we were surprised to see three houseswallows gliding very swiftly by us that morning was rather chilly with the wind at northwest but the tenor of the weather for some time before had been delicate and the noons remarkably warm from this incident and from repeated accounts which i meet with i am more and more induced to believe that many of the swallow kind do not depart from this island but lay themselves up in holes and caverns and do insectlike and batlike come forth at mild times and then retire again to their latebrae nor make i the least doubt but that if i lived at newhaven seaford brighthelmstone or any of those towns near the chalkcliffs of the sussex coast by proper observations i should see swallows stirring at periods of the winter when the noons were soft and inviting and the sun warm and invigorating and i am the more of this opinion from what i have remarked during some of our late springs that though some swallows did make their appearance about the usual time viz the thirteenth or fourteenth of april yet meeting with an harsh reception and blustering cold northeast winds they immediately withdrew absconding for several days till the weather gave them better encouragement  letter xiii to the same april         dear sir while i was in sussex last autumn my residence was at the village near jews from whence i had formerly the pleasure of writing to you on the first of november i remarked that the old tortoise formerly mentioned began first to dig the ground in order to the forming it is hybernaculum which it had fixed on just beside a great tuft of hepaticas it scrapes out the ground with it is forefeet and throws it up over it is back with it is hind but the motion of it is legs is ridiculously slow little exceeding the hourhand of a clock and suitable to the composure of an animal said to be a whole month in performing one feat of copulation nothing can be more assiduous than this creature night and day in scooping the earth and forcing it is great body into the cavity but as the noons of that season proved unusually warm and sunny it was continually interrupted and called forth by the heat in the middle of the day and though i continued there till the thirteenth of november yet the work remained unfinished harsher weather and frosty mornings would have quickened it is operations no part of it is behavior ever struck me more than the extreme timidity it always expresses with regard to rain for though it has a shell that would secure it against the wheel of a loaded cart yet does it discover as much solicitude about rain as a lady dressed in all her best attire shuffling away on the first sprinklings and running it is head up in a corner if attended to it becomes an excellent weatherglass for as sure as it walks elate and as it were on tiptoe feeding with great earnestness in a morning so sure will it rain before night it is totally a diurnal animal and never pretends to stir after it becomes dark the tortoise like other reptiles has an arbitrary stomach as well as lungs and can refrain from eating as well as breathing for a great part of the year when first awakened it eats nothing nor again in the autumn before it retires through the height of the summer it feeds voraciously devouring all the food that comes in it is way i was much taken with it is sagacity in discerning those that do it kind offices for as soon as the good old lady comes in sight who has waited on it for more than thirty years it hobbles toward it is benefactress with awkward alacrity but remains inattentive to strangers thus not only  the ox knows his owner and the ass his masters crib isaiah i    but the most abject reptile and torpid of beings distinguishes the hand that feeds it and is touched with the feelings of gratitude  i am etc etc ps in about three days after i left sussex the tortoise retired into the ground under the hepatica    letter xiv to the same selborne march         dear sir the more i reflect on the  of animals the more i am astonished at it is effects nor is the violence of this affection more wonderful than the shortness of it is duration thus every hen is in her turn the virago of the yard in proportion to the helplessness of her brood and will fly in the face of a dog or a sow in defense of those chickens which in a few weeks she will drive before her with relentless cruelty  this affection sublimes the passions quickens the invention and sharpens the sagacity of the brute creation thus an hen just become a mother is no longer that placid bird she used to be but with feathers standing an end wings hovering and clocking note she runs about like one possessed dams will throw themselves in the way of the greatest danger in order to avert it from their progeny thus a partridge will tumble along before a sportsman in order to draw away the dogs from her helpless covey in the time of nidification the most feeble birds will assault the most rapacious all the hirundines of a village are up in arms at the sight of an hawk whom they will persecute till he leaves that district a very exact observer has often remarked that a pair of ravens nesting in the rock of gibraltar would suffer no vulture or eagle to rest near their station but would drive them from the hill with an amazing fury even the blue thrush at the season of breeding would dart out from the clefts of the rocks to chase away the kestril or the sparrowhawk if you stand near the nest of a bird that has young she will not be induced to betray them by an inadvertent fondness but will wait about at a distance with meat in her mouth for an hour together  should i farther corroborate what i have advanced above by some anecdotes which i probably may have mentioned before in conversation yet you will i trust pardon the repetition for the sake of the illustration  the flycatcher of the zoology the stoparola of ray builds every year in the vines that grow on the walls of my house a pair of these little birds had one year inadvertently placed their nest on a naked bough perhaps in a shady time not being aware of the inconvenience that followed but an hot sunny season coming on before the brood was half fledged the reflection of the wall became insupportable and must inevitably have destroyed the tender young had not affection suggested an expedient and prompted the parentbirds to hover over the nest all the hotter hours while with wings expanded and mouths gaping for breath they screened off the heat from their suffering offspring  a farther instance i once saw of notable sagacity in a willowwren which had built in a bank in my fields this bird a friend and myself had observed as she sat in her nest but were particularly careful not to disturb her though we saw she eyed us with some degree of jealousy some days after as we passed that way we were desirous of remarking how this brood went on but no nest could be found till i happened to take up a large bundle of long green moss as it were carelessly thrown over the nest in order to dodge the eye of any impertinent intruder  a still more remarkable mixture of sagacity and instinct occurred to me one day as my people were pulling off the lining of an hotbed in order to add some fresh dung from out of the side of this bed leaped an animal with great agility that made a most grotesque figure nor was it without great difficulty that it could be taken when it proved to be a large whitebellied fieldmouse with three or four young clinging to her teats by their mouths and feet it was amazing that the desultory and rapid motions of this dam should not oblige her litter to quit their hold especially when it appeared that they were so young as to be both naked and blind  to these instances of tender attachment many more of which might be daily discovered by those that are studious of nature may be opposed that rage of affection that monstrous perversion of the  which induces some females of the brute creation to devour their young because their owners have handled them too freely or removed them from place to place swine and sometimes the more gentle race of dogs and cats are guilty of this horrid and preposterous murder when i hear now and then of an abandoned mother that destroys her offspring i am not so much amazed since reason perverted and the bad passions let loose are capable of any enormity but why the parental feelings of brutes that usually flow in one most uniform tenor should sometimes be so extravagantly diverted i leave to abler philosophers than myself to determine  i am etc  letter xv to the same selborne july        dear sir some young men went down lately to a pond on the verge of wolmerforest to hunt flappers or young wildducks many of which they caught and among the rest some very minute yet wellfledged wildfowls alive which upon examination i found to be teals i did not know till then that teals ever bred in the south of england and was much pleased with the discovery this i look upon as a great stroke in natural history  we have had ever since i can remember a pair of white owls that constantly breed under the eaves of this church as i have paid good attention to the manner of life of these birds during their season of breeding which lasts the summer through the following remarks may not perhaps be unacceptable  about an hour before sunset for then the mice begin to run they sally forth in quest of prey and hunt all round the hedges of meadows and small enclosures for them which seem to be their only food in this irregular country we can stand on an eminence and see them beat the fields over like a settingdog and often drop down in the grass or corn i have minuted these birds with my watch for an hour together and have found that they return to their nest the one or the other of them about once in five minutes reflecting at the same time on the adroitness that every animal is possessed of as far as regards the well being of itself and offspring but a piece of address which they show when they return loaded should not i think be passed over in silence  as they take their prey with their claws so they carry it in their claws to their nest but as the feet are necessary in their ascent under the tiles they constantly perch first on the roof of the chancel and shift the mouse from their claws to their bill that the feet may be at liberty to take hold of the plate on the wall as they are rising under the eaves  white owls seem not but in this i am not positive to hoot at all all that clamorous hooting appears to me to come from the wood kinds the white owl does indeed snore and hiss in a tremendous manner and these menaces well answer the intention of intimidating for i have known a whole village up in arms on such an occasion imagining the churchyard to be full of goblins and specter white owls also often scream horribly as they fly along from this screaming probably arose the common peoples imaginary species of screechowl which they superstitiously think attends the windows of dying persons the plumage of the remiges of the wings of every species of owl that i have yet examined is remarkably soft and pliant perhaps it may be necessary that the wings of these birds should not make much resistance or rushing that they may be enabled to steal through the air unheard upon a nimble and watchful quarry  while i am talking of owls it may not be improper to mention what i was told by a gentleman of the county of wilts as they were grubbing a vast hollow pollardash that had been the mansion of owls for centuries he discovered at the bottom a mass of matter that at first he could not account for after some examination he found that it was a congeries of the bones of mice and perhaps of birds and bats that had been heaping together for ages being cast up in pellets out of the crops of many generations of inhabitants for owls cast up the bones fur and feathers of what they devour after the manner of hawks he believes he told me that there were bushels of this kind of substance  when brown owls hoot their throats swell as big as an hens egg i have known an owl of this species live a full year without any water perhaps the case may be the same with all birds of prey when owls fly they stretch out their legs behind them as a balance to their large heavy heads for as most nocturnal birds have large eyes and ears they must have large heads to contain them large eyes i presume are necessary to collect every ray of light and large concave ears to command the smallest degree of sound or noise  i am etc  it will be proper to premise here that the sixteenth eighteenth twentieth and twentyfirst letters have been published already in the philosophical transactions but as nicer observation has furnished several corrections and additions it is hoped that the republication of them will not give offense especially as these sheets would be very imperfect without them and as they will be new to many readers who had no opportunity of seeing them when they made their first appearance  the hirundines are a most inoffensive harmless entertaining social and useful tribe of birds they touch no fruit in our gardens delight all except one species in attaching themselves to our houses amuse us with their migrations songs and mavelous agility and clear our outlets from the annoyances of gnats and other troublesome insects some districts in the south seas near guiaquil see ulloas travels  are desolated it seems by the infinite swarms of venomous mosquitoes which fill the air and render those coasts insupportable it would be worth inquiring whether any species of hirundines is found in those regions whoever contemplates the myriads of insects that sport in the sunbeams of a summer evening in this country will soon be convinced to what a degree our atmosphere would be choked with them was it not for the friendly interposition of the swallow tribe  many species of birds have their peculiar lice but the hirundines alone seem to be annoyed with dipterous insects which infest every species and are so large in proportion to themselves that they must be extremely irksome and injurious to them these are the hippoboscae hirundinis with narrow subulated wings abounding in every nest and are hatched by the warmth of the birds own body during incubation and crawl about under it is feathers  a species of them is familiar to horsemen in the south of england under the name of forestfly and to some of sidefly from it is running sideways like a crab it creeps under the tails and about the groins of horses which at their first coming out of the north are rendered half frantic by the tickling sensation while our own breed little regards them  the curious reaumur discovered the large eggs or rather pupae of these flies as big as the flies themselves which he hatched in his own bosom any person that will take the trouble to examine the old nests of either species of swallows may find in them the black shining cases or skins of the pupae of these insects but for other particulars too long for this place we refer the reader to l histoire d insectes of that admirable entomologist tom iv pl     letter xvi to the same selborne nov  0      dear sir in obedience to your injunctions i sit down to give you some account of the housemartin or martlet and if my monography of this little domestic and familiar bird should happen to meet with your approbation i may probably soon extend my inquiries to the rest of the british hirundines  the swallow the swift and the bankmartin  a few housemartins begin to appear about the sixteenth of april usually some few days later than the swallow for some time after they appear the hirundines in general pay no attention to the business of nidification but play and sport about either to recruit from the fatigue of their journey if they do migrate at all or else that their blood may recover it is true tone and texture after it has been so long benumbed by the severities of winter about the middle of may if the weather be fine the martin begins to think in earnest of providing a mansion for it is family the crust or shell of this nest seems to be formed of such dirt or loam as comes most readily to hand and is tempered and wrought together with little bits of broken straws to render it tough and tenacious as this bird often builds against a perpendicular wall without any projecting ledge under it requires it is utmost efforts to get the first foundation firmly fixed so that it may safely carry the superstructure on this occasion the bird not only clings with it is claws but partly supports itself by strongly inclining it is tail against the wall making that a fulcrum and thus steadied it works and plasters the materials into the face of the brick or stone but then that this work may not while it is soft and green pull itself down by it is own weight the provident architect has prudence and forbearance enough not to advance her work too fast but by building only in the morning and by dedicating the rest of the day to food and amusement gives it sufficient time to dry and harden about half an inch seems to be a sufficient layer for a day thus careful workmen when they build mudwalls informed at first perhaps by this little bird raise but a moderate layer at a time and then desist lest the work should become topheavy and so be ruined by it is own weight by this method in about ten or twelve days is formed an hemispheric nest with a small aperture toward the top strong compact and warm and perfectly fitted for all the purposes for which it was intended but then nothing is more common than for the housesparrow as soon as the shell is finished to seize on it as it is own to eject the owner and to line it after it is own manner  after so much labor is bestowed in erecting a mansion as nature seldom works in vain martins will breed on for several years together in the same nest where it happens to be well sheltered and secure from the injuries of weather the shell or crust of the nest is a sort of rusticwork full of knobs and protuberances on the outside nor is the inside of those that i have examined smoothed with any exactness at all but is rendered soft and warm and fit for incubation by a lining of small straws grasses and feathers and sometimes by a bed of moss interwoven with wool in this nest they tread or engender frequently during the time of building and the hen lays from three to five white eggs  at first when the young are hatched and are in a naked and helpless condition the parent birds with tender assiduity carry out what comes away from their young was it not for this affectionate cleanliness the nestlings would soon be burnt up and destroyed in so deep and hollow a nest by their own caustic excrement in the quadruped creation the same neat precaution is made use of particularly among dogs and cats where the dams lick away what proceeds from their young but in birds there seems to be a particular provision that the dung of nestlings is enveloped in a tough kind of jelly and therefore is the easier conveyed off without soiling or daubing yet as nature is cleanly in all her ways the young perform this office for themselves in a little time by thrusting their tails out at the aperture of their nest as the young of small birds presently arrive at their  or full growth they soon become impatient of confinement and sit all day with their heads out at the orifice where the dams by clinging to the nest supply them with food from morning to night for a time the young are fed on the wing by their parents but the feat is done by so quick and almost imperceptible a slight that a person must have attended very exactly to their motions before he would be able to perceive it as soon as the young are able to shift for themselves the dams immediately turn their thoughts to the business of a second brood while the first flight shaken off and rejected by their nurses congregate in great flocks and are the birds that are seen clustering and hovering on sunny mornings and evenings round towers and steeples and on the roofs of churches and houses these congregatings usually begin to take place about the first week in august and therefore we may conclude that by that time the first flight is pretty well over the young of this species do not quit their abodes all together but the more forward birds get abroad some days before the rest these approaching the eaves of buildings and playing about before them make people think that several old ones attend one nest they are often capricious in fixing on a nestingplace beginning many edifices and leaving them unfinished but when once a nest is completed in a sheltered place it serves for several seasons those which breed in a ready finished house get the start in hatching of those that build new by ten days or a fortnight these industrious artificers are at their labors in the long days before four in the morning when they fix their materials they plaster them on with their chins moving their heads with a quick vibratory motion they dip and wash as they fly sometimes in very hot weather but not so frequently as swallows it has been observed that martins usually build to a northeast or northwest aspect that the heat of the sun may not crack and destroy their nests but instances are also remembered where they bred for many years in vast abundance in an hot stifled innyard against a wall facing to the south  birds in general are wise in their choice of situation but in this neighborhood every summer is seen a strong proof to the contrary at an house without eaves in an exposed district where some martins build year by year in the corners of the windows but as the corners of these windows which face to the southeast and southwest are too shallow the nests are washed down every hard rain and yet these birds drudge on to no purpose from summer to summer without changing their aspect or house it is a piteous sight to see them laboring when half their nest is washed away and bringing dirt   generis lapsi sarcire ruinas thus is instinct a most wonderful unequal faculty in some instances so much above reason in other respects so far below it martins love to frequent towns especially if there are great lakes and rivers at hand nay they even affect the close air of london and i have not only seen them nesting in the borough but even in the strand and fleet street but then it was obvious from the dinginess of their aspect that their feathers partook of the filth of that sooty atmosphere martins are by far the least agile of the four species their wings and tails are short and therefore they are not capable of such surprising turns and quick and glancing evolutions as the swallow accordingly they make use of a placid easy motion in a middle region of the air seldom mounting to any great height and never sweeping long together over the surface of the ground or water they do not wander far for food but affect sheltered districts over some lake or under some hanging wood or in some hollow vale especially in windy weather they breed the latest of all the swallow kind in      they had nestlings on to october the twentyfirst and are never without unfledged young as late as michaelmas  as the summer declines the congregating flocks increase in numbers daily by the constant accession of the second broods till at last they swarm in myriads upon myriads round the villages on the thames darkening the face of the sky as they frequent the aits of that river where they roost they retire the bulk of them i mean in vast flocks together about the beginning of october but have appeared of late years in a considerable flight in this neighborhood for one day or two as late as november the third and sixth after they were supposed to have been gone for more than a fortnight they therefore withdraw with us the latest of any species unless these birds are very shortlived indeed or unless they do not return to the district where they are bred they must undergo vast devastations some how and some where for the birds that return yearly bear no manner of proportion to the birds that retire  housemartins are distinguished from their congeners by having their legs covered with soft downy feathers down to their toes they are no songsters but twitter in a pretty inward soft manner in their nests during the time of breeding they are often greatly molested with fleas  i am etc  letter xvii to the same ringmer near jews dec        dear sir i received your last favor just as i was setting out for this place and am pleased to find that my monography met with your approbation my remarks are the result of many years observation and are i trust true in the whole though i do not pretend to say that they are perfectly void of mistake or that a more nice observer might not make many additions since subjects of this kind are inexhaustible  if you think my letter worthy the notice of your respectable society you are at liberty to lay it before them and they will consider it i hope as it was intended as an humble attempt to promote a more minute inquiry into natural history into the life and conversation of animals perhaps hereafter i may be induced to take the houseswallow under consideration and from that proceed to the rest of the british hirundines  though i have now traveled the sussexdowns upwards of thirty years yet i still investigate that chain of majestic mountains with fresh admiration year by year and think i see new beauties every time i traverse it this range which runs from chichester eastward as far as eastbourn is about sixty miles in length and is called the south downs properly speaking only round jews as you pass along you command a noble view of the wild or weald on one hand and the broad downs and sea on the other mr ray used to visit a family mr courthope of danny just at the foot of these hills and was so ravished with the prospect from plumptonplain near jews that he mentions those scapes in his wisdom of god in the works of the creation with the utmost satisfaction and thinks them equal to any thing he had seen in the finest parts of europe  for my own part i think there is somewhat peculiarly sweet and amusing in the shapely figured aspect of chalkhills in preference to those of stone which are rugged broken abrupt and shapeless  perhaps i may be singular in my opinion and not so happy as to convey to you the same idea but i never contemplate these mountains without thinking i perceive somewhat analogous to growth in their gentle swellings and smooth funguslike protuberances their fluted sides and regular hollows and slopes that carry at once the air of vegetative dilation and expansion    or was there ever a time when these immense masses of calcarious matter were thrown into fermentation by some adventitious moisture were raised and leavened into such shapes by some plastic power and so made to swell and heave their broad backs into the sky so much above the less animated clay of the wild below  by what i can guess from the admeasurements of the hills that have been taken round my house i should suppose that these hills surmount the wild at an average at about the rate of five hundred feet  one thing is very remarkable as to the sheep from the westward till you get to the river adur all the flocks have horns and smooth white faces and white legs and a hornless sheep is rarely to be seen but as soon as you pass that river eastward and mount beedinghill all the flocks at once become hornless or as they call them pollsheep and have moreover black faces with a white tuft of wool on their foreheads and speckled and spotted legs so that you would think that the flocks of laban were pasturing on one side of the stream and the variegated breed of his soninlaw jacob were cantoned along on the other and this diversity holds good respectively on each side from the valley of bramber and beeding to the eastward and westward all the whole length of the downs if you talk with the shepherds on this subject they tell you that the case has been so from time immemorial and smile at your simplicity if you ask them whether the situation of these two different breeds might not be reversed however an intelligent friend of mine near chichester is determined to try the experiment and has this autumn at the hazard of being laughed at introduced a parcel of blackfaced hornless rams among his horned western ewes the blackfaced pollsheep have the shortest legs and the finest wool  as i had hardly ever before traveled these downs at so late a season of the year i was determined to keep as sharp a lookout as possible so near the southern coast with respect to the summer shortwinged birds of passage we make great inquiries concerning the withdrawing of the swallow kind without examining enough into the causes why this tribe is never to be seen in winter for enter nous the disappearing of the latter is more mavelous than that of the former and much more unaccountable the hirundines if they please are certainly capable of migration and yet no doubt are often found in a torpid state but redstarts nightingales whitethroats blackcaps etc etc are very ill provided for long flights have never been once found as i ever heard of in a torpid state and yet can never be supposed in such troops from year to year to dodge and elude the eyes of the curious and inquisitive which from day to day discern the other small birds that are known to abide our winters but notwithstanding all my care i saw nothing like a summer bird of passage and what is more strange not one wheatear though they abound so in the autumn as to be a considerable perquisite to the shepherds that take them and though many are to be seen to my knowledge all the winter through in many parts of the south of england the most intelligent shepherds tell me that some few of these birds appear on the downs in march and then withdraw to breed probably in warrens and stonequarries now and then a nest is plowed up in a fallow on the downs under a furrow but it is thought a rarity at the time of wheatharvest they begin to be taken in great numbers are sent for sale in vast quantities to brighthelmstone and tunbridge and appear at the tables of all the gentry that entertain with any degree of elegance about michaelmas they retire and are seen no more till march though these birds are when in season in great plenty on the south downs round jews yet at eastbourn which is the eastern extremity of those downs they abound much more one thing is very remarkable  that though in the height of the season so many hundreds of dozens are taken yet they never are seen to slock and it is a rare thing to see more than three or four at a time so that there must be a perpetual flitting and constant progressive succession it does not appear that any wheatears are taken to the westward of houghtonbridge which stands on the river arun  i did not fail to look particularly after my new migration of ringousels and to take notice whether they continued on the downs to this season of the year as i had formerly remarked them in the month of october all the way from chichester to jews wherever there were any shrubs and covert but not one bird of this sort came within my observation i only saw a few larks and whinchats some rooks and several kites and buzzards  about midsummer a flight of crossbills comes to the pinegroves about this house but never makes any long stay  the old tortoise that i have mentioned in a former letter still continues in this garden and retired under ground about the twentieth of november and came out again for one day on the thirtieth it lies now buried in a wet swampy border under a wall facing to the south and is enveloped at present in mud and mire  here is a large rookery round this house the inhabitants of which seem to get their livelihood very easily for they spend the greatest part of the day on their nesttrees when the weather is mild these rooks retire every evening all the winter from this rookery where they only call by the way as they are going to roost in deep woods at the dawn of day they always revisit their nesttrees and are preceded a few minutes by a flight of daws that act as it were as their harbingers  i am etc  letter xviii to the same selborne jan         dear sir the houseswallow or chimneyswallow is undoubtedly the first comer of all the british hirundines and appears in general on or about the thirteenth of april as i have remarked from many years observation not but now and then a straggler is seen much earlier and in particular when i was a boy i observed a swallow for a whole day together on a sunny warm shrove tuesday which day could not fall out later than the middle of march and often happened early in february  it is worth remarking that these birds are seen first about lakes and millponds and it is also very particular that if these early visiters happen to find frost and snow as was the case of the two dreadful springs of    0 and      they immediately withdraw for a time a circumstance this much more in favor of hiding than migration since it is much more probable that a bird should retire to it is hybernaculum just at hand than return for a week or two only to warmer latitudes  the swallow though called the chimneyswallow by no means builds altogether in chimnies but often within barns and outhouses against the rafters and so she did in virgils time  ante garrula quam tignis nidos suspendat hirundo   in sweden she builds in barns and is called ladu swala the barnswallow besides in the warmer parts of europe there are no chimnies to houses except they are englishbuilt in these countries she constructs her nest in porches and gateways and galleries and open halls  here and there a bird may affect some odd peculiar place as we have known a swallow build down the shaft of an old well through which chalk had been formerly drawn up for the purpose of manure but in general with us this hirundo breeds in chimnies and loves to haunt those stacks where there is a constant fire no doubt for the sake of warmth not that it can subsist in the immediate shaft where there is a fire but prefers one adjoining to that of the kitchen and disregards the perpetual smoke of that funnel as i have often observed with some degree of wonder  five or six or more feet down the chimney does this little bird begin to form her nest about the middle of may which consists like that of the housemartin of a crust or shell composed of dirt or mud mixed with short pieces of straw to render it tough and permanent with this difference that whereas the shell of the martin is nearly hemispheric that of the swallow is open at the top and like half a deep dish this nest is lined with fine grasses and feathers which are often collected as they float in the air  wonderful is the address which this adroit bird shows all day long in ascending and descending with security through so narrow a pass when hovering over the mouth of the funnel the vibrations of her wings acting on the confined air occasion a rumbling like thunder it is not improbable that the dam submits to this inconvenient situation so low in the shaft in order to secure her broods from rapacious birds and particularly from owls which frequently fall down chimnies perhaps in attempting to get at these nestlings  the swallow lays from four to six white eggs dotted with red specks and brings out her first brood about the last week in june or the first week in july the progressive method by which the young are introduced into life is very amusing first they emerge from the shaft with difficulty enough and often fall down into the rooms below for a day or so they are fed on the chimneytop and then are conducted to the dead leafless bough of some tree where sitting in a row they are attended with great assiduity and may then be called perchers in a day or two more they become flyers but are still unable to take their own food therefore they play about near the place where the dams are hawking for flies and when a mouthful is collected at a certain signal given the dam and the nestling advance rising toward each other and meeting at an angle the young one all the while uttering such a little quick note of gratitude and complacency that a person must have paid very little regard to the wonders of nature that has not often remarked this feat  the dam betakes herself immediately to the business of a second brood as soon as she is disengaged from her first which at once associates with the first broods of housemartins and with them congregates clustering on sunny roofs towers and trees this hirundo brings out her second brood toward the middle and end of august  all the summer long is the swallow a most instructive pattern of unwearied industry and affection for from morning to night while there is a family to be supported she spends the whole day in skimming close to the ground and exerting the most sudden turns and quick evolutions avenues and long walks under hedges and pasturefields and mown meadows where cattle graze are her delight especially if there are trees interspersed because in such spots insects most abound when a fly is taken a smart snap from her bill is heard resembling the noise at the shutting of a watchcase but the motion of the mandibles are too quick for the eye  the swallow probably the male bird is the excubitor to housemartins and other little birds announcing the approach of birds of prey for as soon as an hawk appears with a shrill alarming note he calls all the swallows and martins about him who pursue in a body and buffet and strike their enemy till they have driven him from the village darting down from above on his back and rising in a perpendicular line in perfect security this bird also will sound the alarm and strike at cats when they climb on the roofs of houses or otherwise approach the nests each species of hirundo drinks as it flies along sipping the surface of the water but the swallow alone in general washes on the wing by dropping into a pool for many times together in very hot weather housemartins and bankmartins dip and wash a little  the swallow is a delicate songster and in soft sunny weather sings both perching and flying on trees in a kind of concert and on chimney tops is also a bold flyer ranging to distant downs and commons even in windy weather which the other species seem much to dislike nay even frequenting exposed seaport towns and making little excursions over the salt water horsemen on wide downs are often closely attended by a little party of swallows for miles together which plays before and behind them sweeping around and collecting all the sculking insects that are roused by the trampling of the horses feet when the wind blows hard without this expedient they are often forced to settle to pick up their lurking prey  this species feeds much on little coleoptera as well as on gnats and flies and often settles on dug ground or paths for gravels to grind and digest it is food before they depart for some weeks to a bird they forsake houses and chimnies and roost in trees and usually withdraw about the beginning of october though some few stragglers may appear on at times till the first week in november  some few pairs haunt the new and open streets of london next the fields but do not enter like the housemartin the close and crowded parts of the city  both male and female are distinguished from their congeners by the length and forkedness of their tails they are undoubtedly the most nimble of all the species and when the male pursues the female in amorous chase they then go beyond their usual speed and exert a rapidity almost too quick for the eye to follow  after this circumstantial detail of the life and discerning  of the swallow i shall add for your farther amusement an anecdote or two not much in favor of her sagacity   a certain swallow built for two years together on the handles of a pair of gardenshears that were stuck up against the boards in an outhouse and therefore must have her nest spoiled whenever that implement was wanted and what is stranger still another bird of the same species built it is nest on the wings and body of an owl that happened by accident to hang dead and dry from the rafter of a barn this owl with the nest on it is wings and with eggs in the nest was brought as a curiosity worthy the most elegant private museum in great britain the owner struck with the oddity of the sight furnished the bringer with a large shell or conch desiring him to fix it just where the owl hung the person did as he was ordered and the following year a pair probably the same pair built their nest in the conch and laid their eggs  the owl and the conch make a strange grotesque appearance and are not the least curious specimens in that wonderful collection of art and nature sir ashton levers musaeum   thus is instinct in animals taken the least out of it is way an undistinguishing limited faculty and blind to every circumstance that does not immediately respect selfpreservation or lead at once to the propagation or support of their species  i am with all respect etc etc  letter xix to the same selborne feb         dear sir i received your favor of the eighth and am pleased to find that you read my little history of the swallow wtih your usual candor nor was i the less pleased to find that you made objections where you saw reason  as to the quotations it is difficult to say precisely which species of hirundo virgil might intend in the lines in question since the ancients did not attend to specific differences like modern naturalists yet somewhat may be gathered enough to incline me to suppose that in the two passages quoted the poet had his eye on the swallow  in the first place the epithet garrula suits the swallow well who is a great songster and not the martin which is rather a mute bird and when it sings is so inward as scarce to be heard besides if tignum in that place signifies a rafter rather than a beam as it seems to me to do then i think it must be the swallow that is alluded to and not the martin since the former does frequently build within the roof against the rafters while the latter always as far as i have been able to observe builds without the roof against eaves and cornices  as to the simile too much stress must not be laid on it yet the epithet nigra speaks plainly in favor of the swallow whose back and wings are very black while the rump of the martin is milkwhite it is back and wings blue and all it is under part white as snow nor can the clumsy motions comparatively clumsy of the martin well represent the sudden and artful evolutions and quick turns which juturna gave to her brothers chariot so as to elude the eager pursuit of the enraged aeneas the verb sonat also seems to imply a bird that is somewhat loquacious  nigra velut magnas domini cum divitis aedes pervolat et pennis alta atria lustrat hirundo pabula parva legens nidisque loquacibus escas et nunc porticibus vacuis nunc humida circum stagna sonat     we have had a very wet autumn and winter so as to raise the springs to a pitch beyond any thing since      which was a remarkable year for floods and high waters the landsprings which we call lavants break out much on the downs of sussex hampshire and wiltshire the country people say when the lavants rise corn will always be dear meaning that when the earth is so glutted with water as to send forth springs on the downs and uplands that the cornvales must be drowned and so it has proved for these ten or eleven years past for landsprings have never obtained more since the memory of man than during that period nor has there been known a greater scarcity of all sorts of grain considering the great improvements of modern husbandry such a run of wet seasons a century or two ago would i am persuaded have occasioned a famine therefore pamphlets and newspaper letters that talk of combinations tend to inflame and mislead since we must not expect plenty till providence sends us more favorable seasons  the wheat of last year all round this district and in the county of rutland and elsewhere yields remarkably bad and our wheat on the ground by the continual late sudden vicissitudes from fierce frost to pouring rains looks poorly and the turnips rot very fast  i am etc  letter xx to the same selborne feb         dear sir the sandmartin or bankmartin is by much the least of any of the british hirundines and as far as we have ever seen the smallest known hirundo though brisson asserts that there is one much smaller and that is the hirundo esculenta  but it is much to be regretted that it is scarce possible for any observer to be so full and exact as he could wish in reciting the circumstances attending the life and conversation of this little bird since it is fera natura at least in this part of the kingdom disclaiming all domestic attachments and haunting wild heaths and commons where there are large lakes while the other species especially the swallow and housemartin are remarkably gentle and domesticated and never seem to think themselves safe but under the protection of man  here are in this parish in the sandpits and banks of the lakes of woolmerforest several colonies of these birds and yet they are never seen in the village nor do they at all frequent the cottages that are scattered about in that wild district the only instance i ever remember where this species haunts any building is at the town of bishops waltham in this county where many sandmartins nestle and breed in the scaffoldholes of the backwall of william of wykehams stables but then this wall stands in a very sequestered and retired enclosure and faces upon a large and beautiful lake and indeed this species seems so to delight in large waters that no instance occurs of their abounding but near vast pools or rivers and in particular it has been remarked that they swarm in the banks of the thames in some places below london bridge  it is curious to observe with what different degrees of architectonic skill providence has endowed birds of the same genus and so nearly correspondent in their general mode of life for while the swallow and the housemartin discover the greatest address in raising and securely fixing crusts or shells of loam as cunabula for their young the bankmartin terebrates a round and regular hole in the sand or earth which is serpentine horizontal and about two feet deep at the inner end of this burrow does this bird deposit in a good degree of safety her rude nest consisting of fine grasses and feathers usually goosefeathers very inartificially laid together  perseverance will accomplish any thing though at first one would be disinclined to believe that this weak bird with her soft and tender bill and claws should ever be able to bore the stubborn sandbank without entirely disabling herself yet with these feeble instruments have i seen a pair of them make great dispatch and could remark how much they had scooped that day by the fresh sand which ran down the bank and was of a different color from that which lay loose and bleached in the sun  in what space of time these little artists are able to mine and finish these cavities i have never been able to discover for reasons given above but it would be a matter worthy of observation where it falls in the way of any naturalist to make his remarks this i have often taken notice of that several holes of different depths are left unfinished at the end of summer to imagine that these beginnings were intentionally made in order to be in the greater forwardness for next spring is allowing perhaps too much foresight and rerum prudentia to a simple bird may not the cause of these latebrae being left unfinished arise from their meeting in those places with strata too harsh hard and solid for their purpose which they relinquish and go to a fresh spot that works more freely or may they not in other places fall in with a soil as much too loose and mouldering liable to flounder and threatening to overwhelm them and their labors  one thing is remarkable  that after some years the old holes are forsaken and new ones bored perhaps because the old habitations grow foul and fetid from long use or because they may so abound with fleas as to become untenantable this species of swallow moreover is strangely annoyed with fleas and we have seen fleas bedfleas  pulex irritans swarming at the mouths of these holes like bees on the stools of their hives  the following circumstance should by no means be omitted  that these birds do not make use of their caverns by way of hybernacula as might be expected since banks so perforated have been dug out with care in the winter when nothing was found but empty nests  the sandmartin arrives much about the same time with the swallow and lays as she does from four to six white eggs but as this species is cryptogame carrying on the business of nidification incubation and the support of it is young in the dark it would not be so easy to ascertain the time of breeding were it not for the coming forth of the broods which appear much about the time or rather somewhat earlier than those of the swallow the nestlings are supported in common like those of their congeners with gnats and other small insects and sometimes they are fed with libellulae dragonflies almost as long as themselves in the last week in june we have seen a row of these sitting on a rail near a great pool as perchers and so young and helpless as easily to be taken by hand but whether the dams ever feed them on the wing as swallows and housemartins do we have never yet been able to determine nor do we know whether they pursue and attack birds of prey  when they happen to breed near hedges and enclosures they are dispossessed of their breeding holes by the housesparrow which is on the same account a fell adversary to housemartins  these hirundines are no songsters but rather mute making only a little harsh noise when a person approaches their nests they seem not to be of a sociable turn never with us congregating with their congeners in the autumn undoubtedly they breed a second time like the housemartin and swallow and withdraw about michaelmas  though in some particular districts they may happen to abound yet in the whole in the south of england at least is this much the rarest species for there are few towns or large villages but what abound with housemartins few churches towers or steeples but what are haunted by some swifts scarce a hamlet or single cottagechimney that has not it is swallow while the bankmartins scattered here and there live a sequestered life among some abrupt sandhills and in the banks of some few rivers  these birds have a peculiar manner of flying flitting about with odd jerks and vacillations not unlike the motions of a butterfly doubtless the flight of all hirundines is influenced by and adapted to the peculiar sort of insects which furnish their food hence it would be worth inquiry to examine what particular genus of insects affords the principal food of each respective species of swallow  notwithstanding what has been advanced above some few sandmartins i see haunt the skirts of london frequenting the dirty pools in saint georgesfields and about whitechapel the question is where these build since there are no banks or bold shores in that neighborhood perhaps they nestle in the scaffold holes of some old or new deserted building they dip and wash as they fly sometimes like the housemartin and swallow  sandmartins differ from their congeners in the diminutiveness of their size and in their color which is what is usually called a mousecolour near valencia in spain they are taken says willughby and sold in the markets for the table and are called by the country people probably from their desultory jerking manner of flight papilion de montagna  letter xxi to the same selborne sept         dear sir as the swift or blackmartin is the largest of the british hirundines so is it undoubtedly the latest comer for i remember but one instance of it is appearing before the last week in april and in some of our late frosty harsh springs it has not been seen till the beginning of may this species usually arrives in pairs  the swift like the sandmartin is very defective in architecture making no crust or shell for it is nest but forming it of dry grasses and feathers very rudely and inartificially put together with all my attention to these birds i have never been able once to discover one in the act of collecting or carrying in materials so that i have suspected since their nests are exactly the same that they sometimes usurp upon the housesparrows and expel them as sparrows do the house and sandmartin well remembering that i have seen them squabbling together at the entrance of their holes and the sparrows up in arms and muchdisconcerted at these intruders and yet i am assured by a nice observer in such matters that they do collect feathers for their nests in andalusia and that he has shot them with such materials in their mouths  swifts like sandmartins carry on the business of nidification quite in the dark in crannies of castles and towers and steeples and upon the tops of the walls of churches under the roof and therefore cannot be so narrowly watched as those species that build more openly but from what i could ever observe they begin nesting about the middle of may and i have remarked from eggs taken that they have sat hard by the ninth of june in general they haunt tall buildings churches and steeples and breed only in such yet in this village some pairs frequent the lowest and meanest cottages and educate their young under those thatched roofs we remember but one instance where they breed out of buildings and that is in the sides of a deep chalkpit near the town of odiham in this county where we have seen many pairs entering the crevices and skimming and squeaking round the precipices  as i have regarded these amusive birds with no small attention if i should advance something new and peculiar with respect to them and different from all other birds i might perhaps be credited especially as my assertion is the result of many years exact observation the fact that i would advance is that swifts tread or copulate on the wing and i would wish any nice observer that is startled at this supposition to use his own eyes and i think he will soon be convinced in another class of animals viz the insect nothing is so common as to see the different species of many genera in conjunction as they fly the swift is almost continually on the wing and as it never settles on the ground on trees or roofs would seldom find opportunity for amorous rites was it not enabled to indulge them in the air if any person would watch these birds of a fine morning in may as they are sailing round at a great height from the ground he would see every now and then one drop on the back of another and both of them sink down together for many fathoms with a loud piercing shriek this i take to be the juncture when the business of generation is carrying on  as the swift eats drinks collects materials for it is nest and as it seems propagates on the wing it appears to live more in the air than any other bird and to perform all functions there save those of sleeping and incubation  this hirundo differs widely from it is congeners in laying invariably but two eggs at a time which are milkwhite long and peaked at the small end whereas the other species lay at each brood from four to six it is a most alert bird rising very early and retiring to roost very late and is on the wing in the height of summer at least sixteen hours in the longest days it does not withdraw to rest till a quarter before nine in the evening being the latest of all day birds just before they retire whole groups of them assemble high in the air and squeak and shoot about with wonderful rapidity but this bird is never so much alive as in sultry thundry weather when it expresses great alacrity and calls forth all it is powers in hot mornings several getting together in little parties dash round the steeples and churches squeaking as they go in a very clamorous manner these by nice observers are supposed to be males serenading their sitting hens and not without reason since they seldom squeak till they come close to the walls or eaves and since those within utter at the same time a little inward note of complacency  when the hen has sat hard all day she rushes forth just as it is almost dark and stretches and relieves her weary limbs and snatches a scanty meal for a few minutes and then returns to her duty of incubation swifts when wantonly and cruelly shot while they have young discover a little lump of insects in their mouths which they pouch and hold under their tongue in general they feed in a much higher district than the other species a proof that gnats and other insects do also abound to a considerable height in the air they also range to vast distances since locomotion is no labor to them who are endowed with such wonderful powers of wing their powers seem to be in proportion to their leavers and their wings are longer in proportion than those of almost any other bird when they mute or case themselves in flight they raise their wings and make them meet over their backs  at some certain times in the summer i had remarked that swifts were hawking very low for hours together over pools and streams and could not help inquiring into the object of their pursuit that induced them to descend so much below their usual range after some trouble i sound that they were taking phryganeae ephemerae and libellulae cadewflies mayflies and dragonflies that were just emerged out of their aurelia state i then no longer wondered that they should be so willing to stoop for a prey that afforded them such plentiful and succulent nourishment  they bring out their young about the middle or latter end of july but as these never become perchers nor that ever i could discern are fed on the wing by their dams the coming forth of the young is not so notorious as in the other species  on the thirtieth of last june i untiled the eaves of an house where many pairs build and found in each nest only two squab naked pulli on the eighth of july i repeated the same inquiry and found they had made very little progress toward a fledged state but were still naked and helpless from whence we may conclude that birds whose way of life keeps them perpetually on the wing would not be able to quit their nest till the end of the month swallows and martins that have numerous families are continually feeding them every two or three minutes while swifts that have but two young to maintain are much at their leisure and do not attend on their nests for hours together  sometimes they pursue and strike at hawks that come in their way but not with that vehemence and fury that swallows express on the same occasion they are out all day long in wet days feeding about and disregarding still rain from whence two things may be gathered first that many insects abide high in the air even in rain and next that the feathers of these birds must be well preened to resist so much wet windy and particularly windy weather with heavy showers they dislike and on such days withdraw and are scarce ever seen  there is a circumstance respecting the color of swifts which seems not to be unworthy our attention when they arrive in the spring they are all over of a glossy dark sootcolour except their chins which are white but by being all day long in the sun and air they become quite weatherbeaten and bleached before they depart and yet they return glossy again in the spring now if they pursue the sun into lower latitudes as some suppose in order to enjoy a perpetual summer why do they not return bleached do they not rather perhaps retire to rest for a season and at that juncture moult and change their feathers since all other birds are known to moult soon after the season of breeding  swifts are very anomalous in many particulars dissenting from all their congeners not only in the number of their young but in breeding but once in a summer whereas all the other british hirundines breed invariably twice it is past all doubt that swifts can breed but once since they withdraw in a short time after the flight of their young and some time before their congeners bring out their second broods we may here remark that as swifts breed but once in a summer and only two at a time and the other hirundines twice the latter who lay from four to six eggs increase at an average five times as fast as the former  but in nothing are swifts more singular than in their early retreat they retire as to the main body of them by the tenth of august and sometimes a few days sooner and every straggler invariably withdraws by the twentieth while their congeners all of them stay till the beginning of october many of them all through that month and some occasionally to the beginning of november this early retreat is mysterious and wonderful since that time is often the sweetest season in the year but what is more extraordinary they begin to retire still earlier in the most southerly parts of andalusia where they can be no ways influenced by any defect of heat or as one might suppose defect of food are they regulated in their motions with us by a failure of sood or by a propensity to moulting or by a disposition to rest after so rapid a life or by what this is one of those incidents in natural history that not only baffles our searches but almost eludes our guesses  these hirundines never perch on trees or roofs and so never congregate with their congeners they are fearless while haunting their nesting places and are not to be scared with a gun and are often beaten down with poles and cudgels as they stoop to go under the eaves swifts are much infested with those pests to the genus called hippoboscae hirundinis and often wriggle and scratch themselves in their flight to get rid of that clinging annoyance  swifts are no songsters and have only one harsh screaming note yet there are ears to which it is not displeasing from an agreeable association of ideas since that note never occurs but in the most lovely summer weather  they never settle on the ground but through accident and when down can hardly rise on account of the shortness of their legs and the length of their wings neither can they walk but only crawl but they have a strong grasp with their feet by which they cling to walls their bodies being flat they can enter a very narrow crevice and where they cannot pass on their bellies they will turn up edgewise  the particular formation of the foot discriminates the swift from all the british hirundines and indeed from all other known birds the hirundo melba or great whitebellied swift of gibraltar excepted for it is so disposed as to carry  omnes quatuor digitos anticos all it is four toes forward besides the least toe which should be the backtoe consists of one bone alone and the other three only of two apiece a construction most rare and peculiar but nicely adapted to the purposes in which their feet are employed this and some peculiarities attending the nostrils and under mandible have induced a discerning john antony scopoli of carniola md naturalist to suppose that this species might constitute a genus per se  in london a party of swifts frequents the tower playing and feeding over the river just below the bridge others haunt some of the churches of the borough next the fields but do not venture like the housemartin into the close crowded part of the town  the swedes have bestowed a very pertinent name on this swallow calling it ring swala from the perpetual rings or circles that it takes round the scene of it is nidification  swifts feed on coleoptera or small beetles with hard cases over their wings as well as on the softer insects but it does not appear how they can procure gravel to grind their food as swallows do since they never settle on the ground young ones overrun with hippoboscae are sometimes found under their nests fallen to the ground the number of vermin rendering their abode insupportable any longer they frequent in this village several abject cottages yet a succession still haunts the same unlikely roofs a good proof this that the same birds return to the same spots as they must stoop very low to get up under these humble eaves cats lie in wait and sometimes catch them on the wing  on the fifth of july      i again untiled part of a roof over the nest of a swift the dam sat in the nest but so strongly was she affected by natural  for her brood which she supposed to be in danger that regardless of her own safety she would not stir but lay sullenly by them permitting herself to be taken in hand the squab young we brought down and placed on the grassplot where they tumbled about and were as helpless as a newborn child while we contemplated their naked bodies their unwieldy disproportioned abdomina and their heads too heavy for their necks to support we could not but wonder when we reflected that these shiftless beings in a little more than a fortnight would be able to dash through the air almost with the inconceivable swiftness of a meteor and perhaps in their emigration must traverse vast continents and oceans as distant as the equator so soon does nature advance small birds to their  or state of perfection while the progressive growth of men and large quadrupeds is slow and tedious  i am etc  letter xxii to

pleasure in contemplating the address with which this feat was performed to a considerable depth in the chimney was somewhat interrupted by apprehensions lest my eyes might undergo the same fate with those of tobit tobit    0   perhaps it may be some amusement to you to hear at what times the different species of hirundines arrived this spring in three very distant counties of this kingdom with us

says that hawks  paciscuntur inducias cum avibus quamdiu cuculus cuculat but it appears to me that during that period many little birds are taken and destroyed by birds of prey as may be seen by their

the defense of his family but once i observed in my garden that several magpies came determined to storm the nest of a misselthrush the dams defended their mansion with great vigor and fought resolutely pro aris and focis but numbers at last prevailed they tore the nest to pieces and swallowed the young alive  in the season of nidification the wildest birds are comparatively tame thus the ringdove breeds in my fields though they are continually frequented and the misselthrush though most shy and wild in the autumn and winter builds in my garden close to a walk where people are passing

shut out   letter xxiii to the same selborne june        dear sir on september the   st      being then on a visit and intent on fielddiversions i rose before daybreak when i came into the enclofures i found the stubbles and clovergrounds matted all over with a thick coat of cobweb in the meshes of which a copious and heavy dew hung so plentifully that the whole face of the country seemed as it were covered with two or three settingnets drawn one over another when the dogs attempted to hunt their eyes were so blinded and hoodwinked that they could not proceed but were obliged to lie down and scrape the encumbrances from their faces with their forefeet so that finding my sport interrupted i returned home musing in my mind on the oddness of the occurrence  as the morning advanced the sun became bright and warm and the day turned out one of those most lovely ones which no season but the autumn produces cloudless calm serene and worthy of the south of france itself  about nine an appearance very unusual began to demand our attention a shower of cobwebs falling from very elevated regions and continuing without any interruption till the close of the day these webs were not single filmy threads floating in the air in all directions but perfect flakes or rags some near an inch broad and five or six long which fell with a degree of velocity that showed they were considerably heavier than the atmosphere  on every side as the observer turned his eyes might he behold a continual succession of fresh flakes falling into his sight and twinkling like stars as they turned their sides toward the sun  how far this wonderful shower extended would be difficult to say but we know that it reached bradley selborne and alresford three places which lie in a sort of a triangle the shortest of whose sides is about eight miles in extent  at the second of those places there was a gentleman for whose veracity and intelligent turn we have the greatest veneration who observed it the moment he got abroad but concluded that as soon as he came upon the hill above his house where he took his morning rides he should be higher than this meteor which he imagined might have been blown like thistledown from the common above but to his great astonishment when he rode to the most elevated part of the down  00 feet above his fields he found the webs in appearance still

observed but on this day the flakes hung in the trees and hedges so thick that a diligent person sent out might have gathered baskets full  the remark that i shall make on these cobweblike appearances called gossamer is that strange and superstitious as the notions about them were formerly nobody in these days doubts but that they are the real production of small spiders which swarm in the fields in fine weather in autumn and have a power of shooting out webs from their tails so as to render themselves buoyant and lighter than air but why these apterous insects should that day take such a wonderful aerial excursino and why their webs should at once become so gross and material as to be considerably more weighty than air and to descend with precipitation is a matter beyond my skill if i might be allowed to hazard a supposition i should imagine that those filmy threads when first shot might be entangled in the rising dew and so drawn up spiders and all by a brisk evaporation into the regions where clouds are formed and if the spiders have a power of coiling and thickening their webs in the air as dr lister says they have see his letters to mr ray then when they were become heavier than the air they must fall  every day in fine weather in autumn chiefly do i see those spiders shooting out their webs and mounting aloft they will go off from your finger if you will take them into your hand last summer one alighted on my book as i was reading in the parlour and running to the top of the page and shooting out a web took it is departure from thence but what i most wondered at was that it went off with considerable velocity in a place where no air was stirring and i am sure that i did not assist it with my breath so that these little crawlers seem to have while mounting some locomotive power without the use of wings and to move in the air faster than the air itself  letter xxiv to the same selborne aug         dear sir there is a wonderful spirit of sociality in the brute creation independent of sexual attachment the congregating of gregarious birds in the winter is a remarkable instance  many horses though quiet with company will not stay one minute in a field by themselves the strongest fences cannot restrain them my neighbors horse will not only not stay by himself abroad but he will not bear to be left alone in a strange stable without discovering the utmost impatience and endeavoring to break the rack and manger with his fore feet he has been known to leap out at a stablewindow through which dung was thrown after company and yet in other respects is remarkably quiet oxen and cows will not fatten by themselves but will neglect the finest pasture that is not recommended by society it would be needless to instance in sheep which constantly flock together  but this propensity seems not to be confined to animals of the same species for we know a do still alive that was brought up from a little sawn with a dairy of cows with them it goes afield and with them it returns to the yard the dogs of the house take no notice of this deer being used to her but if strange dogs come by a chase ensues while the master smiles to see his favorite securely leading her pursuers over hedge or gate or style till she returns to the cows who with fierce lowings and menacing horns drive the assailants quite out of the pasture  even great disparity of kind and size does not always prevent social advances and mutual fellowship for a very intelligent and observant person has assured me that in the former part of his life keeping but one horse he happened also on a time to have but one solitary hen these two incongruous animals spent much of their time together in a lonely orchard where they saw no creature but each other by degrees an apparent regard began to take place between these two sequestered individuals the fowl would approach the quadruped with notes of complacency rubbing herself gently against his legs while the horse would look down with satisfaction and move with the greatest caution and circumspection lest he should trample on his dimunitive companion thus by mutual good offices each seemed to console the vacant hours of the other

year one of these tribes calls itself by the noble name of stanley of which i have nothing particular to say but the other is distinguished by an appellative somewhat remarkable  as far as their harsh gibberish can be understood they seem to say that the name of their clan is curleople now the termination of this word is apparently grecian and as mezeray and the gravest historians all agree that these vagrants did certainly migrate from egypt and the east two or three centuries ago and so spread by degrees over europe may not this familyname a little corrupted be the very name they brought with them from the levant it would be matter of some curiosity could one meet with an intelligent person among them to inquire whether in their jargon they still retain any greek words the greek radicals will appear in hand foot head water earth etc it is possible that amidst their cant and corrupted dialect many mutilated remains of their native language might still be discovered  with regard to those peculiar people the gypsies one thing is very remarkable and especially as they came from warmer climates and that is that while other beggars lodge in barns stables and cowhouses these sturdy savages seem to pride themselves in braving the severities of winter and in living sub dio the whole year round last september was as wet a month as ever was known and yet during those deluges did a young gypsygirl liein in the midst of one of our hopgardens on the cold ground with nothing over her but a piece of a blanket extended on a few hazelrods bent hoop fashion and stuck into

 letter xxvi to the same selborne nov        dear sir hic  taedae pingues hic plurimus ignis semper et assidua posts fuligine nigri  i shall make no apology for troubling you with the detail of a very simple piece of domestic economy being satisfied that you think nothing beneath your attention that tends to utility the matter alluded to is the use of rushes instead of candles which i am well aware prevails in many districts besides this but as i know there are countries also where it does not obtain and as i have considered the subject with some degree of exactness i shall proceed in my humble story and leave you to judge of the expediency  the proper species of rush for this purpose seems to be the juncus effusus or common soft rush which is to be found in most moist pastures by the sides of streams and under hedges these rushes are in best condition in the height of summer but may be gathered so as to serve the purpose well quite on to autumn it would be needless to add that the largest and longest are best decayed laborers women and children make it their business to procure and prepare them as soon as they are cut they must be flung into water and kept there for otherwise they will dry and shrink and the peel will not run at first a person would find it no easy matter to divest a rush of it is peel or rind so as to leave one regular narrow even rib from top to bottom that may support the pith but this like other feats soon becomes familiar even to children and we have seen an old woman stoneblind performing this business with great dispatch and seldom failing to strip them with the nicest regularity when these junci are thus far prepared they must lie out on the grass to be bleached and take the dew for some nights and afterward be dried in the sun  some address is required in dipping these rushes in the scalding fat or grease but this knack also is to be attained by practice the careful wife of an industrious hampshire labourer obtains all her fat for nothing for she saves the scummings of her baconpot for this use and if the grease abounds with salt she causes the salt to precipitate to the bottom by setting the scummings in a warm oven where hogs are not much in use and especially by the seaside the coarser animaloils will come very cheap a pound of common grease may be procured for four pence and about six pounds of grease will dip a pound of rushes and one pound of rushes may be bought for one shilling so that a pound of rushes medicated and ready for use will cost three shillings if men that keep bees will mix a little wax with the grease it will give it a consistency and render it more cleanly and make the rushes burn longer muttonsuet would have the same effect  a good rush which measured in length two feet four inches and an half being minuted burnt only three minutes short of an hour and a rush still of greater length has been known to burn one hour and a quarter  these rushes give a good clear light watchlights coated with tallow it is true shed a dismal one darkness visible but then the wick of those have two ribs of the rind or peel to support the pith while the wick of the dipped rush has but one the two ribs are intended to impede the progress of the flame and make the candle last  in a pound of dry rushes avoirdupois which i caused to be weighed and numbered we found upwards of one thousand six hundred individuals now suppose each of these burns one with another only half an hour then a poor man will purchase eight hundred hours of light a time exceeding thirtythree entire days for three shillings according to this account each rush before dipping costs     of a farthing and     afterward thus a poor family will enjoy   hours of comfortable light for a farthing an experienced old housekeeper assures me that one pound and an half of rushes completely supplies his family the year round since working people burn no candle in the long days because they rise and go to bed by daylight  little farmers use rushes much in the short days both morning and evening in the dairy and kitchen but the very poor who are always the worst oeconomists and therefore must continue very poor buy an halfpenny candle every evening which in their blowing open rooms does not burn much more than two hours thus have they only two hours light for their money instead of eleven  while on the subject of rural economy it may not be improper to mention a pretty implement of housewifery that we have seen no where else that is little neat besoms which our foresters make from the stalks of the polytricum commune or great golden maidenhair which they call silkwood and find plenty in the bogs when this moss is well combed and dressed and divested of it is outer skin it becomes of a beautiful brightchesnut color and being soft and pliant is very proper for the dusting of beds curtains carpets hangings etc if these besoms were known to the brushmakers in town it is probable they might come much in use for the purpose abovementioned a besom of this sort is to be seen in sir ashton levers museum   i am etc  letter xxvii to the same selborne dec         dear sir we had in this village more than twenty years ago an idiot boy whom i well remember who from a child showed a strong propensity to bees they were his food his amusement his sole object and as people of this cast have seldom more than one point in view so this lad exerted all his few faculties on this one pursuit in the winter he dosed away his time within his fathers house by the fire side in a kind of torpid state seldom departing from the chimneycorner but in the summer he was all alert and in quest of his game in the fields and on sunny banks honeybees humblebees and wasps were his prey wherever he found them he had no apprehensions from their stings but would seize seize them nudis manibus and at once disarm them of their weapons and suck their bodies for the sake of their honeybags sometimes he would fill his bosom between his shirt and his skin with a number of these captives and sometimes would confine them in bottles he was a very merops apiaster or beebird and very injurious to men that kept bees for he would slide into their beegardens and sitting down before the stools would rap with his finger on the hives and so take the bees as they came out he has been known to overturn hives for the sake of honey of which he was passionately fond where metheglin was making he would linger round the tubs and vessels begging a draught of what he called beewine as he ran about he used to make a humming noise with his lips resembling the buzzing of bees this lad was lean and sallow and of a cadaverous complexion and except in his favorite pursuit in which he was wonderfully adroit discovered no manner of understanding had his capacity been better and directed to the same object he had perhaps abated much of our wonder at the feats of a more modern exhibiter of bees and we may justly say of

growing up with us at a time when they take the fastest hold and make the most lasting impressions become so interwoven into our very constitutions that the strongest good sense is required to disengage ourselves from them no wonder therefore that the lower people retain them their whole lives through since their minds are not invigorated by a liberal education and therefore not enabled to make any efforts adequate to the occasion  such a preamble seems to be necessary before we enter on the superstitions of this district lest we should be suspected of exaggeration in a recital of practices too gross for this enlightened age  but the people of tring in hertfordshire would do well to remember that no longer ago than the year      and within twenty miles of the capital they seized on two superannuated wretches crazed with age and overwhelmed with infirmities on a suspicion of witchcraft and by trying experiments drowned them in a horsepond  in a farmyard near the middle of this village stands at this day a row of pollardashes which by the seams and long cicatrices down their sides manifestly show that in former times they have been cleft asunder these trees when young and flexible were severed and held open by wedges while ruptured children stripped naked were pushed through the apertures under a persuasion that by such a process the poor babes would be cured of their infirmity as soon as the operation was over the tree in the suffering part was plastered with loam and carefully swathed up if the parts coalesced and soldered together as usually fell out

garden not long since i cut down two or three such trees one of which did not grow together  we have several persons now living in the village who in their childhood were supposed to be healed by this superstitious ceremony derived down perhaps from our saxon ancestors who practiced it before their conversion to christianity  at the south corner of the plestor or area near the church there stood about twentyyears ago a very old grotesque hollow pollardash which for ages had been looked on with no small veneration as a shrewash now a shrewash is an ash whose twigs or branches when gently applied to the limbs of cattle will immediately relieve the pains which a beast suffers from the running of a shrewmouse over the part affected for it is supposed that a shrewmouse is of so baneful and deleterious a nature that wherever it creeps over a beast be it horse cow or sheep the suffering animal is afflicted with cruel anguish and threatened with the loss of the use of the limb against this accident to which they were continually liable our provident forefathers always kept a shrewash at hand which when once medicated would maintain it is virtue for ever a shrewash was made thus for a similar practice see plots staffordshire   into the body of the tree a deep hole was bored with an auger and a poor devoted shrewmouse was thrust in alive and plugged in no doubt with several quaint incantations long since forgotten as the ceremonies necessary for such a consecration are no longer understood all succession is at an end and no such tree is known to subsist in the manor or hundred

trees are perfect alembics and no one that has not attended to such matters can imagine how much water one tree will distill in a nights time by condensing the vapor which trickles down the twigs and boughs so as to make the ground below quite in a float in newtonlane in october      on a misty day a particular oak in leaf dropped so fast that the cartway stood in puddles and the ruts ran with water though the ground in general was dusty  in some of our smaller islands in the west indies if i mistake not there are no springs or rivers but the people are supplied with that necessary element water merely by the dripping of some large tall trees which standing in the bosom of a mountain keep their heads constantly enveloped with fogs and clouds from which they dispense their kindly neverceasing moisture and so render those districts habitable by condensation alone  trees in leaf have such a vast proportion more of surface than those that are naked that in theory their condensations should greatly exceeed those that are stripped of their leaves but as the former imbibe also a great quantity of moisture it is difficult to say which drip most but this i know that deciduous trees that are entwined with much ivy seem to distill the greatest quantity ivyleaves are smooth and thick and cold and therefore condense very fast and besides evergreens imbibe very little these facts may furnish the intelligent with hints concerning what sorts of trees they should plant round small ponds that they would wish to be perennial and show them how advantageous some trees are in preference to others  trees perspire profusely condense largely and check evaporation so much that woods are always moist no wonder therefore that they contribute much to pools and streams  that trees are great promoters of lakes and rivers appears from a well known fact in north america for since the woods and forests have been grubbed and cleared all bodies of water are much diminished so that some streams that were very considerable a century ago will not now drive a common mill vide kalms travels to north america  besides most woodlands forests and chases with us abound with pools and morasses no doubt for the reason given above  to a thinking mind few phenomena are more strange than the state of little ponds on the summits of chalkhills many of which are never dry in the most trying droughts of summer on chalkhills i say because in many rocky and gravelly soils springs usually break out pretty high on the sides of elevated grounds and mountains but no person acquainted with chalky districts will allow that they ever saw springs in such a soil but in valleys and bottoms since the waters of so pervious a stratum as chalk all lie on one dead level as welldiggers have assured me again and again  now we have many such little round ponds in this district and one in particular on our sheepdown three hundred feet above my house which though never above three feet deep in the middle and not more than thirty feet in diameter and containing perhaps not more than two or three hundred hogsheads of water yet never is known to fail though it affords drink for three hundred or four hundred sheep and for at least twenty head of large cattle beside this pond it is true is overhung with two moderate beeches that doubtless at times afford it much supply but then we have others as small that without the aid of trees and in spite of evaporation from sun and wind and perpetual consumption by cattle yet constantly maintain a moderate share of water without overflowing in the wettest seasons as they would do if supplied by springs by my journal of may      it appears that the small and even considerable ponds in the vales are now dried up while the small ponds on the very tops of hills are but little affected can this difference be accounted for from evaporation alone which certainly is more prevalent in bottoms or rather have not those elevated pools some unnoticed recruits which in the night time counterbalance the waste of the day without which the cattle alone must soon exhaust them and here it will be necessary to enter more minutely into the cause dr hales in his vegetable statics advances from experiment that the moister the earth is the more dew falls on it in a night and more than a double quantity of dew falls on a surface of water than there does on an equal surface of moist earth hence we see that water by it is coolness is enabled to assimilate to itself a large quantity of moisture nightly by condensation and that the air when loaded with fogs and vapors and even with copious dews can alone advance a considerable and neverfailing resource persons that are much abroad and travel early and late such as shepherds fishermen etc can tell what prodigious fogs prevail in the night on elevated downs even in the hottest parts of summer and how much the surfaces of things are drenched by those swimming vapors though to the senses all the while little moisture seems to fall  i am etc  letter xxx to the same selborne april        dear sir monsieur herissant a french anatomist seems persuaded that he has discovered the reason why cuckoos do not hatch their own eggs the impediment he supposes arises from the internal structure of their parts which incapacitates them for incubation according to this gentleman the crop or craw of a cuckoo does not lie before the sternum at the bottom of the neck as in the gallinae columbae etc but immediately behind it on and over the bowels so as to make a large protuberance in the belly histoire de lacademie royale        induced by this assertion we procured a cuckoo and cutting open the breast bone and exposing the intestines to sight found the crop lying as mentioned above this stomach was large and round and stuffed hard like a pincushion with food which upon nice examination we found to consist of various insects such as small scarabs spiders and dragonflies the last of which we have seen cuckoos catching on the wing as they were just emerging out of the aurelia state among this farrago also were to be seen maggots and many seeds which belonged either to gooseberries currants cranberries or some such fruit so that these birds apparently subsist on insects and fruits nor was there the least appearance of bones feathers or fur to support the idle notion of their being birds of prey  the sternum in this bird seemed to us to be remarkably short between which and the anus lay the crop or craw and immediately behind that the bowels against the backbone  it must be allowed as this anatomist observes that the crop placed just upon the bowels must especially when full be in a very uneasy situation during the business of incubation yet the test will be to examine whether birds that are actually known to sit for certain are not formed in a similar manner this inquiry i proposed to myself to make with a fernowl or goatsucker as soon as opportunity offered because if their formation proves the same the reason for incapacity in the cuckoo will be allowed to have been taken up somewhat hastily  not long after a fernowl was procured which from it is habit and shape we suspected might resemble the cuckoo in it is internal construction nor were our suspicions illgrounded for upon the dissection the crop or craw also lay behind the sternum immediately on the viscera between them and the skin of the belly it was bulky and stuffed hard with large phalaenae moths of several sorts and their eggs which no doubt had been forced out of those insects by the action of swallowing  now as it appears that this bird which is so well known to practice incubation is formed in a similar manner with cuckoos monsieur herissants conjecture that cuckoos are incapable of incubation from the disposition of their intestines seems to fall to the ground and we are still at a loss for the cause of that strange and singular peculiarity in the instance of the cuculus canorus  we found the case to be the same with the ringtail hawk in respect to formation and as far as i can recollect with the swift and probably it is so with many more sorts of birds that are not granivorous  i am etc  letter xxxi to the same selborne april         dear sir on august the  th      we surprised a large viper which seemed very heavy and bloated as it lay in

fullgrown earthworms this little fry issued into the world with the true viperspirit about them showing great alertness as soon as disengaged from the belly of the dam they twisted and wriggled about and set themselves up and gaped very wide when touched with a stick showing manifest tokens of menace and defiance though as yet they had no manner of fangs that we could find even with the help of our glasses  to a thinking mind nothing is more wonderful than that early instinct which impresses young animals with the notion of the situation of their natural weapons and of using them properly in their own defense even before those weapons subsist or are formed thus a young cock will spar at his adversary before his spurs are grown and a calf or a lamb will push with their heads before their horns are sprouted in the same manner did these young adders attempt to bite before their fangs were in being the dam however was furnished with very formidable ones which we lifted up for they fold down when not used and cut them off with the point of our scissars  there was little room to suppose that this brood had ever been in the open air before and that they were taken in for refuge at the mouth of the dam when she perceived that danger was approaching because then probably we should have found them somewhere in the neck and not in the abdomen  letter xxxii to the same castration has a

lonely state may be attached to each other from a spirit of sociality in this it may not be amiss to recount a different motive which has been known to create as strange a fondness  my friend had a little helpless leveret brought to him which the servants fed with milk in a spoon and about the same time his cat kittened and the young were dispatched and buried the hare was soon lost and supposed to be gone the way of most fondlings to be killed by some dog or cat however in about a fortnight as the master was sitting in his garden in the dusk of the evening he observed his cat with tail erect trotting toward him and calling with little short inward notes of complacency such as they use toward their kittens and something gamboling after which proved to be the leveret that the cat had supported with her milk and continued to support with great affection  thus was a graminivorous animal nurtured by a carnivorous and predaceous one  why so cruel and sanguinary a beast as a cat of the ferocious genus of feles the murium leo as linnaeus calls it should be affected with any tenderness toward an animal which is it is natural prey is not so easy to determine  this strange affection probably was occasioned by that desiderium those tender maternal feelings which the loss of her kittens had awakened in her breast and by the complacency and ease she derived to herself from the procuring her teats to be drawn which were too much distended with milk till from habit she became as much delighted with this foundling as if it had been her real offspring  this incident is no bad solution of that strange circumstance which grave historians as well as the poets assert of exposed children being sometimes nurtured by female wild beasts that probably had lost their young for it is not one whit more mavelous that romulus and remus in their infant state should be nursed by a shewolf than that a poor little sucking leveret should be fostered and cherished by a bloody grimalkin

insects and reptiles are of much more consequence and have much more influence in the economy of nature than the incurious are aware of and are mighty in their effect from their minuteness which renders them less an object of attention and from their numbers and fecundity earthworms though in appearance a small and despicable link in the chain of nature yet if lost would make a lamentable chasm for to say nothing of half the birds and some quadrupeds which are almost entirely supported by them worms seem to be the great promoters of vegetation which would proceed but lamely without them by boring perforating and loosening the soil and rendering it pervious to rains and the fibers of plants by drawing straws and stalks of leaves and twigs into it and most of all by throwing up such infinite numbers of lumps of earth called wormcasts which being their excrement is a fine manure for grain and grass worms probably provide new soil for hills and slopes where the rain washes the earth away and they affect slopes probably to avoid being flooded gardeners and farmers express their detestation of worms the former because they render their walks unsightly and make them much work and the latter because as they think worms eat their green corn but these men would find that the earth without worms would soon become cold hardbound and void of fermentation and consequently steril and besides in favor of worms it should be hinted that green corn plants and flowers are not so much injured by them as by many species of coleoptera scarabs and tipulae longlegs in their larva or grubstate and by unnoticed myriads of small shellless snails called slugs which silently and imperceptibly make amazing havoc in the field and garden farmer young of nortonfarm says that this spring

twentysixth and twentyseventh of last march were very hot days so fultry that every body complained and were restless under those sensations to which they had not been reconciled by gradual approaches  this sudden summerlike heat was attended by many summer coincidences for on those two days the thermometer rose to sixtysix in the shade many species of insects revived and came forth some bees swarmed in this neighborhood the old tortoise near jews in sussex awakened and came forth out of it is dormitory and what is most to my present purpose many houseswallows appeared and were very alert in many places and particularly at cobham in surrey  but as that short warm period was succeeded as well as preceded by harsh severe weather with frequent frosts and ice and cutting winds the insects withdrew the tortoise retired again into the ground and the swallows were seen no more until the tenth of april when the rigor of the spring abating a softer season began to prevail  again it appears by my journals for many years past that housemartins retire to a bird about the beginning of october so that a person not very observant of such matters would conclude that they had taken their last farewell but then it may be seen in my diaries also that considerable flocks have discovered themselves again in the first week of november and often on the fourth day of that month only for one day and that not as if they were in actual migration but playing about at their leisure and feeding calmly as if no enterprise of moment at all agitated their spirits and this was the case in the beginning of this very month for on the fourth of november more than twenty housemartins which in appearance had all departed about the seventh of october were seen again for that one morning only sporting between my fields and the hanger and feasting on insects which swarmed in that sheltered district the preceding day was wet and blustering but the fourth was dark and mild and soft the wind at southwest and the thermometer at    a pitch not common at that season of the year moreover it may no the amiss to add in this place that whenever the thermometer is above  0 the bat comes flitting out in every autumnal and wintermonth  from all these circumstances laid together it is obvious that torpid insects reptiles and quadrupeds are awakened from their profoundest slumbers by a little untimely warmth and therefore that nothing so much promotes this deathlike stupor as a defect of heat and farther it is reasonable to suppose that two whole species or at least many individuals of those two species of british hirundines do never leave this island at all but partake of the same benumbed state for we cannot suppose that after a months absence housemartins can return from southern

only the palms of his hands and the soles of his feet this scaly eruption usually broke out twice in the year at the spring and fall and by peeling away left the skin so thin and tender that neither his hands or feet were able to perform their functions so that the poor object was half his time on crutches incapable of employ and languishing in a tiresome state of indolence and inactivity his habit was lean lank and cadaverous in this sad plight he dragged on a miserable existence a burden to himself and his parish which was obliged to support him till he was relieved by death at more than thirty years of age  the good women who love to account for every defect in children by the doctrine of longing said that his mother felt a violent propensity for oysters which she was unable to gratify and that the black rough scurf on his hands and feet were the shells of that fish we knew his parents neither of which were lepers his father in particular lived to be far advanced in years  in all ages the leprosy has made dreadful havoc among mankind the israelites seem to have been greatly afflicted with it from the most remote times as appears from the peculiar and repeated injunctions given them in the levitical law see leviticus chap xiii and xiv  nor was the rancour of this foul disorder much abated in the last period of their commonwealth as may be seen in many passages of the new testament  some centuries ago this horrible distemper prevailed all europe over and our forefathers were by no means exempt as appears by the large provision made for objects laboring under this calamity there was an hospital for female lepers in the diocese of lincoln a noble one near durham three in london and southwark and perhaps many more in or near our great towns and cities moreover some crowned heads and other wealthy and charitable personages bequeathed large legacies to such poor people as languished under this hopeless infirmity  it must therefore in these days be to an humane and thinking person a matter of equal wonder and satisfaction when he contemplates how nearly this pest is eradicated and observes that a leper now is a rare sight he will moreover when engaged in such a train of thought naturally inquire for the reason this happy change perhaps may have originated and been continued from the much smaller quantity of salted meat and fish now eaten in these kingdoms from the use of linen next the skin from the plenty of better bread and from the profusion of fruits roots legumes and greens so common in every family three or four centuries ago before there were any enclosures sowngrasses fieldturnips or fieldcarrots or hay all the cattle which had grown fat in summer and were not killed for winteruse were turned out soon after michaelmas to shift as they could through the dead months so that no fresh meat could be had in winter or spring hence the mavelous account of the vast stores of salted flesh found in the larder of the eldest spencer viz six hundred bacons eighty carcasses of beef and six hundred muttons in the days of edward the second even so late in the spring as the third of may it was from magazines like these that the turbulent barons supported in idleness their riotous swarms of retainers ready for any disorder or mischief but agriculture is now arrived at such a pitch of perfection that our best and fattest meats are killed in the winter and no man need eat salted flesh unless he prefers it that has money to buy fresh  one cause of this distemper might be no doubt the quantity of wretched fresh and salt fish consumed by the commonalty at all seasons as well as in lent which our poor now would hardly be persuaded to touch  the use of linen changes shirts or shifts in the room of sordid and filthy woollen long worn next the skin is a matter of neatness comparatively modern but must prove a great means of preventing cutaneous ails at this very time woollen instead of linen prevails among the poorer welsh who are subject to foul eruptions  the plenty of good wheaten bread that now is found among all ranks of people in the south instead of that miserable sort which used in old days to be made of barley or beans may contribute not a little to the sweetening their blood and correcting their juices for the inhabitants of mountainous districts to this day are still liable to the itch and other cutaneous disorders from a wretchedness and poverty of diet  as to the produce of a garden every middleaged person of observation may perceive within his own memory both in town and country how vastly the consumption of vegetables is increased greenstalls in cities now support multitudes in a comfortable state while gardeners get fortunes every decent labourer also has his garden which is half his support as well as his delight and common farmers provide plenty of beans peace and greens for their hinds to eat with their bacon and those few that do not are despised for their sordid parsimony and looked upon as regardless of the welfare of their dependants potatoes have prevailed in this little district by means of premiums within these twenty years only and are much esteemed here now by the poor who would scarce have ventured to taste them in the last reign  our saxon ancestors certainly had some sort of cabbage because they call the month of february sproutcale but long after their days the cultivation of gardens was little attended to the religious being men of leisure and keeping up a constant correspondence with italy were the first people among us that had gardens and fruit trees in any perfection within the walls of their abbeys in monasteries the lamp of knowledge continued to burn however dimly in them men of business were formed for the state the art of writing was cultivated by the monks they were the only proficients in mechanics gardening and architecture see dalrymples annals of scotland and priories the barons neglected every pursuit that did not lead to war or tend to the pleasure of the chase  it was not till gentlemen took up the study of horticulture themselves that the knowledge of gardening made such hasty advances lord cobham lord ila and mr waller of beaconsfield were some of the first people of rank that promoted the elegant science of ornamenting without despising the superintendence of the kitchen quarters and fruit walls  a remark made by the excellent mr ray in his tour of europe at once surprises us and corroborates what has been advanced above for we find him observing so late as his days that the italians use several herbs for sallets which are not yet or have not been but lately used in england viz selleri celery which is nothing else but the sweet smallage the young shoots whereof with a little of the head of the root cut off they eat raw with oil and pepper and farther he adds  curled endive blanched is much used beyond seas and for a raw sallet seemed to excel lettuce itself now this journey was undertaken no longer ago than in the year       i am etc  letter xxxviii to the same forte puer comitum seductus ab agmine fido dixerat ecquis adest et adest responderat echo hic stupet utque aciem parts divisit in omnes voce veni clamat magna vocat illa vocantem  selborne feb         dear sir in a district so diversified as this so full of hollow vales and hanging woods it is no wonder that echoes should abound many we have discovered that return the cry of a pack of dogs the notes of a huntinghorn a tunable ring of bells or the melody of birds very agreeably but we were still at a loss for a polysyllabical articulate echo till a young gentleman who had parted from his company in a summer evening walk and was calling after them stumbled upon a very curious one in a spot where it might least be expected at first he was much surprised and could not be persuaded but that he was mocked by some boy but repeating his trials in several languages and finding his respondent to be a very adroit polyglot he then discerned the deception  this echo in an evening before rural noises cease would repeat ten syllables most articulately and distinctly especially if quick dactyls were chosen the last syllables of tityre tu patulae recubans   were as audibly and intelligibly returned as the first and there is no doubt could trial have been made but that at midnight when the air is very elastic and a dead stillness prevails one or two syllables more might have been obtained but the distance rendered so late an experiment very inconvenient  quick dactyls we observed succeeded best for when we came to try it is powers in slow heavy embarassed spondees of the same number of syllables monstrum horrendum inform ingens   we could perceive a return but of four or five  all echoes have some one place to which they are returned stronger and more distinct than to any other and that is always the place that lies at right angles with the object of repercussion and is not too near nor too far off buildings or naked rocks reecho much more articulately than hanging wood or vales because in the latter the voice is as it were entangled and embarassed in the covert and weakened in the rebound  the true object of this echo as we found by various experiments is the stonebuilt tiled hopkiln in gallylane which measures in front  0 feet and from the ground to the eaves    feet the true centrum phonicum or just distance is one particular spot in the kingsfield in the path to norehill on the very brink of the steep balk above the hollow cart way in this case there is no choice of distance but the path by mere contingency happens to be the lucky the identical spot because the ground rises or falls so immediately if the speaker either retires or advances that his mouth would at once be above or below the object  we measured this polysyllabical echo with great exactness and found the distance to fall very short of dr plots rule for distinct articulation for the doctor in his history of oxfordshire allows   0 feet for the return of each syllable distinctly hence this echo which gives ten distinct syllables ought to measure  00 yards or   0 feet to each syllable whereas our distance is only     yards or near    feet to each syllable thus our measure falls short of the doctors as five to eight but then it must be acknowledged that this candid philosopher was convinced afterward that some latitude must be admitted of in the distance of echoes according to time and place  when experiments of this sort are making it should always be remembered that weather and the time of day have a vast influence on an echo for a dull heavy moist air deadens and clogs the sound and hot sunshine renders the air thin and weak and deprives it of all it is springiness and a ruffling wind quite defeats the whole in a still clear dewy evening the air is most elastic and perhaps the later the hour the more so  echo has always been so amusing to the imagination that the poets have personified her and in their hands she has been the occasion of many a beautiful fiction nor need the gravest man be ashamed to appear taken with such a phenomenon since it may become the subject of philosophical or mathematical inquiries  one should have imagined that echoes if not entertaining must at least have been harmless and inoffensive yet virgil advances a strange notion that they are injurious to bees after enumerating some probable and reasonable annoyances such as prudent owners would wish far removed from their beegardens he adds   aut ubi concava pulsu saxa sonant vocisque offensa resultat imago   this wild and fanciful assertion will hardly be admitted by the philosophers of these days especially as they all now seem agreed that insects are not furnished with any organs of hearing at all but if it should be urged that though they cannot hear yet perhaps they may feel the repercussions of sounds i grant it is possible they may yet that these impressions are distasteful or hurtful i deny because bees in good summers thrive well in my outlet where the echoes are very strong for this village is another anathoth a place of responses or echoes besides it does not appear from experiment that bees are in any way capable of being affected by sounds for i have often tried my own with a large speakingtrumpet held close to their hives and with such an exertion of voice as would have haled a ship at the distance of a mile and still these insects pursued their various employments undisturbed and without showing the least sensibility or resentment  some time since it is discovery this echo is become totally silent though the object or hopkiln remains nor is there any mystery in this defect for the field between is planted as an hopgarden and the voice of the speaker is totally absorbed and lost among the poles and entangled foliage of the hops and when the poles are removed in autumn the disappointment is the same because a tall quickset hedge nurtered up for the purpose of shelter to the hop ground entirely interrupts the impulse and repercussion of the voice so that till those obstructions are removed no more of it is garrulity can be expected  should any gentleman of fortune think an echo in his park or outlet a pleasing incident he might build one at little or no expense for whenever he had occasion for a new barn stable dogkennel or the like structure it would be only needful to erect this building on the gentle declivity of an hill with a like rising opposite to it at a few hundred yards distance and perhaps success might be the easier ensured could some canal lake or stream intervene from a seat at the centrum phonicum he and his friends might amuse themselves sometimes of an evening with the prattle of this loquacious nymph of whose complacency and decent reserve more may be said than can with truth of every individual of her sex since she is    quae nec

birds the swifts i am now confirmed in the opinion that we have every year the same number of pairs invariably at least the result of my inquiry has been exactly the same for a long time past the swallows and martins are so numerous and so widely distributed over the village that it is hardly possible to recount them while the swifts though they do not all build in the church yet so frequently haunt it and play and rendezvous round it that they are easily enumerated the number that i constantly find are eight pairs about half of which reside in the church and the rest build in some of the lowest and meanest thatched cottages now as these eight pairs allowance being made for accidents breed yearly eight pairs more what becomes annually of this increase and what determines every spring which pairs shall visit us and reoccupy their ancient haunts  ever since i have attended to the subject of ornithology i have always supposed that that sudden reverse of affection that strange  which immediately succeeds in the feathered kind to the most passionate fondness is the occasion of an equal dispersion of birds over the face of the earth without this provision one favorite district would be crowded with inhabitants while others would be destitute and forsaken but the parent birds seem to maintain a jealous superiority and to oblige the young to seek for new abodes and the rivalry of the males in many kinds prevents their crowding the one on the other whether the swallows and housemartins return in the same exact number annually is not easy to say for reasons given above but it is apparent as i have remarked before in my monographies that the numbers returning bear no manner of proportion to the numbers retiring  letter xl to the same selborne june        dear sir the standing objection to botany has always been that it is a pursuit that amuses the fancy and exercises the memory without improving the mind or advancing any real knowledge and where the science is carried no farther than a mere systematic classification the charge is but too true but the botanist that is desirous of wiping off this aspersion should be by no means content with a list of names he should study plants philosophically should investigate the laws of vegetation should examine the powers and virtues of efficacious herbs should promote their cultivation and graft the gardener the planter and the husbandman on the phytologist not that system is by any means to be thrown aside without system the field of nature would be a pathless wilderness but system should be subservient to not the main object of pursuit  vegetation is highly worthy of our attention and in itself is of the utmost consequence to mankind and productive of many of the greatest comforts and elegancies of life to plants we owe timber bread beer honey wine oil linen cotton etc what not only strengthens our hearts and exhilerates our spirits but what secures us from inclemencies of weather and adorns our persons man in his true state of nature seems to be subsisted by spontaneous vegetation in middle climes where grasses prevail he mixes some animal food with the produce of the field and garden and it is toward the polar extremes only that like his kindred bears and wolves he gorges himself with flesh alone and is driven to what hunger has never been known to compel the very beasts to prey on his own species see the late voyages to the southseas   the productions of vegetation have had a vast influence on the commerce of nations and have been the great promoters of navigation as may be seen in the articles of sugar tea tobacco opium ginseng betel paper etc as every climate has it is peculiar produce our natural wants bring on a mutual intercourse so that by means of trade each distant part is supplied with the growth of every latitude but without the knowledge of plants and their culture we must have been content with our hips and haws without enjoying the delicate fruits of india and the salutiferous drugs of peru  instead of examining the minute distinctions of every various species of each obscure genus the botanist should endeavor to make himself acquainted with those that are useful you shall see a man readily ascertain every herb of the field yet hardly know wheat from barley or at least one sort of wheat or barley from another  but of all sorts of vegetation the grasses seem to be most neglected neither the farmer nor the grazier seem to distinguish the annual from the perennial the hardy from the tender nor the succulent and nutritive from the dry and juiceless  the study of grasses would be of great consequence to a northerly and grazing kingdom the botanist that could improve the swerd of the district where he lived would be an useful member of society to raise a thick turf on a naked soil would be worth volumes of systematic knowledge and he would be the best commonwealths man that could occasion the growth of  two blades of grass where one alone was seen

ornithologist should be able to distinguish birds by their air as well as by their colors and shape on the ground as well as on the wing and in the bush as well as in the hand for though it must not be said that every species of birds has a manner peculiar to itself yet there is somewhat in most genera at least that at first sight discriminates them and enables a judicious observer to pronounce upon them with some certainty put a bird in motion   et vera incessu patuit     thus kites and buzzards sail round in circles with wings expanded and motionless and it is from their gliding manner that the former are still called in the north of england gleads from the saxon verb glidan to glide the kestrel or windhover has a peculiar mode of hanging in the air in one place his wings all the while being briskly agitated henharriers sly low over heaths or fields of corn and beat the ground regularly like a pointer or settingdog owls move in a buoyant manner as if lighter than the air they seem to want ballast there is a peculiarity belonging to ravens that must draw the attention even of the most incurious  they spend all their leisure time in striking and cuffing each other on the wing in a kind of playful skirmish and when they move from one place to another frequently turn on their backs with a loud croak and seem to be falling to the ground when this odd gesture betides them they are scratching themselves with one foot and thus lose the center of gravity rooks sometimes dive and tumble in a frolicksome manner crows and daws swagger in their walk woodpeckers sly volatu undoso opening and closing their wings at every stroke and so are always rising or falling in curves all of this genus use their tails which incline downward as a support while they run up trees parrots like all other hookedclawed birds walk aukwardly and make use of their bill as a third foot climbing and descending with ridiculous caution all the gallinae parade and walk gracefully and run nimbly but fly with difficulty with an impetuous whirring and in a straight line magpies and jays flutter with powerless wings and make no dispatch herons seem incumbered with too much sail for their light bodies but these vast hollow wings are necessary in carrying burdens such as large fishes and the like pigeons and particularly the sort called smiters have a way of clashing their wings the one against the other over their backs with a loud snap another variety called tumblers turn themselves over in the air some birds have movements peculiar to the season of love thus ringdoves though strong and rapid at other times yet in the spring hang about on the wing in a toying and playful manner thus the cocksnipe while breeding forgetting his former flight fans the air like the windhover and the greenfinch in particular exhibits such languishing and faultering gestures as to appear like a wounded and dying bird the kingfisher darts along like an arrow fernowls or goatsuckers glance in the dusk over the tops of trees like a meteor starlings as it were swim along while misselthrushes use a wild and desultory flight swallows sweep over the surface of the ground and water and distinguish themselves by rapid turns and quick evolutions swifts dash round in circles and the bankmartin moves with frequent vacillations like a butterfly most of the small birds fly by jerks rising and falling as they advance most small birds hop but wagtails and larks walk moving their legs alternately skylarks rise and fall perpendicularly as they sing woodlarks hang poised in the air and titlarks rise and fall in large curves singing in their descent the whitethroat uses odd jerks and gesticulations over the tops of hedges and bushes all the duckkind waddle diverse and auks walk as if fettered and stand erect on their tails these are the compedes of linnaeus geese and cranes and most wildfowls move in figured flights often changing their position the secondary remiges of tringae wildducks and some others are very long and give their wings when in motion an hooked appearance dabchicks moorhens and coots fly erect with their legs hanging down and hardly make any dispatch the reason is plain their wings are placed too forward out of the true center of gravity as the legs of auks and diverse are situated too backward  letter xliii to the same selborne sept        dear sir from the motion of birds the transition is natural enough to their notes and language of which i shall say something not that i would pretend to understand their language like the vizier who by the recital of a conversation which passed between two owls reclaimed a sultan see spectator vol vii no     before delighting in conquest and devastation but i would be thought only to mean that many of the winded tribes have various sounds and voices adapted to express their various passions wants and feelings such as anger fear love hatred hunger and the like all species are not equally eloquent some are copious and fluent as it were in their utterance while others are confined to a few important sounds no bird like the fish kind is quite mute though some are rather silent the language of birds is very ancient and like other ancient modes of speech very elliptical little is said but much is meant and understood  the notes of the eaglekind are shrill and piercing and about the season of nidification much diversified as i have been often assured by a curious observer of nature who long resided at gibraltar where eagles abound the notes of our hawks much resemble those of the king of birds owls have very expressive notes they hoot in a fine vocal sound much resembling the vox lumana and reducible by a pitchpipe to a musical key this note seems to express complacency and rivalry among the males they use also a quick call and an horrible scream and can snore and hiss when they mean to menace ravens besides their loud croak can exert a deep and solemn note that makes the woods to echo the amorous sound of a crow is strange and ridiculous rooks in the breeding season attempt sometimes in the gaiety of their hearts to sing but with no great success the parrotkind have many modulations of voice as appears by their aptitude to learn human sounds doves coo in an amorous and mournful manner and are emblems of despairing lovers the woodpecker sets up a sort of loud and hearty laugh the fernowl or goatsucker from the dusk till daybreak serenades his mate with the clattering of castanets all the tuneful passeres express their complacency by sweet modulations and a variety of melody the swallow as has been observed in a former letter by a shrill alarm bespeaks the attention of the other hirundines and bids them be aware that the hawk is at hand aquatic and gregarious birds especially the nocturnal that shift their quarters in the dark are very noisy and loquacious as cranes wildgeese wildducks and the like their perpetual clamor prevents them from dispersing and losing their companions  in so extensive a subject sketches and outlines are as much as can be expected for it would be endless to instance in all the infinite variety of the feathered nation we shall therefore confine the remainder of this letter to the few domestic fowls of our yards which are most known and therefore best understood and first the peacock with his gorgeous train demands our attention but like most of the gaudy birds his notes are grating and shocking to the car the yelling of cats and the braying of an ass are not more disgustful the voice of the goose is trumpetlike and clanking and once saved the capitol at rome as grave historians assert the hiss also of the gander is formidable and full of menace and protective of his young among ducks the sexual distinction of voice is remarkable for while the quack of the female is loud and sonorous the voice of the drake is inward and harsh and feeble and scarce discernible the cock turkey struts and gobbles to his mistress in a most uncouth manner he has also a pert and petulant note when he attacks his adversary when a hen turkey leads forth her young brood she keeps a watchful eye and if a bird of prey appear though ever so high in the air the careful mother announces the enemy with a little inward moan and watches him with a steady and attentive look but if he approach her note becomes earnest and alarming and her outcries are redoubled  no inhabitants of a yard seem possessed of such a variety of expression and so copious a language as common poultry take a chicken of four or five days old and hold it up to a window where there are flies and it will immediately seize it is prey with little twitterings of complacency but if you tender it a wasp or a be at once it is note becomes harsh and expressive of disapprobation and a sense of danger when a pullet is ready to lay she intimates the event by a joyous and easy soft note of all the occurrences of their life that of laying seems to be the most important for no sooner has a hen disburdened herself than she rushes forth with a clamorous kind of joy which the cock and the rest of his mistresses immediately adopt the tumult is not confined to the family concerned but catches from yard to yard and spreads to every homestead within hearing till at last the whole village is in an uproar as soon as a hen becomes a mother her new relation demands a new language she then runs clocking and screaming about and seems agitated as if possessed the father of the flock has also a considerable vocabulary if he finds food he calls a favorite concubine to partake and if a bird of prey passes over with a warning voice he bids his family beware the gallant chanticleer has at command his amorous phrases and his terms of defiance but the sound by which he is best known is his crowing by this he has been distinguished in all ages as the countrymans clock or larum as the watchman that proclaims the divisions of the night thus the poet elegantly styles him   the crested cock whose clarion sounds the silent hours   a neighboring gentleman one summer had lost most of his chickens by a sparrowhawk that came gliding down between a faggot pile and the end of his house to the place where the coops stood the owner inwardly vexed to see his flock thus diminishing hung a setting net adroitly between the pile and the house into which the caitif dashed and was entangled resentment suggested the law of retaliation he therefore clipped the hawks wings cut off his talons and fixing a cork on his bill threw him down among the broodhens

contribute to promote science an obelisk in a garden or park might be both an embellishment and an heliotrope  any person that is curious and enjoys the advantage of a good horizon might with little trouble make two heliotropes the one for the winter the other for the summer solstice and these two erections might be constructed with very little expense for two pieces of timber framework about ten or twelve feet high and four feet broad at the base and close lined with plank would answer the purpose  the erection for the former should if possible be placed within sight of some window in the common sitting parlour because men at that dead season of the year are usually within doors at the close of the day while that for the latter might be fixed for any given spot in the garden or outlet whence the owner might contemplate in a fine summers evening the utmost extent that the sun makes to the northward at the season of the longest days now nothing would be necessary but to place these two objects with so much exactness that the westerly limb of the sun at setting might but just clear the winter heliotrope to the west of it on the shortest day and that the whole disc of the sun at the longest day might exactly at setting also clear the summer heliotrope to the north of it  by this simple expedient it would soon appear that there is no such thing strictly speaking as a solstice for from the shortest day the owner would every clear evening see the disc advancing at it is setting to the westward of the object and from the longest day observe the sun retiring backwards every evening at it is seting toward the object westward till in a few nights it would set quite behind it and so by degrees to the west of it for when the sun comes near the summer solstice the whole disc of it would at first set behind the object after a time the northern limb would first appear and so every night gradually more till at length the whole diameter would set northward of it for about three nights but on the middle night of the three sensibly more remote than the former or following when beginning it is recess from the summer tropic it would continue more and more to be hidden every night till at length it would descend quite behind the object again and so nightly more and more to the westward  letter xlv to the same selborne   mugire videbis sub pedibus terram et

justifies our suspicions which though it befell not within the limits of this parish yet as it was within the hundred of selborne and as the circumstances were singular may fairly claim a place in a work of this nature  the months of january and february in the year      were remarkable for great melting snows and vast gluts of rain so that by the end of the latter month the landsprings or lavants began to prevail and to be near as high as in the memorable winter of      the beginning of march also went on in the same tenor when in the night between the  th and  th of that month a considerable part of the great woody hanger at hawkley was torn from it is place and fell down leaving a high freestone cliff naked and bare and resembling the steep side of a chalkpit it appears that this huge fragment being perhaps sapped and undermined by waters foundered and was ingulfed going down in a perpendicular direction for a gate which stood in the field on the top of the hill after sinking with it is posts for thirty or forty feet remained in so true and upright a position as to open and shut with great exactness just as in it is first situation several oaks also are still standing and in a state of vegetation after taking the same desperate leap that great part of this prodigious mass was absorbed in some gulf below is plain also from the inclining ground at the bottom of the hill which is free and unincumbered but would have been buried in heaps of rubbish had the fragment parted and fallen forward about an hundred yards from the foot of this hanging coppice stood a cottage by the side of a lane and two hundred yards lower on the other side of the lane was a farmhouse in which lived a labourer and his family and just by a stout new barn the cottage was inhabited by an old woman and her son and his wife these people in the evening which was very dark and tempestuous observed that the brick floors of their kitchens began to heave and part and that the walls seemed to open and the roofs to crack but they all agree that no tremor of the ground indicating an earthquake was ever felt only that the wind continued to make a most tremendous roaring in the woods and hangers the miserable inhabitants not daring to go to bed remained in the utmost solicitude and confusion expecting every moment to be buried under the ruins of their shattered edifices when daylight came they were at leisure to contemplate the devastations of the night they then found that a deep rift or chasm had opened under their houses and torn them as it were in two and that one end of the barn had suffered in a similar manner that a pond near the cottage had undergone a strange reverse becoming deep at the shallow end and so vice versa that many large oaks were removed out of their perpendicular some thrown down and some fallen into the heads of neighboring trees and that a gate was thrust forward with it is hedge full six feet so as to require a new track to be made to it from the foot of the cliff the general course of the ground which is pasture inclines in a moderate descent for half a mile and is interspersed with some hillocks which were rifted in every direction as well toward the great woody hanger as from it in the first pasture the deep clefts began and running across the lane and under the buildings made such vast shelves that the road was impassable for some time and so over to an arable field on the other side which was strangely torn and disordered the second pasture field being more soft and springy was protruded forward without many fissures in the turf which was raised in long ridges resembling graves lying at right angles to the motion at the bottom of this enclosure the soil and turf rose many feet against the bodies of some oaks that obstructed their farther course and terminated this awful commotion  the perpendicular height of the precipice in general is twentythree yards the length of the lapse or slip as seen from the fields below one hundred and eightyone and a partial fall concealed in the coppice extends seventy yards more so that the total length of this fragment that fell was two hundred and fiftyone yards about fifty acres of land suffered from this violent convulsion two houses were entirely destroyed one end of a new barn was left in ruins the walls being cracked through the very stones that composed them a hanging coppice was changed to a naked rock and some grass grounds and an arable field so broken and rifted by the chasms as to be rendered for a time neither fit for the plough or safe for pasturage till considerable labor and expense had been bestowed in levelling the surface and filling in the gaping fissures  letter xlvi to the same selborne   resonant arbusta    there is a steep abrupt pasture field interspersed with furze close to the back of this village well known by the name of the short lirhe consisting of a rocky dry soil and inclining to the afternoon sun this spot abounds with the gryllus campestris or fieldcricket which though frequent in these parts is by no means a common insect in many other counties  as their cheerful summer cry cannot but draw the attention of a naturalist i have often gone down to examine the economy of these grylli and study their mode of life but they are so shy and cautious that it is no easy matter to get a sight of them for feeling a persons footsteps as he advances they stop short in the midst of their song and retire backward nimbly into their burrows where they lurk till all suspicion of danger is over  at first we attempted to dig them out with a spade but without any great success for either we could not get to the bottom of the hole which often terminated under a great stone or else in breaking up the ground we inadvertently squeezed the poor insect to death out of one so bruised we took a multitude of eggs which were long and narrow of a yellow color and covered with a very tough skin by this accident we learned to distinguish the male from the female the former of which is shining black with a golden stripe across his shoulders the latter is more dusky more capacious about the abdomen and carries a long swordshaped weapon at her tail which probably is the instrument with which she deposits her eggs in crannies and safe receptacles  where violent methods will not avail more gentle means will often succeed and so it proved in the present case for though a spade be too boisterous and rough an implement a pliant stalk of grass gently insinuated into the caverns will probe their windings to the bottom and quickly bring out the inhabitant and thus the humane inquirer may gratify his curiosity without injuring the object of it it is remarkable that though these insects are furnished with long legs behind and brawny thighs for leaping like grasshoppers yet when driven from their holes they show no activity but crawl along in a shiftless manner so as easily to be taken and again though provided with a curious apparatus of wings yet they never exert them when there seems to be the greatest occasion the males only make that shrilling noise perhaps out of rivalry and emulation as is the case with many animals which exert some sprightly note during their breeding time it is raised by a brisk friction of one wing against the other they are solitary beings living singly male or female each as it may happen but there must be a time when the sexes have some intercourse and then the wings may be useful perhaps during the hours of night when the males meet they will sight siercely as i found by some which i put into the crevices of a dry stone wall where i should have been glad to have made them settle for though they seemed distressed by being taken out of their knowledge yet the first that got possession of the chinks would seize on any that were obtruded upon them with a vast row of serrated fangs with their strong jaws toothed like the shears of a lobsters claws they perforate and round their curious regular cells having no foreclaws to dig like the molecricket when taken in hand i could not but wonder that they never offered to defend themselves though armed with such formidable weapons of such herbs as grow before the mouths of their burrows they eat indiscriminately and on a little platform which they make just by they drop their dung and never in the day time seem to stir more than two or three inches from home sitting in the entrance of their caverns they chirp all night as well as day from the middle of the month of may to the middle of july and in hot weather when they are most vigorous they make the hills echo and in the stiller hours of darkness may be heard to a considerable distance in the beginning of the season their notes are more faint and inward but become louder as the summer advances and so die away again by degrees  sounds do not always give us pleasure according to their sweetness and melody nor do harsh sounds always displease we are more apt to be captivated or disgusted with the associations which they promote than with the notes themselves thus the shrilling of the fieldcricket though sharp and stridulous yet marvellously delights some hearers filling their minds with a train of summer ideas of every thing that is rural verdurous and joyous  about the tenth of march the crickets appear at the mouths of their cells which they then open and bore and shape very elegantly all that ever i have seen at that season were in their pupa state and had only the rudiments of wings lying under a skin or coat which must be cast before the insect can arrive at it is perfect state we have observed that they cast these skins in april which are then seen lying at the mouths of their holes  from whence i should suppose that the old ones of last year do not always survive the winter in august their holes begin to be obliterated and the insects are seen no more till spring  not many summers ago i endeavored to transplant a colony to the terrace in my garden by boring deep holes in the sloping turf the new inhabitants stayed some time and fed and sung but wandered away by degrees and were heard at a farther distance every morning so that it appears that on this emergency they made use of their wings in attempting to return to the spot from which they were taken  one of these crickets when confined in a paper cage and set in the sun and supplied with plants moistened with water will feed and thrive and become so merry and loud as to be irksome in the same room where a person is sitting if the plants are not wetted it will die  letter xlvii to the same selborne dear sir far from all resort of mirth save the cricket on the hearth miltons il penseroso while many other insects must be sought after in fields and woods and waters the gryllus domesticus or housecricket resides altogether within our dwellings intruding itself upon our notice whether we will or no this species delights in newbuilt houses being like the spider pleased with the moisture of the walls and besides the softness of the mortar enables them to burrow and mine between the joints of the bricks or stones and to open communications from one room to another they are particularly fond of kitchens and bakers ovens on account of their perpetual warmth  tender insects that live abroad either enjoy only the short period of one summer or else doze away the cold uncomfortable months in profound slumbers but these residing as it were in a torrid zone are always alert and merry a good christmas fire is to them like the heats of the dog days though they are frequently heard by day yet is their natural time of motion only in the night as soon as it grows dusk the chirping increases and they come running forth and are from the size of a flea to that of their full stature as one should suppose from the burning atmosphere which they inhabit they are a thirsty race and show a great propensity for liquids being found frequently drowned in pans of water milk broth or the like whatever is moist they affect and therefore often gnaw holes in wet woollen stockings and aprons that are hung to the fire they are the housewifes barometer foretelling her when it will rain and are prognostic sometimes she thinks of ill or good luck of the death of a near relation or the approach of an absent lover by being the constant companions of her solitary hours they naturally become the objects of her superstition these crickets are not only very thirsty but very voracious for they will eat the scummings of pots and yeast salt and crumbs of bread and any kitchen offal or sweepings in the summer we have observed them to fly when it became dusk out of the windows and over the neighboring roofs this feat of activity accounts for the sudden manner in which they often leave their haunts as it does for the method by which they come to houses where they were not known before it is remarkable that many sorts of insects seem never to use their wings but when they have a mind to shift their quarters and settle new colonies when in the air they move  volatu undoso in waves or curves like woodpeckers opening and shutting their wings at every stroke and so are always rising or sinking  when they increase to a great degree as they did once in the house where i am now writing they become noisome pests slying into the candles and dashing into peoples faces but may be blasted and destroyed by gunpowder discharged into their crevices and crannies in families at such times they are like pharaohs plague of frogs  in their bedchambers and upon their beds and in their ovens and in their kneadingtroughs exodus viii    their shrilling noise is occasioned by a brisk attrition of their wings cats catch hearthcrickets and playing with them as they do with mice devour them crickets may be destroyed like wasps by phials half filled with beer or any liquid and set in their haunts for being always eager to drink they will crowd in till the bottles are full  letter xlviii to the same selborne how diversified are the modes of life not only of incongruous but even of congenerous animals and yet their specific distinctions are not more various than their propensities thus while the fieldcricket delights in sunny dry banks and the housecricket rejoices amidst the glowing heat of the kitchen hearth or oven the gryllus gryllo talpa the molecricket haunts moist meadows and frequents the sides of ponds and banks of streams performing all it is functions in a swampy wet soil with a pair of forefeet curiously adapted to the purpose it burrows and works under ground like the mole raising a ridge as it proceeds but seldom throwing up hillocks  as molecrickets often infest gardens by the sides of canals they are unwelcome guests to the gardener raising up ridges in their subterraneous progress and rendering the walks unsightly if they take to the kitchen quarters they occasion great damage among the plants and roots by destroying whole beds of cabbages young legumes and flowers when dug out they seem very slow and helpless and make no use of their wings by day but at night they come abroad and make long excursions as i have been convinced by finding stragglers in a morning in improbable places in fine weather about the middle of april and just at the close of day they begin to solace themselves with a low dull jarring note continued for a long time without interruption and not unlike the chattering of the fernowl or goatsucker but more inward  about the beginning of may they lay their eggs as i was once an eyewitness for a gardener at an house where i was on a visit happening to be mowing on the  th of that month by the side of a canal his scythe struck too deep pared off a large piece of turf and laid open to view a curious scene of domestic economy   ingentem lato dedit ore fenestram apparet domus intus et atria longa patescunt apparent  penetralia   there were many caverns and winding passages leading to a kind of chamber neatly smoothed and rounded and about the size of a moderate snuff box within this secret nursery were deposited near an hundred eggs of a dirty yellow color and enveloped in a tough skin but too lately excluded to contain any rudiments of young being full of a viscous substance the eggs lay but shallow and within the influence of the sun just under a little heap of freshmowed mould like that which is raised by ants  when molecrickets fly they move  cursu undoso rising and falling in curves like the other species mentioned before in different parts of this kingdom people call them fencrickets churrworms and evechurrs all very apposite names  anatomists who have examined the intestines of these insects astonish me with their accounts for they say that from the structure position and number of their stomachs or maws there seems to be good reason to suppose that this and the two former species ruminate or chew the cud like many quadrupeds  letter xlix to the same selborne may        it is now more than forty years that i have paid some attention to the ornithology of this district without being able to exhaust the subject new occurrences still arise as long as any inquiries are kept alive  in the last week of last month five of those most rare birds too uncommon to have obtained an english name but known to naturalists depiction of a plover pa      charadrius himantopus by the terms of himantopus or loripes and charadrius himantopus were shot upon the verge of frinshampond a large lake belonging to the bishop of winchester and lying between woolmerforest and the town of farnham in the county of surrey the pond keeper says there were three brace in the slock but that after he had satisfied his curiosity he suffered the sixth to remain unmolested one of these specimens i procured and found the length of the legs to be so extraordinary that at first sight one might have supposed the shanks had been fastened on to impose on the credulity of the beholder they were legs in caricatura and had we seen such proportions on a chinese or japan screen we should have made large allowances for the fancy of the draughtsman these birds are of the plover family and might with propriety be called the stilt plovers brisson under that idea gives them the apposite name of lechasse my specimen when drawn and stuffed with pepper weighed only four ounces and a quarter though the naked part of the thigh measured three inches and an half and the legs four inches and an half hence we may safely assert that these birds exhibit weight for inches incomparably the greatest length of legs of any known bird the flamingo for instance is one of the most long legged birds and yet it bears no manner of proportion to the himantopus for a cock flamingo weighs at an average about four pounds avoirdupois and his legs and thighs measure usually about twenty inches but four pounds are fifteen times and a fraction more than four ounces and one quarter and if four ounces and a quarter have eight inches of legs four pounds must have one hundred and twenty inches and a fraction of legs viz somewhat more than ten feet such a monstrous proportion as the world never saw if you should try the experiment in still larger birds the disparity would still increase it must be matter of great curiosity to see the stilt plover move to observe how it can wield such a length of lever with such feeble muscles as the thighs seem to be furnished with at best one should expect it to be but a bad walker but what adds to the wonder is that it has no back toe now without that steady prop to support it is steps it must be liable in speculation to perpetual vacillations and seldom able to preserve the true center of gravity  the old name of himantopus is taken from pliny and by an awkward metaphor implies that the legs are as slender and pliant as if cut out of a thong of leather neither willughby nor ray in all their curious researches either at home or abroad ever saw this bird mr pennant never met with it in all great britain but observed it often in the cabinets of the curious at paris hasselquist says that it migrates to egypt in the autumn and a most accurate observer of nature has assured me that he has found it on the banks of the streams in andalusia  our writers record it to have been found only twice in great britain from all these relations it plainly appears that these long legged plovers are birds of south europe and rarely visit our island and when they do are wanderers and stragglers and impelled to make so distant and northern an excursion from motives or accidents for which we are not able to account one thing may fairly be deduced that these birds come over to us from the continent since nobody can suppose that a species not noticed once in an age and of such a remarkable make can constantly breed unobserved in this kingdom  letter l to the same selborne april       0 dear sir the old sussex tortoise that i have mentioned to you so often is become my property i dug it out of it is winter dormitory in march last when it was enough awakened to express it is resentments by hissing and packing it in a box with earth carried it eighty miles in postchaises the rattle and hurry of the journey so perfectly roused it that when i turned it out on a border it walked twice down to the bottom of my garden however in the evening the weather being cold it buried itself in the loose mould and continues still concealed  as it will be under my eye i shall now have an opportunity of enlarging my observations on it is mode of life and propensities and perceive already that toward the time of coming forth it opens a breathing place in the ground near it is head requiring i conclude a freer respiration as it becomes more alive this creature not only goes under the earth from the middle of november to the middle of april but sleeps great part of the summer for it goes to bed in the longest days at four in the afternoon and often does not stir in the morning till late besides it retires to rest for every shower and does not move at all in wet days  when one reflects on the state of this strange being it is a matter of wonder to find that providence should bestow such a profusion of days such a seeming waste of longevity on a reptile that appears to relish it so little as to squander more than two thirds of it is existence in a joyless stupor and be lost to all sensation for months together in the profoundest of slumbers  while i was writing this letter a moist and warm afternoon with the thermometer at  0 brought forth troops of shellsnails and at the same juncture the tortoise heaved up the mould and put out it is head and the next morning came forth as it were raised from the dead and walked about till four in the afternoon this was a curious coincidence a very amusing occurrence to see such a similarity of feelings between the two  for so the greeks called both the shellsnail and the tortoise  summer birds are this cold and backward spring unusually late i have seen but one swallow yet this conformity with the weather convinces me more and more that they sleep in the winter  letter li to the same selborne sept        i have now read your miscellanies through with much care and satisfaction and am to return you my best thanks for the honorable mention made in them of me as a naturalist which i wish i may deserve  in some former letters i expressed my suspicions that many of the housemartins do not depart in the winter far from this village i therefore determined to make some search about the southeast end of the hill where i imagined they might slumber out the uncomfortable months of winter but supposing that the examination would be made to the best advantage in the spring and observing that no martins had appeared by the   th of april last on that day i employed some men to explore the shrubs and cavities of the suspected spot the persons took pains but without any success however a remarkable incident occurred in the midst of our pursuit  while the laborers were at work a housemartin the first that had been seen this year came down the village in the sight of several people and went at once into a nest where it stayed a short time and then flew over the houses for some days after no martins were observed not till the   th of april and then only a pair martins in general were remarkably late this year  letter lii to the same selborne sept        i have just met with a circumstance respecting swifts which furnishes an exception to the whole tenor of my observations ever since i have bestowed any attention on that species of hirundines our swifts in general withdrew this year about the first day of august all save one pair which in two or three days was reduced to a single bird the perseverance of this individual made me suspect that the strongest of motives that of an attachto her young could alone occasion so late a stay i watched therefore till the twentyfourth of august and then discovered that under the eaves of the church she attended upon two young which were fledged and now put out their white chins from a crevice these remained till the twentyseventh looking more alert every day and seeming to long to be on the wing after this day they were missing at once nor could i ever observe them with their dam coursing round the church in the act of learning to fly as the first broods evidently do on the thirtyfirst i caused the eaves to be searched but we found in the nest only two callow dead stinking swifts on which a second nest had been formed this double nest was full of the black shining cases of the hippoboscae hirundinis  the following remarks on this unusual incident are obvious the first is that though it may be disagreeable to swifts to remain beyond the beginning of august yet that they can subsist longer is undeniable the second is that this uncommon event as it was owing to the loss of the first brood so it corroborates my former remark that swifts breed regularly but once since was the contrary the case the occurrence above could neither be new nor rare  ps one swift was seen at lyndon in the county of rutland in      so late as the third of september    letter liii to the same as i have sometimes known you make inquiries about several kinds of insects i shall here send you an account of one sort which i little expected to have found in this kingdom i had often observed that one particular part of a vine growing on the walls of my house was covered in the autumn with a black dustlike appearance on which the flies fed eagerly and that the shoots and leaves thus affected did not thrive nor did the fruit ripen to this substance i applied my glasses but could not discover that it had any thing to do with animal life as i at first expected but upon a closer examination behind the larger boughs we were surprised to find that they were coated over with husky shells from whose sides proceeded a cottonlike substance surrounding a multitude of eggs this curious and uncommon production put me upon recollecting what i have heard and read concerning the coccus vitis viniferae of linnaeus which in the south of europe infests many vines and is an horrid and loathsome pest as soon as i had turned to the accounts given of this insect i saw at once that it swarmed on my vine and did not appear to have been at all checked by the preceding winter which had been uncommonly severe  not being then at all aware that it had any thing to do with england i was much inclined to think that it came from gibraltar among the many boxes and packages of plants and birds which i had formerly received from thence and especially as the vine infested grew immediately under my studywindow where i usually kept my specimens true it is that i had received nothing from thence for some years but as insects we know are conveyed from one country to another in a very unexpected manner and have a wonderful power of maintaining their existence till they fall into a nidus proper for their support and increase i cannot but suspect still that these cocei came to me originally from andalusia yet all the while candor obliges me to confess that mr lightfoot has written me word that he once and but once saw these insects on a vine at weymouth in dorsetshire which it is here to be observed is a seaport town to which the coccus might be conveyed by shipping  as many of my readers may possibly never have heard of this strange and unusual insect i shall here transcribe a passage from a natural history of gibraltar written by the reverend john white late vicar of blackburn in lancashire but not yet published   in the year    0 a vine which grew on the east side of my house and which had produced the finest crops of grapes for years past was suddenly overspread on all the woody branches with large lumps of a white fibrous substance resembling spiders webs or rather raw cotton it was of a very clammy quality sticking fast to every thing that touched it and capable of being spun into long threads at first i suspected it to be the product of spiders but could find none nothing was to be seen connected with it but many brown oval husky shells which by no means looked like insects but rather resembled bits of the dry bark of the vine the tree had a plentiful crop of grapes set when this pest appeared upon it but the fruit was manifestly injured by this foul encumbrance it remained all the summer still increasing and loaded the woody and bearing branches to a vast degree i often pulled off great quantities by handfuls but it was so slimy and tenacious that it could by no means be cleared the grapes never filled to their natural perfection but turned watery and vapid upon perusing the works afterward of m de reaumur i found this matter perfectly described and accounted for those husky shells which i had observed were no other than the female coccus from whose sides this cottonlike substance exsudes and serves as a covering and security for their eggs  to this account i think proper to add that though the female cocci are stationary and seldom remove from the place to which they stick yet the male is a winged insect and that the black dust which i saw was undoubtedly the excrement of the females which is eaten by ants as well as flies though the utmost severity of our winter did not destroy these insects yet the attention of the gardener in a summer or two has entirely relieved my vine from this filthy annoyance  as we have remarked above that insects are often conveyed from one country to another in a very unaccountable manner i shall here mention an emigration of small aphides which was observed in the village of selborne no longer ago than august the  st       at about three oclock in the afternoon of that day which was very hot the people of this village were surprised by a shower of aphides or smotherflies which fell in these parts those that were walking in the street at that juncture found themselves covered with these insects which settled also on the hedges and gardens blackening all the vegetables where they alighted my annuals were discolored with them and the stalks of a bed of onions were quite coated over for six days after these armies were then no doubt in a state of emigration and shifting their quarters and might have come as far as we know from the great hopplantations of kent or sussex the wind being all that day in the easterly quarter they were observed at the same time in great clouds about farnham and all along the vale from farnham to alton for various methods by which several insects shift their quarters see derhams physicotheology   letter live to the same dear sir when i happen to visit a family where gold and silver fishes are kept in a glass bowl i am always pleased with the occurrence because it offers me an opportunity of observing the actions and propensities of those beings with whom we can be little acquainted in their natural state not long since i spent a fortnight at the house of a friend where there was such a vivary to which i paid no small attention taking every occasion to remark what passed within it is narrow limits it was here that i first observed the manner in which fishes die as soon as the creature sickens the head sinks lower and lower and it stands as it were on it is head till getting weaker and losing all poise the tail turns over and at last it floats on the surface of the water with it is belly uppermost the reason why fishes when dead swim in that manner is very obvious because when the body is no longer balanced by the fins of the belly the broad muscular back preponderates by it is own gravity and turns the belly uppermost as lighter from it is being a cavity and because it contains the swimmingbladders which contribute to render it buoyant some that delight in gold and silver fishes have adopted a notion that they need no aliment true it is that they will subsist for a long time without any apparent food but what they can collect from pure water frequently changed yet they must draw some support from animalcula and other nourishment supplied by the water because though they seem to eat nothing yet the consequences of eating often drop from them that they are best pleased with such jejune diet may easily be confuted since if you toss them crumbs they will seize them with great readiness not to say greediness however bread should be given sparingly lest turning sour it corrupt the water they will also feed on the waterplant called lemna ducks meat and also on small fry  when they want to move a little they gently protrude themselves with their pinnae pectorales but it is with their strong muscular tails only that they and all fishes shoot along with such inconceivable rapidity it has been said that the eyes of fishes are immovable but these apparently turn them forward or backward in their sockets as their occasions require they take little notice of a lighted candle though applied close to their heads but flounce and seem much frightened by a sudden stroke of the hand against the support whereon the bowl is hung especially when they have been motionless and are perhaps asleep as fishes have no eyelids it is not easy to discern when they are sleeping or not because their eyes are always open  nothing can be more amusing than a glass bowl containing such fishes the double refractions of the glass and water represent them when moving in a shifting and changeable variety of dimensions shades and colors while the two mediums assisted by the concavoconvex shape of the vessel magnify and distort them vastly not to mention that the introduction of another element and it is inhabitants into our parlours engages the fancy in a very agreeable manner  gold and silver fishes though originally natives of china and japan yet are become so well reconciled to our climate as to thrive and multiply very fast in our ponds and stews linnaeus ranks this species of fish under the genus of cyprinus or carp and calls it cyprinus auratus  some people exhibit this sort of fish in a very fanciful way for they cause a glass bowl to be blown with a large hollow space within that does not communicate with it in this cavity they put a bird occasionally so that you may see a goldfinch or a linnet hopping as it were in the midst of the water and the fishes swimming in a circle round it the simple exhibition of the fishes is agreeable and pleasant but in so complicated a way becomes whimsical and unnatural and liable to the objection due to him qui variare cupit rem prodigialiter unam   i am etc  letter lv to the same october  0      dear sir i think i have observed before that much the most considerable part of the housemartins withdraw from hence about the first week in october but that some the latter broods i am now convinced linger on till toward the middle of that month and that at times once perhaps in two or three years a flight for one day only has shown itself in the first week in november  having taken notice in october    0 that the last flight was numerous amounting perhaps to one hundred and fifty and that the season was soft and still i was resolved to pay uncommon attention to these late birds to find if possible where they roosted and to determine the precise time of their retreat the mode of life of these latter hirundines is very favorable to such a design for they spend the whole day in the sheltered district between me and the hanger sailing about in a placid easy manner and feasting on those insects which love to haunt a spot so secure from ruffling winds as my principal object was to discover the place of their roosting i took care to wait on them before they retired to rest and was much pleased to find that for several evenings together just at a quarter past five in the afternoon they all scudded away in great haste toward the southeast and darted down among the low shrubs above the cottages at the end of the hill this spot in many respects seems to be well calculated for their winter residence for in many parts it is as steep as the roof of any house and therefore secure from the annoyances of water and it is moreover clothed with beechen shrubs which being stunted and bitten by sheep make the thickest covert imaginable and are so entangled as to be impervious to the smallest spaniel besides it is the nature of underwood beech never to cast it is leaf all the winter so that with the leaves on the ground and those on the twigs no shelter can be more complete i watched them on to the thirteenth and fourteenth of october and found their evening retreat was exact and uniform but after this they made no regular appearance now and then a straggler was seen and on the twentysecond of october i observed two in the morning over the village and with them my remarks for the season ended  from all these circumstances put together it is more than probable that this lingering flight at so late a season of the year never departed from the island had they indulged me that autumn with a november visit as i much desired i presume that with proper assistants i should have settled the matter past all doubt but though the third of november was a sweet day and in appearance exactly suited to my wishes yet not a martin was to be seen and so i was forced reluctantly to give up the pursuit  i have only to add that were the bushes which cover some acres and are not my own property to be grubbed and carefully examined probably those late broods and perhaps the whole aggregate body of the housemartins of this district might be found there in different secret dormitories and that so far from withdrawing into warmer climes it would appear that they never depart three hundred yards from the village  letter lvi to the same they who write on natural history cannot too frequently advert to instinct that wonderful limited faculty which in some instances raises the brute creation as it were above reason and in others leaves them so far below it philosophers have defined instinct to be that secret influence by which every species is impelled naturally to pursue at all times the same way or track without any teaching or example whereas reason without instruction would often vary and do that by many methods which instinct effects by one alone now this maxim must be taken in a qualified sense for there are instances in which instinct does vary and conform to the circumstances of place and convenience  it has been remarked that every species of bird has a mode of nidification peculiar to itself so that a schoolboy would at once pronounce on the sort of nest before him this is the case among fields and woods and wilds but in the villages round london where mosses and gossamer and cotton from vegetables are hardly to be found the nest of the chaffinch has not that elegant finished appearance nor is it so beautifully studded with lichens as in a more rural district and the wren is obliged to construct it is house with straws and dry grasses which do not give it that rotundity and compactness so remarkable in the edifices of that little architect again the regular nest of the housemartin is hemispheric but where a rafter or a joist or a cornice may happen to stand in the way the nest is so contrived as to conform to the obstruction and becomes flat or oval or compressed  in the following instances instinct is perfectly uniform and consistent there are three creatures the squirrel the fieldmouse and the bird called the nutbatch sitta europaea which live much on hazlenuts and yet they open them each in a different way the first after rasping off the small end splits the shell in two with his long foreteeth as a man does with his knife the second nibbles a hole with his teeth so regular as if drilled with a wimble and yet so small that one would wonder how the kernel can be extracted through it while the last picks an irregular ragged hole with it is bill but as this artist has no paws to hold the nut firm while he pierces it like an adroit workman he fixes it as it were in a vice in some cleft of a tree or in some crevice when standing over it he perforates the stubborn shell we have often placed nuts in the chink of a gatepost where nuthatches have been known to haunt and have always found that those birds have readily penetrated them while at work they make a rapping noise that may be heard at a considerable distance  you that understand both the theory and practical part of music may best inform us why harmony or melody should so strangely affect some men as it were by recollection for days after a concert is over what i mean the following passage will most readily explain  praehabebat porro vocibus humanis instrumentisque harmonicis musicam illam avium non quod alia quoque non delectaretur sed quod ex musica humana relinqueretur in animo continens quaedam attentionemque et somnum conturbans agitatio dum ascensus exscensus tenores ac mutationes illae sonorum et consonantiarum euntque redeuntque per phantasiam  cum nihil tale relinqui possit ex modulationibus avium quae quod non sunt perinde a nobis imitabiles non possunt perinde internam facultatem commovere gassendus in vita peireskii  this curious quotation strikes me much by so well representing my own case and by describing what i have so often felt but never could so well express when i hear fine music i am haunted with passages therefrom night and day and especially at first waking which by their importunity give me more uneasiness than pleasure elegant lessons still tease my imagination and recur irresistibly to my recollection at seasons and even when i am desirous of thinking of more serious matters  i am etc  letter lvii to the same a rare and i think a new little bird frequents my garden which i have great reason to think is the pettichaps it is common in some parts of the kingdom and i have received formerly several dead specimens from gibraltar this bird much resembles the whitethroat but has a more white or rather silvery breast and belly is restless and active like the willowwrens and hops from bough to bough examining every part for food it also runs up the stems of the crownimperials and putting it is head into the bells of those flowers sips the liquor which stands in the nectarium of each petal sometimes it feeds on the ground like the hedgesparrow by hopping about on the grassplots and mown walks  one of my neighbors an intelligent and observing man informs me that in the beginning of may and about ten minutes before eight oclock in the evening he discovered a great cluster of houseswallows thirty at least he supposes perching on a willow that hung over the verge of james knights upperpond his attention was first drawn by the twittering of these birds which sat motionless in a row on the bough with their heads all one way and by their weight pressing down the twig so that it nearly touched the water in this situation he watched them till he could see no longer repeated accounts of this sort spring and fall induce us greatly to suspect that houseswallows have some strong attachment to water independent of the matter of food and though they may not retire into that element yet they may conceal themselves in the banks of pools and rivers during the uncomfortable months of winter  one of the keepers of woolmerforest sent me a peregrinefalcon which he shot on the verge of that district as it was devouring a woodpigeon the falco peregrinus or haggard falcon is a noble species of hawk seldom seen in the southern counties in winter      one was killed in the neighboring parish of faringdon and sent by me to mr pennant into north wales see my tenth and eleventh letter to that gentleman  since that time i have met with none till now the specimen mentioned above was in fine preservation and not injured by the shot it measured fortytwo inches from wing to wing and twentyone from beak to tail and weighed two pounds and an half standing weight this species is very robust and wonderfully formed for rapine it is breast was plump and muscular it is thighs long thick and brawny and it is legs remarkably short and well set the feet were armed with most formidable sharp long talons the eyelids and cere of the bill were yellow but the irides of the eyes dusky the beak was thick and hooked and of a dark color and had a jagged process near the end of the upper mandible on each side it is tail or train was short in proportion to the bulk of it is body yet the wings when closed did not extend to the end of the train from it is large and fair proportions it might be supposed to have been a female but i was not permitted to cut open the specimen for one of the birds of prey which are usually lean this was in high case in it is craw were many barleycorns which probably came from the crop of the woodpigeon on which it was feeding when shot for voracious birds do not eat grain but when devouring their quarry with undistinguishing vehemence swallow bones and feathers and all matters indiscriminately this falcon was probably driven from the mountains of north wales or scotland where they are known to breed by rigorous weather and deep snows that had lately fallen  i am etc  letter lviii to the same my near neighbor a young gentleman in the service of the east india company has brought home a dog and a bitch of the chinese breed from canton such as are fattened in that country for the purpose of being eaten they are about the size of a moderate spaniel of a pale yellow color with coarse bristling hairs on their backs sharp upright ears and peaked heads which give them a very foxlike appearance their hind legs are unusually straight without any bend at the hock or ham to such a degree as to give them an awkward gait when they trot when they are in motion their tails are curved high over their backs like those of some hounds and have a bare place each on the outside from the tip midway that does not seem to be matter of accident but somewhat singular their eyes are jetblack small and piercing the insides of their lips and mouths of the same color and their tongues blue the bitch has a dewclaw on each hind leg the dog has none when taken out into a field the bitch showed some disposition for hunting and dwelt on the scent of a covey of partridges till she sprung them giving her tongue all the time the dogs in south america are dumb but these bark much in a short thick manner like foxes and have a surly savage demeanor like their ancestors which are not domesticated but bred up in sties where they are fed for the table with ricemeal and other farinaceous food these dogs having been taken on board as soon as weaned could not learn much from their dam yet they did not relish flesh when they came to england in the islands of the pacific ocean the dogs are bred up on vegetables and would not eat flesh when offered them by our circumnavigators  we believe that all dogs in a state of nature have sharp upright foxlike ears and that hanging ears which are esteemed so graceful are the effect of choice breeding and cultivation thus in the travels of ysbrandt ides from muscovy to china the dogs which draw the tartars on snowsledges near the river oby are engraved with prickears like those from canton the kamschatdales also train the same sort of sharpeared peaknosed dogs to draw their sledges as may be seen in an elegant print engraved for captain cooks last voyage round the world  now we are upon the subject of dogs it may not be impertinent to add that spaniels as all sporsmen know though they hunt partridges and pheasants as it were by instinct and with much delight and alacrity yet will hardly touch their bones when offered as food nor will a mongrel dog of my own though he is remarkable for finding that sort of game but when we came to offer the bones of partridges to the two chinese dogs they devoured them with much greediness and licked the platter clean  no sporting dogs will flush woodcocks till inured to the scent and trained to the sport which they then pursue with vehemence and transport but then they will not touch their bones but turn from them with abhorrence even when they are hungry  now that dogs should not be fond of the bones of such birds as they are not disposed to hunt is no wonder but why they reject and do not care to eat their natural game is not so easily accounted for since the end of hunting seems to be that the chase pursued should be eaten dogs again will not devour the more rancid waterfowls nor indeed the bones of any wildfowls nor will they touch the foetid bodies of birds that feed on offal and garbage and indeed there may be somewhat of providential instinct in this circumstance of dislike for vultures hasselquist in his travels to the levant observes that the dogs and vultures at grand cairo maintain such a friendly intercourse as to bring up their young together in the same place  and kites and ravens and crows etc were intended to be messmates with dogs the chinese word for a dog to an european ear sounds like quihloh over their carrion and seem to be appointed by nature as fellowscavengers to remove all cadaverous nuisances from the face of the earth  i am etc  letter lix to the same the fossil wood buried in the bogs of wolmerforest is not yet all exhausted for the peatcutters now and then stumble upon a log i have just seen a piece which was sent by a labourer of oakhanger to a carpenter of this village this was the butend of a small oak about five feet long and about five inches in diameter it had apparently been severed from the ground by an axe was very ponderous and as black as ebony upon asking the carpenter for what purpose he had procured it he told me that it was to be sent to his brother a joiner at farnham who was to make use of it in cabinet work by inlaying it along with whiter woods  those that are much abroad on evenings after it is dark in spring and summer frequently hear a nocturnal bird passing by on the wing and repeating often a short quick note this bird i have remarked myself but never could make out till lately i am assured now that it is the stonecurlew charadrius oedicnemus some of them pass over or near my house almost every evening after it is dark from the uplands of the hill and north field away down toward dorton where among the streams and meadows they find a greater plenty of food birds that fly by night are obliged to be noisy their notes often repeated become signals or watchwords to keep them together that they may not stray or lose each the other in the dark  the evening proceedings and maneuvers of the rooks are curious and amusing in the autumn just before dusk they return in long strings from the foraging of the day and rendezvous by thousands over selbornedown where they wheel round in the air and sport and dive in a playful manner all the while exerting their voices and making a loud cawing which being blended and softened by the distance that we at the village are below them becomes a confused noise or chiding or rather a pleasing murmur very engaging to the imagination and not unlike the cry of a pack of hounds in hollow echoing woods or the rushing of the wind in tall trees or the tumbling of the tide upon a pebbly shore when this ceremony is over with the last gleam of day they retire for the night to the deep beechen woods of tisted and ropley we remember a little girl who as she was going to bed used to remark on such an occurrence in the true spirit of physicotheology that the rooks were saying their prayers and yet this child was much too young to be aware that the scriptures have said of the deity  that he feeds the ravens who call upon him  i am etc  letter lx to the same in reading dr huxhams observationes de aere etc written at plymouth i find by those curious and accurate remarks which contain an account of the weather from the year      to the year      inclusive that though there is frequent rain in that district of devonshire yet the quantity falling is not great and that some years it has been very small for in      the rain measured only   inch     thou and in       0      and again in      only  0   0  places near the sea have frequent scuds that keep the atmosphere moist yet do not reach far up into the country making thus the maritime situations appear wet when the rain is not considerable in the wettest years at plymouth the doctor measured only once    and again once viz              a quantity of rain that has twice been exceeded at selborne in the short period of my observations dr huxham remarks that frequent small rains keep the air moist while heavy ones render it more dry by beating down the vapors he is also of opinion that the dingy smoky appearance in the sky in very dry seasons arises from the want of moisture sufficient to let the light through and render the atmosphere transparent because he had observed several bodies more diaphanous when wet than dry and did never recollect that the air had that look in rainy seasons  my friend who lives just beyond the top of the down brought his three swivel guns to try them in my outlet with their muzzles toward the hanger supposing that the report would have had a great effect but the experiment did not answer his expectation he then removed them to the alcove on the hanger when the sound rushing along the lythe and combwood was very grand but it was at the hermitage that the echoes and repercussions delighted the hearers not only filling the lythe with the roar as if all the beeches were tearing up by the roots but turning to the left they pervaded the vale above combwoodponds and after a pause seemed to take up the crash again and to extend round harteleyhangers and to die away at last among the coppices and coverts of wardleham it has been remarked before that this district is an anathoth a place of responses or echoes and therefore proper for such experiments we may farther add that the pauses in echoes when they cease and yet are taken up again like the pauses in music surprise the hearers and have a fine effect on the imagination  the gentleman abovementioned has just fixed a barometer in his parlour at newton valence the tube was first filled here at selborne twice with care when the mercury agreed and stood exactly with my own but being filled again twice at newton the mercury stood on account of the great elevation of that house threetenths of an inch lower than the barometers at this village and so continues to do be the weight of the atmosphere what it may the plate of the barometer at newton is figured as low as    because in stormy weather the mercury there will sometimes descend below    we have supposed newtonhouse to stand two hundred feet higher than this house but if the rule holds good which says that mercury in a barometer sinks onetenth of an inch for every hundred feet elevation then the newton barometer by standing threetenths lower than that of selborne proves that newtonhouse must be three hundred feet higher than that in which i am writing instead of two hundred  it may not be impertinent to add that the barometers at selborne stand threetenths of an inch lower than the barometers at south lambeth whence we may conclude that the former place is about three hundred feet higher than the latter and with good reason because the streams that rise with us run into the thames at weybridge and so to london of course therefore there must be lower ground all the way from selborne to south lambeth the distance between which all the windings and indentings of the streams considered cannot be less than an hundred miles  i am etc  letter lxi to the same since the weather of a district is undoubtedly part of it is natural history i shall make no further apology for the four following letters which will contain many particulars concerning some of the great frosts and a few respecting some very hot summers that have distinguished themselves from the rest during the course of my observations  as the frost in january      was for the small time it lasted the most severe that we had then known for many years and was remarkably injurious to evergreens some account of it is rigor and reason of it is ravages may be useful and not unacceptable to persons that delight in planting and ornamenting and may particularly become a work that professes never to lose sight of utility  for the last two or three days of the former year there were considerable falls of snow which lay deep and uniform on the ground without any drifting wrapping up the more humble vegetation in perfect security from the first day to the fifth of the new year more snow succeeded but from that day the air became entirely clear and the heat of the sun about noon had a considerable influence in sheltered situations  it was in such an aspect that the snow on the authors evergreens was melted every day and frozen intensely every night so that the laurustines bays laurels and arbutuses looked in three or four days as if they had been burnt in the fire while a neighbors plantation of the same kind in a high cold situation where the snow was never melted at all remained uninjured  from hence i would infer that it is the repeated melting and freezing of the snow that is so fatal to vegetation rather than the severity of the cold therefore it highly behooves every planter who wishes to escape the cruel mortification of losing in a few days the labor and hopes of years to bestir himself on such emergencies and if his plantations are small to avail himself of mats cloths peasehaum straw reeds or any such covering for a short time or if his shrubberies are extensive to see that his people go about with prongs and forks and carefully dislodge the snow from the boughs since the naked foliage will shift much better for itself than where the snow is partly melted and frozen again  it may perhaps appear at first like a paradox but doubtless the more tender trees and shrubs should never be planted in hot aspects not only for the reason assigned above but also because thus circumstanced they are disposed to shoot earlier in the spring and to grow on later in the autumn than they would otherwise do and so are sufferers by lagging or early frosts for this reason also plants from siberia will hardly endure our climate because on the very first advances of spring they shoot away and so are cut off by the severe nights of march or april  dr fothergill and others have experienced the same inconvenience with respect to the more tender shrubs from north america which they therefore plant under northwalls there should also perhaps be a wall to the east to defend them from the piercing blasts from that quarter  this observation might without any impropriety be carried into animal life for discerning beemasters now find that their hives should not in the winter be exposed to the hot sun because such unseasonable warmth awakens the inhabitants too early from their slumbers and by putting their juices into motion too soon subjects them afterward to inconveniences when rigorous weather returns  the coincidents attending this short but intense frost were that the horses fell sick with an epidemic distemper which injured the winds of many and killed some that colds and coughs were general among the human species that it froze under peoples beds for several nights that meat was so hard frozen that it could not be spitted and could not be secured but in cellars that several redwings and thrushes were killed by the frost and that the large titmouse continued to pull straws lengthwise from the eaves of thatched houses and barns in a most adroit manner for a purpose that has been explained already see letter xli to mr pennant   on the  d of january benjamin martins thermometer within doors in a close parlour where there was no fire fell in the night to  0 and on the  th to    and on the  th to    a degree of cold which the owner never since saw in the same situation and he regrets much that he was not able at that juncture to attend his instrument abroad all this time the wind continued north and northeast and yet on the  th roostcocks which had been silent began to sound their clarions and crows to clamor as prognostic of milder weather and moreover moles began to heave and work and a manifest thaw took place from the latter circumstance we may conclude that thaws often originate under ground from warm vapors which arise else how should subterraneous animals receive such early intimations of their approach moreover we have often observed that cold seems to descend from above for when a thermometer hangs abroad in a frosty night the intervention of a cloud shall immediately raise the mercury ten degrees and a clear sky shall again compel it to descend to it is former gage  and here it may be proper to observe on what has been said above that though frosts advance to their utmost severity by somewhat of a regular gradation yet thaws do not usually come on by as regular a declension of cold but often take place immediately from intense freezing as men in sickness often mend at once from a paroxysm  to the great credit of portugal laurels and american junipers be it remembered that they remained untouched amidst the general havoc hence men should learn to ornament chiefly with such trees as are able to withstand accidental severities and not subject themselves to the vexation of a loss which may befall them once perhaps in ten years yet may hardly be recovered through the whole course of their lives  as it appeared afterward the ilexes were much injured the cypresses were half destroyed the arbutuses lingered on but never recovered and the bays laurustines and laurels were killed to the ground and the very wild hollies in hot aspects were so much affected that they cast all their leaves  by the   th of january the snow was entirely gone the turnips emerged not damaged at all save in sunny places the wheat looked delicately and the garden plants were well preserved for snow is the most kindly mantle that infant vegetation can be wrapped in were it not for that friendly meteor no vegetable life could exist at all in northerly regions yet in sweden the earth in april is not divested of snow for more than a fortnight before the face of the country is covered with flowers  letter lxi to the same there were some circumstances attending the remarkable frost in january      so singular and striking that a short detail of them may not be unacceptable  the most certain way to be exact will be to copy the passages from my journal which were taken from time to time as things occurred but it may be proper previously to remark that the first week in january was uncommonly wet and drowned with vast rains from every quarter from whence may be inferred as there is great reason to believe is the case that intense frosts seldom take place till the earth is perfectly glutted and chilled with water the autumn preceding january      was very wet and particularly the month of september during which there fell at lyndon in the county of rutland six inches and an half of rain and the terrible long frost in      0 set in after a rainy season and when the springs were very high  and hence dry autumns are seldom followed by rigorous winters  january  th  snow driving all the day which was followed by frost sleet and some snow till the   th when a prodigious mass overwhelmed all the works of men drifting over the tops of the gates and filling the hollow lanes  on the   th the writer was obliged to be much abroad and thinks he never before or since has encountered such rugged siberian weather many of the narrow roads were now filled above the tops of the hedges through which the snow was driven into most romantic and grotesque shapes so striking to the imagination as not to be seen without wonder and pleasure the poultry dared not to stir out of their roosting places for cocks and hens are so dazzled and confounded by the glare of snow that they would soon perish without assistance the hares also lay sullenly in their seats and would not move till compelled by hunger being conscious poor animals that the drifts and heaps treacherously betray their footsteps and prove fatal to numbers of them  from the   th the snow continued to increase and began to stop the road wagons and coaches which could no longer keep on their regular stages and especially on the western roads where the fall appears to have been deeper than in the south the company at bath that wanted to attend the queens birthday were strangely incommoded many carriages of persons who got in their way to town from bath as far as marlborough after strange embarrassments here met with a ne plus ultra the ladies fretted and offered large rewards to laborers if they would shovel them a track to london but the relentless heaps of snow were too bulky to be removed and so the   th passed over leaving the company in very uncomfortable circumstances at the castle and other inns  on the  0th the sun shone out for the first time since the frost began a circumstance that has been remarked before much in favor of vegetation all this time the cold was not very intense for the thermometer stood at          and thereabout but on the   st it descended to  0 the birds now began to be in a very pitiable and starving condition tamed by the season skylarks settled in the streets of towns because they saw the ground was bare rooks frequented dunghills close to houses and crows watched horses as they passed and greedily devoured what dropped from them hares now came into mens gardens and scraping away the snow devoured such plants as they could find  on the   d the author had occasion to go to london through a sort of laplandianscene very wild and grotesque indeed but the metropolis itself exhibited a still more singular appearance than the country for being bedded deep in snow the pavement of the streets could not be touched by the wheels or the horses feet so that the carriages ran about without the least noise such an exemption from din and clatter was strange but not pleasant it seemed to convey an uncomfortable idea of desolation   ipsa silentia terrent   on the   th much snow fell all day and in the evening the frost became very intense at south lambeth sor the four following nights the thermometer fell to          and at selborne to      0 and on the   st of january just before sunrise with rhyme on the trees and on the tube of the glass the quicksilver sunk exactly to zero being    degrees below the freezing point but by eleven in the morning though in the shade it sprung up to    at selborne the cold was greater than at any other place that the author could hear of with certainty though some reported at the time that at a village in kent the thermometer fell two degrees below zero viz    degrees below the freezing point  the thermometer used at selborne was graduated by benjamin martin     a most unusual degree of cold this for the south of england during these four nights the cold was so penetrating that it occasioned ice in warm chambers and under beds and in the day the wind was so keen that persons of robust constitutions could scarcely endure to face it the thames was at once so frozen over both above and below bridge that crowds ran about on the ice the streets were now strangely encumbered with snow which crumbled and trod dusty and turning gray resembled bay salt what had fallen on the roofs was so perfectly dry that from first to last it lay twentysix days on the houses in the city a longer time than had been remembered by the oldest housekeepers living according to all appearances we might now have expected the continuance of this rigorous weather for weeks to come since every night increased in severity but behold without any apparent cause on the  st of february a thaw took place and some rain followed before night making good the observation above that frosts often go off as it were at once without any gradual declension of cold on the  d of february the thaw persisted and on the  d swarms of little insects were frisking and sporting in a courtyard at south lambeth as if they had felt no frost why the juices in the small bodies and smaller limbs of such minute beings are not frozen is a matter of curious inquiry  severe frosts seem to be partial or to run in currents for at the same juncture as the author was informed by accurate correspondents at lyndon in the county of rutland the thermometer stood at    at blackburn in lancashire at    and at manchester at     0 and    thus does some unknown circumstance strangely overbalance latitude and render the cold sometimes much greater in the southern than the northern parts of this kingdom  the consequences of this severity were that in hampshire at the melting of the snow the wheat looked well and the turnips came forth little injured the laurels and laurustines were somewhat damaged but only in hot aspects no evergreens were quite destroyed and not half the damage sustained that befell in january      those laurels that were a little scorched on the southsides were perfectly untouched on their northsides the care taken to shake the snow day by day from the branches seemed greatly to avail the authors evergreens a neighbors laurelhedge in a high situation and facing to the north was perfectly green and vigorous and the portugal laurels remained unhurt  as to the birds the thrushes and blackbirds were mostly destroyed and the partridges by the weather and poachers were so thinned that few remained to breed the following year  letter lxii to the same as the frost in december      was very extraordinary you i trust will not be displeased to hear the particulars and especially when i promise to say no more about the severities of winter after i have finished this letter  the first week in december was very wet with the barometer very low on the  th with the barometer at     five tenths came on a vast snow which continued all that day and the next and most part of the following night so that by the morning of the  th the works of men were quite overwhelmed the lanes filled so as to be impassable and the ground covered twelve or fifteen inches without any drifting in the evening of the  th the air began to be so very sharp that we thought it would be curious to attend to the motions of a thermometer we therefore hung out two one made by martin and one by dollond which soon began to show us what we were to expect for by ten oclock they fell to    and at eleven to   when we went to bed on the  0th in the morning the quicksilver of dollonds glass was down to half a degree below zero and that of martins which was absurdly graduated only to four degrees above zero sunk quite into the brass guard of the ball so that when the weather became most interesting this was useless on the  0th at eleven at night though the air was perfectly still dollonds glass went down to one degree below zero this strange severity of the weather made me very desirous to know what degree of cold there might be in such an exalted and near situation as newton we had therefore on the morning of the  0th written to mr  and entreated him to hang out his thermometer made by adams and to pay some attention to it morning and evening expecting wonderful phenomenon in so elevated a region at two hundred feet or more above my house but behold on the  0th at eleven at night it was down only to    and the next morning at    when mine was at ten we were so disturbed at this unexpected reverse of comparative local cold that we sent one of my glasses up thinking that of mr  must some how be wrongly constructed but when the instruments came to be confronted they went exactly together so that for one night at least the cold at newton was    degrees less than at selborne and through the whole frost  0 or    degrees and indeed when we came to observe consequences we could readily credit this for all my laurustines bays ilexes arbutuses cypresses and even my portugal laurels mr miller in his gardeners dictionary says positively that the portugal laurels remained untouched in the remarkable frost of      0 so that either that accurate observer was much mistaken or else the frost of december      was much more severe and destructive than that in the year above mentioned  and which occasions more regret my fine sloping laurelhedge were scorched up while at newton the same trees have not lost a leaf  we had steady frost on to the   th when the thermometer in the morning was down to  0 with us and at newton only to    strong frost continued till the   st when some tendency to thaw was observed and by january the  d      the thaw was confirmed and some rain fell  a circumstance that i must not omit because it was new to us is that on friday december the  0th being bright sunshine the air was full of icy spiculae floating in all directions like atoms in a sunbeam let into a dark room we thought them at first particles of the rhyme falling from my tall hedges but were soon convinced to the contrary by making our observations in open places where no rhyme could reach us were they watery particles of the air frozen as they floated or were they evaporations from the snow frozen as they mounted  we were much obliged to the thermometers for the early information they gave us and hurried our apples pears onions potatoes etc into the cellar and warm closets while those who had not or neglected such warnings lost all their store of roots and fruits and had their very bread and cheese frozen  i must not omit to tell you that during those two siberian days my parlourcat was so electric that had a person stroked her and been properly insulated the shock might have been given to a whole circle of people  i forgot to mention before that during the two severe days two men who were tracing hares in the snow had their feet frozen and two men who were much better employed had their fingers so affected by the frost while they were thrashing in a barn that a mortification followed from which they did not recover for many weeks  this frost killed all the furze and most of the ivy and in many places stripped the hollies of all their leaves it came at a very early time of the year before old november ended and yet may be allowed from it is effects to have exceeded any since      0  letter lxiii to the same as the effects of heat are seldom very remarkable in the northerly climate of england where the summers are often so defective in warmth and sunshine as not to ripen the fruits of the earth so well as might be wished i shall be more concise in my account of the severity of a summer season and so make a little amends for the prolix account of the degrees of cold and the inconveniences that we suffered from some late rigorous winters  the summers of      and      were unusually hot and dry to them therefore i shall turn back in my journals without recurring to any more distant period in the former of these years my peach and nectarinetrees suffered so much from the heat that the rind on the bodies was scalded and came off since which the trees have been in a decaying state this may prove a hint to assiduous gardeners to fence and shelter their walltrees with mats or boards as they may easily do because such annoyance is seldom of long continuance during that summer also i observed that my apples were coddled as it were on the trees so that they had no quickness of flavor and would not keep in the winter this circumstance put me in mind of what i have heard travelers assert that they never ate a good apple or apricot in the south of europe where the heats were so great as to render the juices vapid and insipid  the great pests of a garden are wasps which destroy all the finer fruits just as they are coming into perfection in      we had none in      there were myriads which would have devoured all the produce of my garden had not we set the boys to take the nests and caught thousands with hazeltwigs tipped with birdlime we have since employed the boys to take and destroy the large breeding wasps in the spring such expedients have a great effect on these marauders and will keep them under though wasps do not abound but in hot summers yet they do not prevail in every hot summer as i have instanced in the two years abovementioned  in the sultry season of      honeydews were so frequent as to deface and destroy the beauties of my garden my honeysuckles which were one week the most sweet and lovely objects that the eye could behold became the next the most loathsome being enveloped in a viscous substance and loaded with black aphides or smotherflies the occasion of this clammy appearance seems to be this that in hot weather the effluvia of flowers in fields and meadows and gardens are drawn up in the day by a brisk evaporation and then in the night fall down again with the dews in which they are entangled that the air is strongly scented and therefore impregnated with the particles of flowers in summer weather our senses will inform us and that this clammy sweet substance is of the vegetable kind we may learn from bees to whom it is very grateful and we may be assured that it falls in the night because it is always first seen in warm still mornings  on chalky and sandy soils and in the hot villages about london the thermometer has been often observed to mount as high as    or    but with us in this hilly and woody district i have hardly ever seen it exceed  0 nor does it often arrive at that pitch the reason i conclude is that our dense clayey soil so much shaded by trees is not so easily heated through as those abovementioned and besides our mountains cause currents of air and breezes and the vast effluvia from our woodlands temper and moderate our heats  letter lxiv to the same the summer of the year      was an amazing and portentous one and full of horrible phenomenon for besides the alarming meteors and tremendous thunderstorms that affrighted and distressed the different counties of this kingdom the peculiar haze or smokey fog that prevailed for many weeks in this island and in every part of europe and even beyond it is limits was a most extraordinary appearance unlike any thing known within the memory of man by my journal i find that i had noticed this strange occurrence from june    to july  0 inclusive during which period the wind varied to every quarter without making any alteration in the air the sun at noon looked as blank as a clouded moon and shed a rustcoloured ferruginous light on the ground and floors of rooms but was particularly lurid and bloodcoloured at rising and setting all the time the heat was so intense that butchers meat could hardly be eaten on the day after it was killed and the flies swarmed so in the lanes and hedges that they rendered the horses half frantic and riding irksome the country people began to look with a superstitious awe at the red louring aspect of the sun and indeed there was reason for the most enlightened person to be apprehensive for all the while calabria and part of the isle of sicily were torn and convulsed with earthquakes and about that juncture a volcano sprung out of the sea on the coast of norway on this occasion miltons noble simile of the sun in his first book of paradise lost frequently occurred to my mind and it is indeed particularly applicable because toward the end it alludes to a superstitious kind of dread with which the minds of men are always impressed by such strange and unusual phenomenon    as when the sun new risen looks through the horizontal misty air  shorn of his beams or from behind the moon  in dim eclipse disastrous twilight sheds on half the nations and with fear of change  perplexes monarchs   letter lxv to the same we are very seldom annoyed with thunderstorms and it is no less remarkable than true that those which arise in the south have hardly been known to reach this village for before they get over us they take a direction to the east or to the west or sometimes divide into two and go in part to one of those quarters and in part to the other as was truly the case in summer      when though the country round was continually harassed with tempests and often from the south yet we escaped them all as appears by my journal of that summer the only way that i can at all account for this fact  for such it is  is that on that quarter between us and the sea there are continual mountains hill behind hill such as norehill the barnet butserbill and portsdown which some how divert the storms and give them a different direction high promontories and elevated grounds have always been observed to attract clouds and disarm them of their mischievous contents which are discharged into the trees and summits as soon as they come in contact with those turbulent meteors while the humble vales escape because they are so far beneath them  but when i say i do not remember a thunderstorm from the south i do not mean that we never have suffered from thunderstorms at all for on june  th      the thermometer in the morning being at    and at noon at  0 the barometer at     six tenths onehalf and the wind north i observed a blue mist smelling strongly of sulphur hanging along our sloping woods and seeming to indicate that thunder was at hand i was called in about two in the afternoon and so missed seeing the gathering of the clouds in the north which they who were abroad assured me had something uncommon in it is appearance at about a quarter after two the storm began in the parish of hartley moving slowly from north to south and from thence it came over nortonfarm and so to grangefarm both in this parish it began with vast drops of rain which were soon succeeded by round hail and then by unequal pieces of ice which measured three inches in girth had it been as extensive as it was violent and of any continuance for it was very short it must have ravaged all the neighborhood in the parish of hartley it did some damage to one farm but norton which lay in the center of the storm was greatly injured as was grange which lay next to it it did but just reach to the middle of the village where the hail broke my north windows and all my gardenlights and handglasses and many of my neighbors windows the extent of the storm was about two miles in length and one in breadth we were just sitting down to dinner but were soon diverted from our repast by the clattering of tiles and the jingling of glass there fell at the same time prodigious torrents of rain on the farms abovementioned which occasioned a flood as violent as it was sudden doing great damage to the meadows and fallows by deluging the one and washing away the soil of the other the hollow lane toward alton was so torn and disordered as not to be passable till mended rocks being removed that weighed  00 weight those that saw the effect which the great hail had on ponds and pools say that the dashing of the water made an extraordinary appearance the froth and spray standing up in the air three feet above the surface the rushing and roaring of the hail as it approached was truly tremendous  though the clouds at south lambeth near london were at that juncture thin and light and no storm was in sight nor within hearing yet the air was strongly electric for the bells of an electric machine at that place rang repeatedly and fierce sparks were discharged  when i first took the present work in hand i proposed to have added an annus historiconaturalis or the natural history of the twelve months of the year which would have comprised many incidents and occurrences that have not fallen in my way to be mentioned in my series of letters  but as mr aikin of warrington has lately published somewhat of this sort and as the length of my correspondence has sufficiently put your patience to the test i shall here take a respectful leave of you and natural history together  and am with all due deference and regard your most obliged and most humble servant gil white selborne june         the antiquities of

is reasonable to suppose that in remote ages this woody and mountainous district was inhabited only by bears and wolves whether the britons ever thought it worthy their attention is not in our power to determine but we may safely conclude from circumstances that it was not unknown to the romans old people remember to have heard their fathers and grandfathers say that in dry summers and in windy weather pieces of money were sometimes found round the verge of woolmerpond and tradition had inspired the foresters with a notion that the bottom of that lake contained great stores of treasure during the spring and summer of    0 there was little rain and the following summer also      was so uncommonly dry that many springs and ponds failed and this lake in particular whose bed became as dusty as the surrounding heaths and wastes this favorable juncture induced some of the forestcottagers to begin a search which was attended with such success that all the laborers in the neighborhood flocked to the spot and with spades and hoes turned up great part of that large area instead of pots of coins as they expected they found great heaps the one lying on the other as if shot out of a bag many of which were in good preservation silver and gold these inquirers expected to find but their discoveries consisted solely of many hundreds of roman coppercoins and some medallions all of the lower empire there was not much virtu stirring at that time in this neighborhood however some of the gentry and clergy around bought what pleased them best and some dozens fell to the share of the author  the owners at first held their commodity at an high price but finding that they were not likely to meet with dealers at such a rate they soon lowered their terms and sold the fairest as they could the coins that were rejected became current and passed for farthings at the petty shops of those that we saw the greater part were of marcus aurelius and the empress faustina his wife the father and mother of commodus some of faustina were in high relief and exhibited a very agreeable set of features which probably resembled that lady who was more celebrated for her beauty than for her virtues the medallions in general were of a paler color than the coins to pretend to account for the means of their coming to this place would be spending time in conjecture the spot i think could not be a roman camp because it is commanded by hills on two sides nor does it show the least traces of entrenchments nor can i suppose that it was a roman town because i have too good an opinion of the taste and judgment of those polished conquerors to imagine that they would settle on so barren and dreary a waste  letter ii that selborne was a place of some distinction and note in the time of the saxons we can give most undoubted proofs but as there are few if any accounts of villages before domesday it will be best to begin with that venerable record ipse rex tenet selesburne eddid regina tenuit et nunquam geldavit de isto manerio dono dedit rex radfredo presbytero dimidiam hidam cum ecelesia tempore regis edwardi et post valuit duodecim solidos et sex denarios modo octo solidos et quatuor denarios here we see that selborne was a royal manor and that editha the queen of edward the confessor had been lady of that manor and was succeeded in it by the conqueror and that it had a church beside these many circumstances concur to prove it to have been a saxon village such as the name of the place itself selesburne seleburne selburn selbourn selborne and selborn as it has been variously spelt at different periods is of saxon derivation for sell signifies great and burn torrens a brook or rivulet so that the name seems to be derived from the great perennial stream that breaks out at the upper end of the village  sell also signifies bonus item foecundus fertilis  foecunda graminis clausura fertile pascuum a meadow in the parish of godelming is still called salgarston lyes saxon dictionary in the supplement by mr manning  the names of many fields and some families thus the name of aldred signifies allreverend and that of kemp means a soldier thus we have a churchlitton or enclosure for dead bodies and not a churchyard there is also a culvercroft near the grangefarm being the enclosure where the priory pigeonhouse stood from culver a pigeon again there are three steep pastures in this parish called the lithe from hlithe clivus the wickerwork that binds and fastens down a hedge on the top is called either from either an hedge when the good women call their hogs they cry sic sic  laconus un porceau chez les lacedemoniens ce mot a sans doubt este pris  sic pour marqu un porceau encore aujourhuy quand les bretons chassent ces animaus ils ne disent point autrement que sic sic antiquite de la nation et de la langue des celtes par pezron  not knowing that sic is saxon or rather celtic for a hog coppice or brush wood our countrymen call rise from hris frondes and talk of a load of rise within the authors memory the saxon plurals housen and peason were in common use but it would be endless to instance in every circumstance he that wishes for more specimens must frequent a farmers kitchen i have therefore selected some words to show how familiar the saxen dialect was to this district since in more than seven hundred years it is fur from being obliterated  with a variety of words in husbandry and common life still subsisting among the country people  what probably first drew the attention of the saxons to this spot was the beautiful spring or fountain called wellhead wellhead signifies spring head and not a deep pit from whence we draw water for particulars about which see letter i to mr pennant  which induced them to build by the banks of that perennial current for ancient settlers loved to reside by brooks and rivulets where they could dip for their water without the trouble and expense of digging wells and of drawing  it remains still unsettled among the antiquaries at what time tracts of land were first appropriated to the chase alone for the amusement of the sovereign whether our saxon monarchs had any royal forests does not i believe appear on record but the constitutiones de foresta of canute the dane are come down to us we shall not therefore pretend to say whether woolmerforest existed as a royal domain before the conquest if it did not we may suppose it was laid out by some of our earliest norman kings who were exceedingly attached to the pleasures of the chase and resided much at winchester which lies at a moderate distance from this destrict the plantagenet princes seem to have been pleased with woolmer for tradition says that king john resided just upon the verge at wardleham on a regular and remarkable mount still called king johns hill and lodge hill and edward iii had a chapel in his park or enclosure at kingsley the parish of kingsley lies between and divides woolmerforest from ails holtforest see letter ix to mr pennant  humphrey duke of gloucester and richard duke of york say my evidences were both in their turns wardens of woolmerforest which seems to have served for an appointment for the younger princes of the royal family as it may again  i have intentionally mentioned edward iii and the dukes humphrey and richard before king edward ii because i have reserved for the entertainment of my readers a pleasant anecdote respecting that prince with which i shall close this letter  as edward ii was hunting on woolmerforest morris ken of the kitchen fell from his horse several times at which accidents the king laughed immoderately and when the chase was over ordered him twenty shillings item paid at the lodge at woolmer when the king was staghunting there to morris ken of the kitchen because he rode before the king and often fell from his horse at which the king laughed exceedingly  a gift by command of twenty shillings a mss in possession of thomas astle esquire containing the private expenses of edward ii  an enormous sum for those days proper allowances ought to be made for the youth of this monarch whose spirits also we may suppose were much exhilarated by the sport of the day but at the same time it is reasonable to remark that whatever might be the occasion of kens first fall the subsequent ones seem to have been designed the scullion appears to have been an artful fellow and to have seen the kings foible which furnishes an early specimen of that his easy softness and facility of temper of which the infamous gaveston took such advantages as brought innumerable calamities on the nation and involved the prince at last in misfortunes and sufferings too deplorable to be mentioned without horror and amazement  letter iii from the silence of domesday respecting churches it has been supposed that few villages had any at the time when that record was taken but selborne we see enjoyed the benefit of one hence we may conclude that this place was in no abject state even at that very distant period how many fabrics have succeeded each other since the days of radfredrus the presbyter we cannot pretend to say our business leads us to a description of the present edifice in which we shall be circumstantial  our church which was dedicated to the virgin mary consists of three ailes and measures fiftyfour feet in length by fortyseven in breadth being almost as broad as it is long the present building has no pretensions to antiquity and is as i suppose of no earlier date than the beginning of the reign of henry vii south view of selborne church pl vi pa      south view of selborne church p mazell sculp s h grimm del  published        by b white and son  it is perfectly plain and unadorned without painted glass carved work sculpture or tracery but when i say it has no claim to antiquity i would mean to be understood of the fabric in general for the pillars which support the roof are undoubtedly old being of that low squat thick order usually called saxon these i should imagine upheld the roof of a former church which falling into decay was rebuilt on those massy props because their strength had preserved them from the injuries of time in the same manner to compare great things with small did wykeham when he newbuilt the cathedral at winchester from the tower westward apply to his purpose the old piers or pillars of bishop walkelins church by blending saxon and gothic architecture together see lowths life of wykeham  upon these rest blunt gothic arches such as prevailed in the reign abovementioned and by which as a criterion we would prove the date of the building  at the bottom of the south aile between the west and south doors stands the font which is deep and capacious and consists of three massy round stones piled one on another without the least ornament or sculpture the cavity at the top is lined with lead and has a pipe at bottom to convey off the water after the sacred ceremony is performed  the east end of the south aile is called the south chancel and till within these thirty years was divided off by old carved gothic framework of timber having been a private chantry in this opinion we are more confirmed by observing two gothic niches within the space the one in the east wall and the other in the south near which there probably stood images and altars  in the middle aile there is nothing remarkable but i remember when it is beams were hung with garlands in honor of young women of the parish reputed to have died virgins and recollect to have seen the clerks wife cutting in white paper the resemblances of gloves and ribbons to be twisted into knots and roses to decorate these memorials of chastity in the church of faringdon which is the next parish many garlands of this sort still remain  the north aile is narrow and low with a sloping ceiling reaching within eight or nine feet of the floor it had originally a flat roof covered with lead till within a century past a churchwarden stripping off the lead in order as he said to have it mended sold it to a plumber and ran away with the money this aile has no door for an obvious reason because the northside of the churchyard being surrounded by the vicaragegarden affords no path to that side of the church nothing can be more irregular than the pews of this church which are of all dimensions and heights being patched up according to the fancy of the owners but whoever nicely examines them will find that the middle aile had on each side a regular row of benches of solid oak all alike with a low backboard to each these we should not hesitate to say are coeval with the present church and especially as it is to be observed that at their ends they are ornamented with carved blunt gothic niches exactly correspondent to the arches of the church and to a niche in the south wall the south aile also has a row of these benches but some are decayed through age and the rest much disguised by modern alterations  at the upper end of this aile and running out to the north stands a transept known by the name of the north chancel measuring twentyone feet from south to north and nineteen feet from east to west this was intended no doubt as a private chantry and was also till of late divided off by a gothic framework of timber in its north wall under a very blunt gothic arch lies perhaps the founder of this edifice which from the shape of its arch may be deemed no older than the latter end of the reign of henry vii the tomb was examined some years ago but contained nothing except the scull and thighbones of a large tall man and the bones of a youth or woman lying in a very irregular manner without any escutcheon or other token to ascertain the names or rank of the deceased the grave was very shallow and lined with stone at the bottom and on the sides  from the east wall project four stone brackets which i conclude supported images and crucifixes in the great thick pilaster jutting out between this transept and the chancel there is a very sharp gothic niche of older date than the present chantry or church but the chief pieces of antiquity are two narrow stone coffinlids which compose part of the floor and lie from west to east with the very narrow ends eastward these belong to remote times and if originally placed here which i doubt must have been part of the pavement of an older transept at present there are no coffins under them whence i conclude they have been removed to this place from some part of a sormer church one of these lids is so eaten by time that no sculpture can be discovered upon it or perhaps it may be the wrong side uppermost but on the other which seems to be of stone of a closer and harder texture is to be discerned a discus with a cross on it at the end of a staff or rod the wellknown symbol of a knighttemplar see dugdale monasticon anglicanum vol ii where there is a fine engraving of a knighttemplar by hollar   this order was distinguished by a red cross on the left shoulder of their cloak and by this attribute in their hand now if these stones belonged to knights templars they must have lain here many centuries for this order came into england early in the reign of king stephen in      and was dissolved in the time of edward ii in      having subsisted only one hundred and ninetynine years why i should suppose that knights templars were occasionally buried at this church will appear in some future letter when we come to treat more particularly concerning the property they possessed here and the intercourse that subsisted between them and the priors of selborne  we must now proceed to the chancel properly so called which seems to be coeval with the church and is in the same plain unadorned style though neatly kept this room measures thirtyone feet in length and sixteen feet and an half in breadth and is wainscoted all round as high as to the bottom of the windows the space for the communion table is raised two steps above the rest of the floor and railed in with oaken balusters here i shall say somewhat of the windows of the chancel in particular and of the whole fabric in general they are mostly of that simple and unadorned sort called lancet some single some double and some in triplets at the east end of the chancel are two of a moderate size near each other and in the north wall two very distant small ones unequal in length and height and in the south wall are two one on each side of the chancel door that are broad and squat and of a different order at the east end of the south aile of the church there is a large lancetwindow in a triplet and two very small narrow single ones in the south wall and a broad squat window beside and a double lancet one in the west end so that the appearance is very irregular in the north aile are two windows made shorter when the roof was sloped and in the north transept a large triple window shortened at the time of a repair in      when over it was opened a round one of considerable size which affords an agreeable light and renders that chantry the most cheerful part of the edifice  the church and chancels have all coved roofs ceiled about the year      before which they were open to the tiles and shingles showing the naked rafters and threatening the congregation with the fall of a spar or a blow from a piece of loose mortar  on the north wall of the chancel is fixed a large oval white marble monument with the following inscription and at the foot of the wall over the deceased and inscribed with his name age arms and time of death lies a large slab of black marble prope hunc parietem sepelitur   on the same wall is newly fixed a small square tablemonument of white marble inscribed in the following manner sacred to the memory   letter iv we have now taken leave of the inside of the church and shall pass by a door at the west end of the middle aile into the belfry this room is part of a handsome square embattled tower of fortyfive feet in height and of much more modern date than the church but old enough to have needed a thorough repair in      when it was neatly stuccoed at a considerable expense by a set of workmen who were employed on it for the greatest part of the summer the old bells three in number loud and out of tune were taken down in      and cast into four to which sir simeon stuart the grandfather of the present baronet added a fifth at his own expense and bestowing it in the name of his favorite daughter mrs mary stuart caused it to be cast with the following motto round it clara puella dedit dixitque mihi esto maria illius et lauds nomen ad astra sono   the day of the arrival of this tuneable peal was observed as an high festival by the village and rendered more joyous by an order from the donor that the treblebell should be fixed bottom upward in the ground and filled with punch of which all present were permitted to partake  the porch of the church to the south is modern and would not be worthy attention did it not shelter a fine sharp gothic doorway this is undoubtedly much older than the present fabric and being found in good preservation was worked into the wall and is the grand entrance into the church nor are the foldingdoors to be passed over in silence since from their thick and clumsy structure and the rude flourishedwork of their hinges they may possibly be as ancient as the doorway itself  the whole roof of the south aile and the south side of the roof of the middle aile is covered with oaken shingles instead of tiles on account of their lightness which favors the ancient and crazy timberframe and indeed the consideration of accidents by fire excepted this sort of roofing is much more eligible than tiles for shingles well seasoned and cleft from quartered timber never warp nor let in drifting snow nor do they shiver with frost nor are they liable to be blown off like tiles but when well nailed down last for a long period as experience has shown us in this place where those that face to the north are known to have endured untouched by undoubted tradition for more than a century  considering the size of the church and the extent of the parish the churchyard is very scanty and especially as all wish to be buried on the south side which is become such a mass of mortality that no person can be there interred without disturbing or displacing the bones of his ancestors there is reason to suppose that it once was larger and extended to what is now the vicarage court and garden because many human bones have been dug up in those parts several yards without the present limits at the east end are a few graves yet none till very lately on the northside but as two or three families of best repute have begun to bury in that quarter prejudice may wear out by degrees and their example be followed by the rest of the neighborhood  north view of selborne church pl vii pa      north view of selborne church s h grimm del p mazell sculp  published        by b white and son    in speaking of the church i have all along talked of the east and west end as if the chancel stood exactly true to those points of the compass but this is by no means the case for the fabric bears so much to the north of the east that the four corners of the tower and not the four sides stand to the four cardinal points the best method of accounting for this deviation seems to be that the workmen who probably were employed in the longest days endeavored to set the chancels to the rising of the sun  close by the church at the west end stands the vicaragehouse an old but roomy and convenient edifice it faces very agreeably to the morning sun and is divided from the village by a neat and cheerful court according to the manner of old times the hall was open to the roof and so continued probably till the vicars became familymen and began to want more conveniences when they flung a floor across and by partitions divided the space into chambers in this hall we remember a date some time in the reign of elizabeth it was over the door that leads to the stairs  behind the house is a garden of an irregular shape but well laid out whose terrace commands so romantic and picturesque a prospect that the first master in landscape might contemplate it with pleasure and deem it an object well worthy of his pencil  letter v in the churchyard of this village is a yewtree whose aspect bespeaks it to be of a great age it seems to have seen several centuries and is probably coeval with the church and therefore may be deemed an antiquity the body is squat short and thick and measures twentythree feet in the girth supporting an head of suitable extent to it is bulk this is a male tree which in the spring sheds clouds of dust and fills the atmosphere around with it is farina  as far as we have been able to observe the males of this species become much larger than the females and it has so fallen out that most of the yewtrees in the churchyards of this neighborhood are males but this must have been matter of mere accident since men when they first planted yews little dreamed that there were sexes in trees  in a yard in the midst of the street till very lately grew a middlesized female tree of the same species which commonly bore great crops of berries by the high winds usually prevailing about the autumnal equinox these berries then ripe were blown down into the road where the hogs ate them and it was very remarkable that though barrowhogs and young sows found no inconvenience from this food yet milchsows often died after such a repast a circumstance that can be accounted for only by supposing that the latter being much exhausted and hungry devoured a larger quantity  while mention is making of the bad effects of yewberries it may be proper to remind the unwary that the twigs and leaves of yew though eaten in a very small quantity are certain death to horses and cows and that in a few minutes an horse tied to a yewhedge or to a faggotstack of dead yew shall be found dead before the owner can be aware that any danger is at hand and the writer has been several times a sorrowful witness to losses of this kind among his friends and in the island of ely had once the mortification to see nine young steers or bullocks of his own all lying dead in an heap from browzing a little on an hedge of yew in an old garden into which they had broken in snowy weather even the clippings of a yewhedge have destroyed a whole dairy of cows when thrown inadvertently into a yard and yet sheep and turkies and as parkkeepers say deer will crop these trees with impunity  some intelligent persons assert that the branches of yew while green are not noxious and that they will kill only when dead and withered by lacerating the stomach but to this assertion we cannot by any means assent because among the number of cattle that we have known fall victims to this deadly food not one has been found when it was opened but had a lump of green yew in it is paunch true it is that yewtrees stand for twenty years or more in a field and no bad consequences ensue but at some time or other cattle either from wantonness when full or from hunger when empty from both which circumstances we have seen them perish will be meddling to their certain destruction the yew seems to be a very improper tree for a pasturefield  antiquaries seem much at a loss to determine at what period this tree first obtained a place in churchyards a statute passed ad   0  and    edward i the title of which is ne rector arbores in cemeterio prosternat now if it is recollected that we seldom see any other very large or ancient tree in a churchyard but yews this statute must have principally related to this species of tree and consequently their being planted in churchyards is of much more ancient date than the year   0   as to the use of these trees possibly the more respectable parishioners were buried under their shade before the improper custom was introduced of burying within the body of the church where the living are to assemble deborah rebekahs nurse genesis xxxv    was buried under an oak the most honorable place of interment probably next to the cave of machpelah genesis xxiii    which seems to have been appropriated to the remains of the patriarchal family alone  the farther use of yewtrees might be as a screen to churches by their thick foliage from the violence of winds perhaps also for the purpose of archery the best long bows being made of that material and we do not hear that they are planted in the churchyards of other parts of europe where long bows were not so much in use they might also be placed as a shelter to the congregation assembling before the churchdoors were opened and as an emblem of mortality by their funereal appearance in the south of england every churchyard almost has it is tree and some two but in the north we understand few are to be found  the idea of r c that the yewtree afforded it is branches instead of palms for the processions on palm sunday is a good one and deserves attention see gent mag vol l p      letter vi the living of selborne was a

after he was dispossessed retired to a little tenement about one hundred and fifty yards from the church where he earned a small pittance by the practice of physic during those dismal times it was not uncommon for the deposed clergy to take up a medical character as was the case in particular i know with the reverend mr yalden rector of compton near guildford in the county of surrey vicar longworth used frequently to mention to his sons who told it to my relations that the sunday after his deprivation his puritanical successor stepped into the pulpit with no small petulance and exultation and

impoverished by his misfortunes that he left the vicaragehouse and premises in a very abject and dilapidated state  july      richard byfield who left eighty pounds by will the interest to be applied

three per cents reduced the trustees are the vicar and the renters or owners of temple priory grange blackmore and oakhangerhouse for the time being this gentleman seemed inclined to have put the vicarial premises in a comfortable state and began by building a solid stone wall round the frontcourt and another in the lower yard between that and the neighboring garden but was interrupted by death from fulfilling his laudable intentions  april    0 barnabas long became vicar  june      this living was now in such low estimation in magdalencollege that it descended to a junior fellow gilbert white ma who was instituted to it in the thirtyfirst year of his age at his first coming he ceiled the chancel and also floored and wainscoted the parlour and hall which before were paved with stone and had naked walls he enlarged the kitchen and brewhouse and dug a cellar and well he also built a large new barn in the lower yard removed the hovels in the front court which he laid out in walks and borders and entirely planned the back garden before a rude field with a stonepit in the midst of it by his will he gave and bequeathed the sum of forty pounds to be laid out in the most necessary repairs of the church that is in strengthening and securing such parts as seem decaying and dangerous with this sum two large buttresses were erected to support the east end of the south wall of the church and the gableend wall of the west end of the south aile was new built from the ground  by his will also he gave one hundred pounds to be laid out on lands the yearly rents whereof shall be employed in teaching the poor children of selbourn parish to read and write and say their prayers and catechism and to sew and knit  and be under the direction of his executrix as long as she lives and after her under the direction of such of his children and their issue as shall live in or within five miles of the said parish and on failure of any such then under the direction of the vicar of selbourn for the time being but still to the uses abovenamed with this sum was purchased of thomas turville of hawkeley in the county of southampton yeoman and hannah his wife two closes of freehold land commonly called colliers containing by estimation eleven acres lying in hawkeley aforesaid these closes are let at this time      on lease at the rate of three pounds by the year  this vicar also gave by will two hundred pounds toward the repairs of the highways such legacies were very common in former times before any effectual laws were made for the repairs of highways sir john cuhum s hawsted p    in the parish of selborne that sum was carefully and judiciously laid out in the summer of the year    0 by his son john white who made a solid and firm causey from roodgreen all down honeylane to a farm called oakwoods where the sandy soil begins this miry and gulfy lane was chosen as worthy of repair because it leads to the forest and thence through the holt to the town of farnham in surrey the only market in those days for men who had wheat to sell in this neighborhood this causey was so deeply bedded with stone so properly raised above the level of the soil and so well drained that it has in some degree withstood fiftyfour years of neglect and abuse and might with moderate attention be rendered a solid and comfortable road the space from roodgreen to oakwoods measures about three quarters of a mile  in      william henry cane bd became vicar and among several alterations and repairs newbuilt the back front of the vicaragehouse  on february      0 duncombe bristowe dd was instituted to this living what benefactions this vicar bestowed on the parish will be best explained by the following passages from his will   item i hereby give and bequeath to the minister and churchwardens of the parish of selbourn in the county of southampton a mahogany table which i have ordered to be made for the celebration of the holy communion and also the sum of thirty pounds in trust to be applied in manner following that is ten pounds toward the charge of erecting a gallery at the west end of the church and ten pounds to be laid out for clothing and such like necessaries among the poor and especially among the ancient and infirm of the said parish and the remaining ten pounds to be distributed in bread at twenty shillings a week at the discretion of john white esquire or any of his family who shall be resident in the said parish  on november         andrew etty bd became vicar among many useful repairs he newroofed the body of the vicaragehouse and wainscoted up to the bottom of the windows the whole of the chancel to the neatness and decency of which he always paid the most exact attention  on september         christopher tailor bd was inducted into the vicarage of selborne  letter vii i shall now proceed to the priory which is undoubtedly the most interesting part of our history  the priory of selborne was founded by peter de la roche or de rupibus see godwin de praesulibus anglia folio london      p      one of those accomplished foreigners that resorted to the court of king john where they were usually caressed and met with a more favorable reception than ought in prudence to have been shown by any monarch to strangers this adventurer was a poictevin by birth had been bred to arms in his youth and distinguished by knighthood historians all agree not to speak very favorably of this remarkable man they allow that he was possessed of courage and fine abilities but then they charge him with arbitrary principles and violent conduct by his insinuating manners he soon rose high in the favor of john and in   0  early in the reign of that prince was appointed bishop of winchester in      he became lord chief justiciary of england the first magistrate in the state and a kind of viceroy on whom depended all the civil affairs in the kingdom after the death of john and during the minority of his son henry this prelate took upon him the entire management of the realm and was soon appointed protector of the king and kingdom  the barons saw with indignation a stranger possessed of all the power and influence to part of which they thought they had a claim they therefore entered into an association against him and determined to wrest some of that authority from him which he had so unreasonably usurped the bishop discerned the storm at a distance and prudently resolving to give way to that torrent of envy which he knew not how to withstand withdrew quietly to the holy land where he resided some time  at this juncture a very small part of palestine remained in the hands of the christians they had been by saladine dispossessed of jerusalem and all the internal parts near forty years before and with difficulty maintained some maritime towns and garrisons yet the busy and enterprising spirit of de rupibus could not be at rest he distinguished himself by the splendor and magnificence of his expenses and amused his mind by strengthening fortresses and castles and by removing and endowing of churches before his expedition to the east he had signalized himself as a founder of convents and as a benefactor to hospitals and monasteries  in the year      he returned again to england and the very next year in      began to build and endow the priory of selborne as this great work followed so close upon his return it is not improbable that it was the result of a vow made during his voyage and especially as it was dedicated to the virgin mary why the bishop made choice of selborne for the scene of his munificence can never be determined now it can only be said that the parish was in his diocese and lay almost midway between winchester and farnham or south waltham and farnham from either of which places he could without much trouble overlook his workmen and observe what progress they made and that the situation was retired with a stream running by it and sequestered from the world amidst woods and meadows and so far proper for the site of a religious house the institution at selborne was a priory of blackcanons of the order of st agustine called also canonsregular regularcanons were such as lived in a conventual manner under one roof had a common refectory and dormitary and were bound by vows to observe the rules and statutes of their order in fine they were a kind of religious whose discipline was less rigid than the monks the chief rule of these canons was that of st augustine who was constituted bishop of hippo ad     but they were not brought into england till after the conquest and seem not to have obtained the appellation of augustine canons till some years after their habit was a long black cassack with a white rocket over it and over that a black cloak and hood the monks were always shaved but these canons were their hair and beards and caps on their heads there were of these canons and women of the same order called canonesses about     houses   the first person with whom the founder treated about the purchase of land was jacobus de achangre or ochangre a gentleman of property who resided at that hamlet and as appears at the house now called oakhangerhouse with him he agreed for a croft or little close of land known by the name of la liega or la lyge which was to be the immediate site of the priory  de achangre also accommodated the bishop at the same instant with three more adjoining crofts which for a time was all the footing that this institution obtained in the parish the seller in the conveyance says warantizabimus defendemus et aequietabimus contra omnes gentes viz we will warrant the thing sold against all claims from any quarter in modern conveyancing this would be termed a covenant for further assurance afterward is added  pro hac autem donacione etc dedit mihi pred episcopus sexdecem marcas argenti in gersumam i e the bishop gave me sixteen silver marks as a consideration for the thing purchased  as the grant from jac de achangre was without date the custom of affixing dates to deeds was not become general in the reign of henry iii  and the next is circumstanced in the same manner we cannot say exactly what interval there was between the two purchases but we find that jacobus de nortun a neighboring gentleman also soon sold to the bishop of winehester some adjoining grounds through which our stream passes that the priory might be accommodated with a mill which was a common necessary appendage to every manor he also allowed access to these lands by a road for carts and wagons   jacobus de nortun concedit petro winton episcopo totum cursum aque que descendit de molendino de durton usque ad boscum will mauduit et croftam terre vocat edriche croft cum extensione ejusdem et abuttamentis ad fundandam domum religiosam de ordine sti augustini concedit etiam viam ad carros et caretas etc this vale down which runs the brook is now called the long lithe or lythe bating the following particular expression this grant runs much in the style of the former dedit mihi episcopus predictus triginta quinque marcas argenti ad me acquietandum versus judaeos  that is the bishop advanced me thirtyfive marks of silver to pay my debts to the jews who were then the only lenders of money  finding himself still streightened for room the founder applied to his royal master henry who was graciously pleased to bestow certain lands in the manor at selborne on the new priory of his favorite minister these grounds had been the property of stephen de lucy and abutting upon the narrow limits of the convent became a very commodious and agreeable acquisition this grant i find was made on march the  th in the eighteenth year of henry viz      being two years after the foundation of the monastery the royal donor bestowed his favor with a good grace by adding to it almost every immunity and privilege that could have been specified in the lawlanguage of the times  quare volumus prior etc habeant totam terram etc cum omnibus libertatibus in bosco et plano in viis et semitis pratis et pascuis aquis et piscariis infra burgum et extra

of chichester then chancellor at the town of northampton before the lord chief justiciary who was the founder himself  the charter of foundation of the priory dated      comes next in order to be considered but being of some length i shall not interrupt my narrative by placing it here and therefore refer the reader to the appendix no i this my copy taken from the original i have compared with dugdales copy and find that they perfectly agree except that in the latter the preamble and the names of the witnesses are omitted yet i think it proper to quote a passage from this charter  et ipsa domus religiosa a cujuslibet alterius domus religiosae subjectione libera permaneat et in omnibus absoluta  to show how much dugdale was mistaken when he inserted selborne among the alien priories forgetting that this disposition of the convent contradicted the grant that he had published in the monasticon anglicanum in english p     is part of his catalogue of alien priories suppressed   henry v viz      where may be seen as follows s sele sussex seleburn shirburn   this appeared to me from the first to have been an oversight before i had seen my authentic evidences for priories alien a few conventual ones excepted were little better than granges to foreign abbeys and their priors little more than bailiffs removeable at will whereas the priory of selborne possessed the valuable estates and manors of selborne achangre norton brompden bassinges basingstoke and natele and the prior challenged the right of pillory thurcet and fureas and every manerial privilege  i find next a grant from jo de venur or venuz to the prior of selborne  de tota mora a moor or bog ubi beme oritur usque ad campum vivarii et de prato voc sydenmeade cum abutt et de cursu aque molendini and also a grant in reversion unius virgate terre a yard land in aehangre at the death of richard actedene his sisters husband who had no child he was to present a pair of gloves of one penny value to the prior and canons to be given annually by the said richard and to quit all claim to the said lands in reversion provided the prior and canons would engage annually to pay to the king through the hands of his bailiffs of aulton ten shillings at four quarterly payments pro omnibus serviciis consuetudinibus exactionibus et demandis  this jo de venur was a man of property at oakhanger and lived probably at the spot now called chapelfarm the grant bears date the   th year of the reign of henry iii  viz       it would be tedious to enumerate every little grant for lands or tenements that might be produced from my vouchers i shall therefore pass over all such for the present and conclude this letter with a remark that must strike every thinking person with some degree of wonder no sooner had a monastic institution got a footing but the neighborhood began to be touched with a secret and religious awe every person round was desirous to promote so good a work and either by sale by grant or by gift in reversion was ambitious of appearing a benefactor they who had not lands to spare gave roads to accommodate the infant foundation the religious were not backward in keeping up this pious propensity which they observed so readily influenced the breasts of men thus did the more opulent monasteries add house to house and field to field and by degrees manor to manor till at last there was no place left but every district around became appropriated to the purposes of their founders and every precinct was drawn into the vortex  letter viii our forefathers in this village were no doubt as busy and bustling and as important as ourselves yet have their names and transactions been forgotten from century to century and have sunk into oblivion nor has this happened only to the vulgar but even to men remarkable and famous in their generation i was led into this train of thinking by finding in my vouchers that sir adam gurdon was an inhabitant of selborne and a man of the first rank and property in the parish by sir adam gurdon i would be understood to mean that leading and accomplished malecontent in the mountfort faction who distinguished himself by his daring conduct in the reign of henry iii the first that we hear of this person in my papers is that with two others he was bailiff of alton before the sixteenth of henry iii viz about      and then not knighted who gurdon was and whence he came does not appear yet there is reason to suspect that he was originally a mere soldier of fortune who had raised himself by marrying women of property the name of gurdon does not seem to be known in the south but there is a name so like it in an adjoining kingdom and which belongs to two or three noble families that it is probable this remarkable person was a north briton and the more so since the christian name of adam is a distinguished one to this day among the family of the gordons  but be this as it may sir adam gurdon has been noticed by all the writers of english history for his bold disposition and disaffected spirit in that he not only figured during the successful rebellion of leicester but kept up the war after the defeat and death of that barons entrenching himself in the woods of hampshire toward the town of farnham after the battle of evesham in which mountfort fell in the year      gurdon might not think it safe to return to his house for fear of a surprise but cautiously fortified himself amidst the forests and woodlands with which he was so well acquainted prince edward desirous of putting an end to the troubles which had so long harassed the kingdom pursued the archrebel into his fastnesses attacked his camp leaped over the entrenchments and singling out gurdon ran him down wounded him and took him prisoner m paris p     and triveti annale   there is not perhaps in all history a more remarkable instance of command of temper and magnanimity than this before us that a young prince in the moment of victory when he had the fell adversary of the crown and royal family at his mercy should be able to withhold his hand from that vengeance which the vanquished so well deserved a cowardly disposition would have been blinded by resentment but this gallant heirapparent saw at once a method of converting a most desperate foe into a lasting friend he raised the fallen veteran from the ground he pardoned him he admitted him into his confidence and introduced him to the queen then lying at guildford that very evening m paris p     and triveti annale  this unmerited and unexpected lenity melted the heart of the rugged gurdon at once he became in an instant a loyal and useful subject trusted and employed in matters of moment by edward when king and confided in till the day of his death  letter ix it has been hinted in a former letter that sir adam gurdon had availed himself by marrying women of property by my evidences it appears that he had three wives and probably in the following order constantia ameria and agnes the first of these ladies who was the companion of his middle life seems to have been a person of considerable fortune which she inherited from thomas makerel a gentleman of selborne who was either her father or uncle the second ameria calls herself the quondam wife of sir adam quae fui uxor etc and talks of her sons under age now gurdon had no son and beside agnes in another document says ego agnes quondam uxor domini adae gurdon in pura et ligea viduitate mea but gurdon could not leave two widows and therefore it seems probable that he had been divorced from ameria who afterward married and had sons by agnes sir adam had a daughter johanna who was his heiress to whom agnes in her lifetime surrendered part of her jointure  he had also a bastard son  sir adam seems to have inhabited the house now called temple lying about two miles east of the church which had been the property of thomas makerel  in the year      he petitioned the prior of selborne in his own name and that of his wife constantia only for leave to build him an oratory in his manorhouse in curia sua licenses of this sort were frequently obtained by men of fortune and rank from the bishop of the diocese the archbishop and sometimes as i have view of selborne pl viii pa      temple in the parish of selborne s h grimm del d lerpiniere sculp  published        by b white and son  seen instances from the pope not only for conveniencesake and on account of distance and the badness of the roads but as a matter of state and distinction why the owner should apply to the prior in preference to the bishop of the diocese and how the former became competent to such a grant i cannot say but that the priors of selborne did take that privilege is plain because some years afterward in    0 prior richard granted to henry waterford and his wife nicholaa a license to build an oratory in their courthouse curia fua de waterford in which they might celebrate divine service saving the rights of the mother church of basynges yet all the while the prior of selborne grants with such reserve and caution as if in doubt of his power and leaves gurdon and his lady answerable in future to the bishop or his ordinary or to the vicar for the time being in case they should infringe the rights of the mother church of selborne  the manorhouse called temple is at present a single building running in length from south to north and has been occupied as a common farm house from time immemorial the south end is modern and consists of a brew house and then a kitchen the middle part is an hall twentyseven feet in length and nineteen feet in breadth and has been formerly open to the top but there is now a floor above it and also a chimney in the western wall the roofing consists of strong massive rafterwork ornamented with carved roses i have often looked for the lamb and flag the arms of the knights templars without success but in one corner found a fox with a goose on his back so coarsely executed that it required some attention to make out the device  beyond the hall to the north is a small parlour with a vast heavy stone chimneypiece and at the end of all the chapel or oratory whose massive thick walls and narrow windows at once bespeak great antiquity this room is only sixteen feet by sixteen feet eight inches and full seventeen feet nine inches in height the ceiling is formed of vast joists placed only five or six inches apart modern delicacy would not much approve of such a place of worship for it has at present much more the appearance of a dungeon than of a room fit for the reception of people of condition for the outside i refer the reader to the plate in which mr grimm has represented it with his usual accuracy the field on which this oratory abuts is still called chapelfield the situation of this house is very particular for it stands upon the immediate verge of a steep abrupt hill  not many years since this place was used for an hopkiln and was divided into two stories by a loft part of which remains at present and makes it convenient for peat and turf with which it is stowed  view of selborne pl ix pa      the pleystow vulg the plestor  sculp  published        by b white and son    letter x the priory at times was much obliged to gurdon and his family as sir adam began to advance in years he found his mind influenced by the prevailing opinion of the reasonableness and efficacy of prayers for the dead and therefore in conjunction with his wife constantia in the year      granted to the prior and convent of selborne all his right and claim to a certain place placea called la pleystow in the village aforesaid in liberam puram et perpetuam elemosinam this pleystow in saxon  or  viz plegestow or plegstow  locus ludorum or playplace is a level area near the church of about fortyfour yards by thirtysix and is known now by the name of the plestor at this juncture probably the vast oak mentioned p   was planted by the prior as an ornament to his new acquired market place according to this supposition the oak was aged     years when blown down   it continues still as it was in old times to be the scene of recreation for the youths and children of the neighborhood and impresses an idea on the mind that this village even in saxon times could not be the most abject of places when the inhabitants thought proper to asign so spacious a spot for the sports and amusements of it is young people for more circumstances respecting the plestor see letter ii to mr pennant   as soon as the prior became possessed of this piece of ground he procured a charter for a market bishop tanner in his notitia monastica has made a mistake respecting the market and sair at selborne for in his references to dodsworth cart    hen iii m   he says  de mercatu et seria de seleburn but this reference is wrong for instead of seleburn it proves that the place there meant was lekeborne or legeborne in the county of lincoln this error was copied from the index of the cat mss angl it does not appear that there ever was a chartered fair at selborne for several particulars respecting the present fair at selborne see letter xxvi of these antiquities from king henry iii and began to erect houses and stalls  seldas around it from this period selborne became a market town but how long it enjoyed that privilege does not appear at the same time gurdon reserved to himself and his heirs a way through the said plestor to a tenement and some crofts at the upper end abutting on the south corner of the churchyard this was in old days the manerial house of the street manor though now a poor cottage and is known at present by the modern name of elliots sir adam also did for the health of his own soul and that of his wife constantia their predecessors and successors grant to the prior and canons quiet possession of all the tenements and gardens  curtillagia which they had built and laid out on the lands in selborne on which he and his vassals  homines had undoubted right of common and moreover did grant to the convent the full privilege of that right of common and empowered the religious to build tenements and make gardens along the kings highway in the village of selborne  from circumstances put together it appears that the above were the first grants obtained by the priory in the village of selborne after it had subsisted about thirtynine years moreover they explain the nature of the mixed manor still remaining in and about the village where one field or tenement shall belong to magdalencollege college in the university of oxford and the next to norton powlet esquire of rotherfield house and so down the whole street the case was that the whole was once the property of gurdon till he made his grants to the convent since which some belongs to the successors of gurdon in the manor and some to the college and this is the occasion of the strange jumble of property it is remarkable that the tenement and crofts which sir adam reserved at the time of granting the plestor should still remain a part of the gurdonmanor though so desirable an addition to the vicarage that is not as yet possessed of one inch of glebe at home but of late viz in january      magdalencollege purchased that little estate which is lifeholding in reversion for the generous purpose of bestowing it and it is lands being twelve acres three of which abut on the churchyard and vicaragegarden as an improvement hereafter to the living and an eligible advantage to future incumbents  the year after gurdon had bestowed the plestor on the priory viz in      henry iii king of england died and was succeeded by his son edward this magnanimous prince continued his regard for sir adam whom he esteemed as a brave man and made him warden  custos of the forest of wolmer since the letters respecting wolmerforest and aylesholt from p    to    were printed the author has been favored with the following extracts  in the act of resumption   hen vii it

though little emolument might hang to this appointment yet are there reasons why it might be highly acceptable and in a few reigns after it was given to princes of the blood see letter ii of these antiquities  in old days gentry resided more at home on their estates and having fewer resources of elegant indoor amusement spent most of their leisure hours in the field and the pleasures of the chase a large domain therefore at little more than a mile distance and well stocked with game must have been a very eligible acquisition affording him influence as well as entertainment and especially as the manerial house of temple by its exalted situation could command a view of near twothirds of the forest  that gurdon who had lived some years the life of an outlaw and at the head of an army of insurgents was for a considerable time in high rebellion against his sovereign should have been guilty of some outrages and should have committed some depredations is by no means matter of wonder accordingly we find a distringas against him ordering him to restore to the bishop of winchester some of the temporalities of that see which he had taken by violence and detained viz some lands in hocheleye and a mill hocheleye now spelt hawkley is in the hundred of selborne and has a mill at this day  by a breve or writ from the king he is also enjoined to readmit the bishop of winchester and his tenants of the parish and town of farnham to pasture their horses and other larger cattle  averia in the forest of wolmer as had been the usage from time immemorial this writ is dated in the tenth year of the reign of edward viz       all the kings writs directed to gurdon are addressed in the following manner  edwardus dei gratia etc dilecto et fideli suo ade gurdon salutem and again custodi foreste sue de wolvemere  in the year      a quarrel between the crews of an english and a norman ship about some trifle brought on by degrees such serious consequences that in      a war broke out between the two nations the french king philip the hardy gained some advantages in gascony and not content with those threatened england with an invasion and by a sudden attempt took and burnt dover  upon this emergency edward sent a writ to gurdon ordering him and four others to enlist three thousand soldiers in the counties of surrey dorset and wiltshire ablebodied men tam sagittare quam balistare potentes and to see that they were marched by the feast of all saints to winchelsea there to be embarked aboard the kings transports  the occasion of this armament appears also from a summons to the bishop of winchester to parliament part of which i shall transcribe on account of the insolent menace which is said therein to have been denounced against the english language  qualiter

winton till      near thirty years afterward   the above are the last traces that i can discover of gurdons appearing and acting in public the first notice that my evidences give of him is that in      being the   th of henry iii he was the kings bailiff with others for the town of alton now from      to      is a space of sixtythree years a long period for one man to be employed in active life should any one doubt whether all these particulars can relate to one and the same person i should wish him to attend to the following reasons why they might in the first place the documents from the priory mention but one sir adam gurdon who had no son lawfully begotten and in the next we are to recollect that he must have probably been a man of uncommon vigor both of mind and body since no one unsupported by such accomplishments could have engaged in such adventures or could have borne up against the difficulties which he sometimes must have encountered and moreover we have modern instances of persons that have maintained their abilities for near that period  were we to suppose gurdon to be only twenty years of age in      in      he would be eightythree after which advanced period it could not be expected that he should live long from the silence therefore of my evidences it seems probable that this extraordinary person finished his life in peace not long after at his mansion of temple gurdons seal had for its device  a man with an helmet on his head drawing a crossbow the legend  sigillum ade de gurdon his arms were goulis iii flowers argent issant de testes de leopards from the collection of thomas martin esquire in the antiquarian repertory p  0  no xxxi   if the stout and unsubmitting spirit of gurdon could be so much influenced by the belief and superstition of the times much more might the hearts of his ladies and daughter and accordingly we find that ameria by the consent and advice of her sons though said to be all under age makes a grant for ever of some lands down by the stream at durton and also of her right of the common of durton itself durton now called dorton is still a common for the copyholders of selborne manor  johanna the daughter and heiress of sir adam was married i find to richard achard she also grants to the prior and convent lands and tenements in the village of selborne which her father obtained from thomas makerel and also all her goods and chattels in selborne for the consideration of two hundred pounds sterling this last business was transacted in the first year of edward ii viz   0  it has been observed before that gurdon had a natural son this person was called by the name of john dastard alias wastard but more probably bastard since bastardy in those days was not esteemed any disgrace though dastardy was esteemed the greatest he was married to gunnorie duncun and had a tenement and some land granted him in selborne by his sister johanna  letter xi the knights templars the military orders of the religious  the knights hospitalars of st john of jerusalem afterward called knights of rhodes now of malta came into england about the year   00   hen i  the knights templars came into england pretty early in stephens reign which commenced      the order was dissolved in      and their estates given by act of parliament to the hospitalars in      all in edw ii though many of their estates were never actually enjoyed by the said hospitalars vid tanner p xxiv x  the commandries of the hospitalars and preceptories of templars were each subordinate to the principal house of their respective religion in london although these are the different denominations which tanner at p xxviii assigns to the cells of these different orders yet throughout the work very frequent instances occur of preceptories attributed to the hospitalars and if in some passages of notitia monast commandries are attributed to the templars it is only where the place afterward became the property of the hospitalars and so is there indifferently styled preceptory or commandry see p                     but to account for the first observed inaccuracy it is probable the preceptories of the templars when given to the hospitalars were still vulgarly however called by their old name of preceptories whereas in propriety the societies of the hospitalars were indeed as has been said commandries and such deviation from the strictness of expression in this case might occasion those societies of hospitalars also to be indifferently called preceptories which had originally been vested in them having never belonged to the templars at all  see in archer p  0  tanner p  00 col     0 note e  it is observable that the very statute for the dissolution of the hospitalars holds the same language for there in the enumeration of particulars occur  commandries preceptories codex p    0 now this intercommunity of names and that in an act of parliament too made some of our ablest antiquaries look upon a preceptory and commandry as strictly synonymous accordingly we find camden in his britannia explaining praeceptoria in the text by a commandry in the margin p       0 j l  commandry a manor or chief message with lands etc belonging to the priory of st john of jerusalem and he who had the government of such house was called the commander who could not dispose of it but to the use of the priory only taking thence his own sustenance according to his degree who was usually a brother of the same priory cowell he adds confounding these with preceptories they are in many places termed temples as temple brueve in lincolnshire etc preceptories were possessed by the more eminent sort of templars whom the chief master created and called praeceptores templi cowell who refers to stephens de jurisd

property in selborne and also a preceptory at sudington now called southington a hamlet lying one mile to the east of the village bishop tanner mentions only two such houses of the templars in all the county of southampton viz godesfield founded by henry de blois bishop of winchester and south badeisley a preceptory of the knights templars and afterward of st john of jerusalem valued at one hundred and eighteen pounds sixteen shillings and seven pence per annum here then was a preceptory unnoticed by antiquaries between the village and temple whatever the edifice of the preceptory might have been it has long since been dilapidated and the whole hamlet contains now only one mean farmhouse though there were two in the memory of man  it has been usual for the religious of different orders to fall into great dissensions and especially when they were near neighbors instances of this sort we have heard of between the monks of canterbury and again between the old abbey of st swythun and the comparatively new minster of hyde in the city of winchester notitia monastica p       winchester newminster king alfred founded here first only a house and chapel for the learned monk grimbald whom he had brought out of flanders but afterward projected and by his will ordered a noble church or religious house to be built in the cemetery on the north side of the old minster or cathedral and designed that grimbald should preside over it this was begun ad  0  and finished to the honor of the holy trinity virgin mary and st peter by his son king edward who placed therein secular canons but ad     they were expelled and an abbot and monks put in possession by bishop ethelwold  now the churches and habitations of these two societies being so very near together the differences which were occasioned by their singing bells and other matters arose to so great a height that the religious of the new monastery thought fit about ad      to remove to a better and more quiet situation without the walls on the north part of the city called hyde where king henry i at the instance of will gifford bishop of winton founded a stately abbey for them st peter was generally accounted patron though it is sometimes called the monastery of st grimbald and sometimes of st barnabas etc  note a few years since a county bridewell or house of correction has been built on the immediate site of hide abbey in digging up the old foundations the workmen found the head of a crosier in good preservation    these feuds arose probably from different orders being crowded within the narrow limits of a city or garrisontown where every inch of ground was precious and an object of contention but with us as far as my evidences extend and while robert saunford was master robert saunforde was master of the temple in      guido de foresta was the next in      the former is fifth in a list of the masters in a ms bib cotton nero e vi  and richard carpenter was preceptor the templars and the priors lived in an intercourse of mutual good offices  my papers mention three transactions the exact time of which cannot be ascertained because they fell out before dates were usually inserted though probably they happened about the middle of the thirteenth century not long after saunford became master the first of these is that the templars shall pay to the priory of selborne annually the sum of ten shillings at two half yearly payments from their chamber  camera at sudington per manum preceptoris vel ballivi nostri qui pro tempore fuerit ibidem till they can provide the prior and canons with an equivalent in lands or rents within four or five miles of the said convent it is also further agreed that if the templars shall be in arrears for one year that then the prior shall be empowered to distrain upon their live stock in bradeseth the next matter was a grant from robert de saunford to the priory for ever of a good and sufficient road  cheminum capable of admitting carriages and proper for the drift of their larger cattle from the way which extends from sudington toward blakemere on to the lands which the convent possesses in bradeseth  the third transaction though for want of dates we cannot say which happened first and which last was a grant from robert samford to the priory of a tenement and its appurtenances in the village of selborne given to the templars by americus de vasci americus vasci by his name must have been an italian and had been probably a soldier of fortune and one of gordons captains americus vespucio the person who gave name to the new world was a florentine  this property by the manner of describing it  totum tenementum cum omnibus pertinentiis suis scilicet in terris and hominibus in pratis and pascuis and nemoribus etc seems to have been no inconsiderable purchase and was sold for two hundred marks sterling to be applied for the buying of more land for the support of the holy war  prior john is mentioned as the person to whom vascis land is conveyed but in williss list there is no prior john till      several years after the dissolution of the order of the templars in      so that unless willis is wrong and has omitted a prior john since      that being the date of his first prior these transactions must have fallen out before that date  i find not the least traces of any concerns between gurdon and the knights templars but probably after his death his daughter johanna might have and might bestow temple on that order in support of the holy land and moreover she seems to have been moving from selborne when she sold her goods and chattels to the priory as mentioned above  temple no doubt did belong to the knights as may be asserted not only from it is name but also from another corroborating circumstance of it is being still a manor tithefree for by virtue of their order says dr blackstone the lands of the knights templars were privileged by the pope with a discharge from tithes  antiquaries have been much puzzled about the terms preceptores and preceptorium not being able to determine what officer or edisice was meant but perhaps all the while the passage quoted above from one of my papers per manum preceptoris vel ballivi nostri qui pro tempore fuerit ibidem may help to explain the difficulty for if it be allowed here that preceptor and ballivus are synonymous words then the brother who took on him that office resided in the house of the templars at sudington a preceptory where he was their preceptor superintended their affairs received their money and as in the instance there mentioned paid from their chamber  camera as directed so that according to this explanation a preceptor was no other than a steward and a preceptorium was his residence i am well aware that according to strict latin the vel should have been seu or five and the order of the words  preceptoris nostri vel ballivi qui  et  ibidem should have been ibi ibidem necessarily having reference to two or more persons but it will hardly be thought fair to apply the niceties of classic rules to the latinity of the thirteenth century the writers of which seem to have aimed at nothing farther than to render themselves intelligible  there is another remark that we have made which i think corroborates what has been advanced and that is that richard carpenter preceptor of sudington at the time of the transactions between the templars and selborne priory did always sign last as a witness in the three deeds he calls himself frater it is true among many other brothers but subscribes with a kind of deference as if for the time being his office rendered him an inferior in the community in two or three ancient records relating to st oswalds hospital in the city of worcester printed by dr nash p     and     of his collections for the history of worcestershire the words preceptorium and preceptoria signify the mastership of the said hospital ad preceptorium five magisterium presentavit  preceptorii five magisterii patronus vacavit dicta preceptoria seu magisterium  ad preceptoriam et regimen dicti hospitalis  te preceptorem five magistrum prefecimus  where preceptorium denotes a building or apartment it may probably mean the masters lodgings or at least the preceptors apartment whatsoever may have been the office or employment of the said preceptor  a preceptor is mentioned in thoresbys ducatus leodiensis or history of leeds p     and a deed witnessed by the preceptor and chaplain before dates were inserted  du presnes supplement  preceptoriae praedia preceptoribus assignata  cowel in his law dictionary enumerates sixteen preceptoriae or preceptories in england but sudington is not among them  it is remarkable that gurtierus in his historia templariorum amstel      never once mentions the words preceptor or preceptorium     letter xii the ladies and daughter of sir adam gurdon were not the only benefactresses to the priory of selborne for in the year      ela longspee obtained masses to be performed for her souls health and the prior entered into an engagement that one of the convent should every day say a special mass for ever for the said benefactress whether living or dead she also engaged within five years to pay to the said convent one hundred marks of silver for the support of a chantry and chantrychaplain who should perform his masses daily in the parish church of selborne a chantry was a chapel joined to some cathedral or parish church and endowed with annual revenues for the maintenance of one or more priests to sing mass daily for the soul of the founder and others  in the east end of the south aile there are two sharppointed gothic niches one of these probably was the place under which these masses were performed and there is the more reason to suppose as much because till within these thirty years this space was fenced off with gothic wooden railing and was known by the name of the south chancel for what is said more respecting this chantry see letter iii of these antiquities  mention is made of a nicholas langrish capellanus de selborne in the time of henry viii was he chantrychaplain to ela longspee whose masses were probably continued to the time of the reformation more will be said of this person hereafter   the solicitude expressed by the donor plainly shows her piety and firm persuasion of the efficacy of prayers for the dead for she seems to have made every provision for the payment of the sum stipulated within the appointed time and to have felt much anxiety lest her death or the neglect of her executors or assigns might frustrate her intentions  et si contingat me in solucione predicte pecunie annis predictis in part aut in toto deficere quod absit concedo et obligo pro me et assignatis meis quod vicecomes  oxon et

for the induction of the new prior  letter xiv in the year      wykeham bishop of winchester held a visitation of his whole diocese not only of the secular clergy through the several deaneries but also of the monasteries and religious houses of all sorts which he visited in person the next year he sent his commissioners with power to correct and reform the several irregularities and abuses which he had discovered in the course of his visitation  some years afterward the bishop having visited three several times all the religious houses throughout his diocese and being well informed of the state and condition of each and of the particular abuses which required correction and reformation besides the orders which he had already given and the remedies which he had occasionally applied by his commissioners now issued his injunctions to each of them they were accommodated to their several exigencies and intended to correct the abuses introduced and to recall them all to a strict observation of the rules of their respective orders many of these injunctions are still extant and are evident monuments of the care and attention with which he discharged this part of his episcopal duty see lowths life of wykeham   some of these injunctions i shall here produce and they are such as will not fail i think to give satisfaction to the antiquary both as never having been published before and as they are a curious picture of monastic irregularities at that time  the documents that i allude to are contained in the notabilis visitatio de seleburne held at the priory of that place by wykeham in person in the year       this evidence in the original is written on two skins of parchment the one large and the other smaller and consists of a preamble    items and a conclusion which altogether evince the patient investigation of the visitor for which he had always been so remarkable in all matters of moment and how much he had at heart the regularity of those institutions of whose efficacy in their prayers for the dead he was so firmly persuaded as the bishop was so much in earnest we may be assured that he had nothing in view but to correct and reform what he found amiss and was under no bias to blacken or misrepresent as the commissioners of thomas lord cromwell seem in part to have done at the time of the reformation letters of this sort from dr layton to thomas lord cromwell are still extant  we may therefore with reason suppose that the bishop gives us an exact delineation of the morals and manners of the canons of selborne at that juncture and that what he found they had omitted he enjoins them and for what they have done amiss and contrary to their rules and statutes he reproves them and threatens them with punishment suitable to their irregularities  this visitatio is of considerable length and cannot be introduced into the body of this work we shall therefore refer the reader to the appendix where he will find every particular while we shall take some notice and make some remarks on the most singular items as they occur  in the preamble the visitor says  considering the charge lying upon us that your blood may not be required at our hands we came down to visit your priory as our office required and every time we repeated our visitation we found something still not only contrary to regular rules but also repugnant to religion and good reputation  in the first article after the preamble  he commands them on their obedience and on pain of the greater excommunication to see that the canonical hours by night and by day be sung in their choir and the masses of the blessed mary and other accustomed masses be celebrated at the proper hours with devotion and at moderate pauses and that it be not allowed to any to absent themselves from the hours and masses or to withdraw before they are finished  item  d he enjoins them to observe that silence to which they are so strictly bound by the rule of saint augustine at stated times and wholly to abstain from frivolous conversation  item  th not to permit such frequent passing of secular people of both sexes through their convent as if a thoroughfare from whence many disorders may and have arisen  item  th to take care that the doors of their church and priory be so attended to that no suspected and disorderly females suspectae et aliae inhonestae pass through their choir and cloister in the dark and to see that the doors of their church between the nave and the choir and the gates of their cloister opening into the fields be constantly kept shut until their first choirservice is over in the morning at dinner time and when they meet at their evening collation a collation was a meal or repast on a fast day in lieu of a supper   item  th mentions that several of the canons are found to be very ignorant and illiterate and enjoins the prior to see that they be better instructed by a proper master  item  th the canons are here accused of refusing to accept of their statutable clothing year by year and of demanding a certain specified sum of money as if it were their annual rent and due this the bishop forbids and orders that the canons shall be clothed out of the revenue of the priory and the old garments be laid by in a chamber and given to the poor according to the rule of saint augustine  in item  th is a complaint that some of the canons are given to wander out of the precincts of the convent without leave and that others ride to their manors and farms under pretense of inspecting the concerns of the society when they please and stay as long as they please but they are enjoined never to stir either about their own private concerns or the business of the convent without leave from the prior and no canon is to go alone but to have a grave brother to accompany him  the injunction in item  0th at this distance of time appears rather ludicrous but the visitor seems to be very serious on the occasion and says that it has been evidently proved to him that some of the canons living dissolutely after the flesh and not after the spirit sleep naked in their beds without their breeches and shirts absque femoralibus et camisiis the rule alluded to in item  0th of not sleeping naked was enjoined the knights templars who also were subject to the rules of st augustine see gurtleri hist templariorum  he enjoins that these culprits shall be punished by severe fasting especially if they shall be found to be faulty a third time and threatens the prior and subprior with suspension if they do not correct this enormity  in item   th the good bishop is very wroth with some of the canons whom he finds to be professed hunters and sportsmen keeping hounds and publicly attending huntingmatches these pursuits he says occasion much dissipation danger to the soul and body and frequent expense he therefore wishing to extirpate this vice wholly from the convent  radicibus extirpare does absolutely enjoin the canons never intentionally to be present at any public noisy tumultuous huntings or to keep any hounds by themselves or by others openly or by stealth within the convent or without considering the strong propensity in human nature toward the pleasures of the chase it is not to be wondered that the canons of selborne should languish after hunting when from their situation so near the precincts of wolmerforest the kings hounds must have been often in hearing and sometimes in sight from their windows  if the bishop was so offended at these sporting canons what would he have said to our modern foxhunting divines   in item   th he forbids the canons in office to make their business a plea for not attending the service of the choir since by these means either divine worship is neglected or their brothercanons are overburdened  by item   th we are informed that the original number of canons at the priory of selborne was fourteen but that at this visitation they were found to be let down to eleven the visitor therefore strongly and earnestly enjoins them that with all due speed and diligence they should proceed to the election of proper persons to fill up the vacancies under pain of the greater excommunication  in item   th the prior and canons are accused of suffering through neglect notorious dilapidations to take place among their manerial houses and tenements and in the walls and enclosures of the convent itself to the shame and scandal of the institution they are therefore enjoined under pain of suspension to repair all defects within the space of six months  item   th charges them with grievously burthening the said priory by means of sales and grants of liveries  liberationes or liberaturae allowances of corn etc to servants delivered at certain times and in certain quantities as clothes were among the allowances from religious houses to their dependants see the corrodies granted by croyland abbey hist of croyland appendix no xxxiv  it is not improbable that the word in afterages came to be confined to the uniform of the retainers of servants of the great who were hence called livery servants sir john cullums hist of hawsted   and corrodies a corrody is an allowance to a servant living in an abbey or priory   the bishop in item   th accuses the canons of neglect and omission with respect to their perpetual chantryservices  item  0th the visitor here conjures the prior and canons not to withhold their original alms  eleemosynas nor those that they were enjoined to distribute for the good of the souls of founders and benefactors he also strictly orders that the fragments and broken victuals both from the hall of their prior and their common refectory should be carefully collected together by their eleemosynarius and given to the poor without any diminution the officer to be suspended for neglect or omission  item   d he bids them distribute their pittances  pitancias  pitancia an allowance of bread and beer or other provision to any pious use especially to the religious in a monastery etc for augmentation of their commons gloss to kennetts par antiq  regularly on obits anniversaries festivals etc  item   th all and every one of the canons are hereby inhibited from standing godfather to any boy for the future ne compatres alicujus pueri de cetero fieri presumatis unless by express license from the bishop obtained because from such relationship favor and affection nepotism and undue influence arise to the injury and detriment of religious institutions the relationship between sponsors and their godchildren who were called spiritual sons and daughters was formerly esteemed much more sacred than at present the presents at christenings were sometimes very considerable the connection lasted through life and was closed with a legacy this last mark of attention seems to have been thought almost indispensable for in a will from whence no extracts have been given the testator left every one of his godchildren a bushel of barley sir john cullums hist of hawsted  d margaretae filiae regis primogenitae quam filiolam quia ejus in baptismo compater fuit appellat cyphum aureum et quadraginta libras legavit  archbishop parker de antiquitate eccles brit speaking of archbishop morton     item   th the visitor herein severely reprimands the canons for appearing publicly in what would be called in the universities an unstatutable manner and for wearing of boots caligae de burneto et sotularium  in ocrearum loco ad modum sotularium du fresue is copious on caligae of several sorts hoc item de

 burnetum i e brunetum pannus non ex lana nativi coloris confectus   sotularium i e subtalaris quia sub talo est peculium genus quibus maxim monachi nocte utebantur in aestate in hyeme vero soccis  this writer gives many quotations concerning sotularia which were not to be made too shapely nor were the caligae to be laced on too nicely     it is remarkable that the bishop expresses more warmth against this than any other irregularity and strictly enjoins them under pain of ecclesiastical censures and even imprisonment if necessary a threat not made use of before for the future to wear boots ocreis seu botis according to the regular usage of their ancient order  item   th he here again but with less earnestness forbids them foppish ornaments and the affectation of appearing like beaux with garments edged with costly furs with fringed gloves and silken girdles trimmed with gold and silver it is remarkable that no punishment is annexed to this injunction  item   st he here singly and severally forbids each canon not admitted to a cure of souls to administer extreme unction or the sacrament to clergy or laity or to perform the service of matrimony till he has taken out the license of the parish priest  item   d the bishop says in this item that he had observed and found in his several visitations that the sacramental plate and cloths of the altar surplices etc were sometimes left in such an uncleanly and disgusting condition as to make the beholders shudder with horror  quod aliquibus sunt horrori men abhorred the offering of the lord   samuel chap ii v    strange as this account may appear to modern delicacy the author when first in orders twice met with similar circumstances attending the sacrament at two churches belonging to two obscure villages in the first he found the inside of the chalice covered with birds dung and in the other the communioncloth soiled with cabbage and the greasy drippings of a gammon of bacon the good dame at the great farmhouse who was to furnish the cloth being a notable woman thought it best to save her clean linen and so sent a foul cloth that had covered her own table for two or three sundays before  he therefore enjoins them for the future to see that the plate cloths and vestments be kept bright clean and in decent order and what must surprise the reader adds  that he expects for the future that the sacrist should provide for the sacrament good wine pure and unadulterated and not as had often been the practice that which was sour and tending to decay  he says farther that it seems quite preposterous to omit in sacred matters that attention to decent cleanliness the neglect of which would disgrace a common convivial meeting   ne turpe toral ne sordida mappa corruget nares ne non et cantharus et lanx oftendat tibi te      item   d says that though the relics of saints the plate holy vestments and books of religious houses are forbidden by canonical institutes to be pledged or lent out upon pawn yet as the visitor finds this to be the case in his several visitations he therefore strictly enjoins the prior forthwith to recall those pledges and to restore them to the convent and orders that all the papers and title deeds thereto belonging should be safely deposited and kept under three locks and keys  in the course of the visitatio notabilis the constitutions of legate ottobonus are frequently referred to ottobonus was afterward pope adrian v and died in      his constitutions are in lyndewoods provinciale and were drawn up in the   d of henry iii  in the vifitatio notabilis the usual punishment is fasting on bread and beer and in cases of repeated delinquency on bread and water on these occasions quarta feria et sexta feria are mentioned often and are to be understood of the days of the week numerically on which such punishment is to be inflicted  letter xv though bishop wykeham appears somewhat stern and rigid in his visitatorial character toward the priory of selborne yet he was on the whole a liberal friend and benefactor to that convent which like every society or individual that fell in his way partook of the generosity and benevolence of that munificent prelate  in the year      william of wykeham out of his mere good will and liberality discharged the whole debts of the prior and convent of selborne to the amount of one hundred and ten marks eleven shillings and sixpence yet in ten years time we find by the notabilis visitatio that all their relics plate vestments titledeeds etc were in pawn  and a few years before he died he made a free gift of one hundred marks to the same priory on which account the prior and convent voluntarily engaged for the celebration of two masses a day by two canons of the convent for ten years for the bishops welfare if he should live so long and for his soul if he should die before the expiration of this term lowths life of wykeham   at this distance of time it seems matter of great wonder to us how these societies so nobly endowed and whose members were exempt by their very institution from every means of personal and family expense could possibly run in debt without squandering their revenues in a manner incompatible with their function  religious houses might sometimes be distressed in their revenues by fires among their buildings or large dilapidations from storms etc but no such accident appears to have befallen the priory at selborne those situate on public roads or in great towns where there were shrines of saints were liable to be intruded on by travelers devotees and pilgrims and were subject to the importunity of the poor who swarmed at their gates to partake of doles and broken victuals of these disadvantages some convents used to complain and especially those at canterbury but this priory from it is sequestered situation could seldom be subject to either of these inconveniences and therefore we must attribute it is frequent debts and embarrassments well endowed as it was to the bad conduct of it is members and a general inattention to the interests of the institution  letter xvi beaufort was bishop of winchester from   0  to      and yet notwithstanding this long episcopate only tom i

deportari novum electum by some of the brothers from the chapter house to the high altar of the church it seems here as if the canons used to chair their new elected prior from the chapter house to

 the conduct of the religious had now for some time been generally bad many of the monastic societies being very opulent were become voluptuous and licentious and had deviated entirely from their original institutions the laity saw with indignation the wealth and possessions of their pious ancestors perverted to the service of sensuality and indulgence and spent in gratifications highly unbecoming the purposes for which they were given a total disregard to their respective rules and discipline drew on the monks and canons a heavy load of popular odium some good men there were who endeavored to oppose the general delinquency but their efforts were too feeble to stem the torrent of monastic luxury as far back as the year      wickliffes principles and doctrines had made some progress were well received by men who wished for a reformation and were defended and maintained by them as long as they dared till the bishops and clergy began to be so greatly alarmed that they procured an act to be passed by which the secular arm was empowered to support the corrupt doctrines of the church but the first lollard was not burnt until the year   0   the wits also of those times

i shall conclude my letter not only on account of the remarkable prediction therein contained which carries with it somewhat of the air of a prophecy but also as it seems to have been a striking picture of monastic insolence and dissipation and a specimen of one of the keenest pieces of satire now perhaps subsisting in any language ancient or modern  now is religion a rider a romer by streate a leader of lovedays and a loud beggar a pricker on a palfrey from manner to manner a heap of hounds at his arse as he a lord were and but if his knave kneel that shall his cope bring he loureth at

concerning a king who after a time would suppress the religious houses is remarkable i imagined it might have been foisted into the copies in the reign of king henry viii but it is to be found in mss

authority of a prior but to be responsible to the visitor finally and to maintain this superiority during the bishops pleasure only this instrument is dated from the bishops manorhouse in southwark march         and the seventh of his consecration  after this transaction it does not appear that the chapter of the priory proceeded to any election on the contrary we find that at six months end

circumstances in this paper it is plain that the sequestration produced good effects for in it are to be found bills of repairs to a considerable amount  by this evidence also it appears that there were at that juncture only four canons at the priory if bishop wykeham was so disturbed see notab visitatio to find the number of canons reduced from fourteen to eleven what would he have said to have seen it diminished below one third of that number  and that these and their four household servants during this sequestration for their clothing wages and diet were allowed per ann xxx lib and that

then required his consent to his own election qui licet in part renitens tanti reverendi patris se confirmans obeyed and signified his consent oraculo vive vocis then was there a mandate citing any one who would gainsay the said election to appear before the bishop or his commissary in his chapel at farnham on the second day of may next the dean of the deanery of aulton then appeared before the

any other time and at the instance of john morton and the proctor confirmed the election by his decree and directed his mandate to the rector of hedley and the vicar of newton valence to install him in the usual form  thus for the first time was a person a stranger to the convent of selborne and never canon of that monastery elected prior though the style of the petitions in former elections used to run thus  vos  rogamus quatinus eligendum ex nobis unum confratrem de gremio nostro  licentiam vestram  nobis concedere dignemini  letter xx prior morton dying in      two canons by themselves proceeded to election and chose a prior but two more one of them berne complaining of not being summoned objected to the proceedings as informal till at last the matter was compromised that the bishop should again for that turn nominate as he had before but the circumstances of this election will be best explained by the following extract  reg waynflete tom ii pars  ma fol    memorandum ad      august     william wyndesor a canonregular of the priory of selburne having been elected prior on the death of brother john appeared in person before the bishop in his chapel at south waltham he was attended on this occasion by thomas london and john bromesgrove canons who had elected him peter berne and william stratfeld canons also presented themselves at the same time complaining that in this business they had been overlooked and not summoned and that therefore the validity of the election might with reason be called in question and quarrels and dissensions might probably arise between the newly chosen prior and the parties thus neglected  after some altercation and dispute they all came to an agreement with the new prior that what had been done should be rejected and annulled and that they would again for this turn transfer to the bishop their power to elect order and provide them another prior whom they promised unanimously to admit  the bishop accepted of this offer before witnesses and on september    in an inner chamber near the chapel abovementioned after full deliberation chose brother thomas fairwise vicar of somborne a canonregular of saint augustine in the priory of bruscough in the diocese of coventry and litchfield to be prior of selborne the form is nearly as above in the last election the canons are again enumerated w wyndesor subprior p berne t london w stratfeld j bromesgrove who had formed the chapter and had requested and obtained license to elect but had unanimously conferred their power on the bishop in consequence of this proceeding the bishop taking the business upon himself that the priory might not suffer detriment for want of a governor appoints the aforesaid t fairwise to be prior a citation was ordered as above for gainsayers to appear october  th before the bishop or his commissaries at south waltham but none appearing the commissaries admitted the said thomas ordered him to be installed and sent the usual letter to the convent to render him due obedience  thus did the bishop of winchester a second time appoint a stranger to be prior of selborne instead of one chosen out of the chapter for this seeming irregularity the visitor had no doubt good and sufficient reasons as probably may appear hereafter  letter xxi whatever might have been the abilities and disposition of prior fairwise it could not have been in his power to have brought about any material reformation in the priory of selborne because he departed this life in the month of august      before he had presided one twelvemonth  as soon as their governor was buried the chapter applied to their visitor for leave to choose a new prior which being granted after deliberating for a time they proceeded to an election by a scrutiny but as this mode of voting has not been described but by the mere form in the appendix an extract from the bishops register representing the manner more fully may not be disagreeable to several readers  wayneflete reg

prior in the usual manner  thus did canon berne though advanced in years reassume his abdicated priorship for the second time to the no small satisfaction as it may seem of the bishop of winchester who professed as will be shown not long hence an high opinion of his abilities and integrity  letter xxii as prior berne when chosen in      held his priorship only to      and then made a voluntary resignation wearied and disgusted as we may conclude by the disorder that prevailed in his convent it is no matter of wonder that when rechosen in      he should not long maintain his station as old age was then coming fast upon him and the increasing anarchy and misrule of that declining institution required unusual vigor and resolution to stem that torrent of profligacy which was hurrying it on to it is dissolution we find accordingly that in      he resigned his dignity again into the hands of the bishop  waynflete reg fol     resignatio prioris de seleborne may         peter berne resigned the priorship may    the bishop admitted his resignation in manerio suo de waltham and declared the priorship void et priorat solacio destitutum esse and granted his letters for proceeding to a new election when all the religious assembled in the chapter house did transfer their power under their seal to the bishop by the following public instrument  in dei nomine amen etc ad      maii    in the

provide and appointed a proctor to present the instrument to the bishop under their seal and required their notary to draw it up in due form etc subscribed by the notary  after the visitor had fully deliberated on the matter he proceeded to the choice of a prior and elected by the following instrument john sharp alias glastenbury  fol    provisio prioris per epm  willmus etc to our beloved

nostre consec     thus did the bishop three times out of the four that he was at liberty to nominate appoint a prior from a distance a stranger to the place to govern the convent of selborne hoping by this method to have broken the cabal and to have interrupted that habit of mismanagement that had pervaded the society but he acknowledges in an evidence lying before us that he never did suceed to his wishes with respect to those late governors  quos tamen male se habuisse et inutiliter administrare et administrasse usque ad presentia tempora post debitam investigationem etc invenit the only time that he appointed from among the canons he made choice of peter berne for whom he had conceived the greatest esteem and regard  when prior berne first relinquished his priorship he returned again to his former condition of canon in which he continued for some years but when he was rechosen and had abdicated a second time we find him in a sorlorn state and in danger of being reduced to beggary had not the bishop of winchester interposed in his favor and with great humanity insisted on a provision for him for life the reason for this difference seems to have been that in the first case though in years he might have been hale and capable of taking his share in the duty of the convent in the second he was broken with age and no longer equal to the functions of a canon  impressed with this idea the bishop very benevolently interceded in his favor and laid his injunctions on the newelected prior in the following manner  fol    in dei nomine amen nos willmus etc considerantes petrum berne late prior in administratione spiritualium et temporalium prioratus laudabiliter vixisse et rexisse ipsumque senio et corporis debilitate confractum ne in opprobrium religionis mendicari cogatur  eidem annuam pensionem a domino johanne sharp alias glastonbury priore moderno and his successors and from the priory or church to be paid every year during his life de voluntate et ex consensu expressis of the said john sharp sub ea que sequitur forma verborum  assignamus   st that the said prior and his successors for the time being honest exhibebunt of the fruits and profits of the priorship eidem esculenta et poculenta while he remained in the priory sub consimili portione eorundem prout convenienter priori for the time being ministrari contigerit and in like manner uni famulo whom he should choose to wait on him as to the servientibus of the prior  item invenient seu exhibebunt eidem unam honestam cameram in the priory cum focalibus necessariis seu opportunis ad eundem  item we will ordain etc to the said p berne an annual pension of ten marks from the revenue of the priory to be paid by the hands of the prior quarterly  the bishop decrees farther that john sharp and his successors shall take an oath to observe this injunction and that before their installation  lecta et facta sunt haec in quodam alto oratorio belonging to the bishop at suthwaltham may         in the presence of john sharp who gave his assent and then took the oath before witnesses with the other oaths before the chancellor who decreed he should be inducted and installed as was done that same day  how john sharp alias glastonbury acquitted himself in his priorship and in what manner he made a vacancy whether by resignation or death or whether he was removed by the visitor does not appear we only find that some time in the year      there was no prior and that the bishop nominated canon ashford to fill the vacancy  letter xxiii this thomas ashford was most undoubtedly the last prior of selborne and therefore here will be the proper place to say something concerning a list of the priors and to endeavor to improve that already given by others  at the end of bishop tanners notitia monastica the folio edition among brown williss principals of religious houses occur the names of eleven of the priors of selborne with dates but this list is imperfect and particularly at the beginning for though the priory was founded in      yet it commences with nich de cantia elected in      so that for the first thirty years no prior is mentioned yet there must have been one or more we were in hopes that the register of peter de rupibus would have rectified this omission but when it was examined no information of the sort was to be found from the year    0 the list is much corrected and improved and the reader may depend on it is being thence forward very exact  a list of the priors of selborne priory from brown williss principals of religious houses with additions within   by the author  john  was prior sine dat see in letter xi of these antiquities the reason why prior john  who had transactions with the knights templars is placed in the list before the year

the bishop        peter berne reelected by scrutiny in resigns again in            john sharper  sharp alias glastonbury canonreg of bruton elected by the bishop by compromise        thomas ashford canon of selborne last prior elected by the bishop of winchester some time in the year and deposed at the dissolution        letter xxiv bishop waynefletes efforts to continue the priory still proved unsuccessful and the convent without any canons and for some time without a prior was tending swiftly to it is dissolution  when sharps alias glastonburys priorship ended does not appear the bishop says that he had been obliged to remove some priors for maladministration but it is not well explained how that could be the case with any unless with sharp because all the others chosen during his episcopate died in their office viz morton and fairwise berne only excepted who relinquished twice voluntarily and was moreover approved of by wayneflete as a person of integrity but the way to show what ineffectual pains the bishop took and what difficulties he met with will be to quote the words of the libel of his proctor radulphus langley who appeared for the bishop in the process of the impropriation of the priory of selborne the extract is taken from an attested copy   item  that the said bishop  dicto prioratui et personis ejusdem pie compatiens sollicitudines pastorales labores et diligentias gravissimas quam plurimas tam per se quam per suos pro reformatione premissorum impendebat et aliquando illius loci prioribus propter malam et inutilem administrationem et dispensationem

winchester founded his college of saint mary magdalene in the university of oxford in or about the year      but the revenues proving insufficient for so large and noble an establishment the college supplicated the founder to augment it is income by putting it in possession of the estates belonging to the priory of selborne now become a deserted convent without canons or prior the president and fellows state the circumstances of their numerous institution and scanty provision and the ruinous and perverted condition of the priory the bishop appoints commissaries to inquire into the state of the said monastery and if found expedient to confirm the appropriation of it to the college which soon after appoints attorneys to take possession september         but the way to give the reader a thorough insight respecting this transaction will be to transcribe a farther proportion of the process of the impropriation from the beginning which will lay open the manner of proceeding and show the consent of the parties  impropriatio selborne       universis sancte matris ecclesie filiis etc ricardus dei gratia prior ecclesie conventualis de novo loco etc ecclesia conventualis de novo loco was

winton and should conclude that there was a mistake in titles and that the abbot must have been here meant he will be pleased to recollect that this person was the second in rank for next under the

obtained the decision of the commissary in their favor they proceeded to supplicate the pope and to entreat his holiness that he would give his sanction to the sentence of union some difficulties were started at rome but they were surmounted by the college agent as appears by his letters from that city at length pope innocent viii by a bull there is nothing remarkable in this bull of pope innocent except the statement of the annual revenue of the priory of selborne which is therein estemated at   0 flor curi whereas bishop godwin sets it at     l    s   d now a floren so named says camden

the second year of his pontificate confirmed what had been done and suppressed the convent  thus fell the considerable and wellendowed priory of selborne after it had subsisted about two hundred and fiftyfour years about seventyfour years after the suppression of priories alien by henry v and about fifty years before the general dissolution of monasteries by henry viii the founder it is probable had fondly imagined that the sacredness of the institution and the pious motives on which it was established might have preserved it inviolate to the end of time  yet it fell to teach us that god attributes to place no sanctity if none be thither brought by men who there frequent or therein dwell miltons paradise lost  letter xxv wainfleet did not long enjoy the satisfaction arising from this new acquisition but departed this life in a few months after he had effected the union of the priory with his late founded college and was succeeded in the sea of winchester by peter courtney some time toward the end of the year       in the beginning of the following year the new bishop released the president and fellows of magdalen college from all actions respecting the priory of selborne

most impious of frauds bishop wainfleet having by statute ordained four obits for himself to be celebrated in the chapel of magdalen college enjoined in one of them a special collect for the

sharp found a house two barns a stable and a dufhouse  dovehouse built and standing on the south side of the old priory and late in the occupation of newlyn in this abstract also are to be seen the names of all the fields many of which continue the same to this day it may not be amiss to mention here that various names of tithings farms fields woods etc which appear in the ancient deeds and evidences of several centuries standing are still preserved in common use with little or no variation  as norton southington durton achangre blackmore bradshot rood plestor etc etc at the same time it should be acknowledged that other places have entirely lost their original titles as le buri and trucstede in this village and la liega or la lyge which was the name of the original site of the priory etc  of some of them i shall take notice where any thing singular occurs  and here first we meet with paradyss paradise mede every convent had it is paradise which probably was an enclosed orchard pleasantly laid out and planted with fruit trees  tylehouse grove so distinguished from having a tiled house near it men at first heaped sods or fern or heath on their roofs to keep off the inclemencies of weather and then by degrees laid straw or haum the first refinements on roofing were shingles which are very ancient tiles are a very late and imperfect covering and were not much in use till the beginning of the sixteenth century the first tiled house at nottingham was in   0   buttwood close here the servants of the priory and the villageswains exercised themselves with their long bows and shot at a mark against a butt or bank there is also a buttclose just at the back of the village   cundyth conduit wood the engrosser of the lease not understanding this name has made a strange barbarous word of it conduitwood was and is a steep rough cowpasture lying above the priory at about a quarter of a mile to the southwest in the side of this field there is a spring of water that never fails at the head of which a cistern was built which communicated with leaden pipes that conveyed water to the monastery when this reservoir was first constructed does not appear we only

shall not pretend to say nor when artists and mechanics first understood any thing of hydraulics and that water confined in tubes would rise to it is original level there is a person now living who had been employed formerly in digging for these pipes and once discovered several yards which they sold for old lead  there was also a plot of ground called tanhouse garden and  tannaria sua a tanyard

the priory called tanners wood   registr b page     here we find a lease of the parsonage of selborne to thomas sylvester and miles arnold husbandmen  of the tithes of all manner of corn pertaining to the parsonage  with the offerings at the chapel of whaddon belonging to the said parsonage dat june     th hen  th viz       as the chapel of whaddon has never been mentioned till now and as it is not noticed by bishop tanner in his notitia monastica some more particular account of it will be proper in this place whaddon was a chapel of ease to the mother church of selborne and was situated in the tithing of oakhanger at about two miles distance from the village the farm and field whereon it stood are still called chapel farm and field this is a manorfarm at present the property of lord stawell and belonged probably in ancient times to jo de venur or venuz one of the first benefactors to the priory  but there are no remains or traces of the building itself the very foundations having been destroyed before the memory of man in a farm yard at oakhanger we remember a large hollow stone of a close substance which had been used as a hogtrough but was then broken this stone tradition said had been the baptismal font of whaddon chapel the chapel had been in a very ruinous state in old days but was newbuilt at the instance of bishop wainfleet about the year      during the first priorship of berne in consequence of a sequestration issued forth by that visitor against the priory on account of notorious and shameful dilapidations see letter xix of these antiquities  summa total

passage not very convenient or safe here was also we find a bridge in very early times for jacobus de hochangre the first benefactor to the priory of selborne held his estate at hochangre by the

dovehouse was a constant appendant to a manerial dwelling of this convenience more will be said hereafter  a cornmill was also esteemed a necessary appendage of every manor and therefore was to be expected of course at the priory of selborne  the prior had secta molendini or ad molendinum servitium quo seudatorii grana sua ad domini molendinum ibi molenda perferre exconsuetudine astringuntur  a power of compelling his vassals to bring their corn to be ground at his mill according to old custom he had also according to bishop tanner secta molendini de street but the purport of street we must confess we do not understand street in old english signifies a road or highway as watling street etc therefore the prior might have some mill on a high road the priory had only one mill originally at selborne but by grants of lands it came possessed of one at durton and one at oakhanger and probably some on it is other several manors thomas knowles president etc ann hen  vi xxiiio viz      demised

mill at the priory was in use within the memory of man and the ruins of the millhouse were standing within these thirty years the pond and dam and millers dwelling still remain as the stream was apt to fail in very dry summers the tenants found their situation very distressing for want of water and so were forced to abandon the spot this inconvenience was probably never felt in old times when the whole district was nothing but woodlands and yet several centuries ago there seem to have been two or three mills between wellhead and the priory for the reason of this assertion see letter xxix to mr barrington  occasional mention has been made of the many privileges and immunities enjoyed by the convent and it is priors but a more particular state seems to be necessary the author therefore thinks this the proper place before he concludes these antiquities to introduce all that has been collected by the judicious bishop tanner respecting the priory and it is advantages in his notitia monastica

respecting the present state of that convent and it is grange and other matters he does not see how he can acquit himself of the subject without trespassing again on the patience of the reader by adding one supplementary letter  no sooner did the priory perhaps much out of repair at the time become an appendage to the college but it must at once have tended to swift decay magdalen college wanted now only two chambers for the chantry priest and his assistant and therefore had no occasion for the hall dormitory and other spacious apartments belonging to so large a foundation the roofs neglected would soon become the possession of daws and owls and being rotted and decayed by the weather would fall in upon the floors so that all parts must have hastened to speedy dilapidation and a scene of broken ruins three full centuries have now passed since the dissolution a series of years that would craze the stoutest edifices but besides the slow hand of time many circumstances have contributed to level this venerable structure with the ground of which nothing now remains but one piece of a wall of about ten feet long and as many feet high which probably was part of an outhouse as early as the latter end of the reign of hen vii we find that a farmhouse and two barns were built to the south of the priory and undoubtedly out of it is materials avarice again has much contributed to the overthrow of this stately pile as long as the tenants could make money of it is stones or timbers wantonness no doubt has had a share in the demolition for boys love to destroy what men venerate and admire a remarkable instance of this propensity the writer can give from his own knowledge when a schoolboy more than fifty years ago he was eyewitness perhaps a party concerned in the undermining a portion of that fine old ruin at the north end of basingstoke town well known by the name of holy ghost chapel very providentially the vast fragment which these thoughtless little engineers endeavored to sap did not give way so soon as might have been expected but it fell the night following and with such violence that it shook the very ground and awakening the inhabitants of the neighboring cottages made them start up in their beds as if they had felt an earthquake the motive for this dangerous attempt does not so readily appear perhaps the more danger the more honor thought the boys and the notion of doing some mischief gave a zest to the enterprise as dryden says upon an other occasion it looked so like a sin it pleased the more   had the priory been only levelled to the surface of the ground the discerning eye of an antiquary might have ascertained it is ichnography and some judicious hand might have developed it is dimensions but besides other ravages the very foundations have been torn up for the repair of the highways so that the site of this convent is now become a rough rugged pasturefield full of hillocks and pits choked with nettles and dwarfelder and trampled by the feet of the ox and the heifer  as the tenant at the priory was lately digging among the foundations for materials to mend the highways his laborers discovered two large stones with which the farmer was so pleased that he ordered them to be taken out whole one of these proved to be a large doric capital worked in good taste and the other a base of a pillar both formed out of the soft freestone of this district these ornaments from their dimensions seem to have belonged to massive columns and show that the church of this convent was a large and costly edifice they were found in the space which has always been supposed to have contained the south transept of the priory church some fragments of large pilasters were also found at the same time the diameter of the capital was two feet three inches and an half and of the column where it had stood on the base eighteen inches and three quarters  two years ago some laborers digging again among the ruins founded a sort of rude thick vase or urn of soft stone containing about two gallons in measure on the verge of the brook in the very spot which tradition has always pointed out as having been the site of the convent kitchen this clumsy utensil a judicious antiquary who saw this vase observed that it possibly might have been a standard measure between the monastery and it is tenants the priory we have mentioned claimed the assize of bread and beer in selborne manor and probably the adjustment of dry measures for grain etc  whether intended for holy water or whatever purpose we were going to procure but found that the laborers had just broken it in pieces and carried it out on the highways  the priory of selborne had possessed in this village a grange an usual appendage to manerial estates where the fruits of their lands were stowed and laid up for use at a time when men took the natural produce of their estates in kind the mansion of this spot is still called the grange and is the manorhouse of the convent possessions in this place the author has conversed with very ancient people who remembered the old original grange but it has long given place to a modern farmhouse magdalen college holds a court leet and court baron the time when this court is held is the midweek between easter and whitsuntide in the great wheatbarn of the said grange annually where the president usually superintends attended by the bursar and steward of the college owen oglethorpe president etc an edw sexti primo viz      demised  robert arden selborne grange for twenty years rent viii  index of leases   the following uncommon presentment at the court is not unworthy of notice there is on the south side of the kings field a large commonfield so called a considerable tumulus or hillock now covered with thorns and bushes and known by the name of kites hill which is presented year by year in court as not ploughed why this injunction is still kept up respecting this spot which is surrounded on all sides by arable land may be a question not easily solved since the usage has long survived the knowledge of the intention thereof we can only suppose that as the prior besides thurset and pillory had also furcas a power of life and death that he might have reserved this little eminence as the place of execution for delinquents and there is the more reason to suppose so since a spot just by is called gally gallows hill  the lower part of the village next the grange in which is a pond and a stream is well known by the name of gracious street an appellation not at all understood there is a lake in surrey near chobham called also graciouspond and another if we mistake not near hedleigh in the county of hants this strange denomination we do not at all comprehend and conclude that it may be a corruption from some saxon word itself perhaps forgotten  it has been observed already that bishop tanner was mistaken when he refers to an evidence of dodsworth  de mercatu et feria de seleburne selborne never had a chartered fair the present fair was set up since the year      by a set of jovial fellows who had found in an old almanac that there had been a fair here in former days on the first of august and were desirous to revive so joyous a festival against this innovation the vicar set his face and persisted in crying it down as the probable occasion of much intemperance however the fair prevailed but was altered to the twentyninth of may because the former day often interfered with wheatharvest on that day it still continues to be held and is become an useful mart for cows and calves most of the lower housekeepers brew beer against this holiday which is dutied by the exciseman and their becoming victuallers for the day without a license is overlooked  monasteries enjoyed all sorts of conveniences within themselves thus at the priory a low and moist situation there were ponds and stews for their fish at the same place also and at the grange culver as has been observed before is saxon for a pigeon in culvercroft there were dovehouses and on the hill opposite to the grange the prior had a warren as the names of the coneycrofts and coneycroft hanger plainly testify a warren was an usual appendage to a manor   nothing has been said as yet respecting the tenure or holding of the selborne estates temple and norton are manor farms and freehold as is the manor of chapel near oakhanger and also the estate at oakhangerhouse and blackmoor the priory and grange are leasehold under magdalen college for twentyone years renewable every seven all the smaller estates in and round the village are copyhold of inheritance under the college except the little remains of the gurdonmanor which had been of old leased out upon lives but have been freed of late by their present lord as fast as those lives have dropped  selborne seems to have derived much of it is prosperity from the near neighborhood of the priory for monasteries were of considerable advantage to places where they had their sites and estates by causing great resort by procuring markets and fairs by freeing them from the cruel oppression of forestlaws and by letting their lands at easy rates but as soon as the convent was suppressed the town which it had occasioned began to decline and the market was less frequented the rough and sequestered situation gave a check to resort and the neglected roads rendered it less and less accessible  that it had been a considerable place for size formerly appears from the largeness of the church which much exceeds those of the neighboring villages by the ancient extent of the burying ground which from human bones occasionally dug up is found to have been much encroached upon by giving a name to the hundred by the old foundations and ornamented stones and tracery of windows that have been discovered on the northeast side of the village and by the many vestiges of disused fish ponds still to be seen around it for ponds and stews were multiplied in the times of popery that the affluent might enjoy some variety at their tables on fast days therefore the more they abounded the better probably was the condition of the inhabitants  more particulars respecting the old family tortoise omitted in the natural history because we call this creature an abject reptile we are too apt to undervalue his abilities and depreciate his powers of instinct yet he is as mr pope says of his lord  much too wise to walk into a well and has so much discernment as not to fall down an haha but to stop and withdraw from the brink with the readiest precaution  though he loves warm weather he avoids the hot sun because his thick shell when once heated would as the poet says of solid armor  scald with safety he therefore spends the more sultry hours under the umbrella of a large cabbageleaf or amidst the waving forests of an asparagusbed  but as he avoids heat in the summer so in the decline of the year he improves the faint autumnal beams by getting within the reflection of a fruitwall and though he never has read that planes inclining to the horizon receive a greater share of warmth several years ago a book was written entitled fruitwalls improved by inclining them to the horizon in which the author has shown by calculation that a much greater number of the rays of the sun will fall on such walls than on those which are perpendicular  he inclines his shell by tilting it against the wall to collect and admit every feeble ray  pitiable seems the condition of this poor embarrassed reptile to be cased in a suit of ponderous armor which he cannot lay aside to be imprisoned as it were within his own shell must preclude we should suppose all activity and disposition for enterprise yet there is a season of the year usually the beginning of june when his exertions are remarkable he then walks on tiptoe and is stirring by five in the morning and traversing the garden examines every wicket and interstice in the fences through which he will escape if possible and often has eluded the care of the gardener and wandered to some distant field the motives that impel him to undertake these rambles seem to be of the amorous kind his fancy then becomes intent on sexual attachments which transport him beyond his usual gravity and induce him to forget for a time his ordinary solemn deportment  additions to letter xli page     of all the propensities of plants none seem more strange than their different periods of blossoming some produce their flowers in the winter or very first dawnings of spring many when the spring is established some at midsummer and some not till autumn when we see the helleborus foetidus and helleborus niger blowing at christmas the helleborus hycmalis in january and the helleborus viridis as soon as ever it emerges out of the ground we do not wonder because they are kindred plants that we expect should keep pace the one with the other but other congenerous vegetables differ so widely in their time of flowering that we cannot but admire i shall only instance at present in the crocus sativus the vernal and the autumnal crocus which have such an affinity that the best botanists only make them varieties of the same genus of which there is only one species not being able to discern any difference in the corolla or in the internal structure yet the vernal crocus expands it is flowers by the beginning of march at farthest and often in very rigorous weather and cannot be retarded but by some violence offered  while the autumnal the saffron defies the insluence of the spring and summer and will not blow till most plants begin to sade and run to seed this circumstance is one of the wonders of the creation little noticed because a common occurrence yet ought not to be overlooked on account of it is being familiar since it would be as difficult to be explained as the most stupendous phenomenon in nature  say what impels amidst surrounding snow congealed the crocus flamy bud to glow say what retards amidst the summers blaze the autumnal bulb till pale declining days the god of seasons whose pervading power controls the sun or sheds the fleecy shower he bids each flower his quickening word obey or to each lingering bloom enjoins delay appendix no i no  ii carta petri et conventus ecclesie winton pro fundatione prioratus
