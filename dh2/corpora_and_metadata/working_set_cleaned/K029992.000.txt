newbery ludgate street williams fleet street evans in the strand and riley curzonstreet mayfair  mdcclxxiv  to the public at large an attachment to letters and a regard for the profession of an author would perhaps never have permitted the writer of the following pages to doubt the superiority of the literary artist or the propriety of the encouragement given to his labors above those of others had not an equal encouragement been obtained of the legislature a few years ago for engravers etchers and mezzotinto scrapers  this circumstance leading to an enquiry into the respective merits of artists in general the practitioners of the useful were found to lay so similar a claim to public encouragement with the professors of the polite arts that the distinction which the law had made in the right of property to their different labors could not fail to appear extremely partial and inequitable  with a view to state this partiality to the public the following tract in which the scientific and useful arts are compared with those of literature and curiosity in the respect abovementioned would have earlier appeared agreeably to the notice given in the public advertiser of june         had not the argument been thought to be affected by the then uncertain state of literary property this being since in some measure determined and the doctrine in question having received the sanction of very high authority the present publication is judged expedient to promote the design of obtaining farther encouragement for the exertions of useful ingenuity and thence facilitating future improvements in the produce manufactures and commerce of these kingdoms  not that artists in general will probably think it prudent to solicit an innovation at present so repugnant to public prejudice as that of being put precisely on the same footing with authors and engravers by displaying however the equity of their pretensions to equal consideration and encouragement it is presumed that the less objection may be made to their application for a parliametary extension of the usual term of exercising their inventions by patent with a repeal of the clause in the monopoly act which now restrains the crown in all cases indiscriminately from granting such patents for more than fourteen years a term in many particular cases greatly inadequate to the labor pains and expense attendant on bringing useful inventions and discoveries to perfection  the moderation of such a request may possibly induce some publicspirited patron of the useful arts to urge more powerfully the expediency of granting to their professors privileges proportionate to their personal merit and public utility  contents introduction   a property in words held more sacred than a property in things   section i of a natural right of

invasion of original copyright founded on the statute    no copyright by the statute in the author of publications not entered in the hall book of the company of stationers and of consequence in unpublished and unentered manuscripts    and seq an address to the artists and manufacturers of great britain introduction a writer who has devoted his time as much to the useful as the polite arts may take on him without impropriety to treat of that very partial distinction which the laws of his country have made between his right of property to the emoluments arising from his different pursuits  as an author and an artist of a certain class an exclusive right to profit by his compositions and inventions is secured to him by statute for a considerable term of years as an artificer or artist of any other class he is destitute of such security let his inventions or discoveries cost him what time or expense they may let them redound ever so much to public utility or private profit the author of them is adjudged to have no exclusive right to the exercise of his invention or the use of his discovery  it is indeed whimsical that in a scientific age and commercial nation a property in words should be held more sacred than a property in things that an artist who has literature enough to give a verbal description of the nature and design of any newlyinvented and useful machine should be legally entitled to the sole right of multiplying the copies of such description though he is denied such right of manufacturing or multiplying the copies of the machine itself this is still more whimsical if we reflect that such verbal description may be only a matter of mere curiosity and the first copy of it have been composed with facility in a few hours while the real instrument may be a subject of great utility and its fabrication have cost the inventor the study application and labor of years to surmount the difficulties attending its first construction  at a time therefore when the farther indulgence of the legislature is solicited in favor of literary property and even that which has been already granted by statute is thought by many an infringement of the natural rights of genius the professors of the useful arts will be wanting to themselves if they neglect the opportunity of laying claim to at least an equal indulgence founded on a plea of at least equal validity  not that the useful artist need rest his cause solely on comparative merit or found his pretensions to a like indulgence on the statute in favor of literary property with equal claim to the natural rights of genius it is by no means difficult to support his superior right to public encouragement on principles of political expediency  at the same time it is not pretended that this partial distinction between the author and the artificer is altogether peculiar to this island the practice of most other nations respecting the common property of discoveries and inventions in the useful arts affords a strong presumption that even granting a natural right of property in them to subsist it is either incapable of being ascertained and secured by law or incompatible with the political interests of the community and it is in vain for individuals to talk of possessing a property which the law cannot ascertain and secure or to contend for such possession if it militate against the general interests of society  how far a right of property in useful inventions and discoveries be founded in nature be capable of being protected by law or consistent with the general good of a commercial people becomes of course the subject of disquisition in the following pages  section i of a natural right of property in new inventions and discoveries in general in the late contests about literary property much has been said and written on the nature and origin of property in general the common lawyers wedded to words and forms have bandied about the technical terms of corporeal and incorporeal till they have almost forgot their simple use it has been proved however against them that there are incorporeal rights as easily ascertainable by law and as justly entitled to the protection of it as others which are corporeal without entering therefore into the dispute of the jus in re or particularly discussing the nature of the property contended for i shall enquire only how it originated and became the natural right of the claimant  the lawyers in general have not less perplexed the question respecting the origin of property than they have puzzled that about the nature of it restricted by the narrow notions which confine property to a corpus or body they have recurred no farther back for a right of possession than prior occupancy setting discoveries and inventions in literature and science on the same footing with the use and improvement of corporeal possessions but the author and inventor may deduce a right of property to their respective labors from a still earlier and more general source every man whom providence sends into the world has a natural right to live in it and if to live in it to the means of subsistence in the present state of society however the man who is born to no estate real or personal finds the means of subsistence by mere possession already engrossed by prior occupants he is therefore of necessity reduced to the creation of new means of livelihood a right to all corporeal property being already secured to others he must have recourse for subsistence to the incorporeal property he is endowed with by nature in the use of his personal talents he must live by his wits or his labor steal he must not and if to beg he be ashamed shall he be denied a right to the contrivance of his brain or the work of his hands this were to affirm that the poor are the naturalborn slaves of the rich and that the possession of corporeal property however obtained gives a right to the possession of all other an affirmation which i presume no freeborn subject of this country will venture to make  it is indeed now very generally admitted that a man can have no better natural right to any thing in the world than to the fruits of his own ingenuity and industry it were needless therefore to throw away time in confuting the casuistry by which the contrary opinion has been maintained  section ii of the pretended difference between authors and artificers regarding a right of property in their respective inventions the advocates for literary property have labored much to maintain as real an imaginary difference which they have set up between the author and the artificer in regard to an exclusive right of property in their respective compositions not that they had any valid plea to offer in support of their argument but because the right of the artificer being universally held untenable at common law if they admitted the author to stand in the same predicament they could not support his claim to a perpetuity in his copyright which they modestly contended for  the futility of the arguments adduced to maintain this supposed difference between the inventors of machines and the authors of books has been so fully displayed in several late publications and pleadings that it were superfluous to attempt to corroborate what has been delivered with so much equity and energy by the first lawyers of this and perhaps any other nation it will be sufficient to refer the reader who is curious to peruse them at large to a pamphlet entitled an enquiry into the nature and origin of literary property published in      to the late pleadings of the court of sessions in scotland the speeches of lord camden and several of the judges on the appeal and final determination of the cause in the house of lords   a certain celebrated writer however having since taken up the pen to urge a similar plea it may not be amiss to take some notice of it see a modest plea for copyright by catharine macaulay  with the intention says mrs macaulay of depriving authors of the honest the dearbought reward of their literary labors they have been raised a little higher instead of lower than the angels ibid page     and at the same time been levelled with the inventors of a very inferior order these inventors of an order very inferior to authors of books are the authors of new inventions and discoveries in the useful arts who it is asserted would be better rewarded for their ingenuity than writers even did they both stand upon the same footing in regard to time and other circumstances for the emoluments arising from their different inventive faculties  i know not how this ingenious writer will make good this assertion but i am persuaded that if the authors of such new inventions and discoveries did stand upon the same footing in regard to a legal security of a right of property in their respective productions as authors of books do they would not complain of injustice or contend for a perpetuity in such right  every common capacity says this writer can soon find out the use of a machine which is not the case with a book i accede to the latter part of the assertion because there are many books whose use cannot be found out at all as they are totally useless if not hurtful the former part i deny for as good a reason had this advocate for literary merit been familiar with the labors of our mathematical philosophical and even mechanic artists she would have known that there are many curious and useful machines with whose use the very makers of them are totally unacquainted  it is a length of time continues this author before the value of a literary publication is discovered and acknowledged by the vulgar and even when the merits of a work of this kind in regard to the honest intentions of the writer and the execution of the composition is in general allowed the malice of partyprejudice and that leaven of selfishness which prevails in the characters of the greater number of individuals may for a long term of years keep back the sale of a book which teaches an offensive doctrine or tells disagreeable truths to the public i hope the writer does not speak experimentally on this occasion as i am ready to go still farther in favor of deserving authors it is not only to the selfishness of individuals and the prejudice of party we may impute the keeping back the sale of a good book it may also be imputed to ignorance inattention or want of taste in the public in general from which causes the more curious refined and instructive the book the longer it will be before it attract sufficient notice to obtain a general sale  if i do not mistake no less than seven and twenty years elapsed before sir isaac newtons principia came to a second edition and i may cite mrs macaulays own authority for saying that when lord bacon published his philosophical ideas they were so little understood that they were deemed literary lumber nay that the learned and royal james whom the earl of shaftelbury terms the schoolmaster of his people compared them to the ways of god past finding out  in the same predicament may also the last book of newtons principia be said to stand even with most of our best mathematicians to this very day  this is undoubtedly a good argument for extending the term at present limited by statute in literary copyright there are certainly many laborious and expensive works whose sale during that term will by no means compensate the authors or undertakers for the intense study long labor and immense cost attending their execution  but the same argument holds equally good with respect to the authors of new inventions and discoveries in the arts and sciences many of which are effected only by amazing application tedious process and prodigious expense and yet the author thinks eight and twenty years too short a term in which to reap the benefit of his labors while the artist or artificer is not entitled by any law in being to a property in the effects of his ingenuity for a single day  i will not censure the impropriety with which the abovementioned writer calls the latter an inventor of a very inseriour order i beg leave however to remind the reader that it is not in the capacity of writers that either bacon or newton particularly the latter lays claim to public veneration the genius of newton was not of a literary cast nor does he raise our admiration or command our respect so much as an author as he does in the capacity of an inventor or artist the superiority of his character is not derived from his superior talents in turning periods and making books but in solving geometrical problems making physical experiments and manufacturing prisms and opticglasses it is sir isaac newton the mathematician the experimentalist the mechanic and not the writer whose name is so highly honored and transmitted with so much renown to posterity  it was to this great philosopher in these capacities also that the respect paid to him when living and the emoluments he reaped in consequence of it are more immediately to be attributed and shall the ingenuity of those talents which made his fortune in life and confer immortality on his name after death be held very inferior to his literary abilities which were at best on a level with mediocrity  lock has remarked it as a circumstance affecting to a speculative mind that a rational being should be employed all day long like a mere mechanical machine in sawing a block of marble montesquieu thought it no less so that a man of learning and ingenuity should employ himself as constantly in culling out words of the same found in order to express himself in rhyme and yet we have numerous instances in which a knack at versification though almost as easily attained as the gift of counting ones fingers has raised the possessor into a degree of public estimation and has elevated a blockhead destitute of science as of sense to an equal rank with men of invention and genius it may be said of montesquieu that he was no great poet and that nulla ars habet osorem nistignorantem  none despise any art but they who are ignorant of it whence the poets infer that authors who write prose do it merely because they cannot write verse it may be retorted however on the versifiers that the high opinion they conceive of their own art generally proceeds from their ignorance of most others at the same time it must be owned that as far as writers are concerned none can be accounted an adept in his art or fully master of the language in which he writes who has not both a taste and a talent for versification in this view the art of poetry is like that of dancing an accomplishment worth the attainment of youth though constantly neglected as wisdom and gravity are attained by age   it is hinted by the writer abovementioned that authors claim a greater indulgence of the legislature than other artists because their writings tend to the improvement of the human mind whereas the productions of inventors of an inferivur order serve only to promote the purposes of luxury or at best to furnish those conveniences which are not absolutely necessary to the comforts of life i shall not here enter into the discussion of the political dispute about the conveniences of life or take on me to determine how far the purposes of luxury may be rendered compatible with the interests of a commercial nation but this i may venture to declare that there is a wide difference between the encouragement politically necessary to be given to literature in the infancy of a language and uncivilized state of society and that which is either necessary or expedient when both are arrived to a degree of cultivation and refinement  indeed i do by no means admit that the human mind is so much improved by mere reading as is generally imagined an application to practical science enlarges and improves it frequently much more than the study of mere theory but were it even otherwise i cannot help thinking that the literary productions of a refined and luxurious age tend less to the farther improvement of the minds of individuals than new inventions and discoveries in the arts and sciences contribute to the farther improvement of the body politic and the political happiness of a people  be this as it may whatever general argument affects the interest of the author in regard to his right of property in new literary compositions must equally affect the artificer in respect to a right of property in new mechanical or other useful inventions it is therefore very inconsequentially inferred that the one has a greater or less natural right to the fruits of his industry and ingenuity than the other  if the case of ingenious authors or of their representatives the booksellers be then in any degree hard and deserving relief that of ingenious artificers is still much more so as they would be well satisfied were they only placed on the worst footing in which the former securely stand under the protection of the statute  section iii on the political expediency of giving public encouragement to inventions and discoveries in the arts and sciences in general it may be thought needless to urge any other argument to prove the political expediency of encouraging improvements in arts and sciences than the universal practice of enlightened and wellregulated states among commercial nations in particular the superiority which the one acquires over the other is universally allowed to result from a superior degree of ingenuity and industry in its respective inhabitants it is these that give rise to improvements in agriculture manufactures and commerce and are the inexhaustible resources of national wealth and political happiness  while a spirit of emulation therefore prevails between states as among individuals it becomes the national interest and thence the indispensible duty of government to promote a spirit of industry and foster the seeds of ingenuity not only among the superior class of authors and artists but also among the lower order of artisans mechanics mariners and husbandmen  the favorites of the muses and such of the higher order of inventors whose thirst of glory or natural curiosity sufficiently animate them to exploits of genius these i say need no stimulation to urge them forward in the pursuits of fame or knowledge it is to such however that government has been frequently liberal as if it were laudably necessary to make a generous provision for those who devote their talents disinterestedly to the service of the public without regard to their private emolument with the generality of mankind nevertheless whatever be their inventive talents or intellectual capacity a principle of selfinterest is the ruling motive of action and the only constant stimulative to the exertion of their private abilities for the public service not that the greatest of our poetical geniuses have been insensible to pecuniary emoluments even shakespeare himself as a brother bard observes for gain not glory winged his towering flight and grew immortal in his own despite  hence it is that a reward proportional to the merit of that service should ever be held forth for their encouragement  as to mere labor though it should not as virtue is said to be left merely to its own reward it certainly should be as virtue generally is rewarded but moderately men possessed of no property and capable of nothing but labor are entitled to nothing but the means of daily subsistence were they possessed of more they would remit their daily labor so that a numerous body of industrious poor is a fund of real wealth to the community but the reward of incessant labor and that of industrious ingenuity should be different the perseverance of the labourer providing merely for the subsistence of the individual or of a few while the industry of the inventor provides for the convenience of hundreds the subsistence of thousands and the support of the state the difference which nature has thus made among men and which is infinitely more striking and characteristical than the gewgaw distinctions of civil society gives them a real title to preeminence the marks of superior talents are indelible proofs of their rightful claim to superior respect and consideration it is hence with the utmost injustice that the ignorant and indolent great blend the artificer and the labourer together and confound them indiscriminately with the refuse of mankind  with the labourer may also be ranked the retailer of simple commodities whose profession requiring the meanest of natural talents should be as little profitable as possible consistent with the support of a family employed in domestic duties or engaged like himself in the business of his profession  nothing it is true is more common than to see an opulent retailer live luxuriously himself and maintain his family in idleness out of profits oppressively wrung from the hard hands of the labourer or insidiously derived from the inventive brain of the artisan but where the channels of consumption are not increased by the increasing number of traders their multiplicity becomes a burden to the state and their extravagance a political evil of the most fatal tendency these therefore merit no encouragement that may serve to increase their number which is already become a public nuisance  with venders of their own manufactures cultivators of their own or other mens lands and with traders of a superior class by whom the art of commerce itself is almost improved into a science the case is different as patrons and promoters of the useful arts in general they merit every encouragement which the law can secure or ministerial policy bestow  again it is necessary to distinguish not only between the merits of different classes of artists but between the real and nominal artists of the same class between the manufacturer for instance who merely copies and vends the inventions of others and he who fabricates and vends his own any peculiar encouragement given to the former tends to establish a monopoly injurious to traders in general but without such encouragement being given to the latter the spirit of invention is checked ingenuity droops and the want of improvement in the commodities of sale prove equally injurious to trade itself  that the legislature have in some instances looked on the expediency of giving public encouragement to useful inventions and discoveries in the same light is obvious the parliamentary rewards that have been offered and paid for the finding out the longitude for the method of making saltwater fresh for a nostrum for the stone and for several other inventions and discoveries afford a sufficient proof that the encouragement of ingenuity by rewarding the authors of such inventions and discoveries is in general adjudged to be politically expedient  from the many objections therefore that have been started to almost every such particular encouragement it is presumed that exceptions must have been taken either to the nature and extent of it or to the method in which it has been bestowed i shall for this reason proceed to take a view of the several modes in which such encouragement has been offered and given and endeavor by obviating those objections to point out a method of bestowing it in such a manner as may be least hurtful to individuals and most conducive to the ends proposed viz the contributing to the conveniences and embellishments of life and the facilitating future improvements in the produce manufactures and commerce of our country  section iv on the methods which have hitherto been taken to encourage improvements in the arts as the first of these methods i rank parliamentary premiums being the most liberal and best becoming the character of an opulent and powerful people  to this method however may be made many objections as well on the part of the public whose money is thus bestowed as on the part of the artist or inventor who is to receive it as a compensation for his labor or ingenuity the expense and difficulty of obtaining it may be grievous to the one as that of granting it may be burdensome to the other while the quantum of it will always run the risk of being inadequate either to the utility of which the invention may prove to the public to the merit of the discovery or to the pains which the author may have taken to bring it to perfection whereas such premium should be ever adapted to all three  we have a remarkable instance of all these circumstances united in the affair of mr harrisons contrivance for finding out the longitude there is no doubt that the ingenious contriver after the success of forty years application deserved the reward to which he was entitled it was yet with difficulty he obtained it and though it might be deemed adequate to the pains he had taken and the ingenuity of his contrivance it is indubitable that the discovery of his invention has proved of little utility in navigation i do not find his clock is ever likely to become of general and common use as the encouragement given by so ample a compensation seems to require  it is remarkable also that mrs stevenss famous medicine for dissolving the stone for the discovery of whose composition the legislature granted five thousand pounds however efficacious before has cured hardly any body fince it was made public  i will not call in question mr irwins method of making saltwater fresh but am well assured that the discovery of as simple and speedy a process might have been purchased for less money  there is indeed no little danger that both the quantum and the facility of obtaining of parliamentary premiums may depend as well on personal interest as on particular ingenuity or public utility the merit of the incomparable hogarth is universally acknowledged and yet it will hardly be denied that an useful artist of equal ingenuity has some right to complain that he is entitled to no property in his inventions when the widow of that ingenious engraver was indulged with an additional term of twenty years copyright in the designs of her deceased husband over and above the fourteen years that had already been enjoyed by virtue of the statute  the indulgence lately granted by parliament to the proprietors of that elegant pile of building the adelphi to dispose of their property by way of lottery appears to have given very general disgust it is to be hoped the like favor bestowed on the ingenious mr cox to dispose of his museum will give more satisfaction but whatever merit might justly recommend these artists to parliamentary indulgence this method of giving public encouragement to the authors of new inventions is so liable to be perverted by partiality or prejudice that it can by no means be consistent with sound policy to permit the indiscriminate application of individuals to be indulged in the use of it  of the petty premiums presented by the societies for the encouragement of arts and manufactures supported by popular subscription i shall say but little as indeed but little is to be said instituted on publicspirited principles but perverted by private cabals the laudable purposes of their institution have been seldom attained in the mean time we hear the candidates for their premiums as clamorous in their complaints of injustice done to their merit as severe in their invectives against the want of knowledge or candor in those who are to judge of it it is with these as with all other mixed societies however unanimous and moderate in their commencement like the parts of an heterogeneous fluid the more solid and important subside while the volatile and insignificant rise uppermost and float constantly on the surface the more sensible and judicious of the members remain silent or retire leaving the business of the association to be transacted by the empty the ignorant and the vain  from such societies therefore little good and still less permanency in the administration of it is to be expected if partiality and prejudice also may be supposed to affect the great council of the nation how much more may such an unwholesome leaven be supposed to affect the fermenting particles of so preposterous a compound  as an essential part of the criterion by which the quantity and quality of public encouragement proper to be given to artists and inventors of any kind is the public utility of their compositions and inventions it is indeed highly improper that the quantum at least of such encouragement should be determined before such utility be eventually decided  the most plausible and politic method of bestowing that encouragement is therefore that by which the eventual utility of such inventions is made the measure of reward this is effected either by vesting a legal right of property in the inventor as in the case of writers engravers etc or by the grant of letterspatent from the crown as in the case of mathematical artists chemical experimentalists artificers and manufacturers  section v on the similarity of predicament between the practitioners of the scientific and mechanic arts and the professors of the arts of design i have already endeavored to show that authors who practice rather the imitative than the inventive arts at least all but those few writers whose productions are truly original have not a more natural right to the proprietary indulgence granted them by the legislature than have the artificers whose inventions and discoveries are really new and useful i am not a little flattered to find an opinion long since suggested by my own reading coincident with a late reflection of that great luminary in law and equity lord camden  i shall beg leave to expatiate here therefore somewhat more diffusely on the impropriety of that distinction which the legislature has made between the practitioners of the useful and those of the polite arts and of the injurious partiality of the law in regard to their right of property in their respective productions  but perhaps the state of dereliction and oppression under which the useful arts at present labor proceeds rather from involuntary neglect than design inventors and artificers have been wanting to their own interests in not applying like authors and booksellers for a copyright in their inventions and compositions time has been when literary artists were obliged as others are now to purchase a temporary property in their works with letterspatent from the crown nay the use of the press itself was once held dependant on royal prerogative writers have been emancipated from such a state of slavery the press has been laid open and on application to the legislature authors and their assigns have been vested with an exclusive right of property in their productions nay practitioners in the arts of design and as i conceive composers of music too are invested with a similar right shall the authors then of chemical discoveries the inventors of mathematical instruments the contrivers of essential improvements in manufactures shall these i say hesitate to follow the example or doubt of obtaining similar redress  on principles of equity no rational objection can be made to it nor indeed on any other ground without arguing inferior merit from superior utility and hard indeed were the case of industrious ingenuity if its desert should defeat its reward  the polite arts it is true make a more splendid and imposing appearance they assume a dignity and importance which may seem to give them a right to property and support but it is merely on the presumptuous plea by which a reduced and beggarly noblesse infer from the possession of empty titles a right to the luxuries of life while they indolently eat the bread of idleness  it is great it is wonderful sublime no doubt to build the lofty rhyme but deaf to what the poet sings though charm his muse the ear of kings the patriot sees more wit and good in the invention of a marrowpudding anon but granting that authors under the auspices of the muses and the specious pretense of improving the human mind by their writings are entitled to greater encouragement than other artists the merit of engravers etchers and mezzotintoscrapers surely places them in the same predicament in the eye of reason with that of practitioners in the other manual arts it cannot be pretended that the labor of the engraver of a print or the copyist of a picture in chiaro oscuro is either more ingenious or useful than that of the contriver of a mathematical instrument or mechanical machine and yet the engravers and mezzotintoscrapers following the example of the authors obtained by degrees an equal indulgence from the legislature to an exclusive right of property in their labors  it may not be amiss to trace the proceeding of these favored artists in their successful attempts to obtain this desired indulgence  it appears from the journals of the house of commons that the petition of the engravers for the act which passed in their favor in the  th of george ii refers to the statute of queen anne in favor of authors with whom the petitioners desired to be put on the same sooting this desire however seems at that time to have been rather premature as they could obtain only a statutory right for the single term of fourteen years and that only in the copies of their own original designs the obtaining this was yet encouragement to ask more  by a subsequent act in the  th of his present majesty they were accordingly indulged in the very ample manner following be it enacted that all and every person and persons who shall engrave etch or work in mezzotinto or chiaro oscuro or cause to be engraved etched or worked any print taken from any picture drawing model or sculpture either ancient or modern shall have and are hereby declared to have the benefit and protection of the said act  meaning the act of the  th of george ii and this act for the term herein after mentioned in like manner as if such print had been graved or drawn from the original design of such graver etcher or draftsman and if any person shall engrave print and publish or import for sale any copy of any such print contrary to the true intent and meaning of this and the said former act every such person shall be liable to the penalties contained in the said act to be recovered as therein and herein after mentioned  the term of the exclusive privilege granted by the former act was in this also extended  the sole right and liberty intended to be secured and protected by the said former act and this act shall be extended continued and be extended continued and be vested in the respective proprietors for the space of twentyeight years to commence from the day of the first publishing of any of the works respectively herein before and in the said former act mentioned  we see here the mere copyist or imitator put on a sooting with original inventors and even the manual excrcise of the graver scraping knife stippling punch and needle more fully rewarded than even the labors of the writer for it is to be observed that the authors right to the second fourteen years is conditional he cannot legally transfer it to the bookseller till the expiration of the first nay it may admit of a doubt whether he can do it then for a longer term than his own life should that fall short of eight and twenty years from the time of the first publication   but will it be pretended that the use of those tools in their operation on the surface of a copperplate is more ingenious or useful and therefore more worthy of public encouragement than is the use of the same or similar tools in their operation on any other substance or to any other purpose  it is remarkable that by the last mentioned act the partiality complained of by useful artists is extended also to the polite i had almost said the useless ones it will not be doubted that the arts of sculpture and of casting figures of plaster of paris potters earth etc from models are equally ingenious and curious with those of etching engraving and scraping delineations of them on copper and yet the engraver who copies after any such model either ancient or modern is vested with an exclusive right to multiply such copies for his own profit whereas the artist who is at the pains to form moulds from such models and casts the very figure itself has no such right but may have his figures imitated and multiplied to the profit of others without legal redress  a singular instance of partiality respecting the right of property in this particular may be observed between the caution with which engravers invade the right and attempt to pirate the works of each other and the temerity with which modellers copy without scruple the ingenious works of their brother artists  nay so little idea of copyright have the latter in their respective labors that they disregard even the privilege of a patent in the hands of other artists under pretense that their manufacture is not of new invention at least this is the plea which i have seen advanced in the public prints against the validity of the patent of those ingenious and excellent artists messieurs wedgwood and bentloy for taking off the sigures of antique models in a terracotta peculiar to themselves  i know not how far our courts of law may countenance this pretext but the modellers are certainly as much entitled in reason to an exclusive right of copying models ancient and modern as the eagravers to copy ancient or modern drawings of them  i might indeed go farther and insist that in equity they should be admitted to claim a right under the same act which seems peculiarly intended to favor the arts dependent on the press for if the linenprinters paperstainers there are other paperstainers besides authors claim under it as some of them do that is such as print and stain from engravings or scrapings on copperplates now it might puzzle the most able casuist at the statute law to give a reason why an exclusive copyright should be granted in an impression taken from a copperplate and not in the same impression taken from a block of cut wood and yet if i am not much misinsormed in this matter such is the state of the case  an exclusive right to their respective prints and patterns the caster of impressions of models in plaisler of paris potters clay or papiermachee has an equal right to insist on his exclusive property to the copies taken off his moulds unless indeed an essential difference be made by the surfaces sustaining the impression being hollow or slat between a seeming plane and a bassorelievo which i think will be hardly asserted as it would lead to a farther distinction between the basso and alto and the whole argument become ridiculous  if then linenprinters paperstainers papiermacheworkers and modellers of every kind are equally entitled in equity and some of them by law to an exclusive copyright in their respective labors no good reason can possibly be given why artificers of all kinds should not be equally entitled to such an exclusive privilege of fabricating any manufacture whose novelty of form or use and design are peculiar to themselves  the late lord hardwicke speaking of the act of queen anne in favor of authors and booksellers called it a general standing patent calculated to save them the trouble and expense from between fourscore and an hundred pounds of applying to the king for a privilege every time they printed a new book  now the acts of the  th of george ii and of the  th of his present majesty are nothing but copies of the said act of queen anne confessedly passed to put engravers etchers mezzotintoscrapers and printsellers on the same footing with authors and booksellers what a pity the woodcutters and letterfounders did not join in the petition that the legislature might have seen either the absurdity of passing such an act or that of not putting artists of all kinds on the same footing   but why are authors engravers etchers mezzotintoscrapers and by virtue of their right booksellers printsellers linenprinters paperstainers etc to be so highly favored above letterfounders woodcutters modellers in plaster chasers enamellers engravers on plate and gems and indeed all other artists and artificers employed in the embellishments and conveniences of life  if this question be unanswerable surely that must be equally so which asks why the authors of new inventions in the useful arts the improvers of our produce and manufactures the promoters of our national trade and commerce should not be equally favored  the inventor of a machine or art useful in life is now almost universally admitted to stand precisely on the same footing with the author of a book but were this still doubted it cannot be doubted that he stands upon as good a footing and has the same right to encouragement as the engraver of a print or the practitioner of an art more ornamental than useful  would it not be extremely inequitable therefore and highly derogatory to the wisdom and justice of the legislature that the latter should continue to enjoy the benefit to use lord hardwickes words of a general standing patent without any expense for every new print he publishes and that the former shall still be put to the trouble of applying to the king for a patent and put to the expense of eighty or a hundred pounds i rate the expense here in the most moderate manner if the patent require to be engrossed on more than one skin of parchment and the clerks in office generally find it necessary to have at least two the es are doubled and the expense of a patent amounts to much more  every time he publishes a new invention  an artificer may be very ingenious and at the same time be very poor he may have bestowed his time and industry he may even have expended a moderate patrimony in bringing his invention to perfection and shall his labor time and money be after all thrown away at least with regard to himself and his family unless he can raise an hundred or an hundred and forty pounds to purchase a right of property in the fruits of his past labor yet so it is and the consequence is that either the invention is suppressed and the public deprived of its advantages or it is sold for a trifle to some wealthier artisan whose purse enables him to profit by the others ingenuity well may the useful artist exclaim with the poet sic vos non vobis nidisicates aves sic vos non vobis vellera sertis oves sic vos non vobis mellisicatis apes sic vos non vobis sertis aratra boves and well may these lines be thus paraphrased so for the cuckoo builds the lark her nest for fleecing shearers sheep provide the vest for goading plowmen oxen turn the soil and bees make honey for the wasps to spoil   but perhaps i am unnecessarily laboring to prove what is suffciently obvious for if i rightly recollect it has been long since maintained that the author of a machine or useful invention has as well as the author of a book an equitable right to insist that he should have the exclusive right of selling his work for such a length of time as ought to reimburse him his expense and recompense him for his trouble see an enquiry into the nature and origin of literary property  vo        how far this argument will hold good respecting what the legislature has already done in placing inventors and even mere practitioners of the polite arts on the footing of authors i will not pretend to say but if it has done right with respect to the ornamental arts the argument will hold a fortiori in favor of the useful either the legislature has done too much for engravers etchers stipplers and scrapers or it has done too little for all other artists  as it would ill become an individual therefore to impeach the wisdom and justice of the legislature i admit the propriety of what it has done for the former artists in particular and thence infer the propriety of the application for its extending the like indulgence to artists in general  section vi on the objections that may be made to placing the useful and polite arts on the same footing i am not insensible that in the contracted view of a narrowminded politician a thousand imaginary difficulties will attend the adoption of the expedient proposed but things are not impracticable or improper merely because they are difficult if the useful arts have this claim on the justice of the community we may rest assured that the adopting it will have a good effect on its public interests  as general reflections however tend not to convince those who can raise only particular exceptions i shall examine into the validity of a few of the most striking objections  the first difficulty that presents itself against the granting an exclusive privilege to the authors of new inventions in the useful arts is the general one of establishing monopolies which are supposed to have the pernicious effects of enriching a few and depriving a multitude of the means of subsistence of enhancing the price of the manufactures monopolized and thence of course proving injurious to domestic economy and foreign commerce  as to monopolies it is an odious word without a determinate meaning in its legal sense as desined by hawkins blackstone and others it has no proper reference to new inventions in the useful arts monopolies says blackstone are much the same offense in other branches of trade that engrossing is in provisions being a license or privilege allowed by the king for the sole buying and selling making working or using of any thing whatsoever whereby the subject in general is restrained from that liberty of manufacturing or trading which he had before these had been carried to an enormous height during the reign of queen elizabeth and were heavily complained of by sir edward coke in the beginning of the reign of king james the first but were in a great measure remedied by statute    jac i c   which declares such monopolies contrary to law and void except as to patents not exceeding the grant of fourteen years to the authors of new inventions  it was owing as that very eminent lawyer very justly observes to the enormous height to which those royal grants were carried in the time of elizabeth and james that the act of parliament passed against them it was owing also to the just resentment of the two houses of parliament against the violent stretch of the prerogative by which they rose to that height that they lost sight of the real object of that resentment falling into the absurdity of inserting a clause excepting new inventions in an act to restrain monopolies with which new inventions had nothing to do  for if a monopoly be only a license or privilege for the sole buying selling making working or using of a thing whereby the subject in general is restrained from that liberty of manufacturing or trading he had before it is plain that the subject is not so restrained by any exclusive privilege granted to the author of a new discovery produce invention or species of manufacture which the subject in general could not manufacture and in which of course he did not trade before  in respect to the effects of exclusive privileges in enriching a few persons impoverishing others and keeping multitudes poor the circumstance is inseparable from new inventions discoveries and improvements till it be determined good policy therefore for a nation not to encourage such inventions and improvements the private interest of individuals must necessarily give way to that of the public  let us suppose that a scientific or even practical artist should invent a machine by means of which one man might be capable of doing the work of a thousand should not his invention be encouraged because a number of laborers would be to seek for employment it is hard no doubt for poor men who are as dull and uninventive as they are poor to be obliged at an advanced period of life to turn their hands to a species of labor to which they are not accustomed but this plea might be urged against almost all useful improvements whatever most of them tending to expedite mechanical operation and render manual labor cheap hence machines to save or expedite such labor are encouraged in allwellgoverned states what indeed would be the consequence if in any one they were not would not the neglected inventors of such machines repair to other states where they might meet with deserved encouragement and would not the state in which labor should be cheapest and manufactures most expeditiously fabricated have caeteris paribus the advantage of others at all foreign markets about sixty years ago if i mistake not application was made to parliament for encouragement to certain individuals for erecting mills for the sawing of timber it was opposed by the petition of a numerous body of sawyers compassion for whose families prevented such encouragement then taking place we have been contented since to pay to the dutch and other nations many hundred thousand pounds for the sawing of timber which they have earned by the same kind of mills that might otherwise been erected in this kingdom  the legislature indeed have of late years seen into this impolicy but though they indemnified mr dingley for what lie suffered by the indiscretion of the populace in destroying his saw mill at limehouse they have not as yet thought it expedient to give sufficient encouragement for the erection of more  it is certain that upon every newinvention or essential improvement in any species of manufacture the manufacturers in the oldway in that branch of business will be clamorous against an exclusive privilege being granted to the improver or inventor but should this have any weight with the legislature the dullest and most uninventive artisan in the world bearing the name of the same profession or occupation may thence claim aright to equal emoluments with the most expert and ingenious of his vocation but would it be either just or politic to admit his claim i have before hinted at the difference which nature itself has made and of consequence sound policy should make between those who have ingenuity to contrive and those who have only strength to labor see page      the skillful cultivator or the ingenious artificer may be compared to the be that extracts from the flowers of the field those mellifluous sweets of which drones and wasps would gladly partake when readymade but because drones and wasps would live like bees on honey are we therefore to rob the hives of the latter to give the former an equal share of the sweets of a manufacture they are not qualified to fabricate as the mere retailers of commodities ought not to grow rich by the labor of others so mere laborers ought to be kept poor that they may continue to be laborers  that they may be capable of labor also they should not be permitted to starve hence on every temporary revolution which new inventions in the mechanic arts necessarily occasion among our laboring artisans their relief should be provided for by the state either by giving a public reward to the authors of such inventions and making them common or by providing a temporary subsistence for such artisans till they can turn their hands to some other employment  we have a recent instance of a numerous industrious and useful body of artisans being hurt by a new ingenious and useful invention this is the method of bending timber for carriagewheels so that the periphery or rim which used to be composed of different sellies consists of one piece  the ingenious inventor has it seems spent a considerable time and been at prodigious expense and trouble to bring his scheme to perfection and as he has obtained a patent for the exercise of it he may probably indemnify himself and even reap some profit by it adequate to its merit in the mean time however the superior strength and lightness of the wheels of this manufacture giving them a preference to all others the common wheelwrights for the present labor under a hardship from which though they have a right to ask relief of the legislature they have none to complain of the inventor or of the exclusive privilege he enjoys by his patent many instances of a similar nature might be pointed out amongst the ingenious artificers of this kingdom  i have indeed already observed that the bestowing of parliamentary premiums for discoveries and inventions whose utility is problematical is a very improper mode of encouraging ingenuity for the reasons then assigned see page    those reasons do not oppose the giving such premiums for inventions whose utility is publicly experienced  as to the pretext that grants of exclusive property or privilege in the exercise of new inventions tend to enhance the price of the newlyinvented manufactures it may be answered that as such grants do not compel any one to purchase these new manufactures the public are left at liberty at the lower price to encourage the old and this they will certainly do neglecting the new if their superiority of merit be not adequate to the advance of price  but it has been said of patentees in particular that their privileges tend to throw advantages into the hands of foreigners who not being restricted by our patents can fabricate and carry such new and improved manufactures to market cheaper than our countrymen the patentees  when they who advance this objection can bring one single instance to corroborate their affection i shall think it merits a reply till then i hold it sufficient to say in favor of patentees in general that as it is their interest to extend the use and sale of their commodities as much us possible it becomes their interest also to vend them as cheap as they can well be afforded at the same time it may not be improper to add that the sooner their patent or exclusive privilege of property expires the higher the price will they be induced to set on them whereas the longer the term of their privilege the cheaper can they afford and will therefore be induced to sell them  it will be objected perhaps for every trifling difficulty will be made an objection that if artists and artificers in general were put on the same footing as authors and engravers claiming an exclusive property in their new productions on the same easy terms of publication or entrance of their claim in some public office the pretenders to such claims would be so numerous and the pretended inventions of many so srivolous that it would give rise to endless vexatious suits and litigations but to this it may be replied that the increasing number of pretenders to new inventions would be a proof that the encouragement offered had answered the end of it by awakening the spirit of ingenuity and industry and would give ground to hope that out of so many pretenders some might deserve encouragement  as to those whose inventions were really new or whose improvements were essentially useful the point of right would be soon settled for it will hardly be pretended that the claim dependant on a precise mode of specification which is now secured by patent could not be equally as well secured by act of parliament i have indeed given an instance in which the right of the engraver secured by statute is admitted even by those who contest a similar right secured by patent see page     whereas with such contrivances as were futile and frivolous the point of right would be soon found not worth contending for either by the invader or defender so that this kind of litigation would soon be at an end  at the same time the curiosity of genius would be awakened its industry roused and the spirit of enterprise revived the ingenious though indigent artificer would not then be deterred from prosecuting a favorite and useful pursuit from the consideration that he could not raise money to purchase a patent should he succeed in his endeavors and that he was only racking his brains for the emolument of others a proper distinction would be then made between the inventive artificer and the uninventive artisan those who are qualified to employ others and those who are capable only to work themselves the respect due to each would be ascertained their due degree of encouragement pointed out and every branch of the arts and sciences flourish while the trunk would be nourished by being properly watered at the root  section vii on the restraint laid on the kings prerogative from giving encouragement to useful artists i am not to learn that exclusive privileges whether by parliamentary grant or royal prerogative are extremely unpopular or that they are particularly obnoxious to the penurious great who instead of grudging the artificer the reward of his ingenuity should be the first most liberally to encourage it unhappily indeed both for ingenuity and industry the superior privilege of being born to do nothing induces such highlyfavoured mortals to conceit that their inferiors were born to do for nothing every thing for them hence the situation of industrious ingenuity at present reminds one of the state of slavery under which the egyptians held the israelites of old whom their insolent taskmasters required to make brick without furnishing them with straw  it has been before observed that such privileges do not compel the public to purchase new manufactures there is therefore less reason for wealthy individuals to complain against them than artificers and traders whose private interest may be materially affected at the same time if we reflect that without the encouragement of such exclusive privileges no new inventions or improvements of any considerable consequence can be expected the opposing them is not less impolitic and absurd than illiberal and unjust  and yet notwithstanding all that may be both politically and equitably urged in behalf of giving a general parliamentary encouragement to new inventions and placing ingenious artists of all kinds on the same footing i am not without apprehensions that the policy of the times may be sound too pusilanimous to carry so salutary a measure into execution  but though neither reason nor justice should prevail so far as they ought i flatter myself with the hope that a power of properly and readily rewarding industrious ingenuity may be lodged somewhere  in other countries as it was in this before the passing the act against monopolies a discretionary power is placed in the hands of government to give such encouragement by exclusive privileges for a term of years which may be renewed or extended according to the exigencies or peculiar merits of the case in england this power held universally elsewhere to be still inherent to the dignity of the sovereign was abridged by the statute before mentioned of the   st of james i it may not be improper therefore in this place to enquire a little into the motives and propriety of this abridgment of the royal prerogative with this view i shall beg leave to cite the following passage from blackstones commentaries  on the accession of king james i no new degree of royal power was added to or exercised by him but such a scepter was too weighty to be wielded by such a hand the unreasonable and imprudent exertion of what was then deemed to be prerogative upon trivial and unworthy occasions and the claim of a more absolute power inherent in the kinglyoffice than had ever been carried into practice soon awakened the sleeping lion the people heard with astonishment doctrines preached from the throne and the pulpit subversive of liberty and property and all the natural rights of humanity they examined into the divinity of this claim and found it weakly and fallaciously supported and common reason assured them that if it were of human origin no constitution could establish it without power of revocation no precedent could sanctify on length of time could confirm it the leaders felt the pulse of the nation and found they had ability as well as inclination to resist it and accordingly resisted and opposed it whenever the pusillanimous temper of the monarch had courage to put it to the trial and they gained some little victories in the cases of concealments monopolies and the dispensing power  it appears from the above state of the case that this restraint on the kings prerogative was laid at a time when the people alarmed for their most essential and valuable privileges were in a state of hostility with the crown of whose encroachments they were to the highest degree jealous and whose exertions of power they were determined on every occasion to oppose their fears excited their passions heated and their resentinent roused against real injuries it is no wonder their discretion was not suffciently on its guard to prevent their encountering imaginary ones  not that many of the royal monopolies then established were not injurious oppressive and deserving abolishment but they might and doubtless would at any other period have been abolished without depriving the prerogative of one of the brightest jewels of the crown for such we may justly term the power of patronizing ingenuity and promoting the arts of civil life  but the rage of reformation as i have before observed stifled the reflection that the exercise of new inventions were not monopolies in that sense which had thrown on the word an odium continued to this day the times however are altered and though new inventions remain destitute of proper encouragement we see monopolies of the most destructive tendency established by the combination and sometimes even the separate influence of opulent individuals not only without being countenanced by the crown but even directly contrary to the most express and positive acts of the legislature  change of times will justify change of measures so far is the nation at present from hearing any doctrines preached from the throne or the pulpit subversive of liberty property and the natural rights of humanity as in the time of james i that we have not the least reason to apprehend an abuse of any additional power that may be restored to the crown respecting this part of its prerogative  should it be judged therefore at present inexpedient to grant or be found through popular prejudice impracticable to obtain the general parliamentary encouragement abovementioned it is to be hoped the legislature will have no objection to repeal the clause in the aforesaid act of the   st of james   restricting the grants of the crown by patent to the term of fourteen years  certain indeed it is that there are some pretended improvements and inventions so trivial and useless that their authors do not merit an exclusive privilege to exercise or profit by them a single day but this is far from being the case with all the term of fourteen years however is so short that few inventors choose to ask for less and it is not at present in the power of the crown if any deserve it to grant more it is this circumstance which eventually and in fact prevents any distinction being made between the encouragement given to the most difficult expensive and important of such inventions and the most obvious insignificant and trivial  a number of instances might be particularized in which the grant of an exclusive right for fourteen years only is greatly inadequate and disproportional to the ingenuity labor expense and utility of such inventions but the legislature itself having acknowledged it by particular grants of premiums to inventors even after the expiration of the term of their patents it is presumed needless to insist farther on what is so manifestly expedient and equitable in justice however to a most useful invention and the ingenious contriver of it i cannot forbear instancing mr hartleys expedient for preventing houses taking fire by lining the cielings with thin plates of iron a method so extremely simple and efficacious that one would imagine in a case of such necessity it need only to be seen to be adopted but if we reflect on the unaccountable security of inattention and indolence which every days experience teaches us we shall not be inclined to wonder if fourteen or even forty years elapse before it come into sufficient use to make the inventor any compensation equal to its merit this gentleman therefore certainly deserves an exclusive privilege for a much longer term than fourteen years or a present parliamentary premium adequate to the importance and utility of his invention  how far what i have written may tend to excite useful artists to apply for redress or induce the legislature to grant it time will determine but be the consequences what they may i lay down the pen well satisfied with having testified my inclination to promote the cause of industrious ingenuity and in that the general interests of my country  appendix containing strictures on certain singular consequences attending the late decision on literary property after the copious and masterly manner in which the subject of literary property has been lately treated as well in the court of sessions in scotland as in the house of lords it may be deemed impertinent to think any farther animadversion necessary but a circumstance or two to which it was not the immediate business of the speakers to pay attention leading to consequences that appear strangely inconsistent with modern practice i am induced to take the present opportunity of noticing them  by the solemn decisions in the courts abovementioned denying the perpettuiy of such property and resting copyright merely on the statute the practice of the court of chancery in granting injunctions against pretended pirates and invaders of such property is materially affected  if authors have no foundation for copyright at common law the proceedings in equity must be founded solely and strictly on the statute by which it does by no means appear that abstracts abridgements and compilations of which the greater number of the new books now published consist are at all contrary to law  it is to little purpose to determine whether literary property be temporary or perpetual unless the nature of that property be also precisely determined in the works of original writers such as shakespeare milton etc this property is sufficiently ascertained but for one original writer that appears in the republic of letters there are five hundred copyists and compilers their number also of necessity increases as books are multiplied nor can it well be otherwise unless all improvements in literature be precluded nil dictum quod non dictum prius was said near two thousand years ago with how much more propriety therefore may it be said at present in historical writings and books of science of any extent originality cannot be pretended to and if compilations abstracts and epitomes are to be no longer allowed the papermills may stop the printingpress stand still and its numerous retainers be obliged literally to starve  it has been long the custom in the court of chancery to grantinjunctions against the printers and publishers of historical and other compilations under the pretense of staying waste in consequence of which an injunction ex part is granted by which the publication is stopped till after every studied delay of exception to the defendants answer the complainants bill is on hearing dismissed and the injunction dissolved when it is frequently impracticable to resume the publication and the author or bookseller is reduced to the necessity of sitting down with the loss attending an imperfect work with that of a procrastinated and litigious lawsuit into the bargain  the practice of the court of chancery teems with suits of this kind in which the complainant waves his right to such damages as he might claim under the act of parliament although he often confessedly grounds his bill on that act applying in the first instance to the chancellor to whose hands the decision of what is or is not securable property in every book is thus transferred  another inconvenience still less attended to and more singular than the above arises from confining the right of literary property merely to the statute and this is that in such case this right itself being conditional viz depending on the entry of the book or pamphlet in the hall book of the company of stationers an author who does not comply with this condition the statutory sine qua non of his copyright can have no pretensions to such right at all so that an author has in fact no copyright in an unentered manuscript which any person may therefore openly or surreptitiously copy publish for his own profit at pleasure macklin the player some time since obtained an injunction and on a hearing got damages of richardson the bookseller for printing and publishing part of the farce of love alamode which the latter employed gurney to take down at the theater in shorthand but since the late decision in the house of lords and the reference of copyright only to the statute i presume no such injunction in chancery can be granted in what a predieament then stand the authors of unpublished manuscripts particularly our english aristophanes mr foot several of whose performances are unpublished and it is necessary to the emoluments of his theater that they should remain so will it not be expedient for him and every other professor of unpublished manuscripts to enter them without delay in the hallbook of the company or will indeed such entry without the actual printing and publication of the work suffice i cannot help thinking that some difficulty attends she solution of these questions  it is for these reasons hoped that as the legislature will probably find it expedient to make some farther alteration in the laws relating to literary property some farther regulation respecting the security of it will be deemed consistent with it is wisdom more precisely to determine the limits of its appropriation so that both writers and booksellers may know how far they are authorized to abridge copy or make quotations from the works of their predecessors without which they cannot safely exercise their calling and all improvements in works of history philology and science must speedily have an end  the end
