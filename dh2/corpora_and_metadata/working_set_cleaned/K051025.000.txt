guy esquire sir though the subject of this treatise considered as a desideratum in the healingart should chance to have had no great share in your studies yet have you a right to a work of this kind superior to any such claim  i will not say had your benificent disposition never appeared in favor of the wretched incurable that i should never have entertained any thoughts on this subject but this i am obliged in justice to acknowledge that whilst i was committing them to paper your excellent design was so strongly before me that i found it absolutely impossible to write regardless of it upon which account it is but just that i make you a tender of what was thus written  i cannot indeed persuade my self however mean the performance may appear that it will prove an unacceptable present since it attempts a farther relief of those deplorable persons for whom you have already expressed so tender a regard  and if by due management any of these shall happily find a cure where it might be least expected in an hospital set apart for incurables it will not i presume redound more to the consolation of the patient than to the honor and delight of him who not only generously founded but liberally endowed it  i am with the highest esteem sir your most obedient servant peter shaw   a treatise of incurable diseases etc i of the proper means to reduce the number of incurables although several cogent reasons to demonstrate the feasibility of the present design may be drawn from the nature of distempers and the known effects of medicines the common occurrences of daily practice and the great probability there is of bringing many unknown remedies to light yet were it not for what so grave and approved an author as the great lordchancellor bacon has recorded about incurable diseases it would perhaps seem daring and presumptuous to maintain the possibility of lessening their number after so many ages appear to have been unsuccessfully spent in attempting it  for the cure of incurables does not only involve a paradox in the expression but in an age so productive of new discoveries and so fertile in improvements as the present it generally passes for a desperate problem and is apt to be ranked in the same class with the quadrature of the circle the perpetual motion and the philosophers stone  but the most celebrated and judicious author abovementioned is clear and express that physicians when they enquire into diseases find so many which they assert to be incurable either from their first appearance or after they have continued some time that the proscriptions of l scylla and the triumvrate were ing in comparison of the proscriptions of physicians by which with the most unjust sentence imaginable they deliver men over to death many of whom notwithstanding escape with less difficy than and those formerly under the roman proseriptions a treatise therefore is wanting upon the cures of repared incurable diseases to the nd that both physicians and others of eminence and resolution may be encouraged and excited to pursue this matter as far as the nature of it will permit since to denounce dises incurable is to establish neggence and carelessness as it were by a law at the same time that it eens ignorance from repoach in inquisitione illorum de morbis inveniunt morbos complures quos insanabiles decernunt alios jam inde a principio morborum alios post talem quampiam periodum ita ut l scyllae and triumvirorum proscriptiones res nihili fuerint prae medicorum proscriptionibus per quas tot homines iniquissimis edictis morti dedunt quorum tamen plurimi minore cum difficultate evadunt quam illi olim inter proscriptiones romanas neque igitur dubitabo continues this great author inter desiderata reponere opus aliquod de curationibus morborum qui habentur pro insanabilibus ut evocentur and excitentur medici aliique egregii and magnanimi qui huic operi quantum largitur natura rerum incumbant quando hoc ipsum istos morbos pronunciare insanabiles neglectum and incuriam veluti lege sanciat and ignorantiam ab infamia eximat de aug scient l iv cap ii p   0  after such a declaration from so great a man it will not i hope appear either assuming or ridiculous to attempt a discovery of the cures of such desperate or inveterate diseases as may chance unjustly to pass for incurable such a design at least ought not to be thought assuming if it be entered upon according to his lordships direction to the end that the more able physicians and persons of eminence and resolution may be encouraged and excited to a thorough pursuit of this matter which is the main view in publishing this treatise  and if an indulgence be granted to any thing that may seem to carry an air of presumption or assurance in such an undertaking i am persuaded there are few will think an attempt of this nature ridiculous or impracticable after so very grave and discerning an author has laid it down for just and reasonable  some there are however who will be apt to say granting many diseases were an hundred years ago unwarrantably called incurable and allowing the physicians of that time to have in this respect been no less unjust than rigid and severe yet after so many great improvements and useful discoveries made in medicine of late it is impossible the censures of the present physicians should be equally unjust or equally severe with those at the time when this great author wrote others will go still farther and cry can it be imagined when by a grand increase of learning a through reformation in philosophy a prodigious number of useful experiments and happy discoveries in mechanics anatomy chyrurgery chemistry pharmacy and botany a noble addition to the materia medica and the introduction of a mechanical system of physic can it be imagined will some say when by these large acquisitions the art of healing seems raised to its achme its pinnacle of perfection that the censures of physicians are not extremely just and utterly irreversible and the number of incurables already shrunk and contracted within the narrowest bounds human means can reduce them  indeed it may very well appear surprising if with these accumulated advantages the art of healing be not vastly improved and the number of reputed incurable diseases lessened and yet alas the thing it self will speak and tell us that incurables were never more common and that they are so far from diminishing that they rather seem to grow upon us daily insomuch that it is become necessary to provide for the meaner sort of them by a new and an extraordinary kind of bounty  besides as twere folly to endeavor to palliate the matter the common practice of every place will at this day afford a sufficient proof both of the great number of incurables and the rash censures of physicians for not to mention that we daily see persons who were given over by some physicians recovered by others what numbers after having been declared incurable by very eminent men and such as were well versed in physical practice have not found a cure by accident the kindness of nature the observation of a regimen the use of slight medicines a course of physic or by venturing upon some desperate means instances of all these are every where so numerous that it is in vain to go about to conceal the thing or its pernicious consequences most persons are now apprizd that incurable in physic has had a like effect with occult quality in philosophy a term which managed with address amused the multitude and kept up a veneration for an appearance of learning but at the same time proved a very great obstacle to farther improvement in useful knowledge  it is well known also that every age has had its particular kind of practice which was always adequate to the discoveries of the time and regulated by the prevailing philosophy of the place so that this practice in the infancy of the art must necessarily have been proportioned to an infant knowledge of diseases and remedies it is less to be wondered at therefore if the puny physicians of the earliest ages shifted the obstinate cases from one to another and were pleased to denounce all the diseases incurable which baffled their slender skill this procedure however we laugh at in them but are our selves perhaps no less ridiculous for we also turn off our desperate patients when our remedies fail us and term that an incurable disease which obstinately resists the fashionable practice of our age and country  but is a distemper therefore really incurable because i a second or a third person cannot cure it or can this term with any propriety be applied to a case which has only eluded the prevailing or current practice of our time without giving any evident tokens that it is absolutely and in every respect incurable if this be sufficient to denominate a disease incurable then numberless diseases which have been cured were incurable  doubtless this term ought to be used with great caution because when misapplied it not only abuses the patient but disgraces the profession and brings a scandal on its professors at the same time that it prevents an improvement of the art of healing but we of this age ought more than those of any precedent one to demur in the use of the word when the case is not very plain and evident we who are well acquainted with the structure of the human body and several grand remedies which were unknown to former ages we who are masters of all the experience of the ancients and have seen their weakness and errors as well as our own in calling some diseases incurable we who cannot but own posterity may improve in their knowledge of these things and be able to cure diseases reputed by us incurable as we have happily cured some that were so reputed by antiquity are not we also sensible that physicians generally go in the same beaten track and that though they differ in forms yet usually agree to exhibit the same medicines in like cases thus all now prescribe mercury in the venereal lues and cortex in intermittents and if these happen to fail the modish practice of our days is supposed to be exhausted and without farther trouble the case is adjudgd incurable but as this sentence is frequently reversed either by nature accident or art it is by no means of it self sufficient to denominate a person properly incurable that his case has been unsuccessfully prescribed to by a few physicians  how it comes to pass that incurables are so numerous at this time and that whilst other arts and sciences appear in a flourishing condition and even medicine it self is greatly improved in its theory yet the art of healing the practical part the most valuable branch of physic and ultimate end which all the other branches are destined to promote and center in should not be equally advanced is a speculation that would carry us beyond the bounds of the present design and as it is of far greater consequence to know how to remedy this defect in the art of healing and thereby diminish if possible the number of incurables than to account for the slow progress of the physical practice i shall here confine my self to the former consideration and endeavor to show what is the most proper method of proceeding in order to discover the cures of such distempers as obstinately resist the present form of practice at the same time that they give no other signs of their being absolutely and properly incurable  the method that i would offer at in this case is founded on a proper use of our natural faculties if we will but open our eyes allow a freedom of reasoning and not be slow in reducing its dictates to action there are good grounds to hope that the number of reputed incurables will soon be lessened or at least their increase be prevented and a more accurate distinction of diseases for the future be introduced  as by a reputed incurable disease i always mean such an one as proves too strong for ordinary treatment without affording any farther reason to persuade us that the cure of the same case is utterly impossible to be effected hereafter to attempt the cure of a reputed incurable disease is in no wise wild or romantic but the way to discover such a cure is not to stop short where the common medicines fail lazily term the case incurable and then sit down contented and applaud our selves for having got to the extent of our tether on the contrary if we would in carnest endeavor to benefit mankind by improving the art of healing from an accurate observation of the phenomenon of diseases we should proceed to deduce their immediate causes and find out what kind of remedies are wanting to remove them and then by the proper experiments obtain these desiderata or at least in defect of them contrive to raise the known remedies to their utmost power in order to see whether they will not then reach the more stubborn cases  it is such a kind of geometrical method which appears to me the most proper to be observed in this pursuit that way of reasoning from data to quaesita which has done wonders in philosophy astronomy and mechanics but it happens most unfortunately that instead of encouraging and pursuing this noble method in physic we seem almost entirely to discountenance and contemn it instead of endeavoring by this means to cultivate the most momentous art on earth we are too often amusing our selves with what is trifling when set in competition with it and instead of endeavoring to lessen the number of incurables or ease their tortures we are either wrapped up in the clouds and contemplating the stars or grovelling on the ground in quest of pebbles not that i would reflect on any part of knowledge though ever so little useful but surely those who have attached themselves to physic and make profession of its practice are inexcusable if this has no share in their studies some excursions out of this province are perhaps allowable but we should not methinks always content ourselves with searching after things which are utterly foreign to physic the theory of physic indeed no one can deny to be useful so far as it brings advantage to the practice but who does not see that it is preposterous to spend time in computing the absolute force of the muscles the weight of the air upon the lungs the just momentum of the fluids and a thousand other things whilst there remain so many inquiries of infinitely greater importance to be made and which might even discover the cure of such diseases as we now miscall incurable  is it not shocking to see what pains and application are bestowed in promoting other arts and sciences whilst physic alone is abandoned and seems to be almost the only art that is not cultivated among us thus in astronomy a glorious science indeed and though not unworthy of the esteem it meets with is yet infinitely less conducive to the wellbeing of mankind than the practice of physic what immense labor and assiduity are employed with what diligent attendance and watching is a new star added to the catalogue or another satellite to the train of a planet what drudgery is not gladly undergone to determine the magnitudes distances periods of revolution gravities and densities of the remote planetary and cometary world but if any professed physicians leaving their own art to the improvement of others shall give themselves up to the cultivation of this they may please to consider that such procedure will afford little consolation to a man under the raging torture of the gout or stone or to those doomed to languish under the hard sentence of incurable what will it avail such as these to be told the exact minute of an eclipse or other results of numerous observations and laborious calculations and yet these things which concern us so little are highly prized at the expense of medicine and the knowledge of them obtained with the most vigorous resolution and assiduous application how we can answer the not taking equal pains to discover new remedies improve the old ones and advance the art of healing when the lives of mankind are immediately concerned in it i am at a loss to know but to return  the method i would recommend to find the cures of reputed incurable diseases will be best understood by the specimen annexed where i aim to proceed entirely upon rational grounds i must therefore take leave to observe that the free use of our reason is the best guide we can make choice of to lead us to this discovery by the use of reason i would be understood to mean the exercise of that faculty upon subjects relating to diseases in order to find a desirable and promising method of cure for an inveterate case when the current practice has proved unsuccessful that is such a method as shall before it be tried appear likely to succeed when considered by a rational physician and is more eligible to the patient than the distemper it is intended to rid him of or at least to palliate such a method of cure as this is in my opinion unexceptionable in reputed incurable cases and ought without scruple to be put in practice by a reputed incurable patient because such a patient can have no hopes of a recovery but either from mere chance or empiricism or else from the trial of such a rational means as is here proposed but any rational person will surely rather rely on reason than chance for a cure moreover true reasoning from the requisite data brings us to absolute certainty and is always preferable to belief tradition casual experience or any other assistance relied on in physical practice a general and rational physician therefore who is never unprovided of data to reason from cannot do better than thus to apply this faculty and if the result of this application be the discovery of a desirable and promising method of cure he cannot do better in the way of his profession than to recommend it  this method of procedure will be readily acquiescd in by those who are unacquainted with the general fate of physic such persons are ant to imagine that this is the common foot upon which all rational physicians proceed in their daily practice and that no other tolerable method can be established but these persons are not aware how extremely cautious and sparing physicians have formerly been in the use of their reason that body of men have all along had so tender a regard to their fellow creatures that they thought their utmost care was necessary in the application of remedies and therefore rarely ventured to trust so dangerous a thing as reason in the use of em and so experience safe experience came to be wisely substituted in its stead this was the oracle this alone was extolled and reason fallacious reason was decryd and contemned as having little to do in the practice of physic hence they proceeded to settle rules and establish forms from experience choosing always to use the remedies which had been used before and to prescribe over again what they had already experienced to swerve from the established method or prevailing practice of the age was commonly thought bold and dangerous and to try a new remedy though it might promise ever so fair was looked upon as hazardous and presumptuous the practice of physic being thus curbed in and restrained has advanced by very slow paces and all this for want of a sound philosophy and a larger stock of data for certainly there can be no other pretense why this best of faculties should be thrown aside as useless or disadvantagious in physic rather than in philosophy or any of the arts and sciences but now as the case is otherwise as our data are more numerous and the way of reasoning from them is improved as our present system of philosophy is solid and extensive and the subject of physic the animal structure is vastly better defined and understood twould be highly absurd to pretend that this grand talent ought not to be applied to discover the cures of at least the reputed incurable diseases among us for in these cases our present stock of experience is confessedly of no service and new random trials might be justly deemed rash and presumptuous an attempt therefore to form a method of cure by arguing from the nature of the disease to the discovery of more powerful remedies is here the only rational and promising means we have left  it will surely be granted that the present practice of physic is improveable if it be considered that the several branches of which this art is composed are daily improving whilst new discoveries are made in anatomy and surgery grows more complete whilst chemistry and pharmacy furnish us with new preparations and mechanics is more successfully applied to the animal structure it cannot be doubted but some use may be made of these things to the advantage of physic and the cure of reputed incurable diseases there is no room to question that many powerful remedies lie now absconded or enveloped in their first principles if it be considered that the whole set we are at this time acquainted with were once in the same state of darkness and confusion let us but reflect that agues were reputed incurable till the cortex was found and its uses known as well as the lues venerea till mercury and the woods were applied and consider by what means not only these but numberless other useful medicines were obtained and then there will be very great encouragement to expect that if diligent search were made and the proper experiments instituted many grand remedies might be disclosed and such as would be of force sufficient to cure some diseases which now lie under the unjust sentence of incurable  nor is this the only reason we have to hope for such a redress in the art of healing and a considerable reduction of the present incurables great assistance may in this case be likewise obtained from a due management of the remedies we are already possessed of for there are so many requisites necessary to advance these to their highest power that it may very well be questioned if the utmost force they are capable of affording was ever exerted on the cause of any disease  chemistry has improved the efficacy of many medicaments and shown them to have such virtues as were utterly unknown before that art became general and fire is an element from which other as great matters may be justly expected besides this an inverted order a well proportioned dose a proper preparation of the body and medicine a right choice a select combination with many other things of the like kind have an immense power to increase the virtues of remedies here then is an almost inexhaustible fountain of useful varieties put into our hands which we can manage as we please and if they were properly employed it is not to be said what effects they might produce in obstinate or reputed incurable cases that this may the better be apprehended let it be considered by way of illustration that when the cortex has proved ineffectual for the cure of an ague being given before the body was rightly disposed it will succeed when exhibited after due preparation that opiates mixed with purgatives will take effect which administered single might fail that solids will purge when fluids will not that lenient purgatives will open the body where strong catharticks would loose their force that some medicines succeed when given in small quantities at long intervals which administered otherwise would have a contrary effect and in short that all possible combinations doses preparations etc have never yet been tried nor perhaps ever can be exhausted  from all which it appears that the cures of some reputed incurable diseases may be justly expected either from a discovery of new powerful remedies or a more apposite use of the old ones our method therefore ought to have regard to both these desiderata  in order to acquire new remedies let us suppose the true and immediate cause of a stubborn disorder to be found which in all bodily diseases is commonly material our method of proceeding directs us to obtain this material cause wherever it can be come at and to make the proper experiments upon that very matter out of the body which being included in it was the parent of the disorder an example or two will make all plain the cretacecus matter or chalky stones which are often thrown out in a fit of the gout appear to have been the immediate cause of that fit a proper quantity of these therefore being obtained and the nature of them discovered from the symptoms of the distemper etc we are hence directed to try any preparation that we know has a power to act upon and dissolve matter of the like kind but in case such a dissolvent be unknown to us then are we to contrive some compositions after the same manner as if we were prescribing to an inveterate case of a patient afflicted with the distemper and try their virtues upon these stones till at length we arrive at a preparation that proves a real dissolvent at the same time that it may be safely administered some convenient way in such a quantity as to be able to effect the like dissolution of that cretaceous matter whilst it is circulating in the fluids of the body such a composition it is reasonable to expect would prove a grand remedy and perhaps a specific that is such a medicine as will effect a cure without causing any sensible evacuation understand the like experiments to be made upon the stones which are apt to lodge in the bladder or kidneys till a proper dissolvent be found which if it cannot safely effect the desired dissolution in the body may at least be so managed as to prevent the future generation of a stone again supposing the case of an hydrophobia occasioned by the bite of a mad dog where we know the fluids are contaminated by an actual poison which being contagious by a communication of any of those fluids a way may very easily be contrived to obtain a quantity of the infected saliva or any other of the animal juices in order to make the proper experiments upon it till an antidote for the venom were by that means discovered this antidote might thus be known to be found supposing two equal portions of the contaminated fluid to be procured and the presumed antidote to be mixed in one of them let both be communicated by injection or otherwise to two sound dogs and if that wherein the presumed antidote was contained proves harmless and the other noxious and the same consequence attends the same experiment in two or three repetitions it would be reasonably to expect that the cure of this cruel disease was discovered and the medicine might therefore be tried occasionally upon hydrophobous patients or rather administered soon after the bite was received  how far this method of proceeding may be put in practice i will not presume to determine but it is very probable that it may be advantageously pursued at least in all those distempers which yield a grosser kind of matter for their cause or else depend upon a visible alteration in the consistence texture etc of the fluids this is certainly a most desirable and rational way of procuring specificks or grand remedies since the lives of mankind are not hereby in the least endangered and it otherwise remains that we wait for their discovery till mere chance shall place them before us open our eyes and force us by repeated importunities and solicitations at once to acknowledge their virtues and our own indolence if the whole tribe of reputed incurable diseases gave such fair opportunities as these for the discovery of their respective specificks and that most of them do not i would have no one be too positive we might soon see their number shrink upon allowing a proper patronage and encouragement to this kind of experiments  and here i cannot but take notice how apt we are to plume our selves upon living in an age when experimental philosophy flourishes experiments its true are daily made but i would fain know to what grand purposes they serve several indeed there are whose design is highly commendable but are there any now on foot or that can possibly be contrived of greater moment than the sort above mentioned any more beneficial to mankind or ornamental to a nation any so well deserving the encouragement of the wealthy and the countenance of the learned but instead of such useful essays as these we generally meet with attempts so mean and low so trivial and contemptible in comparison of them that one would be tempted to think they came from the ignorant vulgar and the herd of mankind rather than from the polite and philosophical part of the species it is a melancholy reflection that those persons from whose open profession surprising discoveries might be justly expected should generally amuse us with the minutiae of things put us off with the tith of mint and cummin and leave us to seek the weightier matters the advancement of physic and the reduction of incurables from another quarter  but what an improvement of the art of healing may we not expect what alleviation of the miseries of the incurable may we not hope for when a spacious building is now purposely crecting for their reception and use this seems not only a particular instance of compassionate bounty but a desire expressed for the improvement of physic and the universal benefit of mankind in an illustrious president of a solid and diffusive good physicians then we may reasonably presume will not now be so far wanting to themselves to their art and to human nature as to neglect this or the like favorable opportunities of raising the reputation of their profession by discovering the cures for the unjustly supposed incurable and lessening the torments of the miserable objects to whom such goodness is shown  no longer let us through ease and indolence give occasion to empiricks to triumph over us and boast themselves masters of specificks for the diseases which we inconsiderately pronounce incurable no longer let us suffer the people to be deluded with the specious arcana of ignorant men arcana the dear and desperate purchase of hazardous experiments and random trials on the human kind no longer let us leave to chance and the slow workings of nature the discovery and production of those useful remedies which we are furnished with faculties to search for and obtain who does not rather repose his confidence in reason and the due exercise of his own abilities than trust to accident the management of any affair and shall we in the art of healing alone put off our inquiries till chance shall deign to present us with the means of recovery when health is within our own reach we seem to want no preparative in this case but a resolution to step beyond the slowpaced practice in vogue and to be guided by our reason in the choice of experiments we are every way fitted to go immediately upon so useful an undertaking we have seen the effects of a tolerable number of trials made upon human blood and other animal fluids which when improved and enlarged may serve to very useful purposes we are furnished with a large stock of data and know how to increase it at discretion the causes of diseases are generally known and materials for experiments are every where at hand so that if the work were heartily set about there is no fear of success a set of axioms also might be laid down to encourage and direct the undertaking and serve as rules in the prosecution of it such as the following for example    mathematical certainty ought not to be expected in physic    a chronic disease allows many opportunities for the discovery and use of remedies    the success or failure of a single experiment is not sufficient to establish or abolish the use of a remedy    if any undesirable method of cure shall upon repeated trials either prove entirely unsuccessful or suffer more to die than recover it ought not to be acquiescd in before at least other more desirable and promising methods shall have been tried    it is better to try any desirable and promising method of cure than run the hazard of languishing out a life in pain and misery    if any disease can be transmuted into another attended with less danger and less pain every such transmutation is a degree of cure    a remedy that acts immediately upon the seat of a disease is more likely to effect a cure than one that acts only consequentially upon it    no more causes of a disease need be inquired after than will fairly and naturally account for its phenomenon    in every inveterate and dangerous disease the most powerful remedies ought to be immediately applied   0 no remedy can rationally be directed before it be known what life is together with its cause state and effects and what a disease is together with its cause state and effects  these may suffice for a specimen of what rules might be given to forward the discovery of the cures of reputed incurable diseases  but let this business proceed as it may and that the success will be proportionable to the application cannot be denied we certainly have it already in our power by the use of known remedies to make several whether real or reputed incurables pass their lives with more ease and satisfaction than they would enjoy without them nay by well adapted regimen and remedies it is possible not only to palliate but to change a stubborn distemper so that it may justly pass for a degree of cure or really become a partial one but when a case is peremptorily adjudgd absolutely incurable the patient is usually dispirited and with difficulty brought to follow those rules which would produce this effect for which reason the sentence of incurable be the case what it will should never be passed with rigor  there is another thing still behind and i am glad to find it insisted upon by no less a person than that ornament to our nation the great lord bacon whom i have already had occasion to mention not only because i know it is necessary for the author of any doctrine which carries the air of novelty to produce his voucher but because the thing it self seems somewhat contrary to the general practice of physicians and the sense of some people it is concerning the proper means to render death easy or less irksom when its approach can no longer be put off or delayed by the use of remedies concerning which our great author expresses himself in this manner i am clearly of opinion that it is the duty of a physician to mitigate the pain and torture of a disease as well as to restore heath and this not only when such a mitigation tends to a recovery as it is the removal of a dangerous symptom but also when there being no farther hopes of a recovery it can only serve to make the passage out of life more calm and easy for that complacency in death which augustus so much desired s no small happiness  but it is a point of conscience with the physicians or our days to sit by the sick after they have given them over when in my opinion if they would do an office of humanity in their own profession they ought to be gaining skill in their art whilst they endeavored to make the dying person depart with more ease and tranquillity etiam plane censeo ad officum medici pertinere non tantum ut sanitatem restituat verum etiam ut dolores and cruciatus morborum mitiget neque id ipsum solummodo cum illa mitigatio doloris veluti symptomatis periculosi ad convalescentiam faciat and conducat imo vero cum abjecta prorsus omni sanitatis spe excessum tantum praebeat e vita magis lenem and placidum siquidem non parva est felicitatis pars quam sibi tantopere precari solebat augustus caesar illa euthanasia  at nostris temporibus medicis quasi religio est aegrotis postquam deplorati sint assidere ubi si officio suo atque adeo humanitati ipsi desse nolint and artem ediscere and diligentiam praestare deberent qua animam agentes facilius and mitius e vita demigrent hanc autem partem inquisitionem de euthanasia exteriori  inter desiderata reponimus de aug scient l iv c   p     and accordingly his lordship sets down as a desideratum a method to cause a composure in dying and does not appear to disapprove even of that course which epicurus took to obtain this end which was by intoxicating himself   hinc stygias ebrius hausit aquas but though the physicians of our time are acquainted with better ways than this to cause such a composure yet i dont know how it happens that few are careful to put them in practice unless it be for fear of bringing death the sooner upon the patient instead of rendering the passage out of life more easy for i believe there are not many who apprehend such a procedure to be unnatural and who would choose to feel that pain and torture which some weak minds may fancy nature intended they should and so be willing to dye by the regular workings of providence rather than be thrown out of the ordinary way by human art it is therefore methinks a proper enquiry by what means this composure in death may be obtained and whether it could not be effected by a remedy which should rather promote than prevent a recovery and since there may be frequent occasions for such an assistant since it would be inhuman to deny it when requested and since the art in it self is doubtless very desirable and highly beneficial it is pity that any opportunity of improving it should be neglected  an attempt to settle a just notion of incurable in physic no proper meaning being generally conveyed by the word incurable it is necessary to appropriate one to so important a term  that the bad tendency of a distemper from its first existence to its latest continuance in the body cannot in the least be prevented or that after a stated period the cure of a case can by human means be advanced no farther is what this term in propriety of speech should constantly signify  but a loose and abusive sense of the word has so universally obtained and is so apt on several occasions to be run into that twill be difficult to make it always carry this more restrained and correct signification nor is it an easy matter in some cases to obtain such a distinct and positive idea as ought to be raised by this sound when we talk of diseases in a philosophical manner which perhaps is one reason why so many distempers commonly pass under this denomination and that when a certain form of remedies has for a determined space of time been used without the desired effect the case is merely upon this account pronounced incurable but it is apparent that there may happen a wide difference between a real and such a reputed incurable distemper since to constitute the former it is necessary that it will utterly elude the force of what the most perfect physicians can rationally prescribe for its cure when to make the latter it is enough that it has eluded the prescriptions of one or two practitioners to confirm a disease really incurable the utmost powers of remedies must prove ineffectual to cause it to pass for incurable that it has baffled the fashionable practice will suffice some reason drawn from the nature of the thing is requisite to show a case to be absolutely incurable to denominate a patient so a groundless conjecture will serve  it is likewise evident that reputed incurable may chance at the same time to prove real incurable diseases so that to introduce a more accurate distinction and to show the true difference betwixt them is of great importance  it is not necessary however in an essay which rather proposes what ought to be done before we make so free with a term upon whose use the lives and health of mankind depend than undertakes to do it it is not necessary i say in such an essay as this to descend so far as to inquire what life and health are what their causes and effects wherein they consist by what various means and how far they may be impaired or diminished before death necessarily ensues all which it would be absolutely requisite to know in the respective distempers if we were willing to see whether any and which of the catalogue of diseases are in their own nature absolutely and in every stage properly incurable or if we would fix the point in other cases to which when diseases arrive they will never admit of farther alleviation these things are here supposed to be in great measure known already although they highly deserve the most exact and careful inquiry  but not to let this weighty matter pass entirely unregarded it should be observed that if a distemper be absolutely incurable the reason why it is so must arise either from the nature of the disorder or the natural imperfection of medicine and consequently where the properties and immediate cause of a disease are well known and yet from them no reason can be deduced to manifest the case incurable that it passes for such ought to be attributed to the natural imperfection of the art of healing but the art of healing cannot be said to be naturally imperfect till its utmost extent be known that is till the animal economy and the immediate causes of its disorders are thoroughly understood and the utmost powers of the known remedies have been fully obtained if not also till all the discoverable ones have after the best manner been experienced now if all these advantages have not been acquired in our days as no considerate person will say they have it follows that no distemper can properly by us be called incurable but where some evident cause of its being so appears from the nature of the thing it self for unless this cause be manifest to pretend a disease is not to be alleviated in any of its stages or that a cure can be carried no farther when we dont know why is a bold guess and to pronounce the case incurable even after we have done our utmost will mean no more than that the remedies hitherto used in it have failed of the defird effect but would not such a censure be equally ridiculous as to say ten or an hundred unsuccessful experiments have been made to transmute metals and therefore their transmutation is undiscoverable here then is a foundation for a just distinction between real and reputed incurable diseases  thus we see in surgery those wounds are properly adjudgd mortal or incurable which happen in such parts of the body whose union was of absolute necessity to the continuance of life as for example a transverse section of the larynx which entirely stops respiration a disunion of the cerebellum which prevents the influx of the fluid there secreted into the heart etc these and the like cases are justly deemed incurable from the very instant when the wounds were first inflicted because here the vital functions are evidently destroyed without any opportunity being allowed for the use of remedies this is the most determined and genuine sense of the word and therefore the use of it in other cases ought to be judged of by its approach to or recess from this original meaning and accordingly where the fatality of wounds is less sudden and less certain as in obstructions of the animal faculties suppose by a transverse section of the oesophagus the term incurable cannot with equal certainty be applied at the instant the wound was received because there may be other ways contrived of conveying nutriment to the body besides by the mouth and in the mean time opportunities may be afforded of applying the proper remedies but if the body could be supplied with nutriment only by the mouth and there were no opportunities allowed for the use of means for recovery then such a case might with equal certainty be pronounced incurable or mortal as one of the former kind though the prediction would not be so soon fulfilled in all such cases as these it is evident when and why the term incurable is applicable which is always governed by the nature of the thing and the opportunities there are for the use of remedies or else by the natural imperfection of the art of surgery whereas on the contrary in several diseases both acute and chronic this term is applied where no such reasons appear thus when certain equivocal symptoms come on in acute distempers without having any regard to the immediate or material cause of the disorders of the animal economy they consist in without so much as any positive idea in our minds obtained from reflecting on the nature of the distemper and without considering the state of the art of healing we at present make no scruple to adjudge them mortal or incurable though neither the vital natural or animal faculties are wanting thus for instance we proceed in the plague malignant fever goaldistemper and the confluent species of the smallpox etc when perhaps if the matter were carefully examined into such diseases ought never to be called incurable till they arrive at the very point of death but if there be any reason to suspend this final judgment in acute cases is there not vastly more to be cautious how we pass such a censure in chronic diseases where no opportunities are wanting to make the necessary inquiries to find out the cause and to apply the proper remedies and what reason can possibly be assigned that the respective specificks for the gout and stone shall never be discovered or that no means can be contrived to alleviate the pain of those diseases farther than is effected by the present practice who can pretend that an antidote for the bite of a mad dog is undiscoverable when he considers we are masters of the specific for that of the viper but to call these and several other diseases incurable is the way to make them so as being apt to put a stop to farther inquiries into the nature of them and retard the discovery of any thing that has a relation to their cure at least then let no one pretend to call any case incurable till he is well acquainted with the subject of diseases till he knows their true and immediate cause and the utmost virtues of the several remedies we are at present possessed of  an animated human body we are certain is a pure mechanical structure wholly composed of solids and fluids and consequently the immediate cause of every bodily disease can be only matter and motion  the utmost virtues of remedies cannot be known till the remedies have been most artificially prepared and combined most seasonably and properly applied exhibited in the most just quantity at the most proper intervals and lastly continued in exact proportion to the demand of the distemper all which requisites there is little reason to believe have been hitherto strictly observed in their exhibition and besides the improvement which may be made in the present set of remedies it is not to be doubted as was before observed that many others of equal virtue may be discovered by proper application upon all which accounts it were greatly to be wished that physicians would never apply the term incurable to any cases but such alone where that matter and motion are wanting which life even in its lowest and weakest state requires or when all means by which they used to be supplied are entirely cut off for if a distemper be curable only in part it is improperly called incurable till that partial cure can by human means be carried no farther  we daily observe so many unexpected and surprising turns in the disorders of a human body nature here acts by so many secret springs and makes so many unforeseen sallies and excursions as if she took delight to mock our toil baffle our best concerted measures and reverse our best formed judgments that it is presumptuous where the case is not manifest to pretend to fix and determine the point she shall just come up to and not exceed to say hitherto shall thou come and no farther here the disease is incurable and here the art of healing fails no one less than an absolute master of this art will surely ever go so far if indeed we could always obtain from an exact observation of the properties of diseases their true and immediate causes and had a previous knowledge of the utmost effects the best adapted regimen and remedies would have upon them then we might presume to determine what cases either were or were not incurable by the present known remedies and no one without this qualification can pass a valid judgment let us then endeavor to increase our knowledge of distempers and remedies by all possible means and not venture to pronounce the sentence of incurable upon diseases at least till we have acquired such a definition of them as will bring us acquainted with their real causes and till we are masters of the best way of managing and improving the remedies we enjoy  to discover whether a reputed incurable be also a real incurable distemper i apprehend the best course to be taken is first to set down the several properties of every case distinctly next to draw as many consequences from these properties as may give light into the nature of the case and assist in discovering its immediate cause and when this is obtained we are naturally directed to search for the remedy so that at length by this method of proceeding we shall see how far our present stock of remedies will reach after they have been duly improved and what we are farther directed to seek for to advance the art of healing to a greater perfection to usher in this method i will here set down a few short examples by way of specimen of what may be expected from it upon a proper application the cases i shall choose to instance in are reputed incurable either from their first appearance to their ultimate stage or after a set time the sequel will show whether they really deserve the appellation of incurable or ought to be rescued and set free from the tyrannical imposition of a misemployd term  a specimen of a rational method to discover the cures of reputed incurable diseases of madness   there are two species of this distemper viz melancholia and mania    the properties of the melancholia are to proceed from some disorder in the mind    to be preceded by anxiety want of sleep intense thought frequent anger or any violent passion profuse venery pain in the head suppression of the natural evacuations burning and lasting fevers violent exercise long continued hot and dry weather    to manifest it self by fear and sadness and the color of the skin which grows pale yellow brown livid by spots of the same color a slow pulse hard respiration secretion and excretion lessened loss of appetite loss of flesh love of solitude lasting passions fixedness on some thought a pressure coarctation or repletion about the viscera or hypochondria    when it is of long continuance it causes the apoplexy epilepsy mania convulsions etc    it is sometimes naturally cured by a cuticular eruption large vatices great swelling and consequent flux of the haemorrhoids and an excretion black bile by the mouth or anus    the properties of the mania are generally the same but differ in a few particulars for instance    boldness and anger here attend instead of fear and sadness in the former    immense muscular strength   0 very great watchfulness     a surprising endurance of cold and hunger     most dreadful and outrageous ideas     all secretions in a manner stopped     anatomy shows in both species that the brain and its meninges are dry hard and crisp its cortex yellow and that its vessels abound in varices and are distended with a black viscid gore     the mania after an obstinate resistance of the common practice has been cured by spontaneous varices or haemorrhoids by a dropsy dysentery a tertian or quartan ague and large haemorrhages     does it not follow that the immediate cause of both species is an evaporation of the more subtle parts of the fluids          0           that the mania differs from the hypochondria only in degree             since they both have the same causes and exhibit the same appearance upon dissection     that this disease unjustly passes for incurable      even although a year or two may have been unsuccessfully spent in attempting its cure     and lastly that the specific wanting in both species is such a remedy as will prevent this evaporation    which remains to be discovered by proper experiments   0 in the mean time perhaps no known remedy will more forcibly contract the pores and prevent this evaporation than the cold bath when used so as to exert its proper force     now the cold bath can only act upon the body by its gravity or pressure the insinuation of the parts whereof it is composed and its coldness but its gravity or pressure will be proportionably increased by a deeper immersion and this will consequently render the insinuation of the water proportionably greater its coldness also may be immensely increased by the addition of sal ammoniac etc here therefore is a remedy of an unlimited force which seems to be exceedingly well adapted to the cure of this disease and accordingly it is found in fact to answer the best of any known remedy in this distemper though made use of under very great disadvantages  of the rabies canina or hydrophobia consequent upon the bite of a maddog the properties of this disease are as follow    it is spontaneous in many animals especially in dogs foxes and wolves which communicate it not only to one another but to men by contagion    the slightest bite of an animal thus infected is often fatal as it is also to touch their saliva with the tongue or to handle such instruments much as have been used about them    the contagion in a human body manifests itself at various intervals in various subjects in some it will lurk for several years    the place where the bite happened first becomes painful the pain spreads to the adjacent parts a weariness and heaviness is felt in the flesh the sleep is broken discomposed frightful and attended with convulsions the patient is uneasy when awake he sighs is sad and seeks solitude these symptoms gradually increase and a difficulty of respiration comes on which is now frequently interrupted with sighs an unusual dread and terror upon beholding any liquid loss of appetite to taste any liquor causes very great anxiety tremors and convulsions vomiting of a viscid bilious or green matter heat fever watching priapismus strange disorderly ideas the tongue is dry and extended out of the mouth there is a hoarseness and very great drought the patient at length now becomes outrageous upon attempting to drink he endeavors to bite whoever he meets with he foams at the mouth and gnashes with his teeth a cold sweat comes on he grows most outragiously mad and with the utmost difficulty of respiration dies convulsive    from dissection it appears that the organs of deglutition are inflamed that a viscid bilious matter is lodged in the stomach that the gallbladeer is full of black bile that the pericardium is dry that the lungs are greatly overcharged with blood that the arteries are full of a very liquid blood but the veins empty it is remarkable that this blood will scarce coagulate when extravasated and exposed to the air all the muscles viscera brain and spinal marrow appear too dry    is not therefore the immediate cause of this disease a subtle poison in the fluids whose specific antidote is unknown to us    and till this antidote can be found is it not clear that all manner of evacuations especially phlebotomy or rather arteriotomy are to be used in every stage of the disease and all other measures to be pursued which tend to introduce new fluids in the room of the contaminated set or at least to discharge so much of the virus as to lessen its pernicious consequences    the effects of this virus in the body being so very dreadful and fatal may justify the use even of severe and hazardous means to prevent em so that at least phlebotomy ad animi deliquium usque may be occasionally repeated not only upon that account but also by reason of the very great inflammation that attends it and because fear is known to have been serviceable in this case may it not be very proper to contrive some extraordinary ways to raise this passion to a very great degree if not before immersion in the cold bath at least by means thereof being used in almost its utmost force  of the palsy   there are three species of this disease   where motion alone is wanting   where sensation alone is wanting   where both motion and sensation are wanting    it is often preceded by the apoplexy epilepsy or convulsions a retention of the natural evacuations a translation of the matter of an acute or chronic disease wounds contusions luxations compressions erosions etc intense cold or heat too free an use of hot water exhalations of poisonous minerals admitted into the body    the paralytic parts grow cold soft flaccid and waste gradually    it is often critically cured or by the force of nature either by a spontaneous and lasting diarrhaea a fever an insensible dissipation of the morbific cause or lastly by a convulsive motion of the part    from hence it follows that the immediate cause of the palsy is a want of the influx of the blood or nervous fluid or both into the part          that the parts lose their natural elasticity        that when both the nervous and arterial fluid is wanting to the part and the canals are deprived of their natural elasticity the case is most inveterate    that its cause may be either external or internal      that the want of the nervous and arterial fluid is either owing to a fault in their respective canals or to the fluids themselves     0 that it may be cured either by a specific or an evacuant   and consequently is not justly reputed incurable     that the cure depends upon removing the obstruction to the influx of the fluids and deriving them in their natural state into their respective canals     that the cure must be adapted to the cause     supposing then both canals and fluids to be affected the canals to have become cold and flaccid and the fluids gross and tenacious it is plain that a powerful dissolvent which at the same time that it liquifies and purifies the blood promotes a free circulation in the disordered parts and restores the elasticity to the canals will prove a specific in this case and why the cortex peruvianus when raised to its utmost or proportionable power may not prove this specific perhaps nothing but the proper experiments will show     the very great effects of a due use of the cortex not only in intermitting fevers but in many other disorders both of the solids and fluids are too well known to stand in need of a particular enumeration and this medicament is now so universally allowed to be safe as well as efficacious when properly applied that i know of no objection that can lie against the use of it in the palsy those who think it not of force sufficient in such an obstinate distemper as this when after some months have to no purpose been spent upon it it is reputed incurable will please to consider its surprising effects on the solids and fluids in a rebellious quartan ague in what very large doses it is capable of being exhibited and how much a prudent mixture of sal absinth etc will add to its virtue especially if so grand a remedy as the cold bath when duly improved may be called in to its assistance as in the distemper we are speaking of it frequently may  of the lues venerea   when this disease is hereditary or become universal it appears under various forms but may be distinguished by these properties  it generally begins with an itching heat and inflammation in some part of the body whitish pustules appear which drying scale off and leave a cavity or else break grow deep afford a yellow mucus or corrosive sanies and form ulcers incurable by common medicines these afterward increase in number both externally and internally the inguinal glands swell collect matter break of themselves and discharge shankers verrucae porri mariscae condylomata caruncles strangury erosion of the urethra and parts adjacent stiffness in the joints and pain of the limbs erosion of the cartilages the bones grow carious and rise in stubborn apostems corrupting the adjacent parts the viscera mortify and the flesh corrupts    this distemper is found to be communicated by lactation sweat saliva and exhalation    from hence it is cause is a corrosive taint admitted into the body which gradually assimilates the fluids to it self corrupts the solids and becomes contagious by a communication of the fluids    the specific wanting here is therefore such an one as will destroy the force of this corrosive or put a stop to the contagion in the animal fluids which there is an opportunity of discovering by the proper experiments    in the mean time if we expect this specific virtue from any known medicament it is necessary it should be used as a specific that is by suffering it to be detained in the body as long as possible to let it have it is utmost effects upon the solids and fluids and who can say that mercury thus properly managed will not have such a specific virtue  this is a matter of no small moment and certainly deserves to be well examined for if this reasoning will hold good it follows that much pain and fatigue very great danger and loathsomness the necessary attendants of a salivation are often undergone to no purpose or else to a bad one whilst such a hazardous method frequently failing to cure the disease occasions it afterward to pass for incurable in which case this specific use of mercury may bid very fair for a cure  there is but one objection that i know of can be made against this way of turning mercury into a specific for the cure of the lues venerea viz that the venereal taint or virus being plentifully evacuated by salivation as appears from the quantity and stench of the saliva a contrary way of proceeding will have a contrary effect and consequently detain and lock up the virus in the body  that some portion of the venereal taint is evacuated with the saliva in a salivation cannot be denied any more than that some is likewise evacuated with the urine and other excretions since in both cases the virus will evidently manifest it self by propagating the contagion   but that it is more plentifully evacuated by the salivary glands in the former case than it would be by the renal in the latter were proper diuretics exhibited may be justly questioned if the stench of the saliva be no proof of it but it is well known that the saliva evacuated in the salivation of a person who is entirely free from any venereal taint is equally fetid with that of a venereal patient  again successive salivations have been oftentimes regularly raised and prudently carried on so as to cause a very plentiful excretion of fetid saliva but notwithstanding this the lues has been left uncured from whence it should appear that the cure does not depend upon an evacuation of ferid saliva nor will this perhaps admit of a doubt if it be remembered that many on the contrary have been cured of the lues by mercury who could never be brought to salivate at all and that others whom upon account of some disease of the breast or the like it has not been thought prudent to venture under so dangerous a flux by the mouth have happily recovered by this specific use of the same  and agreeable to this doctrine is that practice of the best physicians who even after the most profuse flux by the mouth either exhibit proper doses of mercury during the space of several weeks after the salivation is dropped without any design to bring it on again or else put the patient into a course of specific dietdrink as well knowing that unless somewhat of this kind be done the patient is not secure but runs the hazard of a relapse  it is evident that mercury exhibited so as to purge or salivate cannot exert its full force upon the body because by those very excretions it is soon thrown out as appears in that it may be revived from the excrements and reinstated in possession of its former properties if therefore we would obtain the utmost effects of this grand medicament ought it not by a prudent management to be detained in a large quantity as long as possible in the body this method alone methinks can determine whether mercury will prove a true specific for the lues venerea  moreover such an use of mercury is not only directed by the nature of the disease but by the similar effects of other remedies the lues venerea is a very stubborn and obstinate distemper and where it once seises is with great difficulty removed it seems strongly to adhere to the body or rather it entangles it self so as to become one with it as appears particularly by its lasting effects after a partial cure for mercury as it is generally exhibited only palliates but seldom eradicates this disease as is well known to the more curious observers ought not then the remedy also to be entangled and united with the body in order to exert its full force and be upon equal terms with its adversary thus we see every day when the cortex exhibited in an intermittent is evacuated by stool it is of no effect toward curing the disease though administered in a very large quantity but stop this evacuation let the medicine remain in the body circulate with the fluids and exert it is full force it becomes a very different and vastly more powerful remedy than before and justly deserves to be called a specific  of the gout   the chief properties of the gout are to return generally in the spring and autumn   seldom to affect any but men of a gross and corpulent habit   to succeed high living hard study violent exercise the free use of acids and taking cold on the feet    a fit is usually preceeded by crudity or rawness felt in the stomach heaviness costiveness a stoppage of sweat in the feet and by varices    when regular it seizes the internal parts of the foot its periosteum nerves membranes ligaments and tendons about the joints and when irregular that is when it moves about or disperses it self it always falls on the like membranous and nervous parts    a fit comes on with a tensive burning gnawing pain which increases gradually to it is height then decreases as the part grows moist red and tumid    the pain goes off in a diaphoresis leaving an itching behind it    it scales the part or bursting the vessels throws off a solid cretaceous matter    it is more violent as the swelling is less and vice versa    the more severe the fit the greater the interval of its return and vice versa    does it not follow that the immediate cause of the gout both in its knotty and smooth species is a cretaceous matter lodged in some nervous and membranous part for a fit never ceases till this matter is thrown off in the former species and to suppose a like expulsion in the latter though made in a less sensible manner fairly and naturally accounts for the other phenomenon which are the same in both it should follow therefore that these two cases differ only as the cause happens to be more or less perspirable        0 does not the cause of this disease lurk in the body in the absence of a fit     if the gout be ever properly hereditary this is still more evident     it appears that this cause is deposited upon various parts by the fluids   for the solids never exchange places and consequently the fluids alone in the absence of a fit are the seat or vehicle of this cause     this cause upon many occasions   is apt to stagnate or be deposited in the smallest canals and such as are most remote from the brain and heart where the circulation is languid and the parts are naturally pressed contracted and less yielding       this matter is corrosive        as the vessels are more stiff and rigid    and the matter more corrosive and tenacious      the disease will be more severe     both the solids and fluids being concerned in the fit the cure ought at that time to regard them both but in the absence of a fit the cure need only regard the alteration of the fluids        the cure then in the absence of a fit is to be effected either by a proper dissolvent of a cretaceous matter in the fluids or by proper evacuation     till the specific can be found for this case perhaps evacuations might be contrived to carry off the semina of the disease during that large interval   which is usually interposed between two fits and by that means a new set of fluids be procured and a proper regimen and remedies used to prevent the future generation of this cause for if the cause of the disease in the absence of the fit exits in the fluids    and be equally dispersed in them as there appears reason from the supposed present state of health to believe it is certain that an evacuation of blood at a large orifice would lessen the quantity of this cause in the body and could not phlebotomy be so managed as to detract as much of it as would otherwise be thrown out by the ensuing fit and if so would not this prevent a fit as effectually as the having undergone one in the absence of the fit the body is sound and the effects of moderate phlebotomy on a sound body we know are to lessen the quantity of the blood and rarify the remaining part to take off from the resistance of the fluids allow a more free contraction of the canals and a recovery of their elasticity to dissolve coagulations to open obstructions and promote a free circulation and lastly to forward both secretions and excretions and to allow of a renovation of the fluids or mass of blood now there are none of these effects taken separately or conjointly but seem of themselves to have a direct tendency to forward the cure provided the first digestion can be well secured and crudities in the others prevented which greatly depending upon a prudent choice of the subject and a proper management during the use of the remedy no greater objections will perhaps lie against this method where a person is willing to pursue it than are to be produced against other approved and established forms of procedure in other diseases  phlebotomy after the manner proposed has never that i know of been tried by way of prevention or cure of the gout though in the rheumatism an acknowledged similar case it frequently has with very good success and is one of the best known methods of cure for that distemper and the same operation when performed in the common manner or used as an assistant in the cure of the gout has sometimes been found of service but as this case has seldom been prescribed to by physicians of judgment it being always looked upon as incurable or such a disease as was rendered worse by the use of physic it has fallen almost entirely to the management of empiricks from whose practice i will not in a case of so great nicety venture to draw a conclusion  as these few examples are proposed by way of specimen it must be observed that it did not suit with the nature of the design to enumerate all the properties and phonomena of every disease under its respective title though there may perhaps be commonly enough from whence to deduce their immediate cause and a suitable method of cure nor are all the possible advantages taken of what properties are set down upon account of the designed brevity of this discourse it ought not therefore to be attributed to neglect that under madness no notice was taken of what service a prudent exhibition of the cortex sal absinth etc might be during the use of the particular remedy there recommended nor any mention made of the proper ways of endeavoring to reduce the mind to its natural state nor again how advantageous deep incisions frequent scarifications strong attractives actual cauteries powerful digestives sharp corrosives proper lotions etc in the bite of a maddog how useful strong stimulating remedies in the palsy or what better methods than the common there are of treating the inveterate or confirmed lues venerea nor lastly of what service a course of relaxatives perspiratives sudorificks corroboratives stomachicks or a salivation in the gout or the most proper method of treating that disease during the fit though the properties mentioned will lead to it  much less could it be expected that the diet regimen and medicines requisite or useful in each process should be there insisted on which would be to have swelled a volume upon each distemper  thus then have i done what i at first propsd which was only to offer at some probable means to improve the physical practice with regard to inveterate cases or such as are undeservedly styled incurable in hopes at the same time to wipe off some part of that reproach which has fallen on the art of healing through a remissness to cultivate so necessary and beneficial a part of it i am sensible how little i have contributed to so great a work yet if this imperfect sketch may happen to give occasion to a due prosecution of the design i shall not repent that i ventured to communicate so slender a performance to the public  finis
