a remarkable case of a numerous birth with observations  by maxwell garthshore mdfrs and as fellow of the royal college of physicians of edinburgh  from the philosophical transactions  a remarkable case etc read at the royal society june         to sir joseph banks bart prs sir st martinslane may         the following very extraordinary case communicated to me by dr blane f r s i take the liberty at his desire to transmit to you with his letter to me containing the proofs of its authenticity hoping that it will appear to you as it did to us worthy of being read at one of the meetings of the royal society as a fact in natural history which is equally uncommon curious and well vouched in order however to make its singularity more apparent i have taken the liberty to subjoin some observations on births of this kind with such well authenticated accounts of similar events as i have been able to procure confining myself chiefly to those which have happened in our own country where we are least likely to be deceived  i have the honor to be etc maxwell garthshore   p s as one proof of its singularity i many months ago employed various friends at petersburg berlin vienna lions paris and ghent to collect for me well authenticated cases of this kind and i have not as yet been able to procure any  copy of a letter from dr blane physician to his majestys navy and to st thomass hospital f r s to dr garthshore physician to the british lyingin hospital  dear sir sackvillestreet june         a few days ago i received from the country an account of a woman who was delivered of five children at a birth in april last as your extensive experience and reading in this line of practice enable you to judge how far this fact is rare or interesting i submit it to you whether it deserves to be communicated to the royal society mr hull the gentleman who sent me the case is a very sensible and ingenious practitioner of physic at blackburn in lancashire he attended the labor himself from beginning to end and his character for fidelity and accuracy is well known to me as he was formerly a pupil at the hospital to which i am physician so that no fact can be better authenticated he mentions also that he has preserved all those five children in spirits and if desired he will send them for the inspection of the society they were accordingly sent and having been exhibited to the society when this paper was read are now deposited in the museum of mr john hunter   i am with great regard etc gilbert blane   margaret waddington aged twentyone a poor woman of the township of lower darwin near blackburn in lancashire formerly delivered of one child at the full term of pregnancy conceived a second time about the beginning of december      and from that period became affected with the usual symptoms that attend breeding at the end of the first month she became lame complained of considerable pains in her loins and the enlargement of her body was so remarkably rapid that she was then judged by her neighbors to be almost half gone with child at the end of the second month she found herself somewhat larger and her breeding complaints continued to increase when the third month was completed she thought herself fully as large as she had formerly been in her ninth month and to her former symptoms of nausea vomiting lameness and pain of the loins she had now added a distressing shortness of breath she continued to increase so rapidly in size that she thought she could perceive herself growing larger every day and she was under the frequent necessity of widening her clothes when she reckoned herself eighteen weeks gone she first perceived somewhat indistinctly the motion of a child by the  0th of april      all her complaints were become much more distressing she had much tension and pain over all the abdomen her vomiting was incessant and she now could not make water but with the utmost difficulty the symptoms being palliated by mr lancaster she advanced in her pregnancy to monday the   th of april when being supposed to have arrived at the twentieth week she was seized with labor pains these continued gradually to increase till the next day about two in the afternoon at which time i was sent for mr lancaster being absent and she was soon delivered of a small dead but not putrid female child the pains continuing this was soon followed by a second less child to this very soon succeeded a third larger than the first which was alive to these a fourth soon followed somewhat larger than the first and very putrid last of all there soon succeeded a fifth child larger than any of the former and born alive these five children were all females two were born alive and the whole operation was performed in the space of fifty minutes the first made its appearance at two in the afternoon and the last at ten minutes before three each child presented naturally was preceded by a separate burst of water and was delivered by the natural pains only in a short time after the birth of the last the placenta was expelled by nature without any haemorrhage was uncommonly large and in some places beginning to be putrid it consisted of one uniform continued cake and was not divided into distinct placentulae the lobulated appearance being nearly equal all over each funis was contained in a separate cell within which each child had been lodged and it was easy to perceive by the state of the funis and that part of the placenta to which it adhered in which sac the dead and in which the living children had been contained i examined the septa of the cells very carefully but could not divide them as usual into distinct laminae nor determine which was chorion or which amnios i could not prevail on the good women to allow me to carry it home to be more narrowly inspected and i submitted more readily to their prejudice for its being burned as its very soft texture seemed to me to render it hardly capable to bear injection the two living children having survived their birth but a short time i was allowed to carry them home and i have preserved the whole five in spirits and have since weighed and measured them and find their proportions to be as follows in avoirdupois weight inches and parts  oz dr inches the  st born dead      length   the  d  putrid       the  d  alive        the  th  putrid        the  th  alive       the mother in spite of the crowds with which her chamber was continually filled continued to recover and was able to be out of bed on the   th and   th her third and fourth days but finding herself then weak by my advice kept her bed till the   th of may when she went out of doors and on the   st walked to blackburn two miles distant this was the   th day from her delivery she having entirely recovered her strength without any accident it may not be improper to add that the husband of this woman has been in an infirm state of health for three years past and is now laboring under a confirmed phthisis  i am etc signed john hull blackburn lancashire june         observations on numerous births though the females of the human species produce most commonly but one child at a birth and though their formation with only two breasts and one nipple to each renders it probable they were not originally intended to produce in general more than two yet from what we know of the womb and its appendages and what from the latest experiments we are led to conjecture as to the mode of conception we cannot presume a priori to set limits to the fertility of nature nor determine decisively what number of foetuses may be conceived and nourished to a certain period in the human uterus at the same time  the present singular and wellattested case assures us that five have certainly been born at once and we have no title absolutely to reject all the testimonies of even more numerous births or to say that in some rare instances this number has never been exceeded  what has tended to render relations of this sort ridiculous and to throw a degree of discredit on the whole is the many mavelous and evidently absurd and incredible histories which not only the retailers of prodigies but even the credulous writers of medical observations have collected  i need only refer those who wish to amuse themselves with surprising relations of this kind to the curious collections of schenkius schurigiue ambrose parey and others  but in order to show how very uncommon births of this kind are and how truly singular the case communicated by mr hull to dr blane is i take the liberty to subjoin a short view of the usual course of nature in this matter among our own countrywomen where we are least likely to be deceived  though female fertility certainly varies according to the climate situation and manner of life yet i believe it may be taken for a general rule that where people live in the most simple and natural state if they are the best nourished and if they enjoy the firmest health and strength they will there be the most fertile in healthy children but we have no data to determine that they will there have the greatest number at one birth  at the british lyingin hospital where we have had    00 delivered the proportion of twins born has been only one in    births in the westminster dispensary of      women delivered the proportion of twins has been once in  0 births but in the dublin lyingin hospital where above   000 have been delivered they have had twins born once every sixtysecond time the average of which is once in    births nearly in these kingdoms  the calculations made in germany from great numbers in various situations state twins as happening in a varied proportion from once every sixtyfifth to once every seventieth time  but in a more accurate and later calculation made at paris by m tenon surgeon to the salpetriere we learn that in  0     births the proportion of twins was only one in    which is only a small degree less than we have calculated at the british lyingin hospital  it would be easy to add other calculations all differing from these and from one another more or less but i hope these are sufficient to show that nature observes no certain rule in this matter and that even twins the most usual variation is not a very common occurrence  when we advance to triplets or three born at once we find comparatively very few instances in this or any other country and though every one has heard of such events as now and then happening yet very few have seen them  in all those    00 women delivered at the british lyingin hospital there has not been one such case in the london lyingin hospital where being instituted later much fewer have been delivered they have had two such recorded as prodigies in the westminster dispensary in      women delivered there has been but one such event  in the dublin hospital in   000 births they have had triplets born thrice or once in  000 times but have never exceeded that proportion or number born at one time  in a pretty extensive practice of above thirty years both in the county of rutland and in london i have attended but one labor where three children were born am personally acquainted but with one lady who at dumfries in scotland after bearing twins twice was delivered of three children at once and i was never acquainted with any one who produced a greater number  yet so much does this matter vary at edinburgh that dr hamilton professor of midwifry writes he had seen triplets born there five or six times in less than twentyfive years  mauriceau in a long life of very extensive practice at paris with opportunities of knowing most things extraordinary that happened in his time in france tells us he had seen triplets born but a few times had heard of four in that city but once and mentions no greater number  one circumstance which he relates is so far worthy of attention as it accords with one somewhat similar subjoined to mr hulls case now read viz that the husband of one of those women who bore three children was by trade a painter and had been for two years preceding this birth paralytic over onehalf of his body and yet had no reason to doubt the fidelity of his wife  these facts as far as they are to be depended on may show us that the capacity of procreation in the male may remain under very infirm health and that we ought to judge with candor of such wives as are fruitful when living with very ailing husbands and who produce healthy children in the eighth or even ninth month after their death as we can never say determinately under what degree of disease the male is totally incapable of procreation more especially as we are very certain that the female is not when laboring under very desperate and certainly fatal diseases provided the principal organs of generation be sound nay in cases of pulmonary phthisis the life of the female seems to be protracted by pregnancy and i have attended a lady who after being pronounced irrecoverably hectic lived long enough to be twice delivered naturally of healthy children at the full time  but what particular circumstances of constitution or state of health can capacitate the male to become the father of more than one child at a birth or how this could be effected should it be wished remains among those secrets of nature which our want of facts and observations renders us utterly incapable to speculate upon  it seems probable and these two observations as well as spallanzanis and other late experiments would rather incline us to suppose that these numerous births do depend most on the structure and state of the female organs but nothing that i know of has ever been discovered in this obscure matter  the occurrence of four born at once we find to be much more uncommon and i think hallers conjecture rather than calculation of its happening once in  0000 births very much underrated as it appears that once in  00000 would be much nearer the truth of this however we have several well authenticated cases which have happened in this island in the year      there was published in london a quarto pamphlet entitled the fruitful wonder or a strange relation from kingston upon thames of a woman who on thursday and friday the fifth and sixth days of this instant march       was delivered of four children at one birth viz three sons and one daughter all born alive lusty children and perfect in every part which lived twentyfour hours and then died all much about the same time with several other examples of numerous births from credible historians with the physical and astrological reasons for the same by j p student in physic  dr plott in his history of staffordshire p     mentions eleanor the wife of henry diven of watlington who was delivered of four children at a birth in the year       sir robert sibbald in his scotia illustrata after mentioning a case of three born at once adds imo in variis regni locis repertae sunt mulieres quae quatuor foetus uno partu ediderunt but makes no mention of more  in the gentlemans magazine which is reckoned a pretty authentic record of the times we have the following accounts of numerous births  ann boynton of hensbridge in somersetshire was this day june        delivered of three daughters and one son one of the daughters died the rest are likely to live the mother has been married but four years and has had twice twins before which completes the number of eight children at three births  october        at rate in berkshire joan galloway was delivered of two boys and two girls three of whom were alive  in january      the wife of plumer a laboring man at millwimley near hitchin hertfordshire was delivered of three living boys and one dead  august         the wife of williams of coventrystreet piccadilly was delivered of two boys and two girls all likely to live  june      a woman in the parish of tillicultrie near stirling in scotland was delivered of four children which were all immediately baptized and all died at the same time next morning  in september      a poor woman of burton ferry glamorganshire was delivered of three boys and a girl  dr hamilton before mentioned writes that not many years ago a woman was delivered of our children at pennycuick the seat of sir john clark bart near edinburgh when she was advanced to the middle of her last month of pregnancy and that some of these children lived two or three years he further says that five years ago he attended a woman at edinburgh who in the seventh month of her pregnancy after a journey of thirty miles was suddenly delivered of four children all perfect and well grown for the time of which one was born dead and three alive but those three died next day he further adds that these are the only cases of quadruplets or any larger number he had ever heard of as born in scotland in his memory  though cases similar to the present of five children born at once are still much more uncommon and though hallers assertion of their not happening above once in a million of births may be reckoned a very moderate calculation yet we are not altogether without such instances in this country  from the gentlemans magazine we learn that on the  th of october      a woman at a milkcellar in the strand was delivered of three boys and two girls at one birth and that in march      at wells in somersetshire a woman was delivered of four sons and a daughter all alive all christened and all then seeming likely to live  in the commercium literarium norimbergense for the year      we have two such cases one happening in upper saxony the other near prague in bohemia in each of which five children were born and christened all of whom were arrived to that equal degree of maturity which rendered it probable they were all conceived about the same time  i learned from two foreign professors when in london last winter that they had each heard of a case of five children born near paris and near ghent in flanders but the particulars not being sent as promised i presume they may have been misinformed  when we advance farther we get into the region of tradition and improbability and it would ill become me to trouble a society whose professed object is truth and science with the numerous and wonderful relations which many grave and learned authors have recorded as facts they themselves believed yet i still think we have no authority to reject absolutely every relation of this kind when ambrose parey a very honest though credulous man tells that in his time in the parish of sceaux near chambellay between sarte and maine the mother of the then living lord of the noble house of maldemeure had in the first year of her marriage brought forth twins in the second triplets in the third four in the fourth five and in the fifth year six children at one birth of which labor she died and when he adds that of these last six one is yet alive and is now lord of maldemeure how can we disbelieve this circumstance this story may very possibly be inaccurately stated yet the whole cannot be a fiction as it was published among the very people and in the age when it happened and never has been since contradicted so far as we know though the wonderful regularity of the progress gives an appearance of fable to the whole yet we must believe the thing to be possible and that this then existing lord might be the only one of the six who lived long enough to be born at the full time in a mature state the whole or most of the other five as we have sometimes seen in cases of twins having been born as dead abortions which had never arrived to a bulk sufficient to interfere with his growth  i leave the learned to pay what degree of credit they please to the wonderful relations we read of the extreme fertility of the women of egypt arabia and other warm countries as recorded by aristotle by pliny and by albucasis where three four five and six children are said to have been frequently born at once and the greatest part of these reared to maturity and will only say that though a late traveller m savary gives ample testimony of the extreme general fertility of egypt in all vegetable and animal productions and particularly of its abundant population he mentions nothing of the numerous births recorded by the ancient naturalists and historians  of still more fruitful births i will pass over a number of instances which i could adduce from johannes rhodius lucas schroeckius caspar bauhin johannes helvigius bianchi and others and finish with one case more recorded by petrus borelli in his second century of observations published at paris in the year      a collection indeed filled with many wonderful stories though by a man of equal integrity and ingenuity he tells us that in the year    0 just five years before the lady of the then present lord darre produced at one birth eight perfect children which he owns was a very unusual event in that country  i think it totally unnecessary to pursue this enquiry farther but must observe that the present is the only case i have found where the children were all females that the males have in all the other cases been at least equal and generally the most numerous that in many of them at least a part was dead born and that most commonly the rest died in a short time it is thence clear that those numerous births are certainly unfavourable to population as very few indeed of those children can be carried to near the full term of pregnancy and fewer still to that degree of strength that admits of their being reared where more than two are born at one time  as from mr john hunters very curious experiments and observations read lately to this society on the procreation of swine we are led to believe that a certain determined number of ova capable of receiving male impregnation are originally formed in each ovarium and which number when exhausted the female constitution has no power to renew if this be the true account of the economy of nature in this particular which has every appearance of probability those numerous births must occasion a very fruitless profusion and waste of the human race and become every way detrimental to its increase  from the united testimony of the foregoing cases it is undeniably clear that the females of the human species though most commonly uniparous are in certain circumstances to us unknown every now and then capable of very far exceeding their usual number and i must again repeat that it does not appear that we can set any bounds to the powers of nature in that respect or pretend as some have done with certainty to say what may be the utmost limits of human fertility  appendix the following case which made some noise in this city and was published in all the news paper last june as a real instance of five children produced at one birth happened too late to find a place in my paper and not being communicated to the society could not be inserted in the transactions however as it was attended with with some very uncommon circumstances it appears to be a very proper appendix to those copies i have had thrown off to gratify the curiosity of my friends from this recent instance which happened under our own eyes as it were we may be taught with what caution we ought to receive all mavelous reports which the world in general are ever disposed to believe and propagate the relation i subjoin i wrote down thursday june         from the mouth of mrs salter the midwife a lodger in the same house with the patient who then lay dead at no  0 little ayliffestreet goodmansfields and was testified by the husband and sister who were both present and certified by mr gilson of whitechapel to be the same account that was given him by all the people who were in the house along with this woman  elizabeth wellborn of liverpool was married in september      to  ferber of strasburgh a mariner being then in her twentyeighth year she was very soon seized with all the common symptoms of beginning pregnancy only in a more severe degree than most women are she in a short time became remarkably large and by degrees so heavy and unwieldy though a stout and healthy woman before as with difficulty to be able to support the burden of her pregnancy and under much uneasiness and bad health she dragged on a very distressing life till she had completed nine months and four days from her marriage on thursday the  th of june she was seized with symptoms of approaching labor which the midwife called fever continued in that state all the next day and on the saturday morning the labor was thought to have made some progress and the head of a child to be presenting in the natural way this toward the evening receded and the breech of what she imagined to be another child presented itself which after three hours was delivered by the natural pains at nine oclock at night on saturday the  th of june      and proved to be a small living girl seemingly at the full time no placenta followed and she continued tolerably easy till monday evening the   th when she again fell into labor and was delivered about twelve at night fiftytwo hours after the birth of the first by the natural pains of a second living girl larger than the former and a double placenta soon followed she continued uneasy all that night and on tuesday the   th at eleven oclock in the morning eleven hours after the last labor she was delivered of what the midwife called a false conception which she describes as a large mass of solid flesh covered with a thick skin and meafuring near ten inches in circumference but in which when it was cut through the middle and examined she could not find the smallest vestige of a foetus on wednesday the   th at three oclock in the afternoon she was delivered by natural pains of a putrid female child six inches in length and on thursday the   th at seven oclock in the morning just sixteen hours after the birth of the third child she was delivered of a fourth child of nearly the same size with the third a double placenta which seemed to have belonged to these two last children soon followed in a putrid state the birth of these four children was soon succeeded by all the common symptoms of the most dangerous species of puerperal fever mr gilson of whitechapel was then called in and found her in the most desperate situation but before mr gilson came both the placenta and the false conception were destroyed so that we are at a loss to determine whether this last was only a mere coagulum of blood condensed into this form by slow extravasation and the length of time in which it had undergone the compressing action of the uterus or whether it was the increased secundines of a real fifth conception where the foetus had died so early as to be totally dissolved and so mixed with the coagulated mass as not to be discovered by a midwife who cannot be supposed to be able to determine precisely what the nature of this substance was but it has been repeatedly ascertained that all molas or what are vulgarly called false conceptions are either the one or the other  this poor woman gradually grew worse and on the saturday the   th she was seized with convulsions and on sunday the   th of june in the evening at half past ten she died being the fourth day after the delivery of the fourth child and the eleventh after that of the first  the two firstborn children seem healthy and promising are put to a suckling nurse and are of the common size of small twins the eldest weighed in her clothes four pounds and one quarter and the younger scarcely four pounds both together barely the weight of a common full grown mature foetus  i add the following quotations from reputable authors without pretending to say whether any degree of credit ought to be given to them or not  chambon de montaux malady de grossessa tom ii p     quotes a letter published in the journal de savans from m seignette physician at rochelle to m lemery in which he mentions a woman of saintonge who was at one birth delivered of nine wellformed children so far advanced that their sexes could be easily discovered and j b bianchi de naturali in humano corpore vitiosa morbosaque generatione historia aug tauri      p      an author of established reputation for candor and accuracy tells us that in his time in the city of turin three children at one birth had happened more than once that in some of the districts of piedmont there had been sometimes five and that in the duchy of milan a very little time preceding the year      when he published seven had been born at one time and he adds the following very extraordinary history which he supposed to be well authenticated as he received it from m p r david a very respectable clergyman and dean of the chapel of the academy of turin that fourteen years before this m david had met and conversed with a woman whose history he had frequently before heard who assured him that she herself had at one very painful and distressing labor produced in a short space of time seven living and healthy children of different sexes and that one of these children then a boy of eleven or twelve years of age was present with his mother when she told him the story  of fruitful females we have the following history in the harlem courant for      a man was presented to the empress of russia remarkable for being the father of seventytwo children born to him by two wives the first had four children at a birth four times she next produced three at a birth seven times and afterward twins ten times in all amounting to fiftyseven children by one wife the second after bearing three single children had twins six times amounting to fifteen and the two together to seventytwo  the daughter of gerard vanderguicht engraver to sir hans sloane confirmed lately to dr comb a fact he had often heard in his own family that her mother who is now alive and in her eightysixth year had during her marriage with the said vanderguicht borne thirtytwo children at one and thirty births the last being twins and that they all lived to be christened  mr kirwan a very respectable philosopher and fellow of the royal society has often told me that he had conversed with a gentleman who affirmed to him that he himself was the youngest but one of forty sons all produced in succession from three different wives by one father in ireland and who all arrived at the age of manhood and mr kirwan often declared he had no reason to doubt the truth of this relation  as it is more than probable that a number of facts similar to these may have taken place in situations where no public notice has been taken of them the present communication may perhaps stimulate some to make known to the royal society any remarkable and well authenticated phenomenon of this kind which either have already happened or may in future
