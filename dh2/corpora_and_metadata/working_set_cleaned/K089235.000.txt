the life of john wilkes esquire  price one shilling and sixpence  the life of john wilkes esquire in the manner of plutarch being a specimen of a larger work  the second edition revised and corrected  london printed for j wilkie at no    in st pauls churchyard  mdcclxxiii  the life of john wilkes esquire most ages have produced some shining models of undaunted virtue and unabating patriotism  it is the part of the biographer to select characters from the mass of mankind and to hold those only up to view who have been most distinguished on the vast theater of human life were men to be promiscuously described little advantage would be derived from reviewing the annals of past or present times and the eye after a glance would turn away with weariness as from an unbounded plain or a mirror where all objects were presented indiscriminately  but if others have labored under the disadvantage of describing characters equally mixed with right and wrong the author here has little reason to complain of such blended materials  he gives one bold enterprizing and the same ever possessing uniform principles without deviation and without ambiguity  a man says plutarch to be completely great must be born in some famous city  london boasts the birth of mr wilkes  his mother it is reported was delivered without pain or labor and a spectre appeared to the nurse which foretold that the child she then suckled should prove the ornament and support of the british empire circumstances which to many would have appeared trifling and enthusiastic had not his future conduct evinced the truth of the prediction  of his family nothing is reported but in extremes for whilst some would have him to be the son of a distiller and bred up to the cask others trace him up to a most illustrious origin but when some of his friends judged that he should change his name before he engaged in state affairs he prettily enough replied that he would make the name of wilkes more glorious than that of a catiline or a cade and when having served the high and important office of sheriff of london and the citizens were desirous of making an oblation of silver plate to him so far from renouncing his origin that he desired his figure with a dagger in his hand to destroy a monarch should be engraved on the side of a large drinking cup  now he being as plato says a scholar ought to be disposed to all manner of learning and neglectful of no arts cultivated besides his other studies an early taste for poetry and with such wonderful success that in in this poem entitled the essay on woman it has been thought that the author of the divine legation has been spoken of too freely but mr voltaire who is certainly as good a christian as mr wilkes has lately treated the bishop in much the same manner one production at least in point of sentiment he is supposed to have equalled if not excelled both a rochester and an the author here means only to refer to a poem commonly imputed to aristotle which from its superiority is entitled his masterpiece aristotle in progress of time he applied himself to more important studies and became not only a most excellent and yet some one was base enough to apply the following character to him  thersites only clamoured in the throng loquacious loud and turbulent of tongue awed by no shame by no respect controlled in scandal busy in reproaches bold but chief he gloried with licentious style to lash the great and monarchs to revile his figure such as might his soul proclaim one eye was blinking  spleen to mankind his envious heart possessed for much he hated all but most the best popes iliad orator but likewise took in subscriptions for publishing the introduction is published the history of his own country an amazing work this when one considers all his other occupations that he was at that time under innumerable difficulties nay was absolutely engaged to furnish out twoandthirty paragraphs a day in each newspaper besides letters advertisements epigrams and intelligence extraordinary  but the nevertobeforgotten work was the north briton or rather the no    all numbers that have proved fortunate to this country from that time have always terminated in fortyfive and it is very remarkable that the number nine which consists of a four and a five should emphatically be styled the curse of scotland of that celebrated paper written by the late reverend mr churchill and containing many spirited attacks against government which not being well received a process was preferred against the author mr wilkes being never likely to have a more fair or honorable introduction to glory generously declared the paper to be his own  defied all government and has been admired and rewarded for it in short in all his writings whether he arraigned the opinions of others or established any doctrines of his own there were always found both the harmony of order and the decency of religion  his reasons were solid and convincing his inductions pleasing and agreeable he was master of every subject of which he treated and treated none but what were amply for the benefit of mankind  but mr wilkes at that time had not the pleasure of mr bulls acquaintance fearing some creditors and having suffered in a duel he traveled into france with many other great men for the recovery of his health and fortune there he lived in ease and affluence supplied with money from the disinterested in england as well as with large sums arising from the sale of jewels and other articles which his skill and address procured him abroad  his body daily gaining strength he was soon most earnestly solicited to return to england where he again furbished up his rhetoric and reexcited all his political faculties for some time he wished to have retired to his estate at aylesbury but thinking it wrong to give the trouble of long journies to those who made suit to him he gave up his estate there to be divided amongst his friends and then resided altogether in town for the convenience of public business and indeed there were not fewer attending at his door than formerly on croesus for his wealth or pompey for his power  and now being full of expectation and solely bent on the welfare of the public he consulted an oracle how he should soonest arrive at the summit of all political glory  the pythian replied  that he must renounce his constituents at aylesbury and make the opinion of the londoners the rule and guide of his life  the decrees of fate are irresistible  indeed he would have submitted to have represented the city of london but his friends most prudently prevented him and compelled him to blaze out at once as the member for middlesex amidst the united acclamations of a grateful kingdom twelve men from a spirit of patriotism drew mr wilkes through the city and as appeared from one of his agents books agreed only for the small sum of twelve pound twelve as a gratuity for their services   from this happy event every englishman might justly have expected to have dated the era of his felicity  a legislator representing what is called the first county burning with a religious zeal to execute his important charge and fully qualified to regulate with an eye of intuition every the minutest deviation from the just equilibre of church and state but such alas is the fate of all human things that the people were no sooner put in possession of their greatest blessing than they were deprived of it  the parliament spoke sparingly of his merits and as he had been imprisoned for treason and blasphemy were willing to vindicate one bad action by committing another  they asserted that as no felon was eligible into any important office a man so like a felon that he could not be distinguished ought certainly to be expelled but let me remind these gentlemen that the contrary was justified by many of the most experienced lawyers at that time and has since been well explained by the though mr wilkes neither takes his seat in parliament nor resides at the mansion house he had undoubtedly a majority of voices for both majority of the city of london who are now fully convinced that felony though punishable in a private man is by no means a disqualification for a lord mayor  the head say the best logicians is no member  he was now not only deprived of his legal seat but shut up from daylight within the melancholy confines of a gloomy prison  but these hardships he could well have borne himself but his humanity was alarmed for the welfare of others  all honest freeholders as lord chatham beautifully expressed it were most dreadfully aggrieved from the banks of the tweed to the landsend in cornwall they slept not in their beds from horrid dreams and midnight apprehensions but it was not in dreams alas they had in vain implored the just assistance of a relentless monarch  tender and pathetic as this lamentation was there yet was found a peer hardy enough to say that the county in which he lived as well as five or six more adjoining had not only not petitioned but he believed felt no grievances and he was sorry the noble lord would not allow him one honest freeholder in his neighborhood  this appeared to many but as illtimed raillery and so far from invalidating the truth of the great orators assertion that it only afforded a melancholy proof of lord sandwichs apostasy  i will not dwell on the many dreadful consequences attending mr wilkess expulsion  the reader the generous reader feels the weight of them too forcibly and i see him with tears in his eyes lamenting that luckless hour when virtue was stripped of its ornament honesty of its robe and a fatal an everlasting blow was given to the very vitals of the constitution  the ministerial hirelings now daily echoed reproaches against him  they insinuated that he had defrauded the foundling hospital and burnt mr sylvas notes  the latter was the only circumstance that seemed to endanger his credit in the city  it was a bad precedent and they feared it might prove dangerous to trade  weak minds cannot always weigh the comparative merits of actions  bad measures must frequently be applied to good ends and private honesty is ofttimes absolutely incompatible with public patriotism  by many it was called at least an act of inattention  but would it not have been deemed as the height of absurdity that a cicero or a maecenas should have stopped to have regulated a grocers bill when the welfare of millions depended on their public counsels  pericles one of the most admired heroes of antiquity when his accounts were confused and could not well be given up not only destroyed the notes if i may so express it but to drown the remembrance involved his country in the peloponnesian war  but i will place the matter in its true light  the notes were given to a jew  he was importunate  mr wilkes was obliged to turn him out of his house in his own defense for is not a jew bound whenever it is in his power to destroy that man who is known to be a strenuous assertor of the laws of christianity  as to the foundling hospital mr wilkes considered it as a base institution from the beginning  it encouraged bastardy  however he submitted the whole transaction to the tailor white treasurer whose private virtues might be said to go hand in hand with his own and from whose representation of the case the city seemed so well satisfied of their equal integrity that they gave an entire credit to the one and by choosing the other alderman not only made him the guardian of public trust but of course governor to almost all other hospitals  the honor of being alderman likewise entitled him to the high and important office of sheriff which afforded him many favorable opportunities of displaying his humanity  he felt most tenderly for those who partook of one common nature with himself and in his zeal for liberty not only ordered their chains to be struck off during their trials but insisted on their removal from newgate to be more immediately under his own inspection that he might occasionally instruct them in their several duties and let them out at proper times to practice their different occupations in order to discharge the jailors fees  nor was this glorious plan of liberty confined to one set of men only  all ranks all orders in some degree felt the weight of his influence  the messengers and officers who before had used to take up any man whom the parliament deemed highly criminal now tremble least the lord mayor should order them to be imprisoned and their criminal released and the magistrate who before looked formidable on the bench and intimidated the prisoner beneath him now shrinks back from a commitment least the patriots being displeased his house should be burnt down or his family destroyed  nay should the clergy presume to restrain the people with the shackles of religion or my lord chief justice himself to bend their necks beneath the galling load of power mr wilkes has explained that all authority is tyranny and dr wilson and mr horn that religion is imposture  nor is this the system of a day only but the education of our youth is calculated to inculcate these generous principles  the poor apprentice who before had used to read his bible in the evening or play at cribbage with his mistress now leaves the house and discourses like a lacedaemonian vid life of lycurgus not on the price of pepper but passes his judgment on some action worth considering  openly ridicules the religion of his country at the robinhood or regulates the measures of government in a more private assembly  not even the military could repress mr wilkess ardour  at his instigation those splendid hirelings were restrained from carrying arms through the city  their very drum was silenced and they were taught that though they were kept at a vast expense to parade in hydepark and now and then to be reviewed yet they were to be considered as the ornament not as the security of the state and it was unconstitutional for them to interfere though the life of their sovereign was attacked in his palace  nor were those learned gentlemen of the long robe more secure in their dignities  mr wilkes could explain to a middlesex jury that the king had no right to the land tax  that his power and that of the parliament was not equal to that of a petty constables and it was illegal for him in any instance to extend his mercy when the people clamoured for blood  nay when the late judge yates presumed only in passing sentence on mr wilkes to glance at his poem by speaking of the reverence due to christianity  the people such was the patriots popularity laughed him openly to scorn though mr wilkes himself with great politeness and candor said that now and then it was not amiss to hear a musty sermon  he might even be said to be out of the power of medicine for on the parliament desiring a physician to inspect him whilst in danger from a duel he dismissed hebberden for being illiterate and ordered no one to interfere unless they would send nurse grenv  e herself to administer a glister  by extending the liberty of the press all public and private characters are now fully delineated  from this great prerogative the birthright of all englishmen we are enabled to speak truth with impunity  to say that vid junius and others a  mansfield has no integrity a grafton no abilities and that the duke of bedford rejoiced at the death of his only son  that the person of our sovereign is ungracious  his manners depraved his private character immoral and his public one unjust  that he is the worst orator that ever spoke to a parliament  a parent unconcerned in the welfare of his family  has no care for the state but like nero fiddles whilst rome is burning  the fine arts live not but in a state of liberty but now they flourished in all their branches  music was united with poetry and mr wilkes their apollo struck the master lyre  his poetry was a mixed species of the lyric and didactic but managed with such amazing skill that it was echoed not only from the tower to tyburn but balladed about through every fair and market town in the kingdom  but as tacitus observes homines plus oculis quam auribus credunt longum iter per praecepta per exempla breve et efficax tacitus men sooner believe their eyes than their ears so he gave great encouragement likewise to all artists to line their shops with prints emblems sketches and aenigmatic characters  such as should not merely show the delicacy of their art but convey either a fable moral or history and he had the pleasing satisfaction to find that a fox hanging a load of straw or a suspended boot had more effect not only on the multitude but even on the city of london than all the accumulated labors of a university library  it was mr wilkess peculiar happiness to be always connected with characters similar to his own as they say the magnet attracts only those fragments that are of kindred qualities but now and then these fragments were at enmity amongst themselves  when altercations arose about the disposal of places or the distribution of public money they harrangued so freely on their comparative merits that though i have no doubt but they all spoke truth of one another yet i think it was sometimes rather impolitic so fully to unveil to the common eye the deeper mysteries of patriotic duty  every period of history affords some striking instances of the triumphs of virtue over power  a cromwell at one time and a tyler at another have been equally the idols of the many  the very children of one henry ii prince not only revolted against but destroyed their father  from mr wilkes then who is a glorious compound of all these illustrious characters what may not be expected for unhappily for this nation it is governed by a king who holds principles diametrically opposite he has been justly reviled by his people and the voice of the people isthe voice of god  finis
