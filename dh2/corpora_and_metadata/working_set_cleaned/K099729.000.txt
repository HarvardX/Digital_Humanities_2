pastorals after the simple manner of theocritus  by mr pvrney   theoc london printed for j brown at the black swan without temple bar and r burleigh in amencorner      price one shilling  advertisement concerning the language mr dryden much admires shakespeares tempest in that comedy new personages are introduced for whom he thinks the poet has invented a language equally uncommon true it is that such is the recept of a critic in no small repute be  language says quinctilian always suited to the matter true it also is that see dion halicarn who admires him on that account homer used the most rustic words drawn from the beotians virgil from ennius in his heroicks rendered his language uncommon milton shakespeare spencer and our contemporary pastoral writers by reviving the antiquated english terms by choosing and culling the finest words of our glorious ancestors in the steps of these our swain has ventured to tread and where the phrase in use was not suited to the softness and simplicity of his characters as he is acquainted with the dialect of most counties in england has from thence drawn the tenderest expressions as he thought and best adapted to the simplicity of his sentiments induced i suppose to take these liberties in pastoral by what that excellent judge of poetry mr addison has laid down on that poem how beautiful says he is the old pastoral ballad beginning thus see guardians n        0 and  0 rager go vetch tha or cows kee or else tha zun will quite be go be vore chave half a don and into language how much finer than the authors has he turned a thought of virgil and what that hight which girds the welkin sheen where twelve gay signs in meet array are seen this great man adds that by imitating the rusticity of the dorick by the help of the old obsolete roman language virgil might have attained as much of the air of theocritus as phillips has that of spencer by using the antiquated english  fewer oldwords indeed has our present writer admitted than are found either in spencer or the incomparable pastorals of mr phillips but in return has often made use of those once introduced as his characters are particularly simple and tender much also has he imitated spencers manner of changing the vulgar dress as twere of his words yet leaving the main body so as to be known homers manner of performing this aristotle shows in the    chap of his poesy he used for   and for   etc virgil did it by changing illi into olli and the like milton by altering hermit into eremite enterprise into emprize etc and spencer by affixing y and a before and en et ie after his words which gives an inexpressible softness to without hiding the language  this liberty every good heroic writer has taken and well knew spencer that pastoral still more required it he has given us in his fairyqueen a new language the reason must be because his scene lies in a new place but how much more has he done it in his pastorals  among other places in the preface to her homer dacier and many frenchmen complain of the penury and stiffness of their language through the want of this and mr addison observes that the ancient romans did the like yet must i confess that even among the pastoral writers no one but theocritus spencer and our present british swains durst ever venture themselves in this pastoral path being afraid and unwilling to forgo that honor which either a refined language or a sublime one procures but then must we add that from thence it is that no critic but who dares not stir a step without leadingstrings as scaliger rapin etc has ever allowed any else to be pastoral writers  but is any one dissatisfied with our rural style read he a full vindication of one much more so such he will find before folio edition spencers pastorals and by his friend mr harvey for who knows not that his language was equally uncommon in his day and in ours our tongue receiving no visible alteration in one hundred years this appears from ben johnson hooker our common prayer book etc  the reader will observe i here only bring some few authorities the reason that i my self decline laying down any thing concerning the true pastoral language is because we shall see i believe a discourse in a short time on the nature of this kind of poetry where that tender in the language which is agreeable to pastoral will be considered and distinguished from the tender which is suitable to the epick and that which the tragic poem requires  conclude we then with what the learned basil kennet says in his life of theocritus after speaking of his rustic style as for our selves says he the scotchsongs which pass with so much applause show that it is not impossible to revive this old conduct among us with success  postscript as for the moral and actions in each of the following pastorals for action is the only unity to be kept in that poem they lie obvious to every eye but as the pastoral does not paint the characters so lively as the tragic or epick poem those of our shepherdesses are specified in the arguments and this for the ease of the softsex whose favor and approbation our young swain seems particularly desirous of  argument cubbin the writer so called was acquainted with paplet and soflin all young was paplet and ignorant of love soflin more experienced but equally tender and innocent the first eager to be let into the nature and manner of lovers and the other sex the other of a temper particularly free and inclining these as cubbin was informed were at evening gone out to a bush of a sweet and pleasant situation to tattle of love and of collikin soflins lover in pain is cubbin least the gentle paplet should fall in love with him too and goes forth to skulk near the bush to hear if it indeed was so there does the latter part of their discourse which alone he hears confirm the hearsay when the gloom of night draws on they go to bath and cool em in eden brook there is paplet solitary and musing and thence ignorant of her ail returns alone by moonshine to the bush for there collikin that morn had lolld with his love cubbin soon discovers her uneasiness forsakes hit covert to attempt her relief but endeavoring to divert her thoughts from collikin is chid from her sight so being averse to her cure she falls entirely in love  the time in this piece is from noon

so staid till he wept and when he wept did go unhappy soflin now there loves with thee the sweetest mey that ever sun did see all he had seen or heard in head kept he to cut on crook or mark upon his tree for sure there is not who can envy that not one i ween can envy lasses chat but why so fond of lasses chat say you oh had you seen em you would have been so too ye gentle youths who rove where led by chance if be on paplets grief your eye should glance think the poor lass mishap enough has had ah dont you add by hating what she said ween if ye maken mock at it ye make at paplet mock dont so for pappies sake end of the first pastoral argument to the second pastoral fauney and lallet had an equal value for each other fauney was young and of a most taking aspect lallet beauteous and particularly tenderhearted these walk together to a grove at hand to taste the pleasance of the season and the sweets of each othes talk there long they bay themselves in the soft delices of the morn the harmless swain and gentle shepherdess lallet at length leaps up to gather strawberrys for her lover while he for her sat plaiting flowery gyrlonds and wishing her return long he sat and long he wished but she to raise his love delayed her return fauney as she was about to surprise and joy him with her sight rises and runs to paplet to enquire for her then it is that lallets softness of heart appears with watery eyes she rambles through the grove and accuses her self of cruelty there find her another lad and lass endeavor to allay her grief and sing a cheerful song for her diversion at length cubbin begs her to go home with him she declines it lest it might occasion a second uneasiness to fauney and resolves to punish her self by staying where she was she does so till fauney at length does come he skulks behind the cave she sat in and hears how uneasy she was for making him so anon he surprises her with his sight drys up her tears and conducts home in the height of good humor  as for the time though it begins in the morning the main of this pastoral is in the eventide and the moonlight night that succeeds the season midsummerday and the   scene a delightful grove

pick aside a spring her breast to deck then down again sat on the soft and looked for lallet often and often o me how fine a flower is this sooth she shall not have it without a kiss eligring he said and pleased himself that he should please his darling elf thus long he sat still wondering why she came not but she then was by the lass stood by stood hind a bough laughing to think what he would do when found the came not now she sain had i the heart to give him pain emey i have heard say i know not love dearer be the dearer bought a little whit however i will wait twill pain him but a little whit the gentle shepherd easeless was turning and shifting on the grass when paplet saw he younglinglass soft of heart and fair of face full far away he saw and ran to know if lallet she had seen and walked awith her grieved sore till his own dear could see no more when lallet saw athro her bough the fairframed he to paplet go ah god how yearnd the harmless heart how grieved that she should give
