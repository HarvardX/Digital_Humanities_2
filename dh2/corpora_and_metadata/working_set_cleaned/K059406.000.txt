the anatomy of exchangealley or a system of stockjobbing  proving that scandalous trade as it is now carried on to be knavish in its private practice and treason in its public  being a clear detection i of the private cheats used to deceive one another ii of their arts to draw innocent families into their snares understood by their new term of art  viz  being let into the secret iii of their raising and spreading false news to ground the rise or fall of stocks upon iv of their joining with traitors in raising and propagating treasonable rumors to terrify and discourage the people with apprehensions of the enemies to the government v of their improving those rumors to make a run upon the bank and ruin public credit vi of the dangerous consequences of their practices to the government and the necessity there is to regulate or suppress them   to which is added some characters of the most eminent persons concerned now and for some years past in carrying on this pernicious trade  by a jobber  the second edition corrected  london printed for e smith near exchangealley      price one shilling  the anatomy of exchangealley etc the general cry against stockjobbing has been such and people have been so long and so justly complaining of it as a public nuisance and which is still worse have complained so long without a remedy that the jobbers hardened in crime are at last come to exceed all bounds and now if ever sleeping justice will awake and take some notice of them and if it should not now yet the diligem creatures are so steady to themselves that they will some time or other make it absolutely necessary to the government to demolish them  i know they upon all occasions laugh at the suggestion and have the pride to think it impracticable to restrain them and one of the top of the function the other day when i casually told him that if they went on they would make it absolutely necessary to the legislature to suppress them returned that he believed it was as absolutely necessary for em to do it now as ever it could be but how will they do it it is impossible said he but if the government takes credit their funds should come to market and while there is a market we will buy and sell there is no effectual way in the world says he to suppress us but this viz that the government should first pay all the public debts redeem all the funds and dissolve all the charters viz bank south sea and east india and buy nothing upon trust and then indeed says he they need not hang the stockjobbers for they will be apt to hang them selves  i must confess i in part agree that this is an effectual way but i am far from thinking it the only way to deal with a confederation of usurers who having sold the whole nation to usury keep the pursestrings of poor and rich in their hands which they open and shut as they please  but before i come to the needful ways for restraining those people i think twill be of some service to expose their practices to common view that the people may see a little what kind of dealers they are  and first they have this peculiar to em and in which they outdo all the particular pieces of public knavery that ever i met with in the world viz that they have nothing to say for it themselves they have indeed a particular stock of hard ware as the braziers call it in their faces to bear them out in it but if you talk to them of their occupation there is not a man but will own it is a complete system of knavery that it is a trade founded in fraud born of deceit and nourished by trick cheat wheedle forgeries falsehoods and all sorts of delusions coining false news this way good that way bad whispering imaginary terrors frights hopes expectations and then preying upon the weakness of those whose imaginations they have wrought upon whom they have either elevated or depressed if they meet with a cull a young dealer that has money to lay out they catch him at the door whisper to him sir here is a great piece of news it is not yet public it is worth a thousand guineas but to mention it i am heartily glad i met you but it must be as secret as the black side of your soul for they know nothing of it yet in the coffeehouse if they should stock would rise  0 per cent in a moment and i warrant you south sea will be   0 in a weeks time after it is known well says the weak creature prithee dear tom what is it why really sir i will let you into the secret upon your honor to keep it till you hear it from other hands why it is this the pretender is certainly taken and is carried prisoner to the castle of millan there they have him fast i assure you the government had an express of it from my lord st   s within this hour are you sure of it says the fish who jumps eagerly into the net sure of it why if you will take your coach and go up to the secretariesoffice you may be satisfied of it your self and be down again in two hours and in the mean time i will be doing something though it is but little till you return  away goes the gudgeon with his head full of wildfire and a squib in his brain and coming to the place meets a croney at the door who ignorantly confirms the report and so sets fire to the mine for indeed the cheat came too far to be baulkt at home so that without giving himself time to consider he hurries back full of the delusions dreaming of nothing but of getting a hundred thousand pounds or purchase two and even this money was to be gotten only upon the views of his being beforehand with other people  in this elevation he meets his broker who throws more fireworks into the mine and blows him up to so fierce an inflammation that he employs him instantly to take guineas to accept stock of any kind and almost at any price for the news being now public the artist made their price upon him in a word having accepted them for fifty thousand pounds more than he is able to pay the jobber has got an estate the broker   or  00 guineas and the esquire remains at leisure to sell his coach and horses his fine seat and rich furniture to make good the deficiency of his bearskins and at last when all will not go through it he must give them a brush for the rest  there are who tell us that the exchangealley improvements made upon the news of the pretenders being taken were part of the plot that the late earl of mar having concerted the voyage of voghera and how and in what manner the report of the pretenders being there should spread who it should amuse and how at one blow it should spread east to vienna and northwest to paris and so on forgot not to contrive it as at once should serve political ends in italy and at vienna so on the other hand it should not fail to serve a private view in exchangealley and at the same time that he deceived some of the whiggs who he owed a large grudge to for shrewd turns at preston and dumblain he might also raise a tax upon them toward the incident charges of his wandering circumstances  i do not averr this story to be true but the concert is so exact and the nature of it so agreeable to the stockjobbing art nay and to the artists also whose correspondents are very punctual especially since it is said that mr t  s chief agent was formerly my lord m  rs broker that i wont affirm it may be true but this i will venture to say of it that if we are often served thus the pretender may very easily raise a hundred thousand pounds a year in exchangealley for the carrying on an invasion and lay the tax wholly upon his enemies the whigs which by the way i leave them to consider of  but now that i may make good the charge  viz that the whole art and mystery is a mere original system of cheat and delusion i must let you see too that this part of the comedy may be very well called a bite for the biter for which i must go back to the broker and his gudgeon the moneyed gentleman finding himself let into the secret indeed and that he was bitten to the tune of  0000 l worse than nothing after he had unhappily paid as far as his ready money would go of which piece of honesty they say he has heartily repented and is in hopes all that come after him will forgive him for the sake of what followed stopped short as he might well you will say when his money was all gone and bethinks himself what am la doing i have paid away all this money like a fool i was drawn in like an ass by the eager desire of biting my neighbors to a vast sum and i have been fool enough in that but i have been ten thousand times a worse fool to pay a groat of the money especially since i knew i could not pay it all besides who but i would have forgot the nature of the thing i was dealing in and of the people i was dealing with why is it not all a mere body of knavery is not the whole doctrine of stockjobbing a science of fraud and are not all the dealers mere original thieves and pickpockets nay do they not own it themselves have not i heard t w b o and j s a thousand times say they know their employment was a branch of highway robbing and only differed in two things first in degree  viz that it was ten thousand times worse more remorseless more void of humanity done without necessity and committed upon fathers brothers widows orphans and intimate friends in all which cases highwaymen generally touched with remorse and affected with principles of humanity and generosity stopped short and choose to prey upon strangers only secondly in danger  viz that these rob securely the other with the utmost risque that the highwaymen run at the hazard of their lives being sure to be hanged first or last whereas these rob only at the hazard of their reputation which is generally lost before they begin and of their souls which trifle is not worth the mentioning have not i i say heard my broker mr say all this and much more and have not i also heard him say that no man was obliged to make good any of their exchangealley bargains unless he pleased and unless he was in haste to part with his money which indeed i am not and has not all the brokers and jobbers when they have been bitten too hard said the same thing and refused to pay pray how much did old cudworth ph cpm and mr goog eminent jobbers monarchs in their days of exchangealley break for and how much did they ever pay one if i mistake not compounded at last for one penny per pound and the other two for something less  in a word they are all a gang of rogues and cheats and i will pay none of them besides my lawyer sir thomas subtle tells me there is not a man of them dares sue me no though i had no protection to fly to and he states the case thus  you have sir  says subtle contracted to accept of stock at a high price east india at   0 bank at   0 south sea   0 and the like very well they come to put it upon you the stock being since fallen tell them you cannot take it yet if they urge your contract and demand when you will take it tell them you will take it when you think fit  if they swagger call names as rogue cheat and the like tell them as to that you are all of a fraternity there is no great matter in it whether you cheat them or they cheat you it is as it happens in the way of trade that it all belongs to the craft and as the devils broker whiston said to parson giffard tell them you are all of a trade if they rage and tell you the devil will have you and such as that tell them they should let the devil and you alone to agree about that it is none of their business but when he comes for you tell them you would advise them to keep out of the way or get a protection as you have against them  after this it is supposed they will sue you at law then leave it to me i will hang them up for a year or two in our courts and if ever in that time the stock comes up to the price we will tender the money in court demand the stock and saddle the charges of the suit upon them let them avoid it if they can  this is my lawyers opinion says he to himself and i will follow it to a tittle and so we are told he has and i do not hear that one stockjobber has begun to sue him yet or intends it nor indeed dare they do it    this experiment indeed may teach understanding to every honest man that falls into the clutches of these merciless men called stockjobbers and i give the world this notice that in short not one of their exchangealley bargains need be otherwise than thus complied with and let these buyers of bearskins remember it not a man of them dare go to common law to recover the conditions nor is any man obliged further then he thinks himself obliged in principle to make good one of his bargains with them how far principle will carry any man to be just to a common cheat that has drawn him into a snare i do not indeed know but i cannot suppose twill go a very great length where there is so clear so plain and so legal a door to get out at  it must be confessed that if the projected story of the taking the pretender was acted in concert between rome and exchangealley between my lord mar and a certain broker as fame reports either the broker is the devil of a jacobite or my lord the devil of a broker it must be acknowledged twas a far fetched trick and answered the end in exchange most admirably  nor can all the world tell us any other end that it could answer for as to the pretenses of deluding the imperialists on shore or the british men of war at sea and so the better to facilitate the escape of the pretender to spain i undertake to prove that this is absurd and ridiculous for the pretender was embarked at netunna and gone away to sea thirteen days at least before this whim of people taken at voghera was talked of  as to the amusements among the courtsa vienna paris and london they amounted to nothing at all answered no end neither prompted any design on one hand or hindered any thing on the other in a word we may challenge the world to tell us any one turn that was served by it or end answered by it but this in exchangealley  nor was this so inconsiderable a design as not to be worth while to form such a juggle though a great way off and as far off as it is if we may believe the report of those who remember the machines and contrivances of that original of stockjobbing sir j   c   there are those who tell us letters have been ordered by private management to be written from the east indies with an account of the loss of ships which have been arrived there and the arrival of ships lost of war which the great mogul when they have been in perfect tranquillity and of peace with the great mogul when he was come down against the factory of bengale with one hundred thousand men just as it was thought proper to calculate those rumors for the raising and falling of the stock and when it was for his purpose to but cheap or sell dear  it would be endless to give an account of the subtiltics of that capital chet when he had a design to bite the whole exchange as he was the leading hand to the market so he kept it in his power to set the price to all the dealers the subject then was clrie fly the east india stock though there were other stocks on foot too though since sunk to nothing such as the hudsonsbay company the linen manufacture stock paper stock saltpeter stock and others all at this day worse than nothing though some of them then jobbd up to   0 per cent as the two first in particular  but the east india stock was the main point every mans eye when he came to market was upon the brokers who acted for sir j  does sir j  sell or buy if sir j  had a mind to buy the first thing he did was to commission his brokers to look sower shake their heads suggest bad news from india and at the bottom it followed i have commission from sir j  to sell out whatever i can and perhaps they would actually sell ten perhaps twenty thousand pound immediately the exchange for they were not then come to the alley was full of sellers no body would buy a shilling till perhaps the stock would fall six seven eight ten per cent sometimes more then the cunning jobber had another set of men employed on purpose to buy but with privacy and caution all the stock they could lay their hands on till by selling ten thousand pound at   or   per cent lost he would buy a hundred thousand pound stock at  0 or    per cent under price and in a few weeks by just the contrary method set them all a buying and then sell them their own stock again at ten or twelve per cent profit  these honest methods laid the foundation we will not say of a fine great stone house on a certain forest but it certainly laid the foundation of an opulent family and iniutiated the crowd of jobbers on that dexterity in tricking and cheating one another which to this day they are the greatest proficients that this part of the world ever saw  to come a little nearer home we had another gentleman who from a small beginning came to leave as they say who speak of the least   0000 l behind him and yet did not die an old man neither this knight to avoid as much as possible reflections upon the ashes of the dead added to the former craft that of bringing sudden news into exchangealley calculated to the wagers he had to lay or to any he had to hedge off and by this gained immense sums of money where he living i should give it an harder name why should it be thought so strange that my lord mar and his broker should trump up a story from italy send a set of postchaises with gentlemen in disguise out of the way of all road to be taken up in the milanese and sent to the castle and then sent word to a great man in england who is a believer that it was the pretender and all this to raise the price of stocks and put it upon the whiggs i say why should this be more strange than that sir h  f  se in the late king williams reign was able to maintain such a constant intelligence in holland flanders germany ireland etc that he several times brought the king accounts of battles fought victories won towns taken etc before the swiftest expresses of the kings own servants and generals could arrive and had once a diamond ring of  00 l given him by the king for his early news  by this exactly concerted intelligence he then knew how to turn the wagers a sort of jobbing then in mode and which grew so infamous that they were at length obliged to suppress it by act of parliament which way he pleased and by which he got an immense sum of money how often did the gentleman run down true news as if it had been false and run up false news as if it had been true by the force of his foreign intelligeneers how often coin reports of great actions to serve a turn it is too late a trick to be forgot by many that were hit by it to the bone  in a word they putting false news upon us is nothing but an old trade revived though it must be confessed this of the pretender has been a masterpiece and the worthy projector who has the credit of it must pass for a dextrous manager as any the university of exchangealley has bred up for  0 years past  it had also one particular in it for which it was very remarkable sham reports false news foreign letters etc are things that have been often trumpt upon us as above and the town have been not long ago cheated to a good round sum that way but then they have been soon detected the morning news has been set to rights in the afternoon or the evenings heat has cooled by morning but this trick had a fatal duration for it held us near a fortnight in a firm persuasion of the thing and even then it continued but suspected only for some time longer and was yet longer before it was fully detected and even at last it was hardly conquered till the jacobites laugh us out of it and the pretender was looked for nearer home  the assurance with which it was carried about the several places from whence it was written made it so effectually be swallowed down that really people saw no room to question the truth of it for a great while twas written from rome from leghorn from genoa from turin and from paris nay twas even believed at court and almost every where else  exquisite fraud who could have believed this had been born in exchangealley sent over to rome agreed to there and executed in such a manner as to cheat not the town only but all europe  the authority that every one found attemded the report supported it so that it possessed us all even those whose concern for the fact extorted tears from them were not undeceiv d thus the hucksters had time to play their game and they made hay while the sun shone for if we may believe common fame bargains contracts and agreements for stocks bearskins included amounted in that time to some hundred thousands of pounds nay some say to two millions and better most of which was to the loss of the believing party  but what tricking what fraud what laying plots as deep as hell and as far as the ends of the earth is here what cheating of fathers and mothers and brothers gulling widows orphans couzening the most wary and plundering the unwary and how much meaner roberies than these bring the friendless even to the gallows every sessions  but i must not stop here the story of the pretender is over that trump is played and the artful gamesters wanting a new trick after having played so many already that one would think invention was at an end yet they have found it out and we are just led into the secret  hitherto craft and knavery appears to be their method but we shall trace them now a little further and like true hassars that plunder not the enemy only but their own army as the opportunity presents so these men are now come to prey upon the government it self  let us look into the late lotteries had not a piercing eye detected the rognery and not the fall of other things taken off the edge of the peoples fancy for venturing these artists had brought up the tickets to    s apiece advance even before the act was passed that this could not be but by securing the possession of all the tickets in their own hands except such select tickets as were not to come to market i say that this could not be but by connivance and this every one knows and that this connivance again could not be but by some higher people than those that were named to it this also every one may know who they were is none of my business to enquire though it is easy to guess it is very hard when our statesmen come into a confederacy to bite the people and when dukes turn stockjobbers yet that this was done is most certain and what was this but making a property of the power that might be in their hands the better to bite the people for if the parliament appointed  00000 l in tickets to be given out at a certain rate that was low and reasonable was it not to encourage the people on whom the rest of the national burden lies and if by the craft and knavery of jobbers the people are made to pay  00000 l for them which is much about the case pray why not pay the hundred thousand pounds to the public either to pay off a hundred thousand pounds of debt or to make the burden of the current year a hundred thousand pounds lighter of which i am sure there is need enough  it has been indeed our happiness that a worthy member being informed of this abominable cheat detected it and laid it before the house upon which a vote was past to make void all bargains made for tickets before the act was past so the biters were bitten and a certain sir george    was obliged to refund but the roguery of the design was never a jot the less for that  but the fatal influences of this growing evil does not end here and i must trace stockjobbing now to its new acquired capacity of intermeddling with the public assisting rebellion encouraging invasion and if i do not bring the stockjobbers even the whigs among them to be guilty of treason against their king and country and that of the worst kind too then i do nothing  had the stockjobbers been all jacobites by profession or had the employment led them by the necessity of their business to put king and nation and particularly their own to bargain and sale and had the selling of news een their property and they had an act of parliament or patent to entitle them to the sole privilege of imposing what false things they pleased on the people i should have had much the less reason to have complained of their roguery and have rather turned my self to the rest of them people who are the subject they work upon and only have stood at exchangealley end and cried out gentlemen have a care of your pockets  again had it been a private club or suciety of men acting one among another had the cheats the frauds and the tricks they daily make use of in which the english rogue was a fool to them been practiced upon themselves only and like gamesters at a public board they had only played with those that came there to play with them in this case also i should have held my tongue and only put them in mind of an old song every stanza of which chimd in with tantararand rogues all rogues all  but when we find this trade become a political vice a public crime and that as it is now carried on it appears dangerous to the public that whenever any wickedness is it hand any mischief by the worst of the nations enemies upon the wheel the stock jobbers are naturally made assistant to it that they become abettors of treason assistant to rebellion and invasion then it is certainly time to speak for the very employment becomes a crime and we are obliged to expose a sort of men who are more dangerous than a whole nation of enemies abroad an evil more formidable then the pestilence and in their practice more fatal to the public than an invasion of spaniards  it is said by some that the principal leaders in the jobbing trade at that time and at whom most part of the satyr in this work ought to be pointed are whigs members of parliament and friends to the government and that the refore i had best have a care of what i say of them  my first answer is so i will i will have a care of them and in the next place let them have a care of me for if i should speak the whole truth of some of them they might be whigs but i dare say they would be neither pmen or friends to the government very long and it is very hard his majesty should not be told what kind of friends to him such men are  besides i deny the fact these men friends to the government jesu maria the government may be friendly to them in a manner they do not deserve but as to their being friends to the government that is no more possible than the cardinal alberoni or the chevalier de st george are friends to the government and therefore without reflecting upon persons naming names or the like there will be no need of names the dress will describe them i lay down this new fashioned proposition or postulatum take it which way you please that i will make it out by the consequences of what i am going to say   that stockjobbing as it is now practiced and as is generally understood by the word stockjobbing is neither less or more than high treason in its very nature and in its consequences   that the stockjobbers who are guilty of the practices i am going to detect are eventually traitors to king george and to his government family and interest and to their country and deserve to be used at least as confederates with traitors when ever there are any alarms of invasions rebellions or any secret practices against the government of what kind soever   this is a black charge and boldly laid and ought therefore to be effectually made out which shall be the work of a few pages in the following sheets  first i lay down this as a rule which i appeal to the laws of reason to support that all those people who at a time of public danger whether of treasonable invasion from abroad or traiterous attempts to raise insurrections at home shall willingly and wittingly abett assist or encourage the traitors invading or rebelling are equally guilty of treason  secondly all those who shall endeavor to weaken disappoint and disable the government in their preparations or discourage the people in their assisting the government to oppose the rebels or invadors are guilty of treason  all that can be alleged in contradiction to this and perhaps that could not be made our neither is that they are not traitors within the letter of the law to which i answer if they were i should not satyrize them but impeach them but if it appears that they are as effectually destructive to the peace and safety of the government and of the kings person and family as if they were in open war with his power i do the same thing and fully answer the end proposed  as there are many thieves besides housebreakers highwaymen lifters and pickpockets so there are many traitors besides rebels and invaders and perhaps of a much worse kind for as in a dispute between a certain lord and a woman of pleasure in the town about the different virtue of the sexes the lady insisted that the men were agressors in the vice and that in plain english if there were no whoremasters there would be no whores so in a word if there were no parties at home no disaffection no traitors among our selves there would be no invasions from abroad  now i will suppose for the purpose only that the people i am speaking of were not disaffected to the government i mean not originally and intentionally pointing their design at the government nay that they are hearty whigs call them as we please yet if it appear they are hearty knaves too will do any thing for money and are by the necessity of their business obliged or by the vehement pursuit of their interest that is to say of their profits pushed upon things as effectually ruinous and destructive to the government as the very buying arms and ammunition by a professed jacobite in order to rebellion could be are they not traitors even in spite of principle in spite of the name of whig nay in spite of a thousand meritorious things that might otherwise be said of them or done by them  a gunsmith makes ten thousand firelocks in the minories the honest man may be a whig he designs to sell them to the government to lay up in the tower or to kill spaniards or any of the rest of the kings enemies a merchant comes and buys some of them and says they are for the west indies or to sell into france but upon enquiry it appears they are bought for rebellion the unde signing gunsmith comes into trouble of course and it will be very hard for him to prove the negative  viz that when he has furnished the rebels with arms he had no share in the rebellion  to bring this home to the case in view who were the men who in the late hurry of an expected invasion sunk the price of stocks    to    per cent who were the men that made a run upon the bank of england and pusht at them with some particular pique too if possible to have run them down and brought em to a stop of payment and what was the consequences of these things will they tell us that running upon the bank and lowering the stocks was no treason we know that literally speaking those things are no treason but is there not a plain constructive treason in the consequences of it is not a wilful running down the public credit at a time when the nation is threatened with an invasion from abroad and rebellion at home is not this adding to the teror of the people is not this disabling the government discouraging the kings friends and a visible encouragement of the kings enemies is not all that is taken from the credit of the public on such an occasion added to the credit of the invasion does not every thing that weakens the government strengthen its enemies and is not every step that is taken in prejudice of the kings interest a step taken in aid of the designed rebellion the kindest thing that can be said of a certain triumvirate of jobbers whose hands have been deepest in this part of the work and who indeed had more obligations upon them than any other men in the town to have assisted the public interest and advanced the credit of the nation is that they did not think what they did and that this excuse may not serve them another time i may soon furnish them with an anatomy of some of the conduct of that little body of number three that when they see their mistakes with the eyes that other men see them they may at their leisure give a better turn to the measures of unbounded avarice  and now that i may not be said to speak without a precedent i humbly refer to those moneyed gentlemen to a case recent in memory and even in their own which though indeed they may think fit to have forgotten for a time they will all call to mind when they hear of it again and this was the case of two goldsmiths knights also and one of them member of parliament too in fleetstreet who pushed at the bank of england at the time that the pretenders invasion from france was in its preparation one of them it was said had gathered a quantity of bankbills to the value of near  00000 l and the other a great sum though not so many and it was said resolved to demand them all at once  let the gentlement i point at look back to the printed papers that year let them enquire what construction was put upon it let them enquire how the government resented it how my lord treasurer godolphin looked upon it as a mine formed to blow up the queens affairs and how in a word all the friends of the government took it to be such a step in favor of the pretender as was impossible to consist with duty to the queen  let them enquire further with what difficulty sir r  h  wiped off the imputation of being a favourer of the rebellion and how often in vain he protested he did it with no such view and how hard the whiggs were to believe him sir f  c  d indeed carried it with a higher hand and afterward pretended to refuse the bills of the bank but still declared he did it as a goldsmith and as a piece of justice to himself in some points in which the bank had as he alleged used him ill but in general it was looked upon as an open affront to the government and an abetting and countenancing the invasion of the pretender from abroad and the rebellion intended at home nor was the government much less were the authors of private papers and prints wanting in letting them know it nay if i am not misinform d they were threatened with being treated as enemies to the government and if things had gone on to extremities they had doubtless been marked out as persons the government were to take care of  now i only speak in plainer words it was said then that such men as endeavored to run down the public credit were enemies to the government i know no distinction in the case that should require so much tenderness every subject of king george who is at the same time an enemy to king george is a traitor and every overt act of that enmity it being his duty to his utmost to favor aid and support the government is an overt act of treason let it be gilded over with what fine words the persons please it is the same thing if it is not literal treason and within reach of the statute yet the crime is in it self of the same nature  and let any one tell me what is the difference between two dealers in paper credit in the time of a french invasion and three dealers in papercredit in the time of a spanish invasion or what sanctity in birchinlane more than in fleet street that one should be a protection for the same practice that was resented so justly in another  were those stockjobbers sincerely and heartily in the interest of king george and his government as they pretend loudly what run could there be upon the bank what ebb of credit what sinking of stock the honest whiggs who were friends to the government at that time mentioned above who not only knew their duty but how to make it seasonable and useful acted after another manner when others run upon the bank with all the fury possible they carried all the money thither they could gather up nay i could name a man in this city who having but  00 in the world carried it all into the bank to support the credit of the public and the story being told to her majesty by the late lord treasurer godolphin the sense of such fidelity so moved the queen that she sent him a hundred pounds as a gift a royal token of her accepting such an act of loyalty and caused my lord to give him an obligation from the treasury to repay him the whole  00 l if any disaster to the bank should have made it doubtful  where is the like courage and conduct to be found now is it in being are the gentlemen less able or is it that they have not the same zeal for king george as that honest citizen had for the queen or do they doubt the king being as sensible of the service or what is the matter that the public credit had rather met with injurious juggling and jobbing upon it than real support either from exchangealley birchin lane or some other places less noted  let those men reflect a little upon the circumstances the public credit must have been in by such management if the spanish attempt had been made and if these easterly protestant winds had not chopped in by which providence has given the government time to put it self into a posture of defense so as now not to be afraid of them and if the capital stock of the persons interested in the funds is now sunk a million in the real value of them as they stood before even at the market which is nothing but what the matter of fact will justify to what degree would the same current if it had gone on have sunk the estates of all the moneyed men in england  in what manner would money have been raised upon a new credit for any immediate exigencies that might have happened and should the government have been supported nay though the parliament had granted funds while these men had made all credit ebb perhaps to    or  0 per cent discount and is not this then a species of treason and rebellion  it was very remarkable that in the juncture of those things the jacobites could not refrain taking notice how easy it was to set the citizens a plundering the bank and even the exchequer too for had this gone on the funds which are in effect the exchequer it self would have gone down hill hand in hand with the bank credit would have borne equal pace in one as well as in the other and the government would no more have been able to borrow than the bank would have been able to pay  it is scarce fit to enter into a description of all the mischievous consequences which necessary follow running down the public credit in case of such dangers as i have mention d above if i should fully describe them it would appear incredible every one will allow that this practice of the jobbers carry d on a little further would indeed appear to be the worst kind of treason  but it is needful after having said thus much of the crime to say something of the place and then a little of the persons too the center of the jobbing is in the kingdom of exchangealley and its adjacencies the limits are easily surrounded in about a minute and a half  viz stepping out of jonathans into the alley you turn your face full south moving on a few paces and then turning due east you advance to garraways from thence going out at the other door you go on still east into birchinlane and then halting a little at the swordblade bank to do much mischief in fewest words you immediately face to the north enter cornhill visit two or three petty provinces there in your way west and thus having boxd your compass and sailed round the whole stockjobbing globe you turn into jonathans again and so as most of the great follies of life oblige as to do you end just where you began  but this is by way of digression and even still before i come to the main case i am obliged to tell you that though this is the sphere of the jobbers motion the orb to which they are confined and out of which they cannot well act in their way yet it does not follow but that men of foreign situation i mean foreign as to them i do not meak foreign by nation and of different figure are seen among them nay some whose luster is said to be too bright for the hemisphere of a coffeehouse have yet their influence there and act by substitutes and representatives but first i must speak to originals  c  a man of brass sufficient for much more businets than he can be trusted which is  to manage for three blue ribbonds and for four or five cathepers who tell more money than their own he fetches and carries with such indefatigable application that he is said never to sail his appointments to a minute however remote from one another wherever he appears he makes an exchangealley in his person and a court in his audience he is himself a jonathanscosseehouse in little though he be at a cockpit he reallizes exchangealley in every place and yet he rather is directed than directs and like a certain great general famed for more fire than phlegm is fitter to drive than to lead  s  has twice the head but not half the business as c  is said to have yet he gets more money for himself and c  gets more for other folks s  is as cunning as c  is bold and the reserve of one with the openness of the other makes a complete exchangealley man c  jumps at every thing and as he got the start of the world at his beginning by venturing more than he was worth so he deals now with all men as if they ventured more than they are worth originally he was a bite which in modern language is a sharper or being fully interpreted may signify the head class of the fraternity called pick pockets  t  a gamester of the same board acts in concert with c  and s  and makes together a true triumverate of modern thieving he inherits the face of c  with the crafr of s  but seems to take state upon him and acts the reserved part more than either yet even this too is all grimace for where ever he can be sure to kill he ant fawn like an irishman  they are all three of yesterday in their characters yet they are old in the cre  viz of resolving to be rich at the price of every man they can bubble their first blow was aimed at the bank but there they were outwitted and the great lordtreasurer godolphin in the late reign gave them their just characters from that action the defeat they met with there sticks so close to them that they reserve the measures of their revenge nor to cool no not till the charter of the bank shall expire  however their wings being clipped by the clause then obtained in an act of parliament  viz that no society corporation etc should issue out bills of credit as a bank but the bank of england only they were obliged ever since to turn stockjobbers or if we may speak properly of them they are the stockjobbers masters for they have so many bearskins pawned to them at a time so much stock deposited with them upon bottomree as it might be called that indeed they may he called the city pawnbrokers and i have been cold that they have had fifty stockjobbers and brokers bound hand and foot and laid in heaps at their doors at a time  the next trick they tried and which was indeed the masterpiece of their knavery was the getting an assignment of the forfeited estates in ireland into their hands indeed they began the world upon this prospect and expected to have had the whole kingdom of ireland mortgaged to them but here too they were disappointed and had they not found a man that had as much money as themselves and more honesty that bargain of the forfeited estates had been the last they had made in the world  the endeavors they use to cheat that gentleman after he had delivered them from a blow that would have blown them up is another black part of their story that remains to be told for the illustration of their characters at another time but in the interm it is enough to say that he who deliverd them as fools knew how to deliver himself from them as knaves and so they were dropped out of the irish bargain to their great mortification  now they stand ready as occasion offers and profit presents to stockjobb the nation ouzen the parliament ruffle the bank run up and run down stocks and put the dice upon the whole town  they had another flap with a foxtail to the scandal of their politics in the late vote about the tickets of the lottery which i mentioned above what market they will make of it is well enough known but the plot was never the less cunning and it is certain the knavery is not the less visible for the miscarriage i come next to their more modern management  whenever they call in their money the stockjobbers must sell the bearskin men must commute and pay difference money then down come the stocks tumbling two or three per cent then the tools must sell and then masters buy the next week they take in stocks again then the jobbers buy and the managers sell thus the jobbers bite their friends and these men bite the jobbers qui sarpat sharpabitur exchangealley latin they that are let into the secret will understand it  the truth is it has been foretold by cunning men who often see what cannot be hid that these men by a mass of money which they command of other peoples as well as their own will in time ruin the jobbing trade but twill be only like a general visitation where all distempers are swallowed up in the plague like a common calamity that makes enemies turn friends and drowns lesser grievances in the general deluge for if the reprisal trade should adjourn from exchangealley to birchinlane it may seem to be like the banishing usury from the city of rome which transferred it to a jew at genoa a monk at naples and a banker at venice who it was said had no less than seven and twenty principalities in italy mortgaged to them at a time besides two kingdoms seven dutchies and the jewels of the crown of france  having thus given the blazing characters of three capital sharpers of great britain knaves of lesser magnitude can have no room to shine the alley throngs with jews jobbers and brokers their names are needle ss their characters dirty as their employment and the best thing that i can yet find out to say of them is that there happens to be two honest men among them heavens preserve their integrity for the place is a snare the employment it self fatal to principle and hitherto the same observation which i think was very aptly made upon the mint will justly turn upon them  viz that many an honest man has gone in to them but cannot say that i ever knew one come an honest man out from them  but to leave them a little and turn our eyes another way is it not surprising to find new faces among these scandalous people and persons even too big for our reproof is it possible that stars of another latitude should appear in our hemisphere had it been sims or bowcher or gamesters of the drawing room or masquerades there had been little to be said or had the groomporters been transposed to garraways and jonathans it had been nothing new true gamesters being always ready to turn their hand to any play but to see statesmen turn dealers and men of honor stoop to the chicanry of jobbing to see men at the orfices in the morning at the p  house about noon at the cabinet at night and at exchangealley in the proper intervals what new phoenomina are these what fatal things may these shining planets like the late great light foretell to the state and to the public for when statesmen turn jobbers the state may be jobbd  it may be true that a treasurer or cashkeeper may be trusted with more money than he is worth and many times it is so and if the man be honest there may be no harm in it but when a treasurer plays for more money than he is worth they that trust him run a risque of their money because though he may be an honest man he may be undone i speak of private not public treasurers  indeed it requires some apology to say such a one may be an honest man it would be hard to call him an honest man who plays away any mans money that is not his own or more than he is able to pay again out of his own but if it be dishonest to play it away that is lose it at play it is equally dishonest to play with it whether it be lost or no because in such a case he that plays for more than he can pay his master runs the hazard more than himself nay his master runs an unequal hazard for if the money be lost it is the masters if there is gain it is the servants  stockjobbing is play a box and dice may be less dangerous the nature of them are alike a hazard and if they venture at either what is not their own the knavery is the same it is not necessary any more than it is safe to mention the persons i may think of in this remark they who are the men will easily understand me  in a word i appeal to all the world whether a man that is entrusted with other mens money whether public or private is not the question ought to be seen in exchangealley would it not be a sufficient objection to any gentleman or merchant not to employ any man to keep his cash or look after his estate to say of him he plays he is a gamester or he is given to gaming and stockjobbing which is still worse gives the same or a stronger ground of objection in the like cases  again are there fewer sharpers and setters in exchangealley than at the groomporters is there less cheating in stockjobbing than at play or rather is there not fifty times more an unenterd youth coming to deal in exchangealley is immediately surrounded with bites setters pointers and the worst sort of cheats just as a young country gentleman is with bauds pimps and spungers when he first comes to town it is ten thousand to one when a forward young tradesman steps out of his shop into exchangealley i say it is ten thousand to one but he is undone if you see him once but enter the fatal door never discount his bills afterward never trust him with goods at six months pay any more  if it be thus dangerous to the mean what is it to the great i see only this difference that in the first the danger is private in the latter public  it has not been many years since elections for members of  came to market in exchangealley as current as lottery tickets now and at a price like these much above what any parliament allowed them to go at while this was carried on a great many honest men exclaimed against it and exposed it nay several acts of parliament were proposed for regulating elections and preventing bribery and corruption but all this would not do and this indeed was one of the happy consequences of that otherwise necessary act for triennial parliaments and i firmly believe that it is oweing very much to the late suspending that act for a time that these things are not come to market again  it may easily be remembered that the first occasion of the exchangealley men engaging in the case of elections of members was in king williams time on the famous disputes which happened between the old east india company and the new which having held a great while and having embarrassd not the city only but the whole nation and even made it self dangerous to the public business it was expected it should be fully decided by the house of commons to this end the members of both companies with all the trick artifice cunning and corruption that money and interest could arm them with bestirred themselves to be chosen members  brokers rid night and day from one end of the kingdom to the other to engage gentlemen to bribe corporations to buy off competitors and to manage the elections you will see the state of things at that time and the danger this stock jobbing wickedness had brought the public to if you please to read the following exclamation of the honest freeholders at that time which was presented to the public by way of complaint the thing was laid before the king first and before the parliament afterward and it was his majestys sense of the consequence that made him resolve to bring the two east india companies to unite their stocks for in a word the stockjobbers embroiled the whole nation  the grand work which the whole nation is now intent upon is choosing their representatives in parliament choosing men to meet and advise with the king about the most important affairs of the kingdom  and while all men ought to be fixing their eyes upon such men as are best qualified to sit in that place of honor and to examine who are fittest to be entrusted with the religion and peace of england and perhaps of all europe  here we are plagued with the impertinence of two east india companies as if the interest of either company were to be named in the day with the protestant religion and the public peace or as if they who are fit to be representatives of the people in the great matters of peace and war leagues and alliances of neighbors succession of crowns and protection of the protestant religion should not be capable of deciding the petty controversy in trade between two rival companies  the grand question asked now when your vote is required for a parliament man is not as it ought to be is he a man of sense of religion of honesty and estate  but what company is he for the new or the old  as this stockjobbing in its own nature is only a new invented sort of deceptio visus a legerdemain in trade so mixed with trick and cheat that twould puzzle a good logician to make it out by syllogism so nothing can be more fatal in england to our present constitution and which in time may be so to our liberty and religion than to have the interests of elections jobbd upon exchange for money and transferred like east india stock for those who bid most  by this method the country gentlemen may sit at home and only corresponding with the brokers at jonathans and garways as the prizes rise or fall may dispose of their interests in the towns they can govern at as good a rate as they can  the citizens or such who have their several companies and interest to serve will ease themselves of the expense of traveling with the fine borrowed equipages before mentioned and only go to market in exchangealley and buy an election as the stockjobber and they shall agree which election shall be managed by the country gentleman who is to have his bargain no purchase no pay and is to go through with it or else he gets none of the money  elections of parliament men are in a hopeful way and parliaments themselves are in a hopeful way by this concise method of practice to come under the absolute manages meant of a few hands and no doubt things will go on accordingly  banks and stocks may be laid up and employed in a short time for the purchasing the interest of gentlemen and our gentry being willing to get a penny in an honestway as we say will but too often sell their interests and their country too especially such gentlemen whose estates are reduced to an occasion for it  the stockjobbers who care not a farthing which side gets the better but make a prey of them both have set up this new trade of jobbing for elections and that the way of their proceeding may be a little plainer understood we desire you to read the copy of a letter come down last post to a worthy gentleman in our country from a friend of his plying in or near exchangealley concerning this matter    sir the elections for a new parliament being begun almost every where i doubt not but the time is fixed at your town of     i know you have the absolute power of the inhabitants there and can put in whom you please and finding by your last you purpose to decline it your self i am to inform you that a very honest gentleman of my acquaintance being an eminent merchant here would think himself very much obliged if you would use your interest in his behalf upon your grant whereof i have an order to present you with a thousand guineas to buy my lady   he is ready to come down at your first summons in a very good equipage pray dispatch your mind per the bearer to  your humble servant to the honorable sir a b c d bar  postcript  if sir e f g h will dispose of his interest in the town of  i can help him to very good terms  now though the worthy gentleman to whom this proposal was made rejected it with disdain yet the attempt is made very plain in the case  and we are informed that the number of members come down into the countries on such accounts are incredible  wherefore we think it very needful to publish our resentments at such a practice and to protest against it in this our honest plea as an indirect wicked and pernicious practice and which may be of very ill consequence to the nation  if stockjobbing of elections be the first step in all probability stockjobbing of votes will be the second for he that will give a thousand pounds or more only for a power to vote expects to get something by voting or gives away his money for nothing  what shall we say then if a league of confederacy should be made between our parliamentsolicitors and our stockjobbing brokers two sort of people equally mercenary and deceitful  we desire to know whether twould not be more fatal to england than the new war with spain which all europe seems to be so much disturbed at  to all men whose eyes are to be opened with reason and argument it should be enough to fill them with abhorrence to think that the scandalous mechanic upstart mystery of jobbroking should thus grow upon the nation that ever the english nation should suffer themselves to be imposed on by the new invented ways of a few needy mercinaries who can turn all trade into a lottery and make the exchange a gaming table a thing which like the imaginary coins of foreign nations have no reality in themselves but are placed as things which stand to be calculated and reduced into value a trade made up of sharp and trick and managed with impudence and banter  that six or eight men shall combine together and by pretended buying or selling among themselves raise or sink the stock of the e india company to what extravagant pitch of price they will so to wheedle others sometimes to buy sometimes to sell as their occasions require and with so little regard to intrinsic value or the circumstances of the company that when the company has a loss stock shall rise when a great sale or a rich ship arrived it shall fall sometimes run the stock down to    l other times up to   0 l and by this method buy and sell so much that it is thought there are few of the noted stockjobbers but what have bought and sold more stock than both the companies possess  thus let them jobb trick and cheat one another and let them be bubbld by them that knows no better but for gods sake gentlemen dont let the important affairs of the state come under their wicked clutches  dont let them prepare our acts of parliament and then choose members to vote for them if fate and popish confederacies and union of popish powers abroad threaten us let us alone to struggle with them and have fair law and honorable conditions for it but to be bought and sold to have our elections of members and our laws liberties and estates stockjobbd away is intolerable    i said above that the parliament put a check to this practice afterward by several acts and the late act for suspending the triennial bill has at present laid it a ssep but how far the practice may revive when a new election shall come on who knows never was more knaves or more money in exchangealley and never more needy gentlemen to assist the purchasers how necessary it is to prevent them let any one judge  besides what shall we say to the encroaching nature of immortal avarice has not that eminent c  of whom at large above stockjobbd the very public it self as i may say and the very house of commons for jobbing their funds before they are laid stockjobbing their tickets before the lottery was found may in some sense be called stockjobbing the house if then they will even before the members faces jobb their depending acts and that too before they are passed shall we doubt but they will stockjobb the elections of another parliament when this is gone home  it is evident that at present not being able to avoid preying upon their country they have been tampering abroad foreign alarms is the present commodity at market choice of members may be the next till in time by strength of money they may stockjobb religion property constitution and succession for nothing can come amiss to them if they can but get money by it for if the same avarice reigns among them that it is evident is their guide now they would with the same facility jobb for the nation and without any scruple make a transfer of king george and his crown for a half per cent upon the value to whoever bids the money  there was a book published some years ago and when the stockjobbing people were thought as willing yet not quite so daring or so cunning as they are now it was entitled the villainy of the stockjobbers indeed it set them out in their true colors and for some time gave them a little shock for the truth was they jobbd king william and the government at that time at such a rate that in spite of the invincible valor and resolution of the soldiery in spite of the most glorious prince and most vigilant general the world had ever seen yet the enemy gained upon us every year the funds were run down the credit jobbd away in exchangealley the king and his troops devoured by mechanics and sold to usury tallies lay bundled up like bath faggots in the hands of brokers and stockjobbers the parliament gave taxes laid funds but the loans were at the mercy of those men and they showed their mercy indeed by devouring the king and the army the parliament and indeed the whole nation bringing that great prince sometimes to that exigence through unexpressible extortions that were put upon him that he has even gone into the field without his equipage nay even without his army the regiments have been uncloathed when the king has been in the field and the willing brave english spirits eager to honor their country and follow such a king have marched even to battle without either stockings or shoes while his servants have been every day working in exchangealley to get his own money of the stockjobbers even after all the horrible demands of discount have been allowed and at last scarce  0 per cent of the money granted by parliament has come into the exchequer and that late too late for that service and by driblets till the king has been tired with the delay and been even ready to give up the cause  we have just now had a test of their cunning on the subject of the invasion these were the men that made the first advantage of the news immediately those that were to put stock upon any man at a high price tender d it the accepters forced by the demand call in their money on every hand pay the difference the price falls a general run upon the bank follows and stockjobbing began it  say this was no design yet if every alarm of the foolish or the timorous or the false is capable to set the humor afloat by the agency of exchangealley then exchangealley is as dangerous to the public safety as a magazine of gunpowder is to a populous city  but if it be by design then whenever the pretender is to be pawned upon us by any foreign power that can but talk of lending   or  000 men our public credit is at his mercy by the agency of exchangealley and the brokers  the story of the invasion from spain we hope is now over indeed at the worst i saw no such reason to be surprised to that degree as was the case here let us look back and see what injury to the public has the very rumor been what damage to credit what stop to trade what interruption to our general commerce besides sinking above a million sterling upon our estates and every farthing of this is occasioned by the stockjobbers and in the consequences of their contrivances and by no other means for as to the design of an invasion or that they resolved to come hither at all though we have evident proofs of that because some of them have been actually landed yet we cannot yet resolve the question positively whether it was ever worth our being so much alarmed as we have been in exchangealley  even this way it appears that these stockjobbers are dangerous to the peace since it is in their power to set a rate whenever they please not only upon private estates but even upon the whole nation and in that capacity it is to be hoped the parliament who have hitherto redressed the public grievances will take care of these people in particular and deliver the public from such a set of men as are more fatal to them than a midnight fire more dangerous than an enemy embarked nay i had almost said than an enemy landed  for in a word these men take upon them to put a standard upon our fears and we are to ask them when intelligence comes from abroad whether any thing be to be slighted or apprehended every public piece of news every menace of the nations enemies is to receive its weight from them and the price of stocks is the rule by which we are to guide our judgment in public affairs by which we are either to hope or to fear when any thing amiss present it self to our view  is this an advantage fit to be put into the hand of a subject are the kings affairs to go up and down as they please and the credit of his majestys councils rise and fall as these men shall please to value them this would be making them kings and making the king subject to the caprice of their private interst his affairs be liable to be rated in exchangealley and to be run down as they pleased an article which as the roman pontiff in the first politics of the church made all the kings of the earth become pensioners to the priests so it would make all the kings of britain pensioners to exchangealley  it must be confessed it looks as if this were the present view in the manner which stockjobbing now goes on and there are more mischiefs in it than perhaps we are aware of the extremes either way seem dangerous enough for example  if one way the stockjobbers manage the public they scandalously subject the government the ministers of state the public credit nay even the elections of parliament to their orders so if a government should come absolutely to get the management of the stockjobbers it might be many ways fatal to the peoples interest and indeed put the pursestrings of the nation so much into the hands of a ministry that if they did not at any time command the general treasure and be able to raise what money they pleased without a parliament they would be able to add what value they pleased to the funds given raise them when they pleased to draw money in and sink them when they pleased to issue money out that in a word the rate of stocks should be settled every day in the exchequer and though they might not be said to stand no more in need of parliaments it would be most certain that they would not stand in so much need of parliaments as they used to do and as it is convenient for us they should do  i must run out a great length in the enumeration of the mischief to the liberty of great britain which might attend such a thing as this and though at present it may be objected that it is unreasonable and entirely needless because we are under a king that stands in need of no artifices and is too just to attempt any encroachment on the liberties of his people and a ministry who we have reason to hope are above taking any such mean steps yet if ever a time shall come again when every politic step shall be enquired after to bring grist to the public mill and every way that can be found practicable shall be thought justifiable then let you citizens of london have a care of a bearskincourt and a stockjobbing ministry when exchangealley shall be transposed to the exchequer and statesmen shall make a property of the brokers  this is indeed a thing remote and as i say above there is no danger of its happening in this reign so it may never happen at all but as i also say without the least reflection upon our present government that such a time may come and such a thing may happen so i affirm the state of things ought forthwith to be annihilated if possible which is but in its nature capable of being thus perverted and we ought not to leave our posterity in a condition to be devoured by such caterpillars if it be in our power to prevent it  why may not any collected stock of money such as that we have mentioned before to be in the management of the birchinlane company be managed in the hands of courtiers as well as of citizens ministers of state as well as inhabitants of hackney and to how many more unlucky purposes may such men apply that power these men indeed proceed with trick and cunning to amass great estates and to enrich themselves and their families out of the spoils of the people their neighbors etc and in this we think they cannot have too much of our just satyr bestowed upon them but if this engine of jobbing should once come into the hands of ministers of state if a degenerated government should come to use it as such a government may be supposed to be able to do what mischiefs may they not bring upon the nation and what may they not be able to do if their designs are but wicked enough to push them on  it would be hard to say to what length this jobbing trade might be extended especially whereby the advantage of a punctual management the public credit has so far gained upon the people as to bring the rate of funds and stocks to exceed the intrinsic value and to keep upon an advance what may not a government who has the command of money do in the particular art of screwing up or screwing down the public interests and securities  it is a copious subject our exchangealley men understand it well enough and if they were put to give their opinions and had honesty enough to speak the truth against their interest they would acknowledge their trade is capable of ruining ten nations if it was carried on to the full extent of it  while these sheets were at the press we had another little test of their knavery to the public and it is not at all owing to them that the thing run no further the contrary winds and storms etc had disappointed the kings enemies and the spanish fleet was driven back to spain in a shattered and defeated condition as appears by the public account of those things but in the interval of this news came an account on the other hand that some of the party were arrived in scotland that they had beat it up notwithstanding all the opposition of nature the hindrances of winds and seas immediately stocks fell two per cent nor did the good news of the defeated return of the rest animate these men to keep up the interest by which it appears that they are acted more by the bad principle than by the good that they choose rather to do evil than to do good that they sink faster than they rise and are willinger to do harm than good to the government  from whence i infer that the government looking upon them as they really are rather enemies than friends to the general interest should rather incline to root them out than preserve them amen  finis
