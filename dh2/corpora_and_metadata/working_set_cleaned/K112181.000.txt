some reflections upon the conversion of the good thief also the life and conversion of st paul  by sir richard bulstrode knight envoy at the court of brussels from king charles ii and king james ii  published with a preface by his son whitlocke bulstrode esquire  london printed for jonas brown at the black swan without temple bar mdccxv  to the right honorable charles earl of hallifax first lord commissioner of the treasury one of the lords of his majestys most honorable privy council and knight of the most noble order of the garter etc my lord the obligations i have received from your lordship for many years past and the continuance of them to this time do justly call for a public acknowledgment on the first opportunity i had to make it  having nothing of my own worth presenting to your lordship i have with your permission dedicated some essays of my fathers to your lordships perusal  i know how delicate a taste your lordship has that you have adorned your mind both with university and polite learning so that were i not entirely satisfied that the thoughts in them are not common and were they not my fathers i should say that they are writ in the smooth style of a courtier with the spirit and air of a gentleman and with the strength of a man of letters i should not have presumed to have inscribed your lordships name before them  how he was qualified to write these essays the preface mentions i shall only add that during the time of his foreign embassy which lasted about thirty years he laid out his hours between books men of the most polite parts and affairs of the greatest moment  he had the pleasure of near twenty years retirement before his death which was at a hundred and one to recollect his observations of men and things and put them in the dress in which your lordship sees them  there are some of them indeed that seem not to have passed his last hands which therefore are not so correct as they would have been had he lived to have finished them but when i consider that the first draughts of a raphael titian or reuben are preserved with great care though not finished i thought it best to let them pass as they are  the many great services your lordship has done the public have been expressed by so many that it will be hard to avoid repetition  however for a nobleman at the head of affairs at court to move with a great regard to the liberty and property of the subject steady to the reformed religion in the worst of times that advances not prerogative beyond its legal bounds that has the good of the nation at heart and that acts with great sincerity are virtues that can never be sufficiently admired by all true englishmen and particularly by  my lord your lordships most faithful and most obedient servant whit bulstrode  the preface i think it necessary to give some account of the author of the following essays and likewise of the essays themselves the rather because being posthumous works the genuiness of them might be otherwise doubted  as for the author sir richard bulstrode he was the son of edward bulstrode of the inner temple esquire whose reports are extant he came abroad into the world well stocked with university learning was bred at the inner temple called to the bar and practiced as a barrister till the civil wars breaking out put a stop to the current of the law and being then a young man and of an active spirit betook himself to the army and was of the royal side where he behaved himself so well that in a little time he was made adjutantgeneral to the army of king charles the first after the return of the royal family he had a place at court some time after he was appointed to be at the court of brussels as resident from king charles the second on whose death he was made envoy by king james the second to the same court his whole ministry there being about thirty years during which time he held correspondence with most of the courts of christendom as i find by his letters made up into annals which i have by me  when his royal master retired to france he went after him and submitted to his fortune and lived there in retirement about twenty years during which time he had opportunity to compose the following essays which were the result of his own experience  he had been a diligent observer of mankind through a long series of time having lived to an hundred and one had the experience of courts the conversation of men of the first quality generals and men of polite learning and having had great variety of fortune himself was best able to inform mankind what is proper to be done in those several parts of life in which he had been exercised  he looked back upon life after many years enjoying it with a truer view than men usually do forward for we look through a magnifying glass at things to come and think them much bigger and more excellent than in truth we find them the prospect of canaan from mount nebo was more ravishing even to moses than the enjoyment of it was afterward to the israelites or would have been to himself solomon could not have spoke so feelingly of the vanity of the pleasures of this life had he not taken a full draught of them the freedom of the authors conversation in his younger years being a man of a warm temper a great deal of wit and generosity having kept what we call the best company gave him an opportunity of looking back on the miscarriages which young gentlemen are subject to with useful reflections and remarks and of speaking more justly of those errors than closet moralists usually do  the author would have sent me the following essays to have published in his lifetime had not the war between england and france hindered it but dying before that ended he gave directions to his lady to send them to me by the first opportunity which she accordingly did being all of his own hand writing  so much for the author  as to the essays themselves  i essay of company and conversation that of company and conversation shows him to have read mankind very thoroughly  the caution of choosing ones company when to speak and when not when to break a jest and when not is very fit for all young gentlemen to know his short but smart reflection on obscene discourses is a proof of his knowledge of the government of the tongue  he inveighs against the sin of scoffing at religion and profane swearing with great sharpness and a moving sorrow when a good man hears his friend traduced he defends him if he has opportunity or is in pain for want of it much more should every christian be concerned when he hears that name profaned which ought not to be mentioned without reverence  nor does detraction and flattery escape a just censure though he lived and died in a court  his rules of conversation with superiors equals and inferiors are well weighed and considered as most men are free and open at meals the account he gives of his witty master king charles the second at his private suppers with some select persons men of wit is very entertaining  one general rule he lays down that should go through all the parts of conversation and that is integrity which is a virtue too seldom practiced he avoids the pedantry and motoseness of severe cynicks and though he highly commends pleasant conversation wit music and diverting tales yet he wisely cautions against picquant jests which often breed quarrels and in all these freedoms has let nothing slip from him that is contrary to the rules of good ethics  mirth thus guarded with innocence makes the cup of life go down pleasantly and leaves no stain behind it to wound the conscience he has truly said that some persons and cases are privileged from jests as mens deformity meanness of intellectuals poverty etc which puts me in mind of a gentleman whose wit lay only in ridiculing others and having a poor man that worked for him whose shape was not deformed would be often telling him he would give him five pounds to sit for his picture the man thought twas in derision would never be brought to it but gave him this sharp answer that he would give five pounds to laugh at a poor man but would not give him a shilling to buy him a dinner  which gentleman though he had then about two thousand pounds a year yet afterward lived to want a shilling to buy himself a dinner  his account of conversation with well chosen friends is very delightful and instructive i know nothing of this world comparable to the pleasures of conversation with wise honest and ingenious friends except in the consciousness of doing our duty to the most high and the relations we stand in and the peace of mind i had almost said rapture that results from thence  his advice to women as to their conversation with men is fit for all ladies to know and so it is for men that intend chastity not to be too conversant with pretty women for it is ill making gunpowder in a smiths shop  ii essay of solitariness and retirement his thoughts of retirement are very philosophical just and of great weight and the prudent and cautionary rules he gives therein of great use he writes very feelingly on that subject as what he found by experience the art of conversation and the art of retirement seem to comprehend the whole scene of humane life of both which he appears to have been a perfect master and to have given proper directions in each state and condition of life he allows the vigor of life to be spent in public services and the remainder in retirement and useful reflections for the benefit of mankind if he has carried retirement to greater heights than men attached to the world can allow it should be considered that when one is writing on a pleasure at a time when one enjoys it it is hard to keep within the bounds of moderate expressions his lofty strains nevertheless though true may not appear so to them who stand at a distance and have no taste thereof  to speak freely of this matter i think these rules touching retirement should be observed  first to have such a competent fortune as may answer all the circumstances of life when the profits of employment are quitted for to be pinched in the materials of life in old age is a miserable state especially to a generous mind  secondly to have the mind furnished with such knowledge while the life was active as may sufficiently employ it when contemplative  thirdly to have ones passions detached from the world and to have little or no thirst after it  fourthly to consecrate the latter part of life to the more intense service of god in contemplation and devotion and in benefactions to the necessitous and to endeavor to produce some fruit for the good of the public for the present and future age  more particularly i think that a retirement to a convenient house and pleasant gardens near a church where daily devotions may be had a good library a near friend and the exercise of philosophical experiments with beneficence to the needy is the safest and best retirement for a wise man these things will fill up the space of life with innocence and pleasure  iii of st mary magdalens life and conversion with some reflections on the conversion of the good thief as for the essay of mary magdalens life and conversion and of the conversion of the penitent thief he has made many curious observations thereon with very useful reflections in the authors discourse on this subject he has rather played the prelate than the gentleman and having read the fathers hereon has been a little tainted with their gingle  he has drawn it out to a length with so strong a fancy and invention that one would rather have thought to have been a man of thirty than ninety when he wrote it in the winding up however of that essay his exhortations to the love of our savior and contempt of the world have great force and energy  iv essay of the life and conversion of st paul it is a hard matter for a man that writes on a divine subject and who consults what the fathers have said thereon not to run into their style and conform to their way of expression and thus the author has done in this as well as in the preceding essay yet his remarks on the jewish customs of the manner of their education of their youth what josephus says of the sower disposition of the pharisees of which sect paul was a member of his wonderful conversion and indefatigable labor in the ministry are worthy of observation  the truth is the wonderful event of spreading the gospel by means so very improbable and in humane appearance so unlikely does manifestly show the hand of god assisted therein  v essay of nobility he has truly distinguished nobility into four parts the beginner advancer continuer and ruiner of families and has set forth the duty of a nobleman and the gracefulness of it when joined to virtue in a very agreeable manner the gaining honor by military performances he holds much preferable to what is obtained by commerce when the soldier and the scholar meet together they make a great general witness zenophon and caesar amongst the ancients and sir walter raleigh and general stanhope now secretary of state amongst the modern yet i cannot but say that when that late war between england and france shall be writ by a good hand the duke of marlborough will shine as bright in our english annals as any general either ancient or modern  the scotch have a good proverb that an ounce of mothers wit is better than a pound of clergy by clergy they mean learning  vi essay of contentment his essay of contentment under adverse fortune and the many noble examples he brings of great men in adversity and the weighty reasons he gives for a quiet submission to the divine providence in affliction are so genuine and natural that one may easily see they flow from a mind exercised by long trial in that condition the afflicted of any sort may here draw waters of consolation to give peace and rest to their minds  his arguments for contentment under afflictions are very apt to soften the passions and allay the fury which men generally exercise under that state and reduce the mind to a wise and sober resignation to the will of god he has writ in none of his essays any thing above the nature of a brave and a good man and particularly on this subject he seems rather to have vented the dictates of his own mind under the various states of life through which he had passed than offer at conjectures which he never felt he that sets a pattern above humane life may please the fancy but will never satisfy the judgment of the reader in giving rules for the conduct of humane life in the various events of it we should rather write like divines and philosophers than poets his definition of good and evil is more instructive than that of zeno or any of the stoics for he calls that good which makes a man the better and that evil which makes one the worse be that condition rich or poor great or low easy or painful  vii essay of women his description of ladies shows his observations of them to be very accurate they are beholden to him for he has said very few things of them i would give them this caution not to be too free with young gentlemen for they who will indulge to the extreme bounds of virtue will easily slip within the pale of vice so thin a partition so easy a transition there is between the one and the other the fly that buzzes about the candle often generally has her wings burnt at last the person that would avoid burning of shins must sit at some distance from the fire when nature is raised by fooleries virtue slips out of the room  viii essay as the knowledge of god and against atheism his description of the vanity of arts and sciences without the knowledge of god is a truth selfevident for all the knowledge of this world is calculated only for the meridian of this life and reaches no farther but the knowledge of god reaches to eternity and as travelers returning to their own country give a pleasant relation of things curious which they have met with in foreign parts so the knowledge we acquire and observations we make of gods moral government of this world of the revolution of states and kingdoms and of the natural production of his admirable works may serve us to entertain even angels in the kingdom of heaven for though angels excel us in wisdom power and the knowledge of some things yet their wisdom power and knowledge are circumscribed for none of these qualities are infinite but in god they are ignorant of some things omniscience is the attribute only of the most high the redemption of man in its full latitude they did not know holy writ tells us that angels were desirous to look into it and that they were informed of it by the church but be that otherwise by the study and knowledge of the divine operations of gods natural government of the world we arrive at the knowledge of god himself for his majesty is known by his works the contemplation of which brings infinite pleasure to them who delight therein  as for atheism holy writ tells us twas the fool that said in his heart there was no god and indeed nothing but a fool could have thought or said so and he had only the folly of saying it in his heart but not the impudence to express in it words surely as he that sees a fine house must conclude an ingenious artist contrived it and some person must build it for that stones and timber cannot erect themselves into a regular building without some skilful builder so he that looks on the frame of this world must acknowledge an infinite wise god that made and governs it the belief of which to a virtuous man is a mighty support in the day of trouble  ix essay of religion he has set in a true light the advantages of religion to communities in general and to private persons in particular sufficient to recommend it to the practice of the world his complaint of the ignorance of christians with respect to their religion and that they take up their religion as they do the fashion of their clothes according to the custom of the country where they live has been true till of late years even in this reformed country but the charity schools that have been erected and dispersed through all the parts of this kingdom by charitable persons and books of instruction given away by them has dispelled the gross ignorance of the common people so that now they can give a better account of their religion than people of a better education in popish countries where the darkness still continues and must do so where the reading the bible is denied the people and ignorance held to be the mother of devotion  x essay on kings and princes and the education of a prince his essay of princes and their education has such masterly strokes in it that i could wish for the good of mankind that all young princes would read and consider the same and put the excellent advice therein given into practice the good and peace of the world so much depending on the virtuous and wise disposition of the princes thereof the mighty talents which god has entrusted them with will make up a vast account for them to answer at the tremendous day of judgment which they should often think of and that would make them better than they generally are  the offenses they often give are so great and many and of so universal a nature and the miseries brought on mankind thereby so general that should they read and consider the woe denounced by our savior against those who give offense it would make the stoutest hearted prince in christendom tremble witness that prince who proudly styles himself le grand who makes war upon his neighbors french kings reasons for declaring war against the dutch in      for no other apparent reason but because he cannot dissemble his indignation against them for pretended and sham affronts without diminution of his own glory his power to conquer was the true reason disrespect the pretended  that prince who keeps an army of three or four hundred thousand men in constant pay has so many wolves in hire ready to devour mankind whenever he lets em loose and has put the rest of christendom into a necessity of keeping up standing armies to prevent being surpised and conquered by him  even in times of peace such armies corrupt and debauch a whole nation wherever they come they leave the stains of uncleanness behind them and infect the place by the bad example they give what has this prince to answer for so many millions of offenses which the soldiery of europe have given originally flowing from him  st austin calls such princes the worst of homicides in destroying the souls of their subjects  and our author tells us that kings are not to be esteemed happy by their conquests but by using their power in advancing gods honor and service which will tend to the good of their people  xi essay of man though the author has set forth the prones of man to do evil yet he has told us the cure is in our own power he meddles not with the theological points whether we can do works of our selves worthy of the divine acceptance ex congruitate or ex condignitate he speaks in this essay rather like a moralist than divine yet does very well show us the folly of running the hazard of an eternity of misery for a few moments of sensual pleasure  i am entirely satisfied that it is more easy to mortify an unlawful desire by thought and consideration joined with addresses for the divine assistance than to sat it by enjoyment he that would quench an impure desire by enjoyment is like him that would throw gunpowder into the fire to extinguish it enjoyment stops the current for the present but the next tide of blood fired from the imagination of the last enjoyment makes it boil over into a more impetuous torrent in a word man is the worst or best of creatures on this side heaven  he that gives way to his sensitive appetite and indulges therein is worse than a brute for brutes have some natural checks or instinct that confine and restrain their sensations within moderate bounds but a debauchee lets loose all his five faculties to an universal indulgence even farther than nature will afford him strength on the contrary the good man who makes reason his pilot and revelation his pole star sails through the stormy billows of this world with peace and contentment and having mens consciarecti does in a manner anticipate the joys of heaven by fixing his treasure there before hand and by a strong imagination of what is to come tastes them in this present life  xii essay of greatness of mind there are abundance of examples both ancient and modern of great men that have sacrificed their lives for the good of their country dulce est per patria mori is an old adage fame and the hope of immortal glory have carried men on to very desperate attempts and things that at first view have seemed impracticable to the cautious and wary have nevertheless by bold and resolute men been carried with success  he that sets no value on his own life has generally the life of any other man in his power but i think true greatness of mind rather consists in conquering ones self than the world fortior est qui se quam qui fortissima vincit  a man of a wildfire spirit may roam about the world with a parcel of soldiers at his heels and burn and consume half the univers which in the modern language we call a man of valor great general invincible always victorious etc and yet be the worst of men the worst of friends and all the while he is doing of mischief may be gratifying a wicked passion may wish with the tyrant that all mankind had but one neck that he might cut it off at one blow but he that considers the state and condition of life he is placed in here that he has a body that has appetites and desires strong and vigorous toward sensual objects and to enjoy them in a prohibited degree and that he has a rational nature that should steer and govern his sensitive faculties and bring them to act within bounds that there is a revealed divine law that commands him to lead a holy life on which considerations he sacrifices the desires of the body to the divine precepts and suffers afflictions with resignation to that hand from whence they come this man in my opinion is greater than caesar or pompey job had more passive valor than alexander the great but we have roman examples of mere heathens that refused the riches and honors of the world and retired to an obscure and private life witness quintus cincinnatus who was ploughing at his little farm when the senate of rome sent to him to come and appease the sedition in the city which when he had so done he returned back to his farm again and would accept no reward soon after he was sent to again to head the romans against a foreign enemy that invaded their country he went and was made dictator beat the enemy rescued his country laid down the fasces refused the lands and treasure offered him for his good services being contented with the reward only which virtue brings with it i e the pleasure of a good conscience which results from doing ones duty and returned back to his petty farm  xiii essay of children we take a great deal of care in our breed of horses and some are so curious to do the like in their dogs while at the same time there is an universal negligence in the choice of wives the greatness of the portion being the chief thing aimed at whereas a good understanding should be principally desired a silly woman especially if she be of a low and mean spirit generally bringing foolish or sheepish children there is no less carelessness in the education of children in their tender years what people attend them foolish nurses and weak women being generally the first persons they converse with after they are able to talk what idle impressions and silly ideas must such children have that are thus accosted as soon as their faculties are able to receive any impression the idle tales of such women who frighten children from crying by stories of hobgoblins spirits and such fooleries have made them when of an adult age afraid of being in the dark and of something they know not what they teach them pride and to value themselves upon their clothes by asking and showing them where they are fine which folly accompanies the female sex usually to their grave nor are foppish men free from that vanity  they teach them revenge and folly at the same time by pretending to beat another by a blow or pat from the hand of the child  they teach them lying and folly by telling miss twas not she that cried but one behind the curtain thus taught comes the abused infant on the stage of the world whereas the most discreet and prudent people should be attendant on children to make proper impressions upon them at first for these stick longest with them as for the more riper years the author has spoke so fully that i shall add no more  xiv essay of law the benefit of laws and living by rules are so evident to every understanding that there needs but little to be said in commendation thereof  there is scarce any nation under heaven however despotick and absolute the prince is but yet has some certain rule or law for the general conduct of humane life with respect to the public yet when the prince is absolute the subject is little better than a slave law being but a cobweb to him which he can easily break through whenever he pleases that the people conform their lives after the example of the prince and chief magistrate where they reside the author has very justly observed which ought to be a lesson to all princes and magistrates to act with great caution that their bad example may not lead the common people or those of a common understanding into vices regis ad exemplum totus componitur orbis and here i cannot but say a word of the benefit of our english laws which both foreigners that live here and natives have great reason to be thankful to providence for the laws of england secure every mans property and liberty no man forfeits either but by the transgression of some known positive law the magistrate cannot commit any subject to prison without a breach of the laws if he does he is answerable for it to the party injured the judge determines not according to arbitrary power but according to known and stated rules but this subject has been so much spoken of that i think it not necessary to say any more thereon  xv essay of old age as no man writes more feelingly of afflictions than he who gives his thoughts a vent under that condition so no man can write so truly of the circumstances of old age as he that keeps his understanding well to an hundred the which the author did as appears by his essays some of which were writ at near that age  the respect he challenges as due to old age especially when furnished with wisdom and knowledge and the consideration of good services done to the public is a tribute that i think ought not to be denied it but nothing can make the mind of an old man more calm and sedate more bright and shining than a retrospect of a long life well spent in a zealous promoting the honor of god and the good and welfare of mankind for every mans life is to be estimated by its usefulness integrity of mind a love of truth in the soul and the consciousness of doing all we can for our most munificent benefactor to whom we are riding post in old age makes that scene of life full of joy and pleasure st paul was full of rapture when he was going off the stage of life though by a violent death but few courtiers come within this character for to them generally falsehood and deceit are as natural as bowing and cringing and as for truth it has no place in their souls they join themselves to a party that they may mount up to be the head of it with no other view but to betray and destroy it and to aggrandize themselves thereby oh blessed sincerity oh happy integrity but this wicked state of life is as ancient as seneca the tragedian witness these lines colit hic reges calcet ut omnes perdatque aliquos nullumque levet tantum ut noceat cupit esse potens   whitlock bulstrode

yet he was not made to be entirely detached and to live independent of his kind for though he had nothing in prospect but plenty pleasure innocence and security and by the dignity of his nature was set above the society of mere animals yet god saw his being imperfect without a helper and that his happiness was not complete whilst he remained solitary wherefore god miraculously relieved him by dividing him to unite him and made one part of him a companion for the other to maintain his reason with a more equal converse for which end god ordained speech from whence we derive all the advantages of society and without which men would have been useless to each other for by this we possess the most valuable worldly blessings friendship and society which are esteemed amongst the pleasures of the first magnitude the comfort of life depending upon conversation humane society being like the working of a archstone where all would fall to the ground if one piece did not sustain another and yet company is so dangerous and speech so liable to be depraved that what was intended for our advantage is become the source of all our misfortunes for original sin came first out of the mouth by speaking before it entered hers by eating and therefore the due management of that member may justly be reputed one of the greatest mysteries of wisdom and virtue since we find to our sorrow the first use eve made of her tongue was to talk with the tempter and from that discourse to tempt adam who was no sooner fallen but he makes a frivolous excuse less able to cover his sin than the fig leaves his nakedness and this viciousness of the tongue has descended from the infancy of the world even to this day for amongst our greatest depravations there are none more notorious than that of speech for we do not only fall by the slipperiness of our tongues but we deliberately train them to mischief and what was first intended for the benefit of humane society is now become the great disturber of it we living in an age wherein we count it a part of our birthright to let loose our tongues and to use the spur where we should hold the bridle whereby conversation is generally corrupted and he that converses has almost as many snares as companions there being scarce any single man but by his discourse example or behavior does recommend to us or imprint in us or by a kind of contagion insensibly infect us with some vice or other so that conversation which was intended to cultivate our minds and civilize the world has turned it almost to a wilderness upon this account some men will take a pett at mankind and walk into the deserts to avoid company when it is more prudential to stand their ground and to fence against the inconveniences that may happen and if they fear bad company they should keep close to men of virtue and stand carefully upon their guard it being more reasonable to be conversable for the sake of the good than to fly from every mortal for fear of meeting with bad people if every man were possessed with this shiness not only states and kingdoms but even humane nature would be destroyed for to what end was speech given to man if it were not for entertainment of each other and must we quit our station and turn savage by our selves and suffer no company for fear of bad this is to take things by the wrong handle for nothing but our own miscarriages ought to affect us and not those of other people  it is certain that all mens bodies are naturally of the same clay the difference of education only is the potters hand that forms them into vessels of honor or dishonor there being no humane means more effectual toward ripening and sharpning mens intellects giving them an edge and quickness for conversation than good education because it takes them in that age wherein their faculties are as their joints pliable and tractable and so capable of being by exercise improved into great degrees of strength activity and ability so that one of the greatest blessings which man can receive at gods hands is the favorable blessing of good education which polishes and purifies nature as one would do a precious stone wholly defiled with earth and this makes men become like angels when without it the best natures would still dwell in brutishness now since after good education it is a great part of wisdom as well as breeding to learn what is convenient and to take the true height of our acquaintance who conversing with our minds cast upon them either graces or deformities it will therefore be highly necessary for young gentlemen who are tender of their honor and credit to be more than ordinarily careful of being too venturous of any company and to be very curious in taking an exact survey with what persons they may safely and decently converse and how they ought to behave themselves therein  it is usual with physicians in infectious times to forbid most strictly the smaller excesses and exorbitances of diet as apt to breed any distemper because every small accident of that kind through the malignity of the air is then likely to turn into the plague so now that atheism and profaneness are rife in the world and spread much and debauchery is so predominant and contagious that we daily see many men of virtuous dispositions and good inclinations which would have grown to abilities to be by ill company most perniciously corrupted some cautions herein seem therefore highly necessary for as if we breath in an infectious air we shall suck in diseases so if we live in bad company we shall soon add to their number and learn their vices and imperfections  there is nothing more dangerous for young gentlemen than to mistake themselves in the choice of their company this is a point of such importance that upon it depends the whole course of their lives and manners the frequenting with wicked men brings us acquainted with vice makes us behold it without emotion by degrees we begin to act it with some pleasure and time breeds in us a habit  principiis obsta sero medicina paratur cum mala per longas invaluere moras st augustine well expresses the danger of this saying it is a nail driven into a post with a hammer which after the first and second stroke may be drawn out with little difficulty but being once driven up to the head the pincers can take no hold to draw it out which cannot be done but by destruction of the wood  he that lives in this great theater of the world should in the first place learn how to suit himself into sundry habits that he may be enabled in this comedy to represent many persons no man being fit to appear upon this stage till he knows how to act his part to the life and therefore he must labor to have his mind made pliable which may stoop and rise according to the several conditions and capacities of men he associates with not fearing to speak to the greatest with due observance nor disdaining to converse familiarly with the meanest respecting goodness wherever he sees it which he shall as often find under a russet coat as under a velvet cassock and with moral honest men as soon as with the more learned for conversation has made very accomplished persons without the assistance of learning the world being a great book which instructs continually conversations are living libraries not at all inferior to books good conferences are like flints which from a cold and dark heap produce heat and light if men strike them one against the other and the familiar discourses of two or three good wits may be more advantageous to us than the empty disputations of many pedants together and they vent more in one hour than we shall read all day in a library  there is nothing that puts better thoughts in a man than a good companion for example has the force of precept and touches the heart with an affection to goodness and not only the frequent hearing but the very seeing of a wise man delights us  the best rule herein is to associate with those who may be the better for us and we for them these respects are mutual for while we teach we learn it is not safe to trust our selves with much company whosoever goes much abroad he scarce comes home the same man he went out something or other discomposes him for it is with our minds as it is after a long indisposition with our bodies we are grown so tender that the least breath of air exposes us to a relapse  there is certainly much pleasure and satisfaction in communicating our thoughts and in the intercourses of friendship well chosen and therefore seneca said if knowledge and wisdom were offered him on the terms of a secret and that he must not speak of it he would positively refuse the present and tully in his offices tells us if a person had all the blessings of this life yet if he was kept from all company and never to see or converse with men he had much rather die than live in such condition  now the first step to conversation is our outward carriage and comportment wherein the less we are constrained our actions and thoughts seem thereby more innocent the differences of men are easily read in their behavior and a short observation of that will often tell us as much as a long conference some mens carriage is like a verse where every syllable is measured but where there is so much care about the outside there is commonly a remisness in what belongs to the mind it being as rare to see starched complimental man wise as to see a woman valiant there is a sort of men who have an earnest application to make every thing sit right about them which strikes too deep into their small stock of thoughts to allow it furniture for any thing else and therefore to do right to these finespun gentlemen conversation is too course a thing for them and it is best to leave them to their tailor with whom they will live in better correspondence than with any other company indeed a good presence and handsome mein sorted with valor and wisdom does a man excellent service if he spoils it not with affectation and carries with it as queen elizabeth used to say letters or recommendation and if i am rightly informed this was the only thing that brought the great duke of buckingham into favor with king james i by seeing him at a masque in court certainly if our outward comportment be good the adorning the mind does double that excellency if ill it will make it good when the mind performs what the body promises not our behavior should be like a wellmade suit of clothes more proper than gaudy more fit than fine in our outward carriage all manner of affectation is unseemly there being nothing more becoming a gentleman than a native freedom therein a gracefulness of behavior setting off much when it is not constrained dancing is good and adds grace to a man when he well performs it but a man must not set himself to it as if he made it his trade dancing makes the body free and not so stiff but to move gracefully and a mans skill is therein perceived though he stands still but whoever intends to make it his masterpeice one may call it excelling in a mistake which is no good commendation as a late great lord said it is a great advantage to be a good actor for action is a kind of expression and words well chosen are agreeable when they express things that please so all that is expressed by the face and body is well received when done with a good grace but we must not here mistake for there are those that are sometimes actors of nothing as well as those that are speakers of nothing the action and air of the countenance have certain charms which have a great influence on our minds an oration spoken by a good orator appears great and lofty though penned in common terms and compounded of ordinary conceptions and many preachers have in their pulpits charmed their auditors whose sermons in print were scarce worth reading i have heard verses recited in a good tone which have been admired which being read by another their esteem was much diminished and it is probable the reason of this alteration proceeded from the harmony which was then wanting we should not look upon this as strange of good orations and agreeable conferences if we call to mind that of musical instruments touched by the hands of an exquisite master there are some tones which inspire sadness and sweetly incline our souls to languish and there are airs which rejoice and make our hearts merry and pleasingly compel our feet to dance their time  in conversation it is not enough to have wit but he must be an extreme wellbred man to know how to be pleasant in conversation amongst persons that know how to judge because most men have not a delicate taste nor are able to discern what is best and it often happens that such persons are taken nay even charmed with certain ridiculous parts they play to them but though these fooleries are current amongst some yet wellbred persons do not love such kind of buffoonry and those that use them are rather the subjects of scorn than laughter to those that rightly understand such are halfwitted men who have a tinsel wit which shines amongst those who cannot judge petty merchants of small conceits who have an empty habit of prating without meaning they always aim at wit but generally make false fire  it is true we cannot show too much wit in pleasant conversation yet a man must have a great care not to show himself too forward as if one would appear ready to make jests and speak fine things there is something of a free way which cannot be well expressed which has a much better effect but yet it is not good to be too reserved nor affect singularity an open and complaisant carriage has very great charms to attract love however what advantage soever any one has he must be pleased with others if he would have others pleased with him and if we like not our company let us withdraw from them but whilst we are in company we should carry our selves so that we should be acceptable to those with whom we converse though we have no kindness for them as for those who think to revenge themselves by a cross carriage they do themselves more injury than they do to others the love of society is natural but the choice of our company is matter of prudence and the conscience of giving good example is one of the greatest obligations any man can lay upon the age he lives in  it is indeed a fair step toward happiness and virtue to delight in the conversation of good and wise men and where those cannot be had it is best to keep no company at all when men are good and virtuous they are as good alone as in company but most men are of themselves the worst company they can keep let such therefore converse with others and avoid themselves but he that cannot secure himself in privacy shall be much more exposed in public many a ship is lost in the harbor but more in the ocean there are some persons whose company we cannot too much frequent it is certain by seeing them often besides the improvement we have by being with them we gain a good esteem to our selves as we perfume our selves unawares by walking amongst the jessamins and orange trees witty men who are wellbred always say something that pleases and seldom do any thing which has not some mark of worth and breeding and by conversing with and observing them we may not only inform our selves of such things as are necessary to be known for the making an accomplished man but we also learn how to apply them and likewise so far as to know when it is proper and mannerly to be silent but we must know how to distinguish for we shall often hear very good things come from men who behave themselves with as much becomingness as can be disired yet many times this is but borrowed language and the actings of a part and therefore we must not regard so much that which appears polite and regular as we do certain other things which show whether there be a foundation and that the understanding goes farther and is of larger extent  we find in some men a certain plausibleness of carriage which pleases in young people but yet passes away like a flower or a dream and we shall often see these men become the neglect and scorn of those who once admired them but a wellbred man has more solid virtues though he be less busy and forward to show himself in the world and if we love a man for his good breeding and honesty we shall always love him yet it is not enough to have a fair outside to make a man agreeable that which is of greatest importance is the will regulating our intellectuals and taking care that our head and our heart be in good order for no man can ever be excellent without having a good heart and much wit  an accomplished person though of never so much wit ought not to be too confident of himself for the more he excels the more care he ought to take not to prescribe to the company for naturally every man is afraid of a master wit and men do not love to be hectored out of their opinions it being esteemed the common birthright of mankind that every man to opine and judge according to the dictates of his own understanding and not of anothers and therefore a magisterialness in opinion is very unbefitting men in conversation for it does not only fasten upon our nature but upon the better part of it our reason freedom is the endearing thing in society and where that is controlled men are not very fond of associating themselves it is natural for us to be uneasy in the presence of those that assume an authority over us as children care not for the company of their parents or tutors that govern them and men will care less for theirs who would make them children by usurping a tutorage over them this peremptoriness in conversation renders wise men disobliging and very troublesome and fools ridiculous and contemptible we seeing none so peremptory as halfwitted people who have just enough to excite their pride but not so much as to cure their ignorance this is the effect of a mean and imprudent education a man who has converst only with the lower sort of company who durst not dispute nor examine his assertions thinks the same false coin will pass over the world which went current amongst his petty comerades and we may observe this fault is most usual amongst young men who have come raw into company with good fortunes and ill breeding and therefore those persons are most to be esteemed who show their wit without offending any one and such are usually hated who make use of wit only to the displeasing of others and a wise man ought to avoid the company of such it being a small advantage to have wit if we do not make use of it for gaining the good opinion and love of the world we ought to deal with others with that patience respect and moderation which we expect from them not setting forth our own opinions imperiously nor rejecting the opinion of others arrogantly remembering that we are all enwrapped in a deep mist and that all our reasoning is but groping in the dark and therefore we should pass gently over the errors of our neighbors to oblige them to the like account but many gentlemen are so far from this generous humor that they always behave themselves disdainfully in company as if they could not set a just value upon themselves without the utjust contempt of others but this pride is commonly a wind that blows only one way down hill upon those below him upwards they breath gentler gales it being one of their most studied faculties to perform all acts of the highest supererrogating civility to those above them now there is nothing that makes a man more distasteful to company than this haughty humor it being not only pride but inhumanity to attribute so much to the prerogative of birth as not to show affability and respect to the meanest  the conversation of those who are bred in armies is not commonly very pleasing but in recompense they are said to be men of honor and reputation as if that would excuse their wants in every thing else when there is nothing so disgusting as to be disagreeable and morose in company this is like certain women that pretend to virtue who value themselves much upon their being coy and fierce which makes men think all is counterfeit and affected and that they are easier gotten than those who observe good manners and breeding and are as affable as these are severe such women are like those peevish mistresses who think they have a license to kick and scratch provided they do not kiss as if ladies could not be honest without being rude a confident yet a modest carriage which is neither mean nor sullen having nothing which savours not of goodness and honesty is that which is most esteemed in the world and takes with every body women who have most wit like best a discreet reservedness in men those being usually disappointed of their aims who throw as it were their hearts at ladies heads and at the first dash tell them more of their love than can in any probability be true and many times more than they desire to hear  in our conversation it is good advice to spare and thriftily to order that which a man knows and though he has that in his head which is better than silence yet he ought to be more willing to hear than to speak to learn than to teach it being a great folly to be more ready to show all that is in us rather than to learn knowledge of another to spend our own stock rather than to get new when we hear we receive when we speak we give and though it be more glorious to give yet it is more profitable to receive and therefore a just moderation herein is best not to be oversilent nor talkative the first showing stupidity or scorn the last giddiness of the brain prudent men will therefore speak no more than to bring on discourse and will give others their turns of speech a civil guest will no more talk all than eat all the feast it is a great advantage to know how to speak and to write when either smells too much of study it pleases not the general opinion is that men should write as they speak and speak as they write but we seldom do either as we wish we could in order to this it were good when we write to imagine we are speaking that we may not put in any thing that is not natural or which may not be spoken in company and when we speak we should fancy we are writing that we may not say any thing that is not fitting many people are said to speak well who cannot write well but i doubt there is a mistake herein for some men may seem to speak well in appearance when they do not in effect for when a man really excels in speaking he may do the same in writing but this latter requires more care and one may write well without knowing how to speak well for we usually see those who make it their business to write well have commonly a languishing way of speaking for to speak well is not only to make our thoughts be understood but to express our apprehensions which are two very different things and there is no greater sign that a man well understands himself than to be able perspicuously to speak to the understanding of another and our discourse should always be measured by the aptness of it to whom it is addressed for unless our speech be fitted to the capacities of those we discourse with though it be never so elaborate it will rather confound than edify  thus the best art of speaking shows it self under a natural dress it is like plain natural beauty those that are the most perfect show themselves least and when our words smell of art and study one may conclude they that say them have but little of either or else that they know not how to make use of them this is the fault of those that speak so that they cannot be understood but by the learned we should therefore to our power rather mean wisely than speak learnedly much less affectedly for those whose tongues run proud after words are of very little use but amongst such ears as call a bagpipe music for their lips open like a purse without money and their tongues like a fencer before a pageant stir but not strike a gentleman should talk like a gentleman that is like a wise man his knowledge ought to be general he should have a taste of every thing he should not be a slave to one science one knowledge is but part of the house like a bay window no man will build his house so maimed much less himself he must be complete  all those who have given rules for civil life have in order to it put very severe restrictions upon the tongue that it run not before the judgment twas zenos advice to dip the tongue in the mind before one should speak and theophrastus was used to say it was safer trusting to an unbridled horse than to intemperate speech and daily experience confirms this aphorism for those who set no guard upon their tongues are hurried by them into a thousand indecencies and very often into real considerable mischiefs and whereas men should keep a lock upon their lips they give their tongue the key of their heart and the event has been often as unhappy as the proceeding was preposterous  and as our words must be the product of our judgment so they must be temperate and decent mixed with courtesy and civility for he that has calmed his passions has nothing to betray them to rash and rude language which is a foam cast up only by the billows of a turbulent mind and can never be the issues of a serene composed temper neither does any thing charm us more than gracious language quae ne illos quidem quos damnat offendit a pregnant example of which was seen in the last age at the trial of the earl of strafford lord lieutenant of ireland in the year      where amongst others that were appointed by the house of commons to manage their impeachment against him there was one eminent lawyer who urged very smartly against his lordship but yet with great respect and civility of language and when the earl came to reply as he did to every one he said he had been very roughly handled by most of the pleaders but that he was very much beholding to one civil gentleman amongst them naming the former person who though he had touched him nearer the quick than any other yet he was obliged to return him thanks because he had cut his throat with a clean knife thus we see good words are afforded at the same price as ill and are not only cheap but prevalent upon all occasions  next to this graciousness of language we should be very careful that our speeches carry integrity with them candor and ingenuity being most esteemed in discourse those who have upright hearts their judgment how small soever will be still the same but those who have many turnings and doubles in their heart never have a right understanding there is always some counterfeit light which gives them false appearances and then their artifices and craft show they have not parts sufficient to effect their designs by fair and honest ways whereas the way that pleases worthy persons is that freedom of plaindealing what a gracefulness so clear a source gives to all the actions of our life how it beautifies our words and thoughts and how pleasing a thing it is to speak well when so much sincerity goes along with it and though one may not perhaps be happy in all things by following this maxim however one is sure at least to gain the esteem and affection of those who understand true merit nothing being so commendable in conversation as to have an upright and sincere heart which seems to be the foundation of wisdom  speech was given to man as the image and interpreter of the soul it is anime index and speculum the messenger of the heart the gate by which all that is within issues forth and comes into open veiw and therefore the philosopher said well to the child loquere ut te videam speak that i may see thee that is the inside of thee for as vessels are known whether they be broken or whole by their inward sound so is man from his speech which carries with it not only a great influence but a great discovery of our minds and integrity herein is the public faith of mankind with all sorts of men we should deal ingeniously yet reservedly saying what we think but thinking more than we say it being not good to say at all times all that the heart thinks though all that the heart thinks be good freedom of speech is sometimes to be foreborn least we give others power thereby to lay hold on the rudder of our minds for in all there are some places weaker than others and prudent men will take heed of lying uncovered that way it is true there may be possibly in discourse a fault of omission but this is a right hand error a man may be sometimes sorry he said no more but very often that he said so much god has given us two ears and one mouth that we ought to hear more than to speak we have no earlids to keep us from hearing and often must hear against our will but our mouth shuts naturally and we may keep our tongue from speaking unless by intemperance we lose that privilege of nature  the truth is our tongue is so slippery that is easily deceives a heedless guard nature has given it some unhappy advantages toward it it being the most ready for motion of any member and therefore is to be the more carefully managed the chiefest rules to be prescribed herein are sufficiency and pertinency a man should not only know what to say but what not to say for in speech enough is better than all words are but the lacquies of reason of which to send more than will perform the business is superfluous and the discretion in speaking is not so much in speaking few words as in speaking none impertinent otherwise the dumb were born with great advantage if we must retrench the use of the tongue instead of moderating it  a wise mans words must be weighty and material they are weighed in the balance says the son of syrach and therefore a gentlemans discourse should be such as might answer that character no man ever attempting to put froth and bubbles into the scales  when zeno heard a young man full of talk aures inquit in linguam defluxere he said his ears were fallen into his tongue intimating thereby that they should hear much and speak little the truth is when people are very young they cannot judge rightly of any thing and it happens either by experience reflections or meeting with some intelligent persons they come to be of another mind and despise that which they once so much admired and many times laugh at themselves when they examine themselves without flattery it is certain he that always talks adventures himself too far thereby depriving himself of observation which is the great advantage of society and from whence comes experience and wisdom herein we should imitate cunning shopkeepers who show their wares in a half light upon occasion we should speak but sparingly and rather starve than surfeit our auditors our discourses must not be too florid in the beginning it is a thing much to be wished that all which one says be good and fine according as the subject merits but we must proceed by degrees nature is in this as in all other things a very knowing mistress consider how she proceeds insensibly the fairest day when it begins to break and appear has so little light that it is hardly discernable whether it be day or night and nothing is so great a sign that the way of speaking is noble as when it leaves some certain things to be apprehended without speaking them and therefore it is good to know when to give over and to proceed to other matters or at least we should give them another face and turn because diverversity seems not tedious  to make our selves be heard with pleasure we must say such things as others will be glad to hear and say them pleasantly which is the best way to make us be beloved besides when we please others well we are likewise better pleased with our selves excellent painters never draw all they still allow something for you to exercise your own imagination and always leave you more to find out than they discover the graces appear very rarely and even when they are seen they will not be considered full faced nor uncovered in the same manner we should not open our selves too much and in our discourses we should observe this as a general rule either to speak fitly or to be silent wisely for many by their silence may pass for wise men whom speech would presently discover otherwise when the ass disguised himself in the lyons skin he frighted all the beasts and even the cunning fox till he heard him bray pro certo scias nisi rudentem audivissem and te ego timuessem unlearned men which seem of ability to strangers are quickly discovered by their loquacity and those that speak much in company seldom speak well for they that well understand themselves know not how to dwell in talk long discourses says plutarch like overfeatherd arrows shoot beyond the mark and by wearying the attention ordinarily lose both game and labor aristotle answered a man well who having held him in a long discourse in the end begged his excuse telling him he might have saved his apology for he had not minded what he said and it was a smart reply of theocritus to an ill poet repeating many of his verses and asking which he liked best answered those which he had omitted and indeed the company of such who talk much to little purpose ought as little to be regarded for if a man be vain and trifling in his discourses both he that hears and he that answers will be equal losers of their time and if we shut our ears to trifling discourses much more carefully ought we to keep our hearts from drawing in the breath of obscene discourses which are the very pest of conversation we should herein imitate xenocrates the philosopher who being asked an obscene question and giving no answer being again importuned to answer said well de tali re te hominem vanum interrogare decet me autem respondere nequaquam obscene speeches like oil falling upon linen will spread much and as the poison of the body enters by the mouth so the poison of the heart enters by the ear and therefore those who have honesty in their hearts will have only civil and modest words in their mouths  next to modesty in our conversation we must be careful not to be too inquisitive into other mens affairs and if we would be persuaded to affect a wholesome ignorance therein it would much conduce to our ease and innocence for it is the itch of the ear that breaks out at the tongue and were not curiosity the purveyor this trade would soon be set aside the boy in plutarch being asked what he carried hid under his cloak answered well that he therefore carried it so that the other might not know it an unseasonable inquiry into things shows a great weakness and folly in the inquiror  when socrates was asked by a curious person what was done in the next world he told him he had never been there nor spoken with any that came from thence st augustine tells us curiosus est qui ea avide scrutatur quae ad se non pertinent studiosus vero qui diligenter ea perquirit quae ad se attinent  we shall see some men very inquisitive into the religion of their acquaintance being very shy of discoursing with men of differing persuasions and put on an angry zeal against them believing they are fighting god almightys quarrel and therefore grow into a hardened severity against all who dissent from them and we shall frequently see men whose manners and conditions are very conformable in all the necessary obligations of human society to avoid each others company and grow unsociable to each other merely because the one cannot think as the other does whereas our opinions come from our heads our affections from our hearts and therefore a wise man will no more trouble himself about his companions religion than about the religion of his physician or lawyer the offices of friendship which one man owes to another having nothing to do with that consideration and men do not so much question whether their servants be virtuous as whether they be diligent which is the thing for which they make use of them but yet this is a pernicious error for men to think themselves no otherwise concerned in their servants than they are in their horses and oxen to look upon them only as another species of working cattle and so they do their business care not how arrant brutes they be whereas gentlemen should consider that they with themselves are common servants to one great master and that the subjection of one to the other is but the wise economy of their lord who has made the one as stewards or supervisors to regulate the rest and then it will appear a great unfaithfulness to neglect this charge for though they receive wages they are not below their care nature having made no such distinction and returns of kindness and good usage are as much their due to such of them as deserve it as their service is due to their masters when they require it but leaving this digression there are others so far from this niceness that in their discourses they despise and mock at religion because they would not be under the restraints of it religion is against them and therefore they set themselves against religion and it is observable that those who upon other subjects their best friends must needs acknowledge to be sufficiently dull yet can talk very wittily in derogation of religion with some kind of salt and smartness and because religion frets them it makes them wynch and fling and gives them some kind of wit and sharpness in rallying against it these are persons that never say any thing well but what is ill to say and therefore we must be very careful to distinguish between what exacts the title of wit from our judgments and that which appears but such to our corruptions this profane liberty is too much used in our nation and has crossed those seas which environ england which is not so happily severed from the worlds vices as from its continent but i wonder how such men should have the fortune to be esteemed wits only for jesting out of the common road and for making bold to scoff at those things which ought to be reverenced of all mankind but we are fallen into such a profane and skeptical an age as takes a pleasure and pride in unravelling almost all the received principles of religion  however we must not think the worse of religion because some men are so bold as to despise and deride it for it is no disparagement for any person or thing to be laughed at but to deserve to be so there being nothing so excellent but a man may find ways to traduce it and therefore we ought not to have the less reverence for the principles of religion because idle and profane persons can break jests upon them for a little wit with a great deal of ill nature will easily furnish a man for satyr there being nothing so sacred which by the petulancy of wit may not be made ridiculous and those buffoons which do so spare neither their souls nor reputation to show their abilities by profane more than ingenious sallies but it were happy if men would use a nobler exercise for their wits than to persist in their scoffing humor which is not only an enemy to religion but to every thing else that is worthy and yet we shall see some men so profane as to make use of scripture phrases to give a relish to their most insipid discourses and were it not for this magazine a great many mens raillery would want supplies and they would be very mute without this topic in our conversation we should carefully avoid the customary sin of swearing which has none of those allurements which other sins have such men play the platonic to damnation and the great wonder is that we see none who own god more in their oaths than those that disown him in their lives a great absurdity of wickedness to have a god to swear by none to believe in none to pray to there is indeed such a deluge of impiety and profaneness at this day overflowing our afflicted nation that it has brought down most terrible judgments upon it wickedness is now become the mode and fashion amongst them so that men there begin now to fear the singularity of being innocent and a man may with less scorn appear there in the antiquated habit of our forefathers than to own the obsolete and condemned qualities of true piety loyalty duty and sobriety and what temptation is it to the vulgar to be wicked when their superiors have beaten the path before them when gentlemen are atheistical clowns will think themselves very modestly wicked if they be but profane and when they hear their betters swear they will soon find they are as well qualified for that part of greatness as the best it were very happy for our nation if those seducers of the people would sound a retreat to their misled followers and would teach them religion obedience and submission as they have formerly led them to impiety and disobedience  but to return to our intended discourse gentlemen in their conversation ought never to reveal secrets our eyes tongues and looks are the windows and doors of our hearts we should therefore be cautious to keep every thing from breaking out which may be safelier hid than revealed the wits of futilous persons are like the vessels of the danaides that emptied as fast as they filled that which comes in at the ear goes presently out at the mouth because indiscretion which directs to hearken as lightly as to speak lets fly out as easily as lets in and disperses as soon as collects these publish what they know only that they may be telling of news an itch wherewith their tongues are strangely overrun who can as well hold a glowing coal in their mouths as keep any thing secret which they think new which is a most childish vanity and men must have souls of a very low level that can think this a fit entertainment these men not having usually depth enough to supply themselves out of their own store can therefore let nothing pass by them no more than a mill which is always going cannot afford any water to run waste now these men are more impertinent and not less injurious than the most malicious anacreon who was choked with a grapestone died as surely as julius caesar with his three and twenty wounds and a mans reputation is as soon fooled and prated away as maliciously betrayed nay perhaps more easily for where the speaker can least be suspected of design the hearer is the apter to give him credit and this way of insinuating is like those poisons taken in at the pores which are most insensibly sucked in and the most difficult to expel these men are so perpetually busy and continually employed in finding faults with others that they cannot look toward themselves and whilst they put false dresses and varnishes to hide their own deformity they cannot allow the least imperfection of anothers to remain undetected if these men would look into their own hearts they would find such work for their inquisitions and censure that they should not be at leisure to ramble abroad for it now such as busy themselves with tales of their neighbors and entertain company with them furnish their wits as young girls do their closets with shells and gewgaws and since they bestow their time so ill they should study the anatomy of flies and to punish their bodies as well as their minds they should live only upon shrimps wherein there is more business than meat it is indeed a gross error to think so we speak in truth we may declare any mans faults for we must as well speak in charity as truth and yet many men will slide easily into detraction thinking it no great matter not considering the smallest sins are the devils greatest stratagems and if satan fetter us it is indifferent to him whether it be by a cable or by a hair st augustine therefore who was sensible of the commonness of this vice had this following distick written over his table quisquis amat dictis absentum rodere vitam hanc mensam vetitam noverit esse sibi the truth is we should never in our discourses make absent persons the subject of our mirth those freedoms which we use to a mans face are commonly more moderate and equitable because we expose our selves to the like from him but backblows are disingenious showing we intend not a fair trial of wit but a cowardly murder of a mans fame but some men think their wits to be asleep if they dart not out something that is piquant and pierces to the quick but this vein ought to be bridled parce puer stimulis and fortius utere loris there is great difference between saltness and bitterness and no weapon cuts so deep as a reproachful word neither is any wound longer in curing and those jeers are most resented which touch a mans reputation chiefly that of wit and discretion of which even fools seem wary and few will confess their ignorance the reproaches of wit are like the corrodings of aqua fortis they ingrave and indent characters that can never be defaced a dull reproach quickly vanishes no person thinking it worth remembering but when it is steeled with wit it pierces deep leaving such impressions in the fancies of the hearers that it sometimes happens to survive both speaker and hearer and carries it self to posterity many a poor mans infirmities had been confined within a narrow compass had not some picquant strain of drollery scattered and dispersed them and therefore those who rejoice in point of reflection upon each other that love to disparage and backbite their fellow creatures and gratify their proud and haughty humor in derision of others should read those excellent verses which to this purpose st prosper gives us in this following epigram culpare in quoquam quae non sunt nota malignum est praesertim quae sunt cognita si bona sunt non pateant faciles saevis rumoribus aures quae nescire juvat credere non libeat linquantur secreta deo qui si quid opertum est inspicit and nullis indiget indiciis   defamation is certainly one of the most unkind designs that one man can have upon another every man being naturally tender of his reputation which yields a perfume even after death and a mans reputation can hardly be tossed without receiving some bruise the heavy scandals under which some men have lain having taken their rise only from some inadvertence or indiscretion and even doubtful accusations leave a stain behind them and often prove indelible injuries to the party accused and as in the case of stealing it is proverbially said if there were no receivers there would be no thieves so in this of slander if there were fewer spreaders there would be fewer forgers of libels the manufacture would be discouraged if it had not these retailers to put off the wares a man may sometimes do things which to god and his own conscience are abominable and yet keep his reputation with men but when his secret crimes are detected then he becomes infamous so that though his own sin be the material cause yet the discovery is the formal cause of his infamy and he that has divulged his fault stands accountable for all the consequences that flow from that divulging  some men are maliciously apt to run down the reputation of any that stand in their way either of pleasure or preferment when josephs chastity had changed the scene of potiphars wifes passion she presently fixes the crime upon him so when ziba had a mind to undermine mephiboseth in his estate he first practices upon his fame in a false accusation and how often have we seen in our time these scenes reacted and though many men have been wicked enough to commit this crime yet none have been so impudent as to avow it all crimes have had their abettors only this sort of impudent and lying slander is so much the dregs and refuse of wicked men that none have yet had chemistry enough to sublimate it and to bring it into such a reputation that any man would think fit to own it till our last infamous age of insulting vice where this wickedness has not only been admitted into practice but appears also barefaced which did always before keep on the vizard for no man had ever the confidence before to own himself a false accuser of his brethren till that most wicked age which has not only permitted but encouraged and rewarded men for being false accusers to the eternal reproach of our nation and of them that suffered it  next to avoiding the conversation of these forementioned we should be cautious of conversing with such who censure and judge severely of other mens actions which is one of the highest violations of charity and a good man will never make severe constructions but set every thing in the fairest light and put upon it the most candid interpretation that the matter will bear which is of great importance to the reputation of our neighbor for he that gives the first ill character of a man fixes the stamp which ever after goes current in the world it being the business of many to lay on more load but of few to take it off for most people lessen their own beam into a moat and magnify their neighbors moat into a beam they turn the reverse end of the perspective to represent their own faults small and at a distance and shuffle the other end to their neighbor to make theirs seem great now such as make bitter invectives against other mens faults and indulge and palliate their own show their zeal lies in their spleen and consider not so much what is done as who does it a man that affects an extraordinary splendour of reputation is glad to find any foiles to set him off and will therefore let no fault nor folly of another enjoy the shade but bring it into open light that by such comparison his own excellencies may appear the brighter but this shows a degenerous spirit and because he wants solid worth on which to bottom his reputation he is feign to found it on the ruins of other mens diamonds sparkle in the sunshine it is but a glowworm virtue that owes his luster to the darkness about it tacitus gives it as an ill inclination of domitian the emperors temper that he employed himself in catching and tormenting flies and that he turned his scepter into a flyflap and was therefore justly esteemed an enemy to flies and a fly to his enemies and truly they fall not under a much better character either for wisdom or good nature who snatch up all the fluttering reports they can meet with to the prejudice of their neighbor  whosoever has a tender side the world will be sure to find it and to put the worst color on all that man says or does give an aggravation to every thing that may lessen him and a spightful turn to every thing that may recommend him but that wit is much misemployd that is wholly directed to discern the faults of others when it is necessary to be used to mend and prevent his own when we do not frequently turn our eyes inward to see what is amiss within us it is a sign we have an unwelcome prospect at home when we care not to look upon it but rather seek our own consolation in the faults of those we converse with  indeed some mens tempers are so malign that they wish ill to all and believe ill of all men like timon the athenian who professed himself an universal manhater it is certain there are some in whose ears nothing sounds so harsh as the commendation of another and nothing so melodious to them as a defamation plutarch gives an apt instance of this upon aristidess banishment when a mean person had proposed ostracisme being asked what displeasure aristides had done he replied none and that he knew him not but that it grieved him to the heart to hear every one call him a just man i verily believe some of our keenest accusers in these days might give the same answer for no man that is eminent either for piety loyalty or moral virtue but he shall have many invidious eyes upon him watching for his halting and if any the least obliquity be espied he is used worse than the vilest malefactor for such are tried but at one bar but these are arraigned in all companies and in all discourses  next to rash censurers flatterers are most dangerous who may be compared to flies that have pretty shining wings for two or three hot months but the least cold weather makes an end of them or rather like the heliotrope open only toward the sun but shut and contract themselves at night let the object of their adoration be but eclipsed they can see none of those excellencies which before dazzled their eyes and their old idol is often made a sacrifice to their new and all malicious discovery is made of their falling friend to make an interest in their rising one there are such crowds of examples of this kind in our age and most unhappy kingdom that it is fitter to furnish precedents for the future than to borrow any of the past times  this is certainly the most horrid crime that could be committed and the blackest color wherein we can view a parasite and as an ape has a peculiar deformity above other brutes by that awkard and ungraceful resemblance he has to a man so a flatterer is infinitely more hateful for being the ugly counterfeit of a friend a pretense of friendship and kindness is now become the general bait to all base projects all the woolfish designs that have been lately acted upon our english stage have walked under this sheeps clothing and as the world goes men have more need to beware of those who call themselves friends than those who own themselves enemies because the one traitorously betrays you whilst you expect no better from the other  it was heretofore the character given of the english by an ingenious person that they were both excellently endowed and rarely tempered by god and nature and were the most piously affected of all others and that there were not in the whole world either better catholics or better protestants that there was no nation under heaven more remote from ill nature and revenge nor men who were more honestly and even more naturally just nor so far distant from using base treachery of every kind but alas the race is now spoiled by mixture and we are no more what we were every one endeavoring to deceive and delude each other and that freedom and good nature which was thought peculiar to england which is a kind of balsom to the whole life of man and without which life is no better than a punishment both to others and most of all to a mans self is banished out of our nation and those flowers of virtue which were thought to grow no where else but in our island are now degenerated into weeds of flattery treachery and undermining now the suppression of this vice depends upon those persons to whom it is addressed let but princes entertain such parasites with a severe brow and with sharp expressions of dislike these leeches will immediately fall off in sparta when all laws against theft proved ineffectual at last they fixed the penalty upon them that were robbed and that did the business and if it were made amongst us as infamous to be flattered as it is to flatter i believe it might have the same effect  plutarch gives an excellent example of a man that could not be persuaded to flatter in the person of philoxenus who being a good poet and despising some dull poetry of dionysius the tyrant he was by him condemned to the quarries where having been for some time he was by the mediation of friends recalled and at his first appearance dionysius showed him some other of his verses which he thought his masterpiece which as soon as philoxenus had read he made no reply but called to the guards to carry him back again to the quarries a brave example of a heathen poet who preferred a corporal slavery before a mental  as it is a great part of wisdom not to be flattered so it is to pass by the reproaches of others herein we should imitate socrates who being informed of some derogating speeches one had used of him behind his back made only this reply let him beat me too when i am absent i care not however it is good to shun the company of those who take pleasure in exposing others to contempt and derision as one would avoid the heels of a horse that kicks every one he can reach  it is the height of incivility to abuse persons in discourse to abuse inferiors argues a mean contemptible spirit superiors is dangerous to abuse a friend is to lose him a stranger to lose your self in his and the worlds esteem we should therefore endeavor to keep a fair reputation with all persons with superiors it is good to be humble and complaisant not low and flattering with equals grave not morose with inferiors courteous and fair not sullen nor impetuous  it is an indiscreet thing for a man in company to take exceptions and if he have any defect in his person which he suspects men are apt to make derision of it is a folly to vex himself or quarrel at it but the best way to prevent others in their scoffs of this kind is first to speak and let them know as much as they can tell him and then he ought with a manly courage to contemn as unconcerned the indiscretions and follies of others it is no sign a man is sound who complains because one touches him in my younger days i knew an old merry droll who much frequented company who having in his youth taken a great liberty to rally upon married persons in his declining age took a wife where every one might have had her for his money and the first treatment of any friend in his conversation was still the discourse of his own marriage to prevent all that could be said against him  and as we should not be troubled when others tell us of our imperfections so on the other hand we should never praise our selves it is a great blemish for a man to be the trumpet of his own excellencies he who puts a modest rate upon his own deserts does best multiply his fame but he that speaks in his own commendations does as if he meant to sell himself and if the most accomplished would but seriously consider his own imperfections how many things he wants and how few he knows and those how lamely he would make use of his reason and discourse not for commendation of himself but to gain instruction from others such mens company is very troublesome who are only accustomed to the admiration of themselves thinking nothing besides them worthy of regard if these unbred minds were made acquainted with those excellencies which god has bestowed on other men they would not think themselves like gideons fleece to have sucked up all the dew of heaven they would find perhaps they rather answered the other part of the miracle and are drier than their neighbors and if such will needs be reflecting on themselves let them compare their crop of weeds and nettles with that of their corn and then they must either think their ground is poor or themselves very ill husbands  now the way to profit by conversation must come from our selves our question is the fire that draws out either the quintessence or the dreggs of things and therefore the usefullest part of discourse is to give occasion by asking questions by intermingling our discourses with tales with reasons and telling of opinions it being a testimony of as much knowledge to ask a pertinent question as to give a pertinent answer but herein a great regard is to be had in what company we do it for great men love not to be asked questions unless where questions may pull out the thread of their own praises he that in discourse questions much shall undoubtedly learn much if he apply his questions to the skill of the persons with whom he discourses and put them upon those things they understand best for thereby he shall do them a kindness in giving them occasion to please themselves in speaking because every one loves to speak of that wherein he is most expert and himself shall continually gather knowledge by fetching from every one the best that is in him for when men are reduced to speak of those things wherein they are most conversant and skillful the conversing with them is an excellent school but we shall commonly see men take the contrary course choosing rather to discourse of any other profession than their own supposing it to be so much new reputation gotten but this way a man shall never come to perfection as for tales to tell a story well to continue it in a handsome method clothing it with suitable expressions without impertinencies and to represent therein persons and things to the life is one of the best and perhaps one of the hardest parts of conversation the late king charles ii my master of glorious memory had a most particular talent of this kind and was wonderful pleasant in conversation and used very frequently soon after his restoration to have his private sallies in the winterevenings to divert himself with some particular persons of wit whom he still chose to sup with him where i had the honor diverse times by his majestys command to wait upon him at supper for he would then have none of the grooms of his bedchamber with him in these divertisements the king permitted those who supped with him to make use of their wits in telling some pleasant stories and in quick and handsome repartees wherein the king had an excellent vein and would as well take as give without offense which liberty was always used with great respect by those who had the honor to sup with him which were usually  hannibal sested base brother to the then king of denmark the duke of ormond the lords carlingford wentworth and crofts with sir frederick cornwallis sir john mynnis and sometimes tom killigrew in these conversations i have heard excellent discourses witty repartees mingled with pleasant tales wherein the king had so great a faculty that scarce any thing could be said which he would not parallel with some pleasant modern story which he would tell with such grace and quickness as charmed all the company but when he found them warmd with wine and that their wits began to be piquant and sharp and to sting each other the king would always then interpose his royal authority and would stroke over the severe nips they gave each other by throwing dust upon them telling them good jests ought to bite like lambs not dogs to tickle not wound wherein his majesty showed great prudence for we have seen in our days many examples of the mischiefs that have happened by too severe railleries in such fencings jest has proved earnest and florets have been turned to swords and not only the friendship but the men have fallen a sacrifice to the jest it is sure we shall die in earnest and it will not become us always to live in jest but the gift of raillery in this age has devoured the more solid qualifications and is accounted the greatest accomplishment a strange inverted estimate to prefer the little ebullitions of wit before solid reason and judgment if these men should accommodate their diet at the same rate they should eat the husk rather than the pease and feed upon froth and bubbles  there is nothing more becoming a gentleman than a cheerfulness in conversation every thing being by so much the more lively and cheerful as it comes nearer to its creation and nothing has more light and sprightfulness in it than an ingenious conversable integrity virtue is the minds constant health the pulse of it still beats true and evenly she is sprightly without levity free without discomposure and conversable without coyness or cheapness as free from stupidity as lightness from being a log as a squib besides a vivacity of spirit is usually accompanied with such a kind of wit as makes us acceptable in conversation cheerful persons being graceful in all they do are most valuable in company for who had not rather associate himself with a merry conceited humor than with a cynical wise man many men indeed blame mirth because they cannot endure it which is to blame the sun because owls cannot endure the brightness of it as if we should quarrel with light because our weak eyes are dazzled with its beams  there are some men whose dispositions lead them to fasten and feed on miseries and to glide over the pleasures of this life which puts me in mind of what passed betwixt diogenes the cynick and aristippus the courtier who passing by diogenes as he was at dinner in his tub diogenes said to him if you could content your self as i do with bread and garlic you would not be the king of syracuse his slave and you replied aristippus if you knew how to live with princes you would not make such bad cheer it is true this morose and pedantick philosophy is not designed for a gentleman they are born to be sociable and ought to understand all the maxims of the world complaisant humors assisted with this practical knowledge gain the friendship of all people because they know how to set forth gracefully the talents of nature  there is no means so powerful and apposite to divert the fixed and intent cares of the mind and to exhilerate a sorrowful heart as pleasant company and music which mollifyeth our minds and stays the tempestuous affections of it if there be any dregs of cares that lie lurking in our thoughts most powerfully it wipes them all away they say alexander one day excited by the music of a harp took arms and played the part of a common soldier david himself charmed the evil spirit in the body of his fatherinlaw by the sweetness of his harmony and we daily see the terror of death cannot so much affright soldiers as the sound of drums and trumpets does animate them the singing of the nurse makes the child quiet which evidently demonstrates the powerful effects of it in nature it self and the very laboring men find satisfaction in it who sing in their work and without doubt the voice persuades and instructs much more than reading the first being accompanied with certain spirits which we may call living the other is nothing but the pourtraicture of the thoughts of a dead man  sir thomas more in his vtopia makes music an appendix to every meal and epictetus esteems a table without it to be no better than a manger lewis xi says comines at the interview betwixt him and edward iv of england invited him to come to paris and told him as a great part of his entertainment that he should hear most sweet voices exquisite music and should not want the company of fine ladies and the cardinal of bourbon to be his confessor which he thought sufficient endearments to such a sensual prince as edward iv  indeed innocent mirth and pleasant company whet out wits quicken our fancies and make us afterward more fit for any employment a merry heart is the life of the flesh says solomon and gladness prolongs his days and is highly useful when it is only our divertisement not our business but the excess of it is very illbecoming and to set our wits on the tenterhooks for so slight a purpose is abominable but merry humors though they have a great pleasantness in them are obnoxious to many because if jests wherein they are most conversant be well received by some yet they offend more than they please and create more enemies than friends for though points of wit be very fine in discourse yet if they be made so sharp as to draw blood those that use them may have occasion to repent of them it is true flashes of wit give us a pleasant light so long as they burn not but this liberty must be bounded with caution for wit should rather serve for a buckler to defend by a handsome reply than a sword to wound others though with never so facetious a reproach in these rencounters therefore the charge should be powder and not bullets and we must take heed that we pass not from this familiar freedom of drollery which causes mirth to severe scoffing which provokes scorn endangers quarrels and gives an umbrage of a spiteful intent  this pleasant kind of wit is a talent usually given to youth to play withal and it is a pretty gift to begin the world with if they understand the right use of it otherwise it is an unruly engine wildly striking sometimes a friend and not seldom the engineer himself sharp speeches therefore which fly abroad like darts are to be tenderly used for though they be shot at others they are many times thrown back upon themselves as when the earl of rutland who had been instrumental in the preferment of sir thomas more to be lord chancellor of england and thinking the chancellor did not show him that respect he merited meeting him accidentally he told him in reproach honores mutant mores alluding to his name which the lord chancellor sharply returned upon him telling him it was not true in latin but in english that honors changed manners which was the lord rutlands surname thus we shall see some mens wits whip opposition and manifest the quickness of their dexterity in the shapness of their returns like the artisans weapon that makes his enemies arms his enemies destruction and by a nimble repartee turns the words spoken upon the speaker himself there is much pleasure in this kind of wit there being no such stillatory as a quick brain which refines and makes use of whatsoever comes within the pan for its reception but those gentlemen who have this satirical vein and make others afraid of their wit had need be afraid of other mens memories for many times after they have given others occasion to laugh they are made themselves to cry  the rules to be given herein are carefully to observe times circumstances and persons knowing when to jest and when not to use apt and handsome repartees natural and not affected that have more salt than gall speaking what is just and proper upon every occasion which is better than fine conceits which yet are liked if they be good but equivocations quibbling with words and puns which have only the appearance of wit are ridiculous and yet these have brought some men of very ordinary parts into credit there is as much difference between jests picked up here and there and those that come from the springhead as betwixt wise discourses and harmonious fooleries between a solid sufficiency and what is painted a jest should never be served up but once when it is cold the vigor and strength of it is gone many refuse to wear buff because it is lasting and a man of wit will not apparel his brain in durance it is therefore pleasant to mingle jest with earnest for nothing pleases more than variety and it is a dull piece of service to tire any thing too far but as all creatures by secret instigation love to be doing that in which they are most able so these men of wit being delighted to hear themselves talk cannot contain themselves within a mean nor have patience sometimes to be silent so that we may justly wonder such absurd persons should speak so well now there are some limits wherein these kind of wits ought to be circumscribed there being certain persons and things privileged from jesting as religion matters of state great persons any mans present business of importance and any case that deserves pity to play upon any mans unhappiness or deformity is inhumane and men may be as oppressive by their parts as by their power and god did no more design the meaner intellectuals of some for triumphs to the vanity of the more acute than he did the possessions of the less powerful as a prey to the avarice and rapine of the mighty and it is a much greater barbarism to reproach a man that wants the gifts of nature than him that wants those of fortune for a beggar may have impoverished himself by his own fault but in natural defects there is nothing to be charged unless we will arraign that providence which has so disposed and those whom god has blessed with higher degrees of sagacity and quickness ought not to look down upon others as objects of their contempt and scorn but rather of their care and pity endeavoring to secure them from those mischiefs to which their weakness may expose them and their folly should neither dismount our wisdom nor violate our own integrity but the world is grown to that pass that men will rather put stumbling blocks in the way of the blind and pull away the crutch from the lame that they may sport themselves to see them tumble such a delight we take in improving the imperfections of others that it is become the great excellency of this age to be dextrous at it but good nature is willing to interpret things to the best sense to take things by the right handle and will never go to the rigor of the matter nor break out at others misfortunes for to be touchy and peevish in discovering a fault to kindle like gunpowder at the least spark is a sign we are perfectly wrapped up in our own interest and that we have nothing of sweetness or balsom in our blood we must therefore endeavor to sweeten our humor and keep the ferment down and though the world be full of malicious men yet by this we shall disappoint the pleasure of ill nature break the force of an affront and make the injury fall upon us like hail upon tiles rattle without mischief and at last to tumble into dirt  to jest at calamities is a great sign of ill nature when caninius a consul of rome died the same day he was made consul cicero would needs put a jest upon that accident and said o vigilantissime consul sub quo nimo pransus est nemo caenavit nemo dormivit magnum prodigium vidimus caninio consule non sensimus ver non estatem non autumnum the state says he has had a vigilant consul of caninius that never slept in all his consulship but this was justly thought a fault in cicero for calamities are not to be the subject of jests i love jests well said a wise man but not the loss of my friend and those who lose themselves to show their wit are much like heliodore bishop of tricca in thessaly who having wrote the ethiopick history very politely and elegantly but withal somewhat loosely and wantonly was thereupon summoned by a provincial synod who told him his work did more endanger the manners than profit the wits of his readers as nourishing loose and wanton conceits in the heads of youth and therefore they gave him his choice either to retract his book or leave his bishopric whereupon he rather chose to resign his place in the church than to lose the reputation of his vain wit and every age shows us remarkable examples of this kind for sharpness of wit commonly carries with it two ill companions pride and levity ingenious persons miscarrying in nothing more than in too much pleasing themselves in the goodness of their own conceits where sometimes the like befalls them which happened to xeuxis the famous painter who having pictured to the life an old woman so pleased himself in the conceit of his work that he died with laughing at it  being thus prepared with outward and inward furniture for conversation it is necessary to consider how and where to bestow it for he that is provident of his time will be also prudent in the choice of his company and choice of his actions least the first engage him in vanity and the latter by being criminal in throwing himself and his time away  this world is linked together by love and men by conversation and one of the geatest pleasures we enjoy herein if duly weighed is the sweet society of friends and relations which multiplies our joys and divides our griefs there being no stricter union upon earth than that of a virtuous friendship and nothing can be more satisfactory than to improve and benefit that person who is thus become a part of us  men of quality love to deck and embellish the place where their inhabit and friends dwell in each other and therefore cannot but be delighted in beautifying and adorning those minds they have thus chosen to live in by purging them from all foulness and rendering them as splendid and illustrious as is possible and certainly there is nothing more ravishing than a friendship thus entertained that calamities attend it as well as comforts is but a weak objection for what goodness is there without temptations and what happiness in this world not to be transformed it is the gracefulness of every thing that makes it valued gold whilst it is in the mine is good for nothing when it is cut and beaten into the thinness of leafgold it is wasted and blown away and quickly comes to nothing but when it is tempered with such an allay as it may receive a stamp and impression then it is current and useful  thus cynical men who out of pride of their own parts disdain company and can no more endure conversation than owls the daylight like gold in the bowels of the earth their parts are useless and good for nothing who cannot without offense walk the public ways they are saints indeed in private and live only to god and to themselves but being called forth into common life they are like bats in the sun and utterly ignorant of public affairs and the conversation and friendship of those whose end is only civility and mutual visits like leafgold they are blown away with every little wind of distaste or neglect of ceremony and in an equal degree to these are they to be reckoned who are amici inter prandium and sartaginem ad ostium tabernae fratres and amici ad ostium carceris neque fratres neque amici but the useful and profitable conversations which give a right stamp and impression to our minds are those friends that will be supporters to us in our prosperities safeguards in our difficulties counselors in our doubts and comforts in our adversities with these we ought to contract a strict acquaintance and inwardness and to embrace their company upon all fitting opportunities using herein a wise moderation which carries with it both an honor and grace of manners for to seek company and to fly it are two extremes to be blamed to shun all company argues a contempt of others and makes us generally hated and to seek too much after them is a sign of idleness in our selves and makes us slighted we must love our neighbors as our selves and to show that we love them we must not avoid their company and to show that we love our selves we must sometimes be alone and take pleasure in our selves the italians have a very significant proverb which says measure it a hundred times before you cut it off meaning you should stand upon your guard till you discover the inclinations of those you converse with and therefore we should be careful of laying out our friendship too lavishly at first since like other things it will be so much the sooner spent neither should it be of too quick a growth for the plants which shoot up too fast are not of that continuance as those which take more time for it we shall see some who have hot and cold fits of friendship that shall hug you one day and not know you the next this unevenness of temper is by all means to be avoided in conversation a good man will always keep a steady course of friendship which may run like a smooth stream and never change but be a perpetual spring for we cannot find the gust and relish of a true and fixed conversation till we come to a great freedom with each other for they that converse only as strangers are always under some restraints and uneasiness and do never open themselves freely the one to the other  in the long experience i have had in the world i have seldom if ever found any mans company worth enjoying that did not begin with some difficulty if not prejudice for conversation like oysters is nothing the better for opening so easy and so soon neither is there any more dangerous acquaintance than that overhasty familiarity contracted betwixt good fellows as we call them in england who usually begin their friendship in the entry and strike it up in the cellar where servants are disciplined to be the ministers of their masters luxuries whose vices seldom miss to be taken up by them as if they were the badges to witness to whom they belonged there is no greater mark nor discovery of a man than to judge him by the company he keeps it being impossible but that he shall much resemble them and partake some of their qualities si juxta claudum habites sub claudicare disces says plutarch bad company is very contagious to the wisest and best settled men what befell joseph was out of contagion frequenting the egytian court learnt him to swear by the life of pharaoh dum spectant oculi laesos laeduntur and ipsi multaque corporibus transitione nocent i remember aristotle in his problems makes a question why health does not infect as well as sickness a diseased person often communicating his infirmity never his health the reason is says he because the health of the body has no transient force on others and is personal and not communicative but malvezzi tell us it is for that nature in providence drives away the evil from it self and thriftily reserves that which is good and for this reason it is says he that those who have the plague are desirous to come into company that they may give it to others and by the same reason those who have ill qualities in them will be sure to work and apply their vices like rust into the nearest and purest mind  edward ii of england was a sad example hereof for his alter idem his great favorite gaveston was a man of excellent parts of body and of no less endowments of mind being both valiant and witty and if his valor could as well have made the king valiant as his riot made him riotous there might have come some good of their extraordinary conjunction but seeing virtues are but personal and vice communicative it made the king not only more vicious than he would have been but vicious where otherwise in all appearance he would not have been the consideration of this most mischeivous and dangerous conversation caused seleucus to make a law wherein he forbad all company with wicked men and charondas the lawgiver punished those for wicked who frequented lewd company neither was it a sufficient answer which antisthenes gave when he was told of his conversation with wicked men that physicians live amongst the sick for though they help sick mens health they surely impair their own by continual visiting and touching diseased persons but yet this must be favorably understood for there is no rank or quality of persons so absolutely excluded from our conversation but only such a degree of ill company as may poison and corrupt the good for in nearer than company our friend and in somewhat nearer than him our selves we must allow some inordinaries and many grains of allowance must be given to make the best of us current there may be likewise occasion sometimes of conversing with ill men not for society but business and for reformation as our savior converst with publicans and sinners and therefore no man is so tied up as to come in no company but good men for he that cannot live amongst the wicked must seek for another kind of world than this and for more perfect creatures than mortals it was not ill said of the philosopher omnes odit qui malos odit he that hates ill men hates all men and if a man will love none but honest men where will he find any exercise any object of his love if a man will hold friendship with none do offices of society to none but goodnatured and sociable men he will leave many necessary businesses undone the frowardest and perversest man may be good for some particular occasion a crooked piece of timber is not thrown aside it is good for some uses the very flesh of a viper is made an antidote being mingled with other simples and ingredients and by good company and kind usage many an ill man is bettered and since a magistrate ceases not to be a magistrate for being an ill man much less does a man cease to be a man and so to have title to those duties of conversation and business which are rooted in nature because he is of an ill disposition it is indeed a great part of wisdom to contract friendship and inwardness with none but good men that so by our intimacy with them we may participate of their goodness for men are not like bees whose sweetness makes things of another nature sweet it must be good we receive and then perhaps we shall make it better but if ill we make it worse  some naturalists say there is a way of castration in cutting off the ears that there are certain veins behind the ears which if cut cause barrenness our ears are the aqueducts of knowledge and if we cut those that is intermit our conversation with good and wise men this will prove a castration to our understanding the advantages we receive hereby was well intimated in that which socrates said to eschines who seeing every body give socrates something he said because i have nothing else to give thee i will give thee my self do so says socrates and i will give thee back again to thy self better than when i received thee and certainly the conversation of welldisposed men who have most looked into the affairs of the world and have studied men as well as business is a great improvement of our understanding and fortifier of our judgment especially if they be men of years experience and virtue and famed for wisdom for their testimony is of greater force and something is always to be learned from them for where wisdom holds with age and memory has not unthriftily spent her comings in upon time their conversation is certainly the wisest book there is only one fault accompanies them their great and unwearied desire of talking which seems troublesome to many that hear them yet i must confess in my younger days i have ever heard such with delight and did at all times most joyfully accept what they delivered who are of all others most able to instruct youth and surely there is much reverence owing that age which deserves a fatherly respect and honor from us  a gentleman in conversation should be affable not imperious knowing humanity and gentleness is a common debt to mankind and therefore will not contract his civility into so narrow a compass that it shall swell into compliments to them above him and not suffer one drop to descend on those beneath him but will so dispose its streams that all channels may be filled with it but some gentlemen like the pharisee think they are not like other men and having mounted themselves aloft look down upon all below them as little and contemptible creeping things of the earth not considering that the distance betwixt noble and mean men is only valuable as a defense against base and ignoble practices true greatness consisting in despising not the persons but the errors of the vulgar  it is great prudence in gentlemen to associate themselves as near as may be with persons of their own rank and quality for in such kind of friendships well chosen consists the fruit and utility of conversation  to keep company with great men is very dangerous and he that soars in so high a sphere runs the hazard of icarus for if great men love his company it is either for their pleasure because he has wit and tickles their fancy or he has parts which they make use of for their own advantage and it is common with them never to quit or advance such persons but still feed them with hopes that their dependence may be wholly upon them and when such great men die or are disgraced their fall is the ruin of their dependants my lord chancellor bacon wittily resembles such who have intimacy with and dependence upon great men to fasting days which stand next to holy days but otherwise are the leanest days in the year the wise historian tells us nunquam secura cum potente societas the danger of such acquaintance is well represented in the fable of the lion the fox and the ass who keeping company together they went one day a hunting where the lion having taken a great prey he bid the ass divide the spoil who put all into three equal portions which so much offended the lion that he immediately killed the ass and devoured him and then commanded the fox to divide who put all into one great heap and set by a little morsel for himself and being asked by the lion how he knew so wisely to divide answered well the fortune of my brother ass has taught me and if i had as well understood the moral of this fable when i learnt it at school as i did afterward by dearbought experience i had not stood so long in the asss place but sero sapiunt phryges  now there are some men so far from this humor that they always keep company with mean persons and those below them whereas there can be no true friendship but betwixt equals and therefore wise men will not only avoid conversing with such who are much superior but also with those who are much inferior not only in degree but in parts for tanti eris aliis quanti tibi fueris and that our thoughts and designs will be such as our companions are and low fortunes breed many times degenerous purposes and he that makes himself an ass invites others to ride him and it is a very mean ambition to be the best in the company it being an experienced truth that he who desires always to be the best man in the company he keeps shall soon become the worst of any company he comes into  and yet this conversation though bad is not so dangerous as keeping company with fools folly being no good tutor to teach wisdom neither can a wise man contract friendship with a fool their qualities being so far different for when any man is taken with anothers conversation it is a great argument that they are both of the same sentiments but a fool serves for nothing but sometimes to divert an ingenious man and no other use can be made of him  but those who love multitudes are in worse danger than in keeping company with fools for such live in a crowd and a herd is not company the very smell of them offends a wise man and where the crowd of men is there is the crowd of ill customs and since it is hard to avoid temptations when they come single how shall we escape them when they come upon us in a full body how can we think of any thing but ill when we see nothing that is good young gentlemen who are newly come into the world with great fortunes and ill breeding seek great meetings and sin for company to gain experience and therefore it is no wonder they are entangled in debts and made a prey to cheaters and embroiled in quarrels so long as they frequent such conversation it was in such kind of company i conceive seneca meant when he said he never went amongst men but he came home a worse man that he went out  amongst wise men the principal end of company is conference and conference to be bettered by is not usually met with in crowds where men meet not like bees to make honey but like wasps who love to feed in dung in such company you shall hear men speak neither honestly nor temperately slander or flattery engrossing all their discourse so that no man can be bettered by their conversation the chattering of magpyes being better music than a consort of such senseless persons nay a desert is to be preferred before such debauched companions for the wildness of the place is but unchearful whilst the wildness of lewd persons is infectious  besides these there is another conversation which is that of women and though young gentlemen are generally pleased to think this a very innocent diversion yet none is more dangerous especially as to the womans part and proves often a more pernicious calamity than that which thrusts men into hospitals such men as spend their whole time like sardanapalus amongst women and yet pretend chastity are ridiculous  if these hear of a beautiful woman what contrivances and designs do they lay first to see her and then to corrupt her and make it their great business as well as trade for their agents and factors to spring such game and upon these occasions those will liberally sacrifice all their time of which when any charitable office would borrow from them some minutes they are then such busy persons they can by no means afford it but to go in quest of such game to have the company of women is their only delight and pastime but ladies must take heed of such dangerous conversation and especially by how much the more lively they are they are the more liable to be hurt as the finest plants are the soonest nipt by the frost  the world is a dangerous stage for women where virtue alone will not defend them unless joined with much prudence they must have both for their guard and not stir without them and all little enough for the enemy being abroad they are sure to be taken if they be straggling their behavior therefore must ever incline strongly toward the reserved part the deceitfulness of the age we live in having made this caution highly necessary for though most men seem indeed plantonick lovers and so at first as humble gallants they are only admitted for trophies yet they very often become conquerors and from admirers grow into masters besides the world is not so great a fool as not very well to know that frequent visits made to handsome women soon grow suspicious since we know all men are pleased with what is handsome stimulus carnis is a natural vice in all men and lust is no way better restrained than by keeping far from such creatures  he that will avoid committing sin must shun the occasions for the best philosopher cannot make me believe but that every man naturally is pleased with a savory morsel and they that make profession of not staining their reputation with spots of uncleanness ought to shun all that allures thereunto for it is not only a great piece of folly but an infinite rashness worthy to be punished to make gunpowder in a smiths shop with hopes to make people believe there is no danger in it  some learned physicians affirm and anatomists do also tell us when a woman bears twins if they be both of the same sex they are enwrapped in one film but if of different wise nature parts them and if nature thinks not fit to lodge a brother and sister together in so tender an age this certainly teaches us that persons of different sexes cannot live safely together and those who rely upon their strength and virtue in such occasions are certainly more rash than wise and those young ladies who promise to themselves never to go so far as to be gained nor to admit any but indifferent favors such as civility allows and after having given way to more than they should they find a precipice where they expected only entertainment and that woman who will allow her self to go to the utmost extremity of every thing that is lawful is so very near going farther that those gentlemen who lie at watch will begin to count upon her for men are apt to turn every thing that a woman does to the hopeful side but yet few are so impudent as to make an application till they see something which they are willing to take for an encouragement  and therefore it is much more honorable and safer for women to prevent such forwardness than to go about to cure it nothing being with more care to be avoided by them than such a kind of civility which may be mistaken for an invitation  i wish many imprudent ladies had not found the truth of this men often stealing from little favors to greater and still carry on their designs till many times they change their entreaties into threats and their softness into violence and then those women find too late that true simplicity is abused when it deals with falsified the fear of losing their reputation after having given some advantages which they ought not to have done has debauched many women and therefore they ought to be very cautious what men they admit into their company and of granting the least civilities for as the sun shining upon a lookingglass melting the quicksilver presently causes spots so if a young gentleman do but look upon a beautiful woman a flame of love presently arises the ancient philosophers knew this well which made them prescribe absence for the remedy of love that men should not see their mistresses but she knew it better who said to her lover discede discede a foculo meo nam si te vel minime igniculus meus afflaverit ureris infime and what propertius says is most true crescit enim assidue spectando cura puellae ipse alimenta sibi maxima praebet amor   in the last place there are some conversations which are neither good nor bad profitable for nothing but only recreation men who seem as it were made for no other purpose but to divert from serious affairs and since even saints themselves have had their divertisements and that all persons are allowed some breathingtime of humane delight we may therefore safely spare these men that leisure which is set apart for our conversation and sometimes lend our selves to them that we may be the better enabled to return to our serious employments  of solitariness and retirement there is nothing so prejudicial to action as to be always in action for the mind like the body is tired by being always in one posture to be too serious breaks it to be too diverting loosens it so that to unbend our thoughts when they are too much stretched by our cares is not more natural than necessary the eye sees not the objects touching it but those only remote and the understanding continually plunged in affairs is not so quick and piercing as his who sometimes retires from public employments experience teaches us that the eye having lost its quickness by much looking upon the light recovers its vigor again in the dark and as the most curious gravers are obliged to look sometimes upon green flies to recollect again their scattered sight so the spirit being weakened and distracted with variety of affairs ought to recover its force in the privacy of some small retreat in the heat and tumult of business reason has not power to give conduct to active life man having but an imperfect understanding without meditation and therefore as bees must retire to the honey after they have gathered the matter from flowers so it is necessary that we retire into our selves to gather the fruit of our experience otherwise we shall be but ill husbands of the wealth we have gotten  indeed the fruit we gather from our many days of company is very little we scatter much in conversation we gather but small profit but for the few hours we spend in retirement and recollection the return is very considerable and the greater portions of our time we lay out this way the more treasure we lay up for our selves hereafter this inward consideration is a large and powerful study to such as can seriously taste and employ themselves therein it is the nourishment and life of our spirit and nature has favored it with this singular privilege that there is nothing we can do so long neither is there any thing more easy more natural or more our own than to meditate and entertain our thoughts  thus as often as the mind interrupted in its operation by external objects would have the body to be still and quiet it presently betakes it self to retirement when neither wife nor children kindred nor business nor whatsoever else can make any trouble are to be seen all things being excluded that can disturb but since this solitary employment and entertainment of our selves is either one of the best or the worst things we can undertake it must not therefore be in vanity much less in any thing that is vicious but in study in profound knowledge and in the diligent culture of our minds  he that will withdraw himself must first prepare to receive himself it is not wisdom to let the spleen govern us to overdrive nature is to draw a blemish upon our judgment men that retire should first examine the difficulty of the enterprise for without this preliminary prudence a man may overburthen his shoulders and soon wade out of depth and though solitude promises fair and is a strong engagement to a retired person yet it is to many better in prospect than in possession it is a great folly to trust our selves if we cannot govern our selves and he had need be very well assured of himself that falls into his own hands for it often happens that none are more dangerous than our own and therefore wisely says the spaniard god keep me from my self  that man is much mistaken who thinks solitude a sanctuary against all vices it is good against such as proceed from without us but it has its inward and spiritual difficulties and though the devil be busy in all places yet he takes solitude to be his ground of advantage from whence ofttimes he plays his batteries with most success thus we see he ventured to attack our savior himself when he found him in the wilderness to show it is most dangerous for those to be alone that are not masters of themselves there being no security from danger by running away from the world especially if melancholy drives us to solitude which makes the mind uneasy and ill thoughts are no foreign commodity but purely of our own growth which are most dangerous in solitude for many men who have well preserved themselves in company have been lost in solitude lot was chaste even in the city of sodom yet defiled in his cave to an imprudent unadvised man solitude is a dangerous staff and it is to be feared that whilst he walks alone he entertains more and worse company than himself mens vices many times giving them the taste of solitude making them so much shun company and seek the more elbowroom for a man may as well fail alone as in company there are ways for it until such time that he has framed himself such as to become sibi theatrum that he so much respects his reason and fears his conscience that he cannot without shame stumble or trip in their presence that he dare not halt before himself but bears a kind of reverence and respect unto himself which next to religion is the chiefest bridle against all vice cicero in this case gives an excellent direction observentur species honestae animo let honest ideas still represent themselves before our mind let us says seneca represent cato phocion and aristides to our imagination in whose presence even fools would hide their faults and establish them as comptrollers of all our actions  it is certainly a rare thing vt satis se quisque vereatur that every man should sufficiently stand in awe of himself we should win so much upon our selves as to be able in good earnest and willingly to be left alone to quit the world if need be to dwell and delight in our selves we must break those bonds asunder that fasten and bind us to each other and not so tie our selves to the things of this world that our felicity depend upon them but reserve a storehouse for our selves what need soever happen wherein we may secure and establish our true contentment and principal retreat this storehouse is a wise mans mind which moves and turns within it self and is well contented to keep it self company and enjoy it self and when the world frowns upon us and that we are barren of employments we ought then to betake our selves to the secret improver of minds contemplation thereby adorning our house within and make it ready if for guests that is for business and if they come not it is no matter it will be the better for us to live in thus we must bring home our cogitations to our selves that our contentment may depend upon what is within us neither seeking nor disdaining employment but cheerfully go on either with or without it with a calm and undisturbed mind for this world is a comedy where every man acts that part which providence has assigned him and as it is esteemed more noble to look on than to act so there is no securer box from which to behold it than a safe retreat it being easier to feel than express the pleasure that may be taken in standing aloof off and in contemplating the reelings of the multitude upon the stage of this world  there is no counsel more proper for men than the philosophers tecum habit to dwell at home and not to suffer any thing to steal us away from our selves there is neither profit nor pleasure worth so much that we should go abroad to seek it even amongst pagans the wisest looked upon the things of this world as lumber rather than furniture as things which they needed not and retired within their own breasts which they called their home there to enjoy virtue their only good and many of the epicurean sect who proposed to themselves no other end but their own contentment did bereave themselves of all sensual delights and contemned the glory and pomp of all worldly wealth and greatness for the only pleasure of contemplation but now a wise christian that may within his own breast enjoy both virtue and god himself has much higher advantages and more reason to keep within that home and to look upon things without with an indifferent eye that man therefore forgets his origin and his dignity that puts his soul out of possession of her self by running perpetually after hopes that fly from him whereas he should abandon the pleasures of this life and bid adieu to all manner of vanities shunning all passions that may any way impeach the tranquillity either of mind or body making god the only object of his contemplation he that thus retires draws no mans envy upon him he reigns by himself and all the pomp which greatness draws after it is not comparable to that which he enjoys in secret for as that man must needs be accounted most happy that is likest unto god so mans chiefest happiness must needs consist in the contemplation of his divine majesty and of his works and indeed nothing but the supports of religion and a spiritual retreat upon that sole account can make a man fit to entertain himself withdrawing upon the score of religion thus to shut up the prospect of this world that we may take the better view of the other is a prudent precaution thus we untwist our affections and slide off from the world before the world slips from us thus to retire is the best improvement of solitude and to be thus alone is the way to bring us to the most desirable company  to retire for quiet and thinking is commendable amici fures temporis says the lord bacon conversation is a thief that steals away a great part of our time and usually stuffs our memory with rubbish solitude is a great relief in such cases and wise men are glad to get clear of the crowd for fresh air and breathing it is not noise and flashes thunder and lightning that make fair days but it is the suns casting a clear and pleasing light with gentle gales so a life led in sweet tranquillity which is the work of reason is much preferable before all the great successes which the world admires and which are nothing but the extravagancies of fortune in retirement we taste the sweet of a quiet repose and entertain our selves with freedom nay we live more in two days of retreat and we are more sensible of what life is than in two years full of business and trouble and we see greater things in retirement than abroad in the world for what do we see great in the world unless it be perhaps an army the siege of a town or the court of a prince we are quickly accustomed to these which only appear great to us at the first sight but in retirement we look upon the different works of nature the sun rising and setting a still night and those planets which so majestically roll over our heads which we continually admire it is observed by learned physicians that those who dwell farthest from the sun if in any convenient distance have longer life better appetites digestion and growth than others who dwell not so remote from the heats thereof such advantages and much greater have their minds who are well removed from the scorchings the dazzlings and exhalings of the worlds glory into a private retirement whereas those who live in the throng of business and company their minds lose their rest and tranquillity and many times after a man has lost his rest he loses his labor also  it is a great misery for a man never to be his own too much acquaintance makes us strangers to our selves the more we converse with men the less we converse with god and the content which we may expect by our conversation with men is lost by too much conversation i know society is one of those satisfactions which are reckoned amongst the pleasures of the first magnitude in this life but when we consider that the advantage of society consists not in seeing each other but in rational conversation it will appear that solitude is much more satisfactory for what pleasure can be received in talking of new fashions of great purchases of advancement or ruin of favorites victories or defeats of stranger princes and armies some of which are the usual subject of ordinary conversation and in courts and great cities men neither seek nor find any other divertisement than visiting each other reviewing their habits talking of new fashions or of the weather or some such pitiful stuffs and if men discourse upon more serious subjects they are sure to be contradicted which often causes quarrels besides in these rencounters men are tempted to betray their ignorance or their malice in either of which they are esteemed blockheads or quarrelsom and if we converse with those who speak with more address than our selves we repine at our own dullness and envy their acuteness and if we converse with duller than our selves we are soon weary and fret at our being in ill company and if by chance we accompany our equals then we are upon our guard to catch all advantages that we may be thought more knowing and we are so interested in this point of honor that such conversation rather vexes than recreates and many persons make themselves cheap upon these occasions whom we had highly valued if we had frequented them less  that man who dwells upon himself and is always conversant with himself rests in his true and proper center and therefore he that has learnt wisdom from the folly of others and the miscarriages of his own actions will be content to see the crowd afar off and not any more thrust into it but retire within himself it is true indeed there is no place but there are means in it to do well or ill a man may live alone in the throng of a palace but if he may choose he will avoid the sight of it if need require he will endure the court but if he may have his liberty he will be alone for contagion is catching in a throng and a man must either imitate the vicious or hate them and both are dangerous he that is careful to avoid occasions starves his sin those are rare men that can live in the midst of temptations and not fall nemo diu tutus periculo proximus and quae licita sunt ritanda propter vicinitatem illiciti  we have never greater cause to consult our best wits what we are to do and how we are to carry our selves than when preferment or public employments are offered us it was no idle question asked by an eminent man whether if great places or employments were offered us we should refuse or admit them wherein the diverse abilities of men are to be considered he that has strength and wisdom to manage such places may receive them but he that would live quietly ought not to entangle himself with more than he can manage let him try quid far recusent quid valiant humeri the strong and virtuous man may possibly meet and encounter temptations with advantage which the more cautelous will avoid and in one of these two ranks every good man is found and we may well compare them to hannibal and fabius the first always calling for battle the other evermore declining it  there are indeed several degrees of solitude and those wisely retire who being harrassed with the fatigues of a public life foreseeing ill weather are willing to put into port when keeping out at sea might endanger the vessel when the winds go cross it is prudence to furl the sails thus that great prince charles v when he found his success began to fail him he presently withdrew  to be able to check our enemy to encounter occasions to act our part upon the common stage of this life and yet to keep our selves upright this is indeed truly to live but to avoid occasions to overcome the world by retiring from it argues a wise though in the worlds opinion a weak and fainting spirit who think there is no greater argument of imperfection in a good man quam non posse pati solemn non multitudinem not to be able to appear in public without offense and who can only live to god and himself vtilis ipse sibi fortassis inutilis orbi though this indeed be the weaker side yet certainly it is the safer rather than by an improvident foolhardiness to thrust our selves upon occasions which we are unable to manage without offense  there is not amongst men a greater or more frequent error committed than in this kind for in most things of this world men that have no skill in them will be content to acknowledge their ignorance to give place to better experience and will advise and consult with every one in their proper mystery but let offer be made of places of honor money or preferment no man will excuse himself or acknowledge his ignorance or weakness to manage them whereas our errors are no where so dangerous as in the unskillful managing of these things and therefore it is better to be cautious and wary than strong and hardy malo cautior esse quam fortior fortis saepe captus est cautus rarissime we read in holy scripture of a race of men so much greater in bulk than ordinary that men of common size seemed but as grasshoppers to them yet we find the little men were always too hard for them and drove them out because the giants depended upon the opinion of their strength and hardiness the others upon their wary wit and policy and it commonly happens so in this world and we shall find that far more have perished by unadvisedly venturing upon the things of this world than by sober and discreet retiring  but many men overrate themselves whose expectations being great when they are not caressed and humored in their folly they presently grow chagrin and sick of the world and fall into a fit of retirement and melancholy and will keep no longer company with any these men like children when crossed grow sullen in a corner but he that thus shuns company and retreats retires only like a beast to his den  we have seen many examples where greatness has ruined several persons who lived with much honor and reputation before nero tiberius and some others enjoyed the repute of noble souls before their mounting the imperial throne which brought them new vices with their honors and made them as much surpass others in their debauches as they did in their power so that public employment is scarce to be wished for seeing men are tempted thereby to commit the greatest crimes moses who was the meekest of men whilst he lived in the wilderness yet when providence advanced him he so highly offended god that all his former services could not obtain the liberty of his entering into the land of canaan  and though at the creation god found it not good for man to be alone and therefore gave him a companion yet to show the hazard of being in company even adam could not live one day in it and be innocent for the first news we hear of him after eve was associate with him is that he had forfeited his native purity  when god intended to converse with moses he called him from the populous camp to the top of mount sinai and christ did not disclose the glories of his transfiguration at jerusalem but on the top of the mount of olives when god did discipline his beloved yet rebellious people of israel he chose first the wilderness then the two captivities to be his school  history tells us of many who out of their skill and strength have given free entertainment to the world and have made large use of it in all ways of greatness and expense when their time and hour came would rather have gone out of some poor cottage than out of a princely palace and lived with no noise in the world that so they might have died in peace charles v the prince of parma and sundry others though they lived in all pomp and state yet at their death they desired to be buried in a capuchins habit and if they thought to die in a state of perfect sequestration from the world was so precious how much more available had it been to live in it for thus to die not having thus lived is nothing else but to give sentence against their own life for we shall not appear before god as we died but as we lived to profess desertion of the world at ones death as most do is only to be buried in a capuchins hood  it was a notable answer given by the philosopher to pyrrhus who when he told him he would conquer greece then rome and so all the world cyneas asked him why he would give himself so much trouble to which pyrrhus answered he would do it that he might afterward live happily and merrily with his friends but cyneas replied sharply he might live so presently and not take so much pains for it  men that are still busied in public affairs whose mercurial genius inclines them to a restless life they like moses on pisgah see retirement their land of canaan afar off but without hopes of enjoyment and we have seen some great men who would never leave employments till outed of them like whales and other great fishes that never come on shore till they are wounded and then these men have praised retirement not to satisfy their reason but their revenge yet even this proceeding of theirs commends retirement since even the distressed expect a protection there for distress makes men run where they may expect help and certainly those who after possessing great places in courts have been unexpectedly disgraced will be more really convinced of its slipperiness than such as never found the effects of so much revolution nay those men who seek greedily after public employments pretend thereby a design for solitude thus merchants seek about the world that they may gain so much as may afford them the convenience of a retirement and soldiers have often nothing to sweeten their anxieties but the remote prospect of some good garrison for a retreat and caesar himself said aliquando mihi licebit mihi vivere he would have his spare hours esteeming that part of his life to belong to others which was spent on other mens employments  now the wonder is that the same impulse which hurries men to desire to be great that they may be masters should not with far more reason carry them to be solitary where they are free from those necessities and have none to obey but god and nature masters who command us nothing but what were fit for us to do though we were not commanded  this consideration has made many holy fathers retire into deserts where they scarce had any other nourishment but their own juice nor any other company but god that they might tend the work of their salvation without disturbance there they did as it were descend into their sepulchers by deep and holy meditation and from those hermitages enriched the treasure of the church with their divine works confuting gainsayers and increasing the stock of holy learning  but it has not been unusual for some men to retire from the world and yet look back at it as lots wife at sodom and oftentimes to keep their hearts in it thus did many of the philosophers who left the world in effect but not in affection for in their retirements they had nothing but their arms and legs out of the throng their minds and intents were still engaged and they only went back that they might leap the better and with a stronger motion make a nimbler offer again into the world these men did not take the right way they thought they had totally taken leave of all business that they might live at more leisure and greater ease but they mistook themselves and only exchanged one employment for another for though they had shaken off the court and public employments they had not taken leave of the principal vexations of life nor had discharged themselves nor their minds of the burdens which oppressed them they had not so ordered it that their contentment depended wholly upon themselves and that they could live alone in good earnest and at ease however men may converse with the world and yet leave it we may find retiredness in the greatest cities we may pass through a crowd and not mingle with it and we may enjoy our selves in a multitude of unknown persons as if they were the personages of an arras hanging  every ship that sails must needs have some part of the ship under water every man that lives in this world must have some of his labors spent upon the world but as that part of the ship by which a man sails is above the water so that part of us which is above the earth we must remove it from the world thus some who have attained to that sublimity of mind as to be above all worldly cares though they meddle with the world as being of the world yet they do it so safely that they cleave not to it nor are astonished to leave it  thus many great men after the fruition of all earthly honors have much preferred solitude as snatocopias king of bohemia after the loss of a battle against the emperor arnold he retired into a desert where having lived several years with three poor hermits he at his death told them there was no greatness preferrable to the tranquillity of that solitude he had enjoyed with them which he esteemed as true happiness whereas that life he had led upon his throne deserved more the title of death than life and similis a great general to the emperor adrian after all his honors and preferments retired into the country for seven years before his death and caused this epitaph to be written upon his tomb here lies similis of a very great age who yet lived but seven years relating only to the time of his retirement  it was nobly observed by that great emperor marcus aurelius who was also a philosopher that a weaver or a cobbler would willingly sequester themselves from all company that they might prosecute their several trades and yet man cannot retire himself that he may admire the creation and exercise his own soul which is the great trade of a rational creature and of a true philosopher and since gain can prevail so far with men as to make them renounce society and esteem company an idle folly why should not we reflect upon the great advantages of retirement both as to morality and devotion which are much preferrable to those things which are in themselves but trifles if not burdens for certainly solitude has more pleasures in it than any public employment for it drives us into contemplation which is so charming that it may rather be said to ravish than please committing so open a rapture upon our souls that it puts them almost into a state of separation  thus the old hermits members of the catholic church are often remarked for being as far transported out of themselves as they had formerly transported themselves out of the world and even amongst the heathens we find pythagoras almost distracted with the satisfaction he conceived in finding out his demonstrations and pliny was so delighted with the pleasure of contemplating the rarities of the mountain vesuvius as for farther inquiry he approached so near that he lost himself in the flames of it  what calmness and contentment did archimedes show in the midst of the ruins of syracuse being so pleased with his demonstration and so busy about his knowledge and contemplation as he heard not the noise and clamours of the enemy and could not spare so much time from his intendment as to ask life from the rude conquerors when he was interrupted and killed by them here was a tranquillity which looked gloriously through danger and death it is not pomp and shining robes that give grace to the body but it is the mind within the body  socrates that great master of breeding tells us that young men should be instructed men in the flower of their age exercised in welldoing but old men should withdraw themselves and retire from all worldly affairs it being no less than highly necessary that a space of time should be interposed between the business of life and the day of death that when they come to leave the world they may have nothing else to do but to die and whosoever has laid up in his mind wherewith to entertain himself in the shadow and retirement of his age will look upon that temperate climate of his time as the most sweetened and digested part of his whole life free from the hurryings of all the other he then treats himself with the best company that of his own thoughts and observations and with the philosopher when others are sorry he is grown old he is only sorry that he was ever young indeed when decrepitness kills experience when age acts the prologue to death and draws the curtains before our senses it is then high time to give that life leave to think only of death and to prepare for its last journey for it is a right and justice men owe themselves who have given their most active and flourishing age to the world to give their declining age to solitude and retirement and since they have lived long enough for others they ought to give the remainder of their lives to themselves to call in these thoughts and intentions and since god gives them leisure to prepare for and order their remove they ought to make themselves ready to disintangle themselves from their worldly engagements and since they have hitherto lived swimming and floating they should come now and die in the harbor it being but reasonable for that man to shake off society that can bring nothing to it he that cannot lend let him take heed of borrowing and when our forces fail us it is then a part of prudence as well as safety to retire but for men in the strength of their manly vigor that are endowed with public abilities and excellent ornaments the use whereof is only in society for such to retire for their ease or idleness and to do good to none but themselves is very injurious to the public and resists not only reason but goodness both which join in guiding us to common good a man of excellent parts who thus retires under pretense of meditating and leaves no fruit of his meditations to the world is like the river of jordan whose fair and quick water is lost in the lake of sodom called the dead sea this is to die living to lose the quickness of the mind in the gulf of unprofitable idleness it is indeed leaving the world in the worse sense for it is a forsaking mankind and denying to society that service and duty which we owe it  for if men of public employments and professions should husband all their time so thriftily as not to give any part thereof to business but bestow it all in retiredness yet even thereby they would contract a guiltiness as the eagle were very unnatural if because she is able to do it she should perch a whole day upon a tree staring in contemplation of the glory and majesty of the sun and in the mean time let her young eaglets starve in their nest  both ancient and modern histories have furnished us with examples of some kings who have willingly resigned their kingdoms and deposed themselves but whether they did this merely out of a desire to live retiredly or to satisfy their sons being arrived at years fitting to rule that so they might see the succession settled in their own blood or to shun the tumults of rebellion or out of fear of some potent enemy or unaptness of government are great questions left as yet undecided in the world but if any prince has done so gallant an action which is so strongly withstood by human nature as to renounce a kingdom by virtue of a soul inamoured of that felicity which is enjoyed in a private life and that out of a welldisposed mind he preferred the peace of retirement before the hazards and trouble of reigning and that divested himself of his prosperous earthly condition purely that he might be happy that prince was not only truly wise but was undoubtedly more bound to god for giving him that power and that performance than for making him a king but that king who shrunk under the weight of government where men ought to show the greatest worth or has renounced his kingdom out of poorness of spirit that prince is much to be blamed for that the true moderation of soul is seen in gallantly undergoing cases of adversity and not in losing a mans self in prosperity  indeed prudent men that know themselves not able to withstand the temptations of the world will wisely and timely retire from it staggs when they find themselves too fat are said to retire for safety to the woods and thickets knowing that being burdened with their own weight they are not able to run if they should be hunted which if true shows a great providence in nature and if we seriously consider we shall find that multitude and abundance are far more troublesome than solitariness and want in abstinence there is only need of one duty but in the conduct and use of many things diverse duties are required thus the calling of a king or prelate is far more difficult than that of a monk or hermit and the sociable life is much harder than the solitary by how much it is more easy for a man to live altogether without a wife than in all points duly to live and maintain himself with her and therefore sir thomas overbury a very ingenious man was used to say that next to no wife a good wife was best for he that has wife and children servants estate and business has without comparison a more troublesome task than he that has none of all these and has only to do with himself facilius est domi latere quam foris se posse sufficienter custodire and therefore speculative judicious men do discreetly and piously that leave the employments of the world which require the whole man to give themselves some intervals to the office of men as they are men and christians  such retreats as these are most commendable where men sequester themselves from the troubles of the world that they may the better vacare deo and studiis for thus they do more good living out of the world than in it neither do such men as these embrace solitude out of meanness of spirit or for weakness of parts as not fit to attain greatness or not able to bear with the world but they do it purely that they may arrive at that happiness which is usually enjoyed in a retired virtuous life  history affords us many examples of men who have known how to compass the prime places and supreme dignities both in church and state who have had the acquisition of wealth and greatness in their power though not in their aim and who have with much honor relinquished riches to embrace poverty and to enjoy solitariness and retirement having voluntarily left the most gainful and weighty employments and after a full fruition of all earthly happiness and pleasure have taken a solemn leave of the world whilst yet fortune smiled upon them a great example in this kind was quintus mutius posthumous that noble roman who having been taken from the plow to be consul after he had governed that people and conquered their enemies he returned to his former employment and being ready to leave the senate he called for his balance and by putting the fasces the mark of his office or authority in one scale and his plow in the other did let the senators see those imperial ensigns were far the lighter and so took his leave of the senate and returned to his plow such men as these are truly happy who have left cares and troubles for calmness and quiet they possess a happiness which kings can neither keep themselves nor suffer amongst their neighbors these are so far from complaining of the world that they are content to forget it and are resolved neither to have war nor commerce with it having founded a retreat to all their passions as well the pleasing as the troublesome  but we shall find few men that will be content to do this thing seriously sudden wishes and indeliberate proffers and attempts to renounce the world are but rash pangs of seeming mortifications there are not many that will be content with a mean estate that will neglect wealth and abundance and desire god not to heap too much upon them but to abate of his portion there are but few that will with daniel refuse the kings delicacies and feed upon pulse and with the great st paul take pleasure in necessities many indeed will tell us they are resolved to quit the world both in mind and body but custom is a thing we often fall into by flying it and we shall not unfrequently hear men swear they will not swear i verily believe many of our loyal countrymen have had so sad experience of this world and do so little desire to learn that which they are ignorant of therein that they would be very glad to forget what they already know of it and do really wish they were like some of those hermits that inquired how cities were made and what kind of thing a king or a commonwealth was  there is no voice sounds better in a sober mans ears than that which cried to arsenius fuge sede tace which counsels men to give themselves satisfaction by their quiet retiring creed mihi qu been latuit been vixit said a wise man but yet wheresoever we are or in what condition soever if we can but tell our selves what and where we would be we may make any place or state happy to us for we are so composed that if abundance or glory scorch or melt us we have an earthly cave our bodies to go into by consideration and cool our selves and if we be frozen and contracted with lower and dark fortunes we have within us a torch a soul brighter and warmer than any without we are therefore our own umbrellas and our own suns  but as all shadows are of one color if we respect the body from which they are cast so all retirings into a shadowy life are alike from all causes only the employments and that upon which we bestow our time gives it the tincture and the beauty thus our shadows upon clay will be dirty and in a garden green and flowery so in our retirements if we only converse with earth we shall be like it that is unlike our selves but if we be engaged in more refined and intellectual entertainments we shall be something more than our selves that is than this narrow circumference of earth speaks us the soul being always like the object of its delight and converse and therefore well says the roman orator erigimur and latiores fieri videmur humana despicimus contemplantesque supera and caelestia haec nostra ut exigua and minima contemnuntur  however it is not enough to be only separated from the converse of people for though we have freed our selves from the court and from the market yet we are not thereby free from the principal torments of our life though we change places never so often yet may our vices follow us even into immured cloisters the hollow rocks the wearing hairshirts and continual fasting rid us not always from them for a holy habit cleanses not a foul soul and as socrates being asked why one who had been long abroad had not more improved himself by travel answered well because he had not left himself behind him when he went to travel so before a man leaves the world if he do not first discharge both himself and his mind from the burden that presses her retiring will but stir it the more and press it the harder as a sick man takes more hurt than good by changing place it is but settling an evil instead of removing it and if we cast back a kind look upon what we have left behind we still carry our fetters along with us and are not at liberty we ought therefore first to recover our selves from our selves for without managing our superior part all the pains taken about the inferior is to no purpose and he that only changes his cloth of gold for a monks habit and his point de venice for a demi collar shall without doubt be a loser by the bargain it is indeed no such easy matter as many men believe to make a safe retreat from the world to truss up our baggage and bid our company farewell this is a burden which few men can take up handsomely for a man to anticipate the accidents of fortune to deprive himself of his present advantages is an action of extreme difficulty as well as of an extraordinary virtue  but though the doing these things seem very severe to our worldly imaginations and to those who never had experience in themselves of this noblest operation of the soul yet does this retiring produce so great effects and carries with it such spiritual charms and delights that should good fortune her self come in person to find them out who are thus withdrawn to invite them again into the world yet would they shut their doors against her and though she should tell her name she should not be admitted the religious retired man is an inverted pyramid earth has but the least point of it a soul that dwells in heaven will not dabble in this impure mud or stoop to be a copartner in the delights of the creatures that have nothing but beast in them and though it be necessitated by its relation to flesh to a terrestial converse yet it is like the sun without contaminating its beams  thus religious persons when they come abroad into the world partake not of any worldly humor they can safely look upon the throng and more truly than socrates at the olympian games give god thanks that he has made them not to need those many things which others so vainly and violently pursue their raised contemplations enlarge and ennoble their spirits and infinitely advance them above the ordinary level such souls as these that were only lent the earth to show the world their folly in admiring it possess delights which in a manner antidate immortality and though at an humble distance resemble the joys above they receiving here some anticipations of immortal delights as pledges of their eternal rewards for there want not examples of some who have had their souls elevated to such a height of intellectual contemplation that god has made them as it were in some measure patterns of the happiness of the life to come which he has sometimes vouchsafed to show us here below to make us in love with the piece above in heaven  this divine contemplation is promus and condus coeli and situla gratiae it opens to us all the treasures of heaven this remedies all our sorrows settles and composes all our distractions and ravishes our spirits with unspeakable delights to which purpose st francis de sales says most divinely we see the restraints which religious persons put upon themselves we discern their outward bitterness but we are not able to apprehend their inward sweetness and delight the very fire and flames were to the martyrs flowers and perfumes  how injurious a scandal is it therefore which we are apt to cast upon religious persons representing them with angry and stoical countenances and defaming them with melancholy and unsociable humors believing retirement to be a state wherein the soul contracts a rust which cankers its own substance and makes it unpleasant to others whereas our savior assures us there is no life so pleasant and happy and though he himself is said never to have laughed yet his countenance is said ever to have been smiling and in full condemnation of morose humors it was prophesied of him quod non esset tristis in his conversation  it is indeed an ill way of judging that men cannot have piety in their hearts without austerity in their looks a virtue stuck with bristles is too rough when adorned with flowers it will be willingly entertained a cloudy discontented face is not the only or best sign of devotion very merry men have been very holy and devout men no man loves to see such religious whose thorns he is afraid will scratch him for christian philosophy has nothing in common with the cynick this disguiseth the other reforms the one composes the countenance the other regulates the spirit the truly religious are austere to none but themselves their thorns prick no body else it being a vulgar error to believe that those which retire with the greatest strictness should not have their diversions all the hours of their lives are not equally serious neither are all their sayings sermons it being a right most proper to them of all others to have this olium laetitiae this balm of their lives this spiritual alacrity which does even dignifie their service to god for these seek it where it is to be found and therefore we may be sure they gather it from the right tree it being the only fruit of a good conscience and since that is to them a continual feast there is no reason but they should be merry at it this is the substance of all their actions and their constant triumph having this they want nothing quamvis ipsis nihil est nihil deest all their treasure lies in the temple of wisdom which they do so well improve that they become living books to them that converse with them illustrating their minds without prejudice to their sight their instructions having much more of power and life than reading can possibly be capable of  of st mary magdalens life and conversion with some reflections upon the conversion of the good thief being in a place and season where every thing begins to bud i must do so too and vent some of my thoughts though perhaps as all other buds are yet without taste or virtue these lines may be also dull and insipid and though the pleasantness of the season invites me it does not much please me since i see every thing refreshes but i wither and grow older but not better my strength diminishes and my load grows heavier  there are certain rules for the bodys infirmities which if rightly observed will effect their cure but for the diseases of the mind there is no rule for our own taste and apprehension which should be the judge is the disease it self  i am now no more transported with jollity and the love of company having at present loads heavy at my heels which bring to my thoughts my ill fortune my old age the duties of a man of a subject of a husband of a father with all the encumbrances of a numerous family these thoughts deject me into sadness and melancholy and from thence into a serious contemplation of the troubles and miseries of this mortal life which have farther induced me in this time of solemn devotion to entertain my thoughts upon some divine subject the better to compose my mind and submit my will to the orders of divine providence  i know well as no beauty so no discourse has all voices even in the worst faces some eyes see features that please in the best some others see lines they like not some out of affection may plat a laurel for that head on which others in their opinion would bestow a thistle which may perhaps be my fate however i am not ambitious to hang the ivygarland at my door least i should seem like those hosts that use to meet their guests upon the way and promise beforehand a fair and ample entertainment let it please my reader rather to see and allow his cheer and then according to his own palate he may disgust or relish the cookery  i doubt not but many an accurate quill on the wing of contemplation has already taken a high flight upon this subject my only plea shall be he that cannot soar like the eagle may be allowed to flutter like the sparrow  the scripture is every where full of variety like a garment of several colors and upon the same loom of holy writ diverse workmen may according to their several fancies draw out some curious threads of observation and that brain is very unhappy that meets not with some traverse of discourse more than it has borrowed from anothers pen yet i will not contemn the judgment of the wise nor refuse to learn from any instructor i never read but of one foolish cock that refused a pearl though found on a dunghill mens assueta operi per mill volumina slers ambulat atque suos aliquid se ponit in usus   the laborious be is the emblem of a working brain which creature is set before us for a copy of industry it is not always droning upon one flower but throws her light aerie body upon a second so to a third till her thighs are loaded with a large collection it is no less indeed than a wonder that of almost the shadow rather than the substance of so very small a living creature nature has made so incomparable a thing i had rather imitate this laborious insect than challenge to my self arachnes motto mihi soli debeo i had rather bind up in this posie some choice flowers which i have here and there chosen and culled from the gardens of several authors than boast my self with that little arabian that i have eriscerated my self and spun a web out of my own bowels  having therefore imposed this task upon my self and finding nothing more particularly described in the new testament than several remarkable passages of the happy st mary magdalen i have thereupon thought fit to make her the principal subject of this discourse adding some reflections upon the conversion of the good thief and upon what happened to st mary magdalen in the pharisees house what afterward in her own and her sister marthas and what after christs death and resurrection  who this woman was is much controverted and is sooner questioned than answered i know such problematical disquisitions which have more subtilty than usefulness as erasmus on this very quaere says are superfluous and of them we may say as the philosopher did of the athenian shops how many things are here which we need not and therefore i shall omit these disquisitions and will not be curious where the scripture is silent whosoever she was she still carries the name of what for some time she was a woman that was a sinner  we commonly see some artificial pictures which according to diverse sights and aspects represent diverse things such an admirable piece with a double resemblance has st luke an excellent painter here delineated in the most lively colors look on one side you shall see a lascivious woman offering her self to sale in the most tempting manner step on the other side you may behold an admirable convert attended with a retinue of graces view it which way you will here is the word ecce behold like a curtain before some exact piece of workmanship which likewise has a double reference to the power of christ who drew this sinner and to his mercy who received her  in this noble history are several weighty circumstances like so many wedges of gold in a rich mineral and one ingot appears at the head of the mine behold a woman which is a word of emphasis and energy and if this star stand over the house a jesus is within here like janus it looks backward and forward and so i shall discourse of this woman both as a sinner and as a penitent and if it shall seem distastful that i insist a little longer than perhaps the reader may judge necessary on the particular sin for which this woman was publicly noted let me put him in mind of the answer which the comic poet gave who being accused of having brought a lewd debauched ruffian upon the stage and so setting a bad example to young men it is true says he i brought such a man on but i hanged him before he went off and so i gave them a good example here is a better lesson to be learned all women may accept this woman as a pattern to imitate and even the best may learn somewhat from her story for how sinful soever she may appear at first let us suspend our censure till the last act then we shall find how she became a lebete phiala of a caldron boiling with lust a crystal vial of pure chastity how she that at first was running apace into the dead sea did speedily turn into the path to paradise  i shall begin with her fall and consider her first as a sinner  but alas who is not so had she not been a sinner she had been a miracle he that knows himself to be a man knows himself to be a sinner for in the loins of our first parents we all sinned so that it is absurd to suppose a separation of sin from mans nature in our conceptions through that original pollution we are all warmed in unclean blood and still we continue ponere adam super adam to add new sin to our original sin this hereditary poison is inbred in every man and the sullage of adams clay sticks fast to us by adams sinning all his seed are become sinful and all his offspring as in a continued line do like corrupted branches of a rotten tree still bring forth corrupted fruits  the most perfect and glorious light in the world is the sun in the firmament yet has he his paralax and his variation and what son of adam was ever found through the zodiac of whose life an ecliptic could not be drawn a man without sin is like the mountain of gold or the philosophers stone which have no existance but in theory and the operation of the understanding in scholastical speculations you will hear the noise of such a being but you shall no sooner find him than the echo in the poet quem non invenis usquam esse putas nusquam such utopical perfection is only an idle dream of the donatists it is the voice of an apostle in many things we offend all nothing more certain than that corruption has deep root in gods peculiar people even their best works and they too like solomons sculpture a little upon a pillar rare and few will but weigh light in the scales of the sanctuary as the curtezan lais said philosophers did sometimes knock at her gates as well as other men so the best men are often overtaken by human frailties let the best do what they can they are but imperfectly good in some matter or other they step aside from gods commands it is a truth as clear as the sun that the seeds of sin are in all men the seeds not the practice there is not in all the same eruption but there is in all the same corruption some are kytes others hawks and the rest eagles and yet all from the same eyrie he that bears humanity about him he that is clothed with flesh and blood cannot but sin and yet though we cannot avoid being tempted yet we may shun the commission of sin it is one thing to dart and glance a wanton desire and another to court and plead for it though the motions of flesh be alike in all men yet the humouring those motions is not so it is one thing for a man to sin another to give himself over to the commission of sin this continuance in any notorious sin is not only a grave to the soul but a great stone rolled to the mouth thereof to keep it down  what erasmus says of paris that after a man has used himself to the odious scent of it it grows more and more agreeable to him is too true of sin which by long entertainment becomes customary and not easy to be dismissed  we know that an expert swimmer being under water feels not the weight of a full freighted ship of a thousand tuns riding perpendicularly over his head so whilst we swim in the custom of any pleasing sin we are insensible of the burden of it for frequency of sin does flesh us in immodesty assiduity in impudence and that sin is almost incurable that is steeled by custom which is a true character given of this woman who is not described as a woman who had sinned but a woman that was a sinner it was not a transient but a permanent condition that gave her that denomination her long continuance in her trade had branded her with this title a woman that was a sinner  this woman was of a noble descent and as is generally received was remarkable for a luxurious and incontinent life and in those loose days wherein herod erected his theaters and amphitheaters debauchery was very much encouraged and however wantons may flatter themselves and take that for true doctrine which the unwise tutor sometime spoke in the comedy non est creed mihi adolescenti it is no such fault in a young man to follow harlots yet it is such a sin as commonly drives to the devil at once a sin which once indulged becomes what may be called a pleasant madness  history tells us of a certain well in epirus that will quench firebrands if put into it and yet when they are quenched it will presently set them on fire again like this water is a lascivious woman when she quenches the lust of the body for a time she sets it on fire afterward much more wittily therefore fonseca the spaniard has emblemd this vice by the phoenix which does revive and renew her self by the fire which she kindles by the motion of her wings thus we mourn perhaps and bewail and repent of the sin we have committed and desire to give it over that it may die with us but with the wings of our thoughts we blow those coals afresh and make them flame more than before  thus we walk the round first we act a sin because the thought pleases us then we think that sin over again because the act has pleased us and amongst the great variety of sins there is none more plausible nor more pleasing to nature than wantonness how many set their souls burning in the flames thereof and as nero did when he had set rome on fire behold them with transport and delight how many silly wretches like the foolish lark whilst it plays with the feather and stoopeth to the glass are caught in the fowlers net for a lascivious woman to give a short but true character of her is the devils pitfall a trap to catch our souls her eyes like free doctors live upon the spoil of stragglers she baits her desires with a million of prostituted countenances her displayed breasts and loose glances locks wantonly waving over her shoulders her artificial complexion the counterfeit of the great seal of nature her curled hair the sophistry of the old cunning serpent her high washes and paintings are so many lures to bring the adulterer to the snare  but chaste thoughts will check and never stoop to such enticements for when fire falls on fuel that is wet it presently goes out  when potiphars wife one of the greatest ladies in egypt did inordinately affect impudently solicit and in a manner force the modesty of her good servant joseph how much rather did he leave his garment than his virtue nor did he rescue himself from adultery and danger by violence to her person nor neglect the duties he owed her as a servant but with the hazard of his name life and liberty he made an innocent escape to preserve his better garment of chastity  the arabian proverb is elegant obstrue quinque fenestras ut luceat domus shut the five windows that the house may be lightsome cleanse the limbeck of the senses least thence some pollution drop into the soul if at once we would overcome the temptation and the tempter we must resolve with alipius to shut our eyes when we come amongst vanities for the eye is the first part that is struck in such engagements upon the first assault it yields up our strongest fort the eye besides is the vainest of all the senses it takes extreme delight to be cheated one of the pleasures of the eye is the deception of it and how easy is that sense deluded which delights to be deceived  the ancient philosophers before aristotle that held vision to be performed by an emission of beams imagined the eye to be of a fiery nature wherein they were confirmed by observing if the eye had a blow fire seems to sparkle out of it but certainly how watery soever better experience has found the substance of the eye it is spiritually fiery both actively and passively passively for that it is inflamed by every wanton beam actively it sets the whole heart on fire with the inordinate flames of concupisence thus sichem saw dinah and defiled her viderunt oculi rapuerant pectora flammoe no sooner did he see her than his breast was inflamed with lust thus amon fell sick for tamars sake his desire of her began at the first interview thus when david walked upon the roof of his palace and discovered from thence a beautiful woman washing her self here was mulier long libido prope for his petulant eye recoiled upon his heart and smote him with vicious desires yet it is not the eye it self for what is that but the beauty of the face the bright star of the orb it moves in but the viciousness of the eye that is to be condemned when we talk with our eyes then it is that we sin with them but i dare not enlarge upon this subject for fear of committing that which was a noted fault in marcellus the rhetorition as suetonius tells us that lighting on a figure he would pursue it till he forgot the matter in hand i will therefore return to discourse more particularly of this woman so sinful in her life so hateful for her lust and so devoted to incontinence that she was become a common scandal for by her bad example she made the city so infamous that she might more fitly be called peccatum hierosolymae quam peccatrix the sin of jerusalem rather than a sinner in jerusalem as petrus chrysologus observes because the whole city shared the disgrace which she deserved  sin is sin wherever committed whether before a multitude or in a desert yet the more public the fact is the greater is the scandal and this womans offense was the more notorious because she was a city sinner  i confess that no place can secure one from temptations which come in too hastily and uninvited like rough winds from every corner of the sky and in such number as if each minute were computed by them  we are apt to fall because we are mutable but we do not commonly fall except some occasion be given and how full is the world of such occasions our common adversary the devil who has a thousand ways of attacking us finds how apt we are to stumble at something or other in our way he knows which way our corrupted nature bends he sifteth out what will work upon our affections and dispositions and with that he wooes our consent to sin like a skilful sailor he marks the wind and accordingly hoisteth up or strikes sail or like a cunning poet he gives every actor a part agreeable and makes a perpetual use of the bent of our nature thus has he a wedge of gold for covetous achan a crown for ambitious absalom and a dinah for sichem and the concurrence of time and place are his principal engines which serve to give aim to such faults as our nature is too apt to commit without a prompter then surely in a corrupt debauched city are more invitations to sin than in private cells in a large concourse of people you will find many brokers of villainy who live upon the spoil of the unthinking part of mankind where many pots are boiling there must needs be much scum where multitudes of strangers meet where variety of delights entertain the eye it is more difficult to avoid temptations for our nature herein is like fire which if there be any infection in the room draws it to its self or like jeat which omitting all more noble and precious things attracts only straws and dirt  it was in a city where this woman lived where by her lewd example she drew in others to offend and her example was more prejudicial because she was of a good family satans infections many times send their influence through some great star into lesser bodies for example is like a stone thrown into a pond which makes circles which dilate themselves till they are stopped by the banks or like a plague sore which infects the bystanders and lookers on  i do not find the name of the city set down yet many are bold to affirm it was naim others will have it jerusalem wherever she lived she was too well known in her time and having already showed what her offense was i will not lay my finger again upon that blot and having thus far drawn the black lines of her life i will now look on the other part and consider her as she has put off the sinner and as she is now become a penitent  scipio as livy says never looked so fresh nor appeared so lovely to the eyes of his soldiers as after his recovery from a dangerous sickness in the camp so neither does the soul ever seem more beautiful than when she is restored to health after some dangerous conflict the palladium was very much esteemed by both trojans and graecians not so much for the matter or workmanship as because it was snatched out of the flames of troy so no soul is more precious in the sight of god and his angels than that which is snatched out of the fire of hell and jaws of death  to see men turning from god to the world from piety to profaneness is as common as lamentable every days experience shows us such sights but to see men return to god is as happy as wondrous to men and angels and what is more strange we see the first disciples that came to christ were such as were most desperately enthralled to satan the magi publicans harlots the thief the blasphemer etc this shows the depth of christs unspeakable mercy who of the knottiest and most crooked timber can make rafters and cielings for his own house thus he can call a zachaeus from a tollbooth to be a disciple and matthew to be an apostle and this sinful woman to be a convert who it seems came to jesus in simon the pharisees house who had invited christ to eat with him  she came not as the staring multitude to glut her eyes with the sight of a miracle and his glorious person nor as did the centurion or the syrophenitian woman or the ruler of the synagogue for cure of her sickness or in behalf of her friend or child or servant but the only example of this sort of coming came for a cure not of any bodily grief or malady but for her sins she came with remorse and regret for them to lay her burden at jesuss feet to present him with a broken and penitent heart a weeping eye and great affliction for she came humbling her self and fell down before him weeping bitterly for her sins pouring out a flood of tears large enough to wash the feet of jesus which she wiped with the hairs of her head  purgata recessit per gemitum propriique lavans in gurgite fletus munda suis lacrymis redit and detersa capillis but amongst all the demonstrations of gods mercy we can never enough magnify his goodness and power in the conversion of the dying thief who was execrable amongst men and a blasphemer of god my soul is lost in amazement when i think of him the offender came to die nothing was in his thoughts but his guilt and torment christ was silent when he reviled him and being yet in his blood christ said this soul shall live his good spirit so breathed upon him and the force of his grace worked so instantly and powerfully that his last hour was his first wherein he knew his savior to be god in ipso crucis candelabro sol resplenduit the sun did shine upon him from the candlestick of the cross the light whereof was so powerful that it awakned this drowsy sleeping thief leaving him so well instructed that he presently burns with a zealous impatience he cannot hear the revilings of his companion but suddenly he becomes a convert chiding his fellowsufferer saying do not thou fear god seeing thou art in the same condemnation he confesses his sins we receive the just rewards of our deeds but this man has done nothing amiss wherein he shows himself a doctor to preach and lastly he becomes a martyr praying lord remember me when thou come into thy kingdom he that before had in his eye nothing but present death is now lifted above his cross in a blessed ambition lord remember me when thou comst into thy kingdom is this the voice of a thief or of a disciple dic o latro ubi thronus ex saphyro ubi cherubin and exercitus coeli ubi corona sceptrum and purpura ut eum dicas regem tell me o thief what induced thee to style him king where is his throne where are the cherubin and the whole host of heaven see thou any other crown than that of thorus any other scepter than strong iron nails driven up to the head through the palms of those blessed hands any other purple but his blood any other throne but his cross what do thou see that can persuade thee to call him king o faith greater than death that can look beyond a cross at a crown beyond dissolution at a remembrance of life and glory as no disciple could be more faithful so no saint could be more happy nam juxta fluenta plenissimae gratiam simul accepit and gloriam for grace and glory with a full tide both at once came flowing in upon him the reward every way outweighed the request magis velox erat praemium quam petitio and ubetior gratia quam precatio it was a greater favor says st leo to put this so discreet and humble a petition into this thiefs heart but a much greater favor to give him so good and quick a dispatch st cyprian says quid tu domine stephano amplius contulisti what could the martyr st stephen enjoy more or that beloved disciple that leaned on christs bosom or what could the long services of those that endured the heat of the day obtain more at gods hands but god gives them this answer i do thee no wrong did not thou agree with me for a penny  some laborers were working hard in the vineyard from the first hour others from the third others began at the ninth when the sun was setting first came adam then noah after him abraham and the rest of the holy prophets but this thief came at the sunsetting and he that in the morning was on his way toward hell is in the evening with his lord in paradise for no sooner had he cried lord remember but christ answers him immediately i say unto thee and promises thou shall and seals that promise with a verily and promises more than is asked and that soon verily i say unto thee thou shall this day be with me in paradise  so soon as christ afforded this thief any call he came and yet this thiefs conversion is become a proverb and satisfies and serves a sinner in all cases of a late and deathbed repentance but they that urge him as a precedent ought to consider that this thief was not converted at last but at first and when we can find out such another day we may expect such another mercy a day that opened the graves of the dead a day that divided the veil of the temple it self a day which the sun durst not see a day that saw the soul of god if i may so say seeing that god was man too depart from man there shall be no more such days and therefore we must not presume upon such mercy  to the chief of the apostles st peter christ says whither i go thou can not come but to this thief he says this day thou shall be with me in paradise so soon did christ bring this thief to that height of faith that even in that low estate upon the cross he prayed for a spiritual kingdom whereas the apostles themselves whom christ had estated in heaven and had given them reversions of judiciary places twelve seats to judge the twelve tribes yet in that exaltation when christ was ascending they talked to him of a temporal kingdom sic facit fides innocentem latronem facit infidelitas apostolos criminosos christ infused so much faith into this thief as justified him and leaves the apostles so far to their infirmities as endangers them  this thief came to know those wounds that were in christs body were his own wounds in the body of his savior so he came to declare perfect faith in professing christs innocence perfect hope in the memento mei and perfect charity in rebuking his companion he was such a thief as deserved praise and wonder who had a good bargain of death and was the better and longer lived for being hanged for he was thereby made partaker of christs martyrdom and kingdom and this thief has done nothing but what we may all do if we will lay hold on that grace as he did assumemus vocem latronis si nolumus esse latrones ut sedeamus a dextris pendeamus a dextris let us be content to suffer but suffer in the right suffering as a malefactor is somewhat too much on the left hand and yet even that suffering does bring many to the right hand being joined with a true and hearty repentance which is as a city of refuge to fly unto it is the happy plank that has saved many a soul from the gulf of despair the board which after shipwreck will carry us safe unto land and it is not ill compared to a phaenixs nest wherein the old adam is consumed to ashes out of which arises a new man of god for conversion is a sacred riddle wherein when we are born we are buried and when we are quickened we are killed and when we are mortified we are raised thus nineve was overthrown and yet not overthrown it was overthrown by sin and built again by repentance he that is a skillful penitent does cunningly play this aftergame and a sinner after his recovery for the most part seeks god more fervently and is more fearful of relapsing than before of sinning like wild beasts breaking from their toils they are more cautious for the future and the saints come out of the bed of their sins as hezekiah did out of his sick bed more humble more holy more penitent as the eagle that is wearied comes out of the water into which she has dipped her wings with a more towering ascent toward heaven than ever dum peteret regem says martial when mutius scaevola missed his aim and instead of killing porsenna slew one of his secretaries by mistake he presently offered that hand which gave the blow as a willing sacrifice to the flame which hand grew famous for being deceived and it had been less reputation to have struck his enemy to the heart than to punish it so stoutly for missing its aim upon which the poet took occasion to say major deceptae fama est and gloria dextrae si non errasset fecerat illa minus without any change i may apply it to mary magdalens conversion si non peccasset fecerat illa minus she would not have been so famous had she not sinned neither is this a parodox for what an enemy would upbraid by way of reproach is the greatest praise that can be their very sins do honor some as the devils did mary magdalen who are mentioned for her glory since we do not hear of them until they were cast out for repentance is a supercedeas that discharges sin making god to be merciful angels to be joyful and man to be acceptable and as st austin affirms it is a greater deliverance a mightier miracle and a bigger grace that a sinner should be converted than that being converted he should afterward be saved here we see mary magdalen being now touched with repentance for her former sins and vanities like the thirsty and panting heart in the extremity of heat does eagerly long for the cooling springs her soul was deeply wounded with the sting of her sins it stuck so fast that she could not get it out therefore with the wounded deer she comes to the sovereign dittany to expel it the pool of her conscience was troubled and with the descending angel instantly she steps in for a cure for ut cognovit venit as soon as she knew where jesus was she makes haste to him and the zeal with which she approaches christ is very remarkable christ was at dinner in a pharisees house where we may observe by the way that christ frequented feasts and we do not find he was ever invited to any table and refused it if a pharisee or a publican invited him he made no difficulty to go the end of his going indeed was not to eat but to gain souls to god and to fulfill the will of his father which was his meat and drink and at whose table did jesus ever eat and left not the host a gainer when zachaeus entertained him salvation came that day to his house with the author of it and now when this pharisee entertained him his table was honored with the public remission of a penitent sinner but how comes this woman to thrust her self into this pharisees house certainly great was her faith since no disadvantage could affright her from coming to jesus not the frowns nor the censure of a rigid host who darted from his eyes disdain and scorn seeing so notorious a strumpet come to the upper chamber where he entertained his company and that too in christs presence who knew her wicked life and no doubt was offended at her action a pharisees house might have seemed indeed an unlikely place to find a savior in and it was very improper to serve in tears at a banquet certainly the holy spirit moved on the waters doubtless this woman had heard from our saviors lips in his heavenly sermons many gracious invitations of all distressed and sinburthend souls and now at length she was entangld in the net of his heavenly doctrine for our savior as st chrysostom says has two sorts of nets a one of wonders another of words in the former of these he caught those many that believed on his name by the latter he enclosed his very enemies even those very officers that were sent to apprehend him and bring him before the high priest and still does our blessed savior spin out the thread of his love to an infinite length to try whether we will lay hold on it he does angle for us he sits in heaven lets down the line of his love and baits it with his mercy to see whether we will swallow it that he may catch our souls with such a hook was this woman taken she had treasured up his sayings in her memory she had observed that he not only pardoned sinners but received them into his presence she had observed the passages of his power and mercy and a deep remorse wrought in her self for her misspent life and surely had not the spirit of god wrought upon her ere she came she had neither sought nor found christ for those good graces which god finds in us are like the silver which joseph found in benjamins sack of his own putting in if his hand does not move the golden cymbal it will give no pleasant sound for our will herein is like a lower sphere which receives its motions from some first mover and we may believe the holy spirit first breathed and then that blast begat the shower of tears which mary poured out for first thus she being first moved by the spirit of god comes in and finds christ whom she sought she comes into his presence not empty handed but with a precious confection of ointment of nardus the chief of all ointments which she intended to bestow this delicate odoriferous perfume she brings in as rich a vessel a box of alablaster she used likewise a good decorum she did not presently pour out her ointment upon the feet of jesus but observing a decent order in her repentance and in this her laudable action first she gives the sacrifice of a broken heart she stood behind at jesuss feet her eyes sufficiently testified her godly sorrow which dropped down tears as fast as the arabian trees their medicinal gums she wept so plentifully that with those streams of penitence she began to wash his feet and did wipe them with the hairs of her head to show her abjection or neglect of her self thus cunningly in abasement of her self does this humble penitent like the syrophenitian woman like a dog lick her masters feet at the feet of christ she makes a general sacrifice of all those things wherewith she had offended him quot habuit in se oblectamenta tot de se fecit holocausta  peccavit meretrix oculis labrisque comisque inde luunt crimen lumina labra comae her eyes her lips her hair her ointment all the instruments of her sin were turned at her conversion into the means of life as the israelites that gave their jewels to the making of a calf did afterward bestow them upon the lords tabernacle such was this womans practice who having now taken leave of her former vanities and disrobed her self of all her rich ornaments does like an excellent apothecary that knows how to mix his medicines make a most sovereign antidote out of a most deadly poison  she used to send forth her alluring beams into the eyes of the lascivious paramours therefore from her eyes flow a deluge of tears shallow enough to bear the ark of her sorrow she had made her lips the incitements to lust and inlets to vanity but now they sanctify themselves with their respect to the son of god her hair which she had so often curled at her glass does now serve for a towel to dry his feet her odoriferous perfume wherewith she used to make her self acceptable to her amorous companions she bestows on those sacred feet which her eyes had watered her hair dried and her mouth kissed and this strange circumstance of her anointing was scarce done to any but christ nor to him but by this woman it was esteemed so great an ecstasy of love and adoration that to anoint the feet even of the greatest monarch was long unknown in all the pomps and greatness of the roman prodigality it was not used as pliny says in his natural history till otho taught it nero in whose instance it was by pliny reckoned for a prodigy of unnecessary profusion and in it self it was a present for a prince and an alablaster box of nard pistick was sent as a great present from cambyses to the king of aethiopia  but was the ointment so precious and she so poor that she could not bring a napkin certainly she wanted not fine linen to have dried christs feet with but to show her hearty devotion and sincere humility her shame her tears her godly sortow were not enough she still seeks farther to make her self more vile and of no price before christ she her self is the servant that waits on him from her self do fall the dews of water that wash his feet and as her eyes were the ewer so her hairs were the towel using the chiefest ornament of her head in the meanest office of our saviors feet and thus she seems to climb up toward heaven by the same rounds of that ladder by which she was formerly going down to hell  when simon the pharisee observed this woman so busy in the expression of her religion and veneration of jesus he thought within himself this was no prophet that did not know her to be a sinner and that would suffer her to touch him for although the jews religion did permit the harlots of their own nation to live and enjoy all the privileges of their nation except only that their oblations were refused yet the pharisees who pretended to a greater degree of sanctity than others would not permit them to civil usages or benefits of ordinary society and thought religion it self and the honor of a prophet was concerned in the same superstitiousness and therefore simon made an objection within himself which jesus knowing who understood his thoughts as well as his words made an apology for her and himself by a civil question expressed by way of parable of two debtors to whom a greater and a smaller debt respectively was forgiven both of them concluding that they would love their merciful creditor in proportion to his mercy which was mary magdalens case who because she had much forgiven loved much and expressed it in characters so large that the pharisee might read his own incivility and unhospitable entertainment of the master when it stood confronted with the magnificency of mary magdalens charity and penance the last of which she sufficiently expressed by her tears  such is gods goodness that he has placed in the eye both the disease and the cure the faculty of seeing and the sluice of tears that they who offend by seeing may be recovered by weeping tears are the favorites that have the ear of the king of heaven they are our bills of exchange which he allows and returns them with what sums of blessings we desire so long as we pay him this type of our devotion so long is our tenure safe and our title to his goodness and mercy unquestionable  this sovereign water will recall a sinner to the life of grace though never so far gone these heavenly showers are the streams of jordan which cure our leprosy the silim to cure our blindness the bethesda to heal our lameness and defects of obedience never was the poison of any sin so cold but the hand of repentance could thaw it never was the flame of any sin so hot but the tears of repentance could cool it magis frugiferae lacrymantes vineae the bleeding heart like the dropping vine is for the most part fruitful i cannot here express my thoughts of mary magdalens tears in a better strain than that of the poet magdala dum tristi vitiorum compede vincta solvendam domini se jacet ante pedes quam dulces fundit lacrymas quam nobile flumen nascitur ex oculi divise font sui pactolus tali se vellet origire nasci vellet and auriferi nobilis unda tagi illi etenim solum voluunt sub fluctibus aurum at fluit ex oculis plurima gemma suis   her ointment indeed was precious but her tears were more so her tears were her best advocates to plead for mercy at the throne of grace interdum lacrymae pondera vocis habent for sometimes tears have as much force as words she spoke not for she knew she was before one who knew the most retired thoughts and most private desires of her soul what need her tongue speak when her eyes her hands her gesture her countenance and her whole behavior spoke her desires  amongst other things observable in the greater and more solemn feasts of the jews there were some ceremonies used by them as preparations to their feasts which josephus tells us were three first their salutation which was shown either by words or some humble posture of the body sometimes by prostrating their whole body sometimes by kissing the feet as in this passage and commonly by an ordinary kiss of the cheek as a pledge of their welcome to their guest the second was the washing of their feet before they sat down to eat the third compliment was pouring oil upon the head in all which observances simon though of the formal sect of the pharisees was defective insomuch that our savior taxes him of this neglected office in his entertainment thou gave me no water for my feet etc and well might the pharisee read his own fault in the praise christ gave of this woman so well seen in the customs of her country in redoubling of her kisses of an humble thankfulness on those sacred feet  to repent then is to kiss the feet of jesus and it is all one to be sorry for our sins and to love him this is confirmed by our saviors words who denominates this whole action from love christ says not she wept much she sorrowd much but she loved much and by all means she sought to express her great love which great mercy raised for nothing she had was too dear with her most precious and fragrant ointment she anointed our saviors feet that rich and costly testimony of her love she bestowed freely for she did not drop but pour not a dram or two but a whole pound not reserving any but breaking the box and pouring it all out what went before was the sacrifice of a broken heart with that first sacrifice she adored the divinity of christ this last she tendreth to his humanity the first shower of her tears were tears of sorrow and repentance the latter which overtook the first were tears of joy and love and so pleasing to christ were all the actions of this perfect penitent that he not only defended her against the pharisee in preferring her kindness to the entertainment of his house but against satan and the powers of hell in forgiving her many sins without any enumeration of them this is the substance of what passed betwixt jesus and mary magdalen in the pharisees house but i cannot leave this happy convert there but must follow her to bethany to see her comportment there and at our saviors death and after that at his resurrection  jesus having left jerusalem in the  d year of his public ministry after he had wept over it he came to bethany where he met with another sort of reception than he had at the holy city there he supped where martha making great preparations for his entertainment to express her joy and affection to his person desired jesus to dismiss her sister mary from his feet who sat there feasting her self with the food of angels the words of god unmindful of providing for his entertainment but jesus commended her choice and though he did not expressly refuse marthas civility yet he preferred marys religion here mary magdalen who had spent before one box of nard pistick upon our lords feet as a sacrifice for her conversion now bestowed another in thankfulness in restoring her brother lazarus to life and consigned her lord to his burial and here too she met with an evil interpreter judas an apostle one of christs own family pretended it had been better to have given it to the poor but it was malice and the spirit of envy that spoke not religion for he that sees an action well done and seeks to undervalue it by telling how it might have been done better reproves nothing but his own spirit for a man may do very well and god will accept it though to say he might have done better is to say only that action was not the most absolute and perfect in it is kind but the end of that man best showed his present meaning and at the best it could be no other than a rash judgment of the action and intent of mary magdalen and by his declaiming against her he made tacit reflections upon his lord for suffering it and yet it is not intimated in the history of the life of jesus that judas had any malice against the person of christ for when afterward he saw the matter was to end in the death of the lord he repented but a base unworthy spirit of covetousness possessed him and the relics of indignation for missing the price of the ointment burnt in his bowels with a secret dark melancholy fire and broke out into an action which all ages of the world could never parallel to what end was this waste of ointment says judas for it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence and been given to the poor but jesus said let her alone why trouble you her she has wrought a good work on me  as this was well intended it was well taken by christ and approved of by all present except judas who liking his own gain better than any scent in the apothecaries shop seeing that spent on his masters head which he wished in his own purse grumbled at it and that with so colorable a pretense that it was a needless expense a waste and that it might have been bestowed much better for the relief of the poor as that judas drew some of the disciples to favor the motion and to dislike mary magdalen and her action so that both they and he joined in one bill but he of wretched covetousness of mind and they of a simple plain intent and purpose thinking all that was wellspoken was wellmeant so that the action was not brought only against her that bestowed it but against christ that admitted it whereupon he pleads her cause not only excusing her but commending it as a good work and yet the ointment was not so pleasing to his sense as her gratitude was to his spirit for he then declared that the ointment which filled the house with the scent should fill the whole world with the report of it and as far as the gospel should be preached so far should the remembrance of her action reach as well for her commendation as for our imitation  thus we see things well done are oftentimes ill taken and often good intentions want good constructions no person had such experience of this as mary magdalen the scripture records three several virtues of hers and in each of them she was murmurd at when in the bitterness of her soul she showed her repentance by tears simon the pharisee did what he could to disgrace her when sitting at christs feet martha her sister complained of her to christ and now here again the third time when in an honest regard of her duty she is showing her thankfulness for comfort received christs own disciple speaks against her so that if she washes christs feet with tears it contents not if she anoints his head with balm its matter of displeasure and if she sits still and says nothing it is all one still mary magdalen is in fault her doings ever stand awry this is the fortune of all that follow her steps even christ himself could neither have his feet anointed but simon the pharisee nor his head anointed but judas his apostle speaks against it  but we must not leave mary magdalen here for notwithstanding these great discouragements and rebukes which she received from judas and some of the disciples she neglected not her duty nor left her lord till his death for loving christ more than her life she followed him in his journey to his death attending him when his disciples fled being more willing to die with him than to live without him she was last at his cross and first at his grave staid longest there and was soonest here she could not rest till she was up to seek him sought him before the day lighted her she stood by the grave where faint love uses not to stand we bring our friends to the grave and there leave them but come no more at it nor stay longer by it but mary magdalen did and she only and none but she as we shall see by the sequel of this discourse  we find in the whole tenor of the gospel that god observes a mixture of much spiritual power and glory with much outward meanness the gospel is called a rich treasure in an earthen vessel the mystery conveyed is precious but the means of conveyance mean and contemptible the whole mystery of christ is made up of power and meekness his conception was by the holy ghost of a pure virgin but the outside mean his blessed mother an earthen vessel the spouse of a poor carpenter his birth published by an angel but discovered first to poor shepherds his lodging pointed out by a star and yet his cradle but a manger his nursery but a stable being in the wilderness he was attended by angels but see the poor outside he was amongst wild beasts in his agony he was full of trembling and horror but then he received comfort from heaven by an angel at his death he was crucified with thieves but yet the powers of heaven and earth trembled at it the tidings of his resurrection were told by an angel but spread through the world by poor weak women had flesh and blood had the management of the news of his resurrection it would have been first published to the college of the apostles and st peter should have had the first intelligence by a vision of angels directed to him kings and princes make known their minds to inferior people by their great officers and ministers but the court of heaven takes other measures god employs poor and in the eye of the world contemptible men to declare his will to the potentates of the world and this was the grand objection made by the mistaken pagans to christ and his disciples that christianity was set on foot by such abject and mean persons as christ made choice of but that which begat in them contempt and scorn ought to fill us with wonder and admiration  and to make amends for that observation that no good angel ever assumed the likeness of a woman here are women of whom m magdalen was chief made angels i e as the original signifies messengers and publishers of the greatest mystery of our religion for m magdalen with other devout women who not considering the resurrection of christ went with a pious intention to do an office of respect and honor to the body of their master which they meant to embalm in the tomb where they thought to have found it there was god the god of life dead and laid in a grave and here was man a dead man risen out of the grave here are angels of heaven employed in so low an office as to instruct women and women employed in so high an office as to instruct the apostles here are angelical women and evangelical angels angels made evangelists to preach the gospel and women made angels to be instructors of the church  now though it has been doubted whether the blessed virgin was there when this passed at the sepulcher yet that mary magdalen and mary the mother of james and salmone were there is certain  they came to embalm the body of jesus for the rights of embalming amongst the jews used to last forty days and their love was not satisfied with what joseph had done but herein they were very inconsiderate for that was only done upon such bodies as were extenerated and embowelld and then filled up and plastered about with spices and gumms to preserve them from putrefaction when they were to be carried into remote parts but of these reembalmings after the body had been laid in the sepulcher i never read neither seems it to have been possible for these women to have come at the body of christ and by the winding sheet of christ which is kept in savoy it appears that that sheet stuck so close to the body as that it did and does still retain the demensions of his body and the impressions and marks of every wound that he received in his body so that it would have been no easy matter for these women to have pulled off that sheet if it had been fastened to his body with nothing but his blood but if as some authors say his body was carried loose in the sheet which is showed in savoy from the cross to the sepulcher and then taken out of that sheet and embalmed by nicodemus and wrapped up in other linen upon those spices and gums which he bestowed upon it and then buried according to the manner of the jews whose custom it was to swath the bodies of the dead as we do children all over for so lazarus came out bound hand and foot with gravecloaths how could these women think to embalm the body of jesus so swathed and bound up as that body was for certainly it was the body not the gravecloaths they meant to embalm and it seems strange that no one has touched upon this doubt all expositors make good use of their piety and devout care of their dead master but of the impossibility of their coming to the body of the irregularity of their undertaking that and proceeding so far in that which could not possibly be done there is no mention indeed crysologus says saeva passionis procella turbaverat that a bitter storm of passion and consternation had so disordered them as that no faculty of theirs could perform their right function and praefervose caecutiebant earnestness had so discomposed and amazed them as they discerned nothing clearly nor did nothing orderly another inconsiderate action of these women was the removing the stone of the sepulcher for they had prepared their gumms and were on the way to the sepulcher before they thought of that then they stop and say one to another who shall roll away the stone from the sepulcher yet they still go on and their love answers the objection not knowing how it should be done but yet resolving to go through all difficulties but never think how they should pass the guard that was set at the tomb but when they came there they found the guard affrighted and removed and the stone rolled away for a little before they arrived there had been a great earthquake and an angel descending from heaven had rolled away the stone and sat upon it with the terror of his appearance and the earthquake the soldiers were astonished and were like dead men and some of them ran to the high priest and told what had happened hereupon the women finding the door open entered into the sepulcher and missing the body of jesus m magdalen ran to the eleven apostles complaining that the body of our lord was not to be found they thought this story the product of a weak and frightened fancy however peter and john ran as fast as they could to see for the unexpectedness of the relation the wonf the story and the sadness of the n moved them they presently ed to the garden but john being ounger and the nimbler outran ompanion and came first thither e he only peeped but went not in r out of a fear in himself or a great rence to our savior peter though d in the way was before in his  and being older and more consie came and resolutely entered ine sepulcher where he found no but the linen clothes lying toer in one place and the napkin ad been about his head wrapped her in another which being disd with so much care and order d that our saviors body was not n away by thieves as the jews d have it who use to be more care consulting their own safety and pe than of leaving things orderly sd behind them  y this time m magdalen was come  again to the sepulcher where the r women had stayed for her and  the angel speaks to them and s them of another gross absurdity ebukes them for it why seek ye the g amongst the dead why him who is the son of the living god the prince of life who has life in himself and who is life it self amongst the tombs of dead mortals what makes you think of arming him with gumms against putrefaction who told you before he was not subject to corruption but would rise again m magdalen also fell into such another error for when the angel had told her at the sepulcher he is not here for he is risen as he said yet when she came running to peter she said nothing of the resurrection never thought of that but poured her self out in that lamentation they have taken away our lord whereas if she had considered she must necessarily have known from the angels words that no man had taken away the lord that no man had laid him any where else but that by his own power he was risen but as in this storm of passion they left christs promise that he would rise unconsiderd never remembered the rolling of the stone from the door of the sepulcher neither did they consider the impossibility of coming to christs body to do the office they intended their devotion was awake but their consideration was not so however they did not lose all the benefits of their pious and devout intention for the angel did not forbear to comfort them with do not ye fear let them continue in fear that remain in unbelief and have no god to comfort themselves in let those mercenary soldiers that are hired to watch the sepulcher fear and never recover but why should you fear who see none but us your fellowcitizens in the service of god if your conversation be in heaven as it is if you do truly seek that jesus who is risen that he might go thither  it seems the other women who came with m magdalen and stayed till peter and john had been there to make trial of m magdalens report as they were speedy in coming and diligent in searching christ so they were in haste to be gone when they could not find him and fearful of farther seeking and their departure commends m magdalens staying behind to the grave she came before them from the grave she went to tell them thither she returns with them and there she stays behind them a stronger affection fixed her and so fixed her that she had not power to remove thence  to stay whilst company stays that is the worlds love but peter is gone and john is gone and the women are gone and she left alone and to stay alone shows constant love she stood and wept she wished to find christ and therefore wept for his absence whom she dearly loved whilst she had him she bitterly bewailed him she thought lost and having lost the sight of her life she desired to dwell in the dark choosing christs tomb for her best home and there stood weeping she abandoned the living for the company of the dead and now it seems that even the dead have forsaken her since the body she seeks is taken away from her it was love induced her to stand and sorrow forced her to weep her eye was watchful to seek whom her heart most loved to enjoy and her feet in a readiness to run if her eye could chance to espy him but as she watched to find her lost lord she wept for having lost whom she had loved for as first she mourned for the departure of his soul out of his body so now she lamented the taking his body out of the grave for though her first sorrow was because she could not enjoy him alive yet she hoped at least to have found him dead to which purpose she had prepared her spices and provided her ointments to pay him the last duties and though joseph and nicodemus had already bestowed a hundred pound of myrrh and aloes which was as well applied as art and devotion could desire yet such was her love that she would have thought any quantity too little without the addition of her own she came therefore now intending to embalm his corpse as she had before anointed his feet and as in the spring of her felicity she had washed his feet with her tears bewailing unto him the death of her own soul so now she came in the depth of her misery to shed them again for the death of his body but when she saw the grave opened and the body gone the labor of embalming was prevented but the cause of her tears increased and though she found no use for the spices yet she found how to employ her tears now as much afflicted for his loss as before she had been pleased at his presence but since weeping without searching was to no purpose her weeping hindered not her inquiry her sorrow dulled not her diligence she often stooped and looked into the grave but why should she now look in since peter had been in the tomb and john had looked in before however she will not trust either peters or johns eyes nay she will not trust her self she will suspect her own senses she will rather think she looked not well before than leave off looking and thus hoping in despair and despairing in hope she stood at the sepulcher without fear because she thought now nothing left that ought to be feard but with what hope or with what heart could she stand alone at the tomb when the disciples were gone for her eyes had seen and peters hands had felt that the lord was not there the empty winding sheet did also confirm it and yet nothing could make her believe it her disappointed love had drowned both her mind and memory so deep in sorrow and so amazed her senses by his absence that all remembrance of his former promises was diverted with the crowd of present troubles for doubtless had she remembered him as she should have done she would not have thought the tomb a fit place to seek him in neither would she have mourned for him as dead and removed by the treachery of others but joyd in him as revived by his own power but sorrow had quite stupifyd her senses distempered her thoughts discouraged her hopes awaked her passions and left her no other liberty than to weep she wept therefore and as she was weeping she stooped down and looked into the sepulcher and saw two angels in white one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of jesus had been laid angels in a grave a strange sight never seen before that sure was a place fitter for worms than angels they were in white too a color expressive of joy heaven mourned at his passion the eclipse of that day showed them all in black but at the resurrection they rejoice they are now all in white even the heavens and angels they were sitting the one at the head the other at the feet which may be referred to mary magdalens having anointed his head and his feet they sat at these two places as it were to acknowledge so much for her sake between the angels there was no striving for places he that sat at the feet was as well contented as he that sat at the head but with us both angels would have been at the head never a one at the feet and they said unto her woman why weepest thou they asked her why she wept believing she had no cause all was in error tears of grief but false grief imagining him to be dead that was alive she wept because she found the grave empty which god forbid she should have found full for then christ must have been dead still for want of belief in his resurrection she believed he was carried away she erred in so believing there was error in her love but there was love in her error and it was a great argument of her love to call him lord after he had suffered the most opprobrious and ignominious death such as would have made many blush to own him  when she looked first she saw no angel and then of a sudden looking down she saw two yet the suddenness and gloriousness of the sight moved her not at all she seemed to have no sense of it but wept on which was strange for here methinks her good fortune exceeds her hopes and where her last sorrow was bred her first succor arises for she sought but one and she found two one dead body was the cause of her errand and she found two alive her weeping was for a man and her tears have found angels who invite her to a parley and seem to pity her case they sit at the tomb to show they are no strangers to her loss they spoke to her as though they had some special message to deliver to her and if she had asked them concerning her master they were the likeliest to give her a satisfactory answer and to have told her the cause of their coming and the reason of her lords remove but nothing could move her to admit comfort or to entertain any company for having vowed her self to christ alone except to him she will neither lend her ear nor borrow others help besides whatever they could tell her if they told her not of him and whatsoever they told her of him if they told her not where he was both their telling and her hearing were but a wasting of time for she came not thither to see angels but him who made both her and them and to whom she owed more than to men and angels and being full of wavering uncertainties and perplexed thoughts she began to think if she staid there by the tomb where he was not she should never find him and if she would go farther to seek she knew not whither to part with the tomb was death to her and to stand helpless by it would do no good so that all her comfort was that she must either stay there without help or go without hope then she blamed her self for leaving him when she had him thus to lament him now she had lost him and for departing when it was time to stay and returning when it was too late to help forgetting what her master used to say when he told her he would rise again the third day but why does she torment her self with these tragical surmises does she think the angels would sit still if their god were not well did they serve him after his fasting and would they despise him after his decease if in the garden he might have had twelve legions of angels as he said is his power so gone with the life of his body that he could not now command them was there an angel found to help daniel to his dinner to save toby from the fish and to defend balaams poor beast from his masters rage and is the lord of angels of so little concern that if his body wanted it no angel would defend it but she saw two there to honor his tomb and how much more careful would they be to do homage to his person she might well think they would not smile if she had just occasion to weep they would not so gloriously sit in white if a black and mourning weed did better become them  but why did her sorrow question so much about the place where they had laid her lord might not she better suppose that he was in paradise for since he came to repair adams ruins and to be the common parent of our redemption as adam was of our original infection twas reasonable that having endured all his life the penalty of adams exile he should after death reenter upon a possession of that inheritance which adam lost and besides if her sorrow at the cross had not made her as deaf as at the tomb it made her forgetful she could not but have remembered what he himself said to one of the thieves that the same day he should be with him in paradise  whilst mary magdalen thus lost her self in a labyrinth of doubts mixing tears with her words and warming them with sighs she saw the angels with a kind of reverence as though they had done honor to one behind her whereupon she turned back and saw jesus standing but knew not that it was him for when jesus saw that nothing would give her comfort but himself that no angels no sight no speech of others would serve then her lord comes and from seeking him dead she finds him alive but first he comes unknown stands by her and she did not suspect that it was he she not only knew not that twas jesus but mistook him for the gardener proper enough it was and fitted well with the time and place it was the spring and in a garden and she did not mistake in taking him for a gardener though she might seem to err in some sense yet in another sense she was in the right for in a spiritual sense christ may be said to be a gardener for of the first the fairest garden that ever was paradise he was the gardener it was of his planting and ever since it is he that makes all our gardens green sends us yearly the spring and all the herbs and flowers we gather in the season and it is he that gardens our souls too and weeds out of them whatsoever is prejudicial to or destructive of his word sown in our hearts he sows them with the true roots of all christian virtues waters them with the dew of his grace and makes them bring forth fruit to eternal life  besides all this christ on the day of his resurrection was most properly a gardener and that a strange one who made such an herb grow out of the ground that day as the like was never seen before except in the instance of lazarus raised by him a dead body to shoot forth alive from the grave  but was it possible that mary magdalen could forget jesus whose faith had fixed him in her understanding her love in her will both fear and hope in her memory for him her eye weeps her thoughts greive her whole body faints her soul languisheth and there was no part of her that was not busy about him and yet she had forgotten him his countenance and voice assure her his words witness it her eyes behold him and yet she knew him not but there was such a shower of tears between her and him and her eyes were so dimmed with weeping for him that though she saw the man she could not discern jesus and therefore as he seems to her a stranger he asks the same question of her which the angels had only quickens it a little with woman why weepest thou whom seek thou if she seeks christ why knows she him not and if she knows him why does she seek him whom she sees it is a common thing with us to seek a thing and when we have found it not to know we have  scarce three days ago she saw him hanging on a tree with his head crowned with thorns his eyes full of sorrow his ears filled with blasphemies his mouth fed with gall his whole person mangled and disfigured his arms and legs racked with violent pulls his hands and feet board with nails his side wounded with a spear his whole body torn with scourges and goard with blood and yet christ asks her why she weeps and not without cause does he ask this question because she would have christ alive and yet wept because she did not find him dead she was sorry he was not there and for that very cause she should rather have been glad for if he were dead she might have expected to see him there but his not being there was a sign he was alive but she still taking jesus to be the gardener said unto him if thou have carried him from hence tell me where thou have laid him and i will take him away to ask christ for christ seems somewhat strange which however it falls out in other matters here it was safe even when we seek christ to pray christ to help us to find christ for we cannot come to him except he draws us but mary magdalen seems something more harsh to christ than to the angels to them she complains of others saying they have taken him away but she seems to charge christ at least to suspect him of the fact as if he had looked like one that had been a robber of graves her if implies as much but love as it fears where it need not so it suspects without cause but st bernard speaks to christ for her domine amor quem habebat in te and dolor quem habebat de te excusat eam apud te si forte erravit circa te the love she bore him the sorrow she had for him may excuse her if she were in any error concerning him in her saying si sustulisti her affections seem to transport her as she says no man knows what to one a mere stranger to her and she to him she talks to one thrice under the name of him if thou have taken him tell me where thou have laid him and i will fetch him alas poor woman she was not able to lift him there goes more than one or two either to the carrying of a corpse as for his it had more than a hundred pound weight of myrrh and other odours upon it  she charged not the angels with his removal nor seemed to mistrust them for she did not request them to inform her where he was laid but now she judges the gardener to be the author of her loss being almost fully persuaded that he was privy to the place and acquainted with the action and though she was not altogether in the right yet she was not much in the wrong and erred with such aim that she missed very little of the truth  but since she was so desirous to know where jesus lay why did not she name him when she asked for him she says only she will take him away her courage seems above the strength of a woman neither does she remember that all women are weak she promises without condition she makes no exception as if nothing were impossible that her love suggesteth it was indeed wonderful that love had so bereaved her of sense that though she saw the angels she could not see jesus she sought for one whom when she had found she knew not and not knowing him when she found him she sought for him when she had him but alas how could poor mary believe that after her lord had lived so long labored so much died with such pain and shed such showers of blood he should come to no higher a preferment than to be a gardener was a sorry garden the best inheritance her love could have imagined for him or a gardiners office the highest dignity she could allow him it had been better he had lived to have been lord of her castle of magdalen than with his death so dearly to have purchased so mean a post  but her mistake has in it a farther mystery though her sight was deceived she thought not amiss for as our first father in his state of innocence was placed in a garden of pleasure and his first office was that of a gardener so the first man that ever was in glory appeared first in a garden and presented himself in the likeness of a gardener that the beginning of glory might resemble that of innocence and grace and as that gardener was the foil of mankind the parent of sin and author of death so this was the raiser of our ruins the ransom of our offense and the restorer of life in a garden man was deceived and ensnared by the devil in a garden christ was betrayed and apprehended by the jews in a garden adam was condemned to eat his bread in the sweat of his brows and after a freegift of the bread of angels in the last supper christ did earn it us with a bloody sweat of his whole body and as by disobedient eating the fruit of a tree our right to the garden of paradise was forfeited by adam so by the obedient death of christ upon a tree a far better right is now settled and as when adam sinned in the garden of paradise he was then apparelled in the skin of a dead beast that his clothing might betoken his grave and his livery of death agree with his condemnation to die so to defray the debt of that sin in this garden christ lay clad in the dead mans shroud and buried in his tomb that as our evils began so they might end and such places and means as were the premises of our misery might be also the end of our misfortune and for these reasons mary magdalen was allowed to mistake that we might be informed of the mystery and see how aptly the course of our redemption did answer the process of our condemnation  but why could not mary magdalen as well see what in truth christ was as what in show he seemed to be but she thought so to have found him as she left him and she sought him as she saw him last being so overcome with sorrow for his death that she had neither room nor respite in her mind for any hope of his life and therefore she asked the gardener if thou have carried him hence tell me where thou have laid him and i will take him  but one would be ready to think her master was very unkind to leave her so long without comfort and to punish her so much who so well deserved pardon she did not follow the tide of his better fortune to shift sail with the stream she left him not in his lowest ebb she revolted not from his last extremity in his life she served him with her goods in his death she departed not from his cross and after death she came to dwell with him in his grave  but now christ begins to take pity on her her tears were too mighty orators to let her suit fall though they pleaded at the most rigorous bar they tie the tongues of all accusers and soften the rigor of the severest judge they win the invincible and bind the omnipotent when they seem most pitiful they have the greatest power and being most forsaken they are more victorious for this water her heart had been long a limbeck sometimes distilling it from the weeds of her own offenses with the true fire of contrition sometimes of the flowers of spiritual comforts with the flames of contemplation and at other times out of the bitter herbs of her masters miseries with the heat of a tender compassion her tears that were heretofore the proctors for her brothers life were now the inviters of those angels in the monument for her comfort and the suitors that shall be rewarded with the first sight of her revived savior for when christ saw all was in vain that neither men nor agels nor himself so long as he kept himself a gardener could get any thing out of her but that her lord was gone he was taken away and that nothing but jesus could yield her any comfort he is no longer able to contain but even discloses himself and that by his voice and now christ is found alive that was sought dead a cloud may be so thick as to hide the sun from our sight the sun must scatter that cloud and then we may see its light here is an example of it a thick cloud of heaviness had so obscured mary magdalens eyes that she could not see him through it this one word these two syllables mary from his mouth dispels all the darkness no sooner had his voice sounded in her ears but it drove away all the mist dries up her tears opens her eyes and she knows him and answered him with her wonted salutation rabboni thus the gardener did his part brought mary magdalen from a dead and drooping to a lively and cheerful estate she sought christ dead and imprisoned in a stonygrave and finds him both alive and at full liberty she sought him in a shroud more like a leper than himself left as the model of the utmost misery and the only pattern of the bitterest unhappiness and now she finds him invested with robes of glory the owner and giver of all felicity she that had so long sought without finding wept without comfort and called without answer is now fully satisfied with this one word mary having heard him call her in his wonted manner and usual voice this one word restored her senses enlightened her mind quickened her heart and revived her soul  but why did christ choose to be made known to her by the ear rather than by the eye by hearing rather than by appearing because her eyes were holden till her ears were opened the philosophers tell us hearing is the sense of wisdom and in matters of faith the ear goes first and is of more use and to be trusted before the eye no sooner had christs voice sounded in her ears but she knew forthwith it was he and being ravished with his voice and impatient of delays a sudden joy so overprest her by so unexpected a presence and so many miracles laid at once before her that she could no more proceed in her own than give christ leave to go forward with his speech but falling at his sacred feet she offered to bath them with tears of joy and to kiss his late grievous but now most glorious wounds but christ forbad her saying touch me not this seemed a strange rebuke to mary who when dead in sin she touched his mortal feet and now being alive in grace she was denied to touch his glorious feet being commanded from that for which she was before commended by our savior alas what harm had there been if he had suffered her to touch him before his passion many desired and strove to touch him and there went virtue out of him even while he was mortal but now he was immortal in all likelihood much more virtue would proceed christ was not used to be so tender of being touched at several times and places he suffered the rude multitude to crowd and thrust him and much ruder touches at his passion why suffered he them then and why suffered he not her now she had touched before both his head and his feet and anointed them both and she now brought odours in her hand to reembalm him it was early and yet by that time she had given very good proofs of her love she was early up came first to the grave returned and called peter and john staid last at the grave had been at such cost taken such pains had wept so much as to refuse comfort even when offered by angels till she had found christ she was a stranger to consolation and now having found him that she must not touch him seems very hard one poor touch had been but an easy recompense for all her pains and sorrow but if we look into the reason christ gives it is yet more strange touch me not for i am not yet ascended as if he had said when he was ascended then she should but if standing upon earth by him he is not to be touched when he is taken up into heaven no arm can reach him there  there is a time and place for noli me tangere the world began with a noli me tangere the first words god spoke then were touch not the forbidden fruit but christ is not the forbidden tree but the tree of life to be touched and tasted that we may live by him but this touch me not was not on christs part but on marys no let in him to be touched the let was in her she might not touch him would christ have men to touch him and not women for st thomas put his whole hand into the place of his wounds and put him to no pain at all and certain women met him in the way after his resurrection amongst which was m magdalen and he then suffered them to touch him and take him by the feet so that it seems this prohibition was not real but personal not absolutely but not at that time which shows all was not well with m magdalen something was amiss she must have been to blame in the manner of her offer she must have been a little too forward it may be and not have used all the respect she should have done for as soon as christ cried mary she answered with her wonted term rabboni and as she saluted him with her usual word so after her custom she went toward him and would have touched him not in such a manner as was fitting to be observed nor with that regard which his new glorified estate seemed justly to require for that which was enough to christ a few days past was not so now she poor woman was defective in her judgment out of an excess of her affection she thought he had been rabboni still it seemed to her that christ was now as her brother lazarus was after his resurrection that christ had risen neither more nor less but just the same he was bebefore to be saluted approached and touched as formerly he had been  it seems she was not before so carried away with sorrow but she was now as far gone in the other of joy and so forgot her self in offering to touch him no otherwise than she did before her case was like st peters in the mount who knew not what he said when he proposed the building of three tabernacles she knew not what she did being so surprised with the sudden joy as she had no leisure to recollect her self to weigh the wonderful great change this day wrought in him for when her judgment was better settled she did touch him but then it was upon her knees down at his feet another manner of gesture than as it seems she first offered  it is true he gave st thomas leave to touch whose faith was in his fingers ends he then believed not was in doubt thought he had been a ghost and to clear that doubt he was suffered to touch him st thomas and m magdalen or whoever touched christ on earth if they had not been more happy to touch him with their faith than with their hands they had received no good at all by it it was much better with faith to touch the hemm of his garment than without it to touch any part of his body touching was the proper cure for st thomass disease but so it was not for m magdalen who was sure the voice she heard was that of rabboni she had no need to be confirmed in that her disease was of another sort not want of faith but want of due regard thomas touched because he believed not she touched not because she misbelievd he touched that he might know christ was risen she touched not that she might know he was not so risen as she imagined that is as in former times she knew him and christ did hereby silently tell her there was a great difference between a glorious and a mortal body between the condition of momentary and eternal life and that she should rather with reverence fall down afar off than with such familiarity approach to touch him that she was first to embrace him with a firm faith then she should touch him with more worthy hands and therefore he commanded her to go about that which required more haste to run to his brethren and inform them that he would go before them into galilee and there they should see him and so m magdalen preferring her lords will to her own obeyed his command in departing but thought her self but an unfortunate messenger of most joyful news being banished from her masters presence to carry news of his resurrection and going in this perplexed manner she meets by the way the other holy women who first came with her to the grave whom the angels had then assured of christs resurrection and as they all passed toward the disciples jesus met them saying all hayle and so they came near and took hold of his feet and adored him then he said unto them fear not go tell my brethren that i go into galilee there they shall see me  thus christ applied a lenitive to assuage m magdalens pain after the sharp corrosive which had grieved her tender wound which was made rather by ignorance than error and was as soon cured as known and therefore she was now admitted to kiss his feet  she had indeed great favors granted her not only to see angels but to see christ and him first of all and more than that to be employed by christ upon a heavenly errand and no reason for this but that she loved much we cannot say she believed much since she believed no more than just as much as the high priest would have the world believe that he was taken away by night her faith cannot be commended but her love cannot but be praised of which she gave good proofs to christ both living and dead st augustine tells us the reason why christ suffered her not to touch him was to wean her from all sensual and fleshly touching to teach her a new and true touch for her touching of his body which she desired would last but forty days and he therefore taught her another touch that might serve to the worlds end  but st gregory says christs forbidding her to touch him was to save time he being desirous to dispatch her upon an errand better pleasing to him and that required more haste he was careful that his friends might receive comfort with the first and therefore he bids her go with all speed for that it would do them more good to hear of his rising than it would do her to stand and touch him it was a great honor to mary magdalen to be the messenger of these blessed tidings there is no harsh term in this message for though his disciples fled from him forsook him and forswore him he has forgotten and forgiven all he does not cast them off as they did him but sends to them by the name of brethren but this special honor that was done to mary magdalen was withal a silent blaming the disciples for sitting at home so drooping in a corner that christ not finding any of them is feign to seek a new apostle and finding her where he should have found them and did not to send to them by the hand of her whom he first found at the sepulcher and by this mary magdalen ought to be satisfied for to be thus sent to be the messenger of these blessed tidings is a more special honor done to her than if she had been let alone and been admitted to touch christ which she so eagerly desired for we may be sure christ would never have enjoined her to leave the better and take the worse to forbear to touch him to make the more haste to them if that had not then been the better employment the reason why christ bids her go and tell them that i ascend was because he knew they would say oh he is risen we shall have his company again as we had before but by sending them word of his ascending he gave them warning betimes that he rose not to make any abode with them or to converse with them on earth as formerly he had done he knew this would be a hard lesson and would trouble them much for they were still over addicted to his bodily being with them here they would have detained him built him a tabernacle here and by their good will would never have let him go from hence  this was their error and to rid them of this earthly mind thus striving to affix him and keep him here on earth he shows them they were much mistaken and sets them right when christ was risen he was not far from ascending and if we be risen with him we must no more look down into the grave nor fix our selves on earth but strive to ascend with him also  all things in heaven and earth do so rising they ascend presently in heaven the stars are no sooner risen above the horizon but they are in their ascent and never leave ascending till they come to the highest vertical point in earth the little spires that peep out of the ground now at this time natures time of her yearly resurrection they are no sooner out but up they shoot and never leave to aspire till they have attained the full pitch of the growth allowed them by nature so should we from our birth always ascend nor ever stop till we reach the highest perfection our nature is capable of  in our selves it is not strange for earthly men to have earthly minds and having clay for our original that our souls should cleave to the dust so it is with us though so it ought not to be the very heathen poet saw that though we be made of earth we are not made for earth that an heavenly soul was not put into an earthly body to the end the earthly body should draw it down to the earth but rather that the soul should lift it up to heaven and so much is shown by our os sublime and vultus ad sydera the very frame of our body that bears us up thitherward for though we are born in this world and live in it yet we belong to another corporation we are denizens of another country and free of that city which is above whose builder is the lord  thus we see by what happened to mary magdalen and the other devour women that they were not only capable of religious offices but that they were early in their religious work they began betimes there is but one parable that tells us that they that came late to the labor were as well rewarded as the earliest and that is no encouragement to late comers as not so much respecting the different ages of a man but different year of the world and let that parable be understood after the vulgar way of interpreting it yet we should remember that these that were called at the last hours came as soon as they were called mary magdalen and these women were also earnest and sedulous and though their devotion was carried upon things that could not be entirely done yet god cast no cloud of discouragement upon them but exalted and maintained their holy confidence and accepted their devotion for where the root and substance of the work is piety god often overlooks some errors in circumstance as inconsiderable  let therefore mary magdalen be our pattern let us learn from her that we may find christ if we seek him early and diligently we shall meet him let us learn of her to fear no dangers in quest of christ and to think of no comforts without him let us rise with her in the morning of our good motions and let them not sleep in sloth when diligence may execute them let us run with repentance to our sinful hearts which instead of being temples through our faults are become tombs to christ let us roll away the stone of our former hardness remove all heavy loads of sin that oppress us and look into our souls whether we can there find christ if he be not there within us let us stand weeping without and see him in other creatures seek him and not his seek him for himself and not for his gifts if our faith have found christ in a cloud let our hope seek to see him if our hope has led us to see him let our love seek farther into him let us seek him truly and no other for him seek him purely and no other thing with him seek him only and nothing besides him and if at the first search he appear not think not much to persevere in tears and to continue our seeking as mary magdalen did let us stand upon the earth tread under us all worldly vanities and touch them only with the soals of our feet that is with the lowest and least part of our affections and to look better into the tomb let us bow down our necks to the yoke of humility that with lowly looks we may find him whom swelling and haughty thoughts have driven away and if we can perceive in the tombs of our hearts the presence of christs two first messengers that is at the feet sorrow for the bad that is past and at the head desire to a better that is to come entertain them with sighs and welcome them with penitent tears and let us not cease seeking till we find christ  thus preparing our selves with diligence coming with speed standing with fixed hopes and stooping with humble hearts if we crave with mary magdalen no other thing of jesus but jesus himself he will answer our tears with his presence and continue with us for ever  of the life and conversion of st paul st pavl was born at tarsus the metropolis of cilicia a city vastly rich and populous wherein an academy was furnished with schools of learning where there were scholars that excelled in all parts of polite literature those of other places and even rome it self was beholden to it as strabo tells us for many of its best professors and therefore it was made a roman munificium invested with many privileges by julius caesar and augustus who granted to its inhabitants the honors and immunities of citizens of rome  the parents of st paul were jews of the tribe of benjamin we find him described in scripture by two names the one hebrew the other latin probably referring both to his jewish and roman capacity the one saul a name frequent in the tribe of benjamin ever since the first king of israel of that name was chosen out of that tribe in memory whereof they were wont to give their children that name at their circumcision his other name paul was assumed by him as some think at his conversion to show his humility though others think he had two names given him at his circumcision saul relating to his jewish original and paul referring to the roman corporation where he was born or if this name was taken by him afterward it was probably done at his conversion according to the custom of the hebrews who used many times upon extraordinary occasions especially upon entering into a more strict and religious course of life to change their names for new ones which is also usual with our religious in some orders to change their names following therein this apostle who changed his name from saul to paul after his coming into the ministry and yet some think he borrowed that name from sergius paulus the roman lieutenant but st chrysostom tells us it was from his low stature being but three cubits high and therefore says tricubitatis ille tamen coelum ascendit i will not presume to clear this difficulty but leave it to better judgments  saul in his youth was brought up in the schools of tarsus fully instructed in all the liberal arts and sciences he was also taught a particular trade according to the known maxim and principle of the jews that he who does not teach his son a trade learns him to be a thief they thought it not only fit but a necessary part of education for the wisest and most learned rabbis to be brought up to manual trades whereby if there was occasion they might be able to maintain themselves which custom was taken up by the christians especially by the monks of primitive times and is continued to this day amongst the reformed orders in gods church who together with their strict profession and almost incredible exercises of devotion many take upon them particular trades whereat they daily work not for maintaining themselves in particular but for the benefit of their whole community the trade of saul was that of a tentmaker whereat he wrought even after he was called to be an apostle and though this was but a mean course of life yet it was a gainful trade especially in those countries where frequent use was made of tents  saul having ran through the whole course of his studies and laid the sure foundations of human learning at tarsus he was by his parents sent to jerusalem to be perfected in the study of the law and put under the tutorage of gamaliel who was a doctor of law and reckoned a person of great wisdom and prudence a man of chief note and authority in the jewish sanhedrim and president of it when our blessed savior was brought before it under this great master was saul educated in the knowledge of the law wherein he made such large and quick improvements that he soon excelled his fellow pupils and amongst the various sects at that time in jerusalem he was specially educated in the principles and institutions of the pharisees of which sect was both his father and master whereof he became a most earnest and zealous professor and josephus though a pharisee gives this following character of them lib      that they were a crafty and subtle generation of men and so perverse even to princes themselves that they would not fear many times to affront and oppose them and so far had they insinuated themselves into the affections and estimations of the populacy that their good or ill word was enough to make or blast any one with the people who implicitly would believe them let their report be never so false or malicious certain it is they were infinitely proud and insolent surly and illnatured they hated all mankind but themselves and censured those who would not be of their opinion and way as reprobates they were extreme zealous to gather proselytes to their party not to make them more religious but more fierce and cruel much like some who think all religion confined within the bounds of their own sect that none but they were the godly and that all other persons were sons of the earth and therefore they endeavored especially to inspire all their party with a mighty zeal and fervency against all that differed from them so that if any did but speak a good word of our blessed savior he should presently be prosecuted to death  these dogged and illnatured principles together with their unmerciful behavior they endeavored to varnish over with a more than ordinary pretense and profession of religion and were especially diligent in what cost them little the outward instances of religion as frequent fasting long praying with demure and mortified looks in a whining and affected tone saul was deeply leavened with the active and fiery genius of this sect not able to bear with any opposite party in religion especially if late or new insomuch that when the jews were resolved to do execution upon st stephen saul stood by and kept the clothes of them that did it whether he was any farther engaged in his death we know not but this was enough loudly to proclaim his approbation and consent for god chiefly respects the heart and if the vote be passed there that writes the man guilty though he stirs no farther it being easy to murder a man by a silent wish or a passionate desire in all moral actions god judges by the will and reckons the man a companion in the sin who though possibly he may never actually join in it does yet inwardly applaud and like it  the storm thus begun increased apace and a violent persecution began to rise which miserably afflicted and dispersed the christians at jerusalem in which saul was a prime agent raging about in all parts with a furious and ungovernable zeal searching out the christians beating them in the synagogues compelling many to blaspheme imprisoning others and procuring their death he was a sort of inquisitor to the high priest by whom he was employed to find out those christians who preached against the law of moses and after having made a strange havoc at jerusalem he addressed himself to the sanhedrim and there took out a commission to go down and ransack the synagogue at damascus where many christians that were persecuted fled for shelter saul resolving to bring up those he found there to jerusalem in order to their punishment and execution but god who designed him for a work of another nature stopped him in his journey for as he was traveling with his companions upon the road not far from damascus on a sudden a gleam of light which exceeded the splendour of the sun darted from heaven upon them whereat being very strangely amazed and confounded they all fell to the ground and a voice called to him saying saul saul why persecutest thou me to which he replied lord who art thou who told him he was jesus whom he persecuted because what was done to the members was done to the head that it was hard for him to kick against the pricks that he now appeared to him to make choice of him for an apostle and witness of what he had now seen and should after hear that he would stand by him and preserve him and make him a glorious instrument for the conversion of the gentiles this said he asked our lord what he would have him to do who bad him go into the city where he should receive his answer readiness companions who were present at this discourse heard a confused sound but no distinct articulate voice neither saw they him that spoke to saul and probably they being ignorant of the hebrew language wherein christ spoke to saul they heard the words but knew not the meaning of them  thus when saul was wasting the church dispersing the disciples destroying the christians following them from the synagogues into the streets from thence into their houses when he breathed out threatenings and slaughter the lord without any expostulation might have poured down vengeance upon him he might have commanded what punishment he pleased to have served the execution of wrath against him but if ever mercy and judgment met together here it was judicium misericordiae and misericordia judicis a voice and a stroke the one striking down to earth the other lifting up to heaven a light shining from heaven and a light shining to direct him to heaven a light shining to him that was in darkness and in the shadow of death to bring him from the snare of darkness into the glorious liberty of the sons of god he that was the way met him in the way he that was the light met him with a light he that was the word met him with the voice of a word saul saul why persecutest thou me  it was a gracious favor of the lord to vouchsafe to question with him but to call him by his name and to ingeminate that name that was a sign of his great affection and commiseration it was a voice indeed the voice of the lord mighty in operation this voice struck him from his horse to the earth struck him from his presumption persecutest thou me yet the voice was not more powerful than merciful it was as chrysologus says suaviter fortis and fortiter suavis the heaviest fall and yet the happiest fall that ever any had it was his fall and his rising thus a dumbness unto zachary was not a dumb instructor it taught him faith against another time so blindness sent unto saul took away his blindness making him see more in the ways of life than all his learning gathered at the feet of gamaliel could have revealed unto him  saul by this time was gotten up but though he found his feet he lost his eyes being struck blind with the extraordinary brightness of the light and was therefore led by his companions into damascus in which condition he there remained three days together fasting and at this time we may probably suppose it was that he had the vision and ecstasy mentioned by him  there was at this time at damascus ananias one of the seventy disciples a very devout man and probably the first planter of the christian church in damascus and though a christian yet of great repute amongst the jews to him christ appeared and directed him to the street and house where saul of tarsus then lodged who was then at prayers and had seen him in a vision coming to him to lay his hands upon him that he might receive his sight ananias startled at the name of saul having heard of his bloody temper and practices knowing upon what errand he was come to that city was sore afraid but jesus quickly made his fears vanish by telling him he mistook the man that he was now become a chosen vessel to preach the gospel both to jews and gentiles and before the greatest potentates of the earth telling him what great things he should do and suffer for his sake hereupon ananias went forthwith to him laid his hands upon him and told him jesus had sent him to him that he might receive his sight and be filled with the holy spirit which was no sooner said but done and thick films like scales fell from his eyes and his sight returned then he was baptized and solemnly initiated into the christian faith after which he soon joined himself to the disciples of that place to the great joy and wonder of the church that the wolf should so soon become a lamb he that was the mouth of blasphemy is become the mouth of christ he that was the instrument of satan the organ of the holy ghost as says st chrysostom being yet upon the earth he is an angel and being yet but a man he is already in heaven what was done upon him wrought upon all the world he was struck blind and all the world saw the better for it  st chrysostom calls him a universal priest that sacrificed not sheep and goats but even himself and not only that prepared the whole world as a sacrifice to god but so absolutely did he sacrifice himself and his state in this world as that he chose rather to be anathema separated from christ than that they should but whether that was not out of an over vehement and inconsiderate zeal to his brethren is too high a point for me to undertake to judge  after these words saul saul why persecutest thou me he was no longer saul there was an immediate change of affections here is another manner of lycanthropy than when a lamb is made a wolf for here is a wolf made a lamb a bramble is made a vine unprofitable tares become good wheat and the last is made first he that was born out of time has not only the perfection but the excellency of all his lineaments saul was breathing threatenings and slaughter against the church when he was in the height of his fury christ laid hold on him this was for the most part christs method of curing when the sea was in a tempestuous rage when the waters covered the ship and even shaked that which could remove mountains even the faith of the disciples then christ rebukes the wind and commands a calm when the sun was gone out as a giant to run his course as david speaks then god by the mouth of another josuah bids the sun stand still when the unclean spirit foamed and fumed tore and rent the possessed persons then christ commanded them to go out christ staid not here till saul being made drunk with blood was cast into a slumber as satisfied with the blood of christians in the midst of his fit christ gave him physic in the heat of his madness he reclaims him  st paul gives this evidence against himself i persecuted this way unto death what could he say more against himself and then says christ to this tempest be quiet to this glaring sun stand still to this unclean spirit come forth and in this sense st paul calls himself abortivum a person born out of season for whereas the other disciples and apostles had a sort of a growth under christ and were first his disciples and after his apostles st paul was born a man an apostle not carved out as the rest in time but an apostle poured out and cast in a mould as adam was a perfect man in an instant so was st paul an apostle so soon as christ took him in hand for st paul was not in the number of the apostles at the descent the holy ghost but then he had more than an equivalent evidence of his mission for when he traveled from jerusalem to damascus the heavens were opened and our blessed savior himself spoke to him whereupon the company were astonished and st paul struck blind with the glory of the vision and afterward being cured by a miracle at damascus he had no assistance from the rest of the apostles his instructions came all from christ immediately and it cannot be denied that st paul in some kind and upon some subjects is as eloquent as ever man was not inferior to demosthenes whom some think he had read or some other excellent orators his speech to agrippa has as much force and address and much more greatness of mind and noble freedom than any thing we meet with in the best of the heathen orators it is true the advantage of st pauls education was great he had his cause and his master to assist him but yet he met with great difficulties and hazards in the execution of his function for he was to oppose the religion of the jews to alter the customs which moses had delivered and to decry the expectation of a temporal messiah he charged them with the highest crimes imaginable and told them plainly that they had betrayed the savior of the world and killed the prince of life and this he told the obstinate jews who were hardened in prejudice and bigoted to error and superstition for which they pleaded antiquity st paul declared to the sanhedrim that jesus whom they had murdered was raised from the dead was a prince and savior and that it was from him they were to expect remission of their sins with this severe sharpness st paul treated faelix viceroy of judea to whom he talked so freely and so pertinently that the viceroy forgot his character and trembled before him  and yet the truth is the beginnings of our religion were very unpromising the first undertakers began with a slender force and there was a strange disproportion between the cause and the effect for humanly speaking if twelve private men should now make an expedition against the grand signior they would in all probility be as likely to succeed as the apostles were in their enterprise when our savior left them but herein certainly the providence of god for the prevention of all doubts and scruples was great in that he would not lay the foundation of christian religion as not in the force of arms so neither of eloquence and artificial speech which is often insisted upon by st paul not with wisdom nor the excellency of speech nor with enticing words and it is worthy our consideration how it was possible for a few poor men so low in interest and education to break through the opposition of jews and gentiles bafle their learning despise their powers and make them renounce their ancient belief and that life they were most in love with but though they were short in their natural capacities their wonderful success is an undeniable proof of a divine power that assisted them as chrysologus most admirably tells us petrus and andreas jacobus and joannes germanitas combinata ingeminata pauperas in apostolorum principes eliguntur pauperes censu loco humiles viles art obscuri vita labor communes addicti vigiliis fluctibus mancipati negati honoribus injuriis dati sed in istis quantum vilis mundanus videbatur aspectus praetiosus tantum animas dei intuitus tunc ridebat erant censu pauperes sed innocentia locupletes loco humiles sed sanctitate sublimes viles art sed simplicitate praetiosi obscuri vita sed vitae merito perlucentes labor communes sed proposito singulares addicti vigiliis sed ad coelestes victorias jam vocati fluctibus mancipati sed fluctibus non demersi negati honoribus dicati magis honoribus non negati injuriis dati sed non injuriis relicti pertrus chrysologus sermo    which show the particular gifts that christ had given to his apostles  now to magnify his mercy and glory more particularly to st paul and to take away all occasion of despair christ did upon so many great disadvantages draw st paul to him whom he brought to that remarkable height on a sudden that the church celebrates the conversion of no man but this she does not consider the martyrs as born till they die till the world see how they perseverd to the end she takes no knowledge of them wherefore she calls the days of their death their birthdays she does not reckon they are born till they die but of st paul she makes assured the first day nay the first minute the first moment and therefore celebrates his conversion only and as christ dealt with st paul so god deals with us he will first cast us down before he will raise us up he will first break us before he will make us in his fashion the lord only knows how to wound us out of love more than that how to wound us into love not only with him that wounds us but into love with the wound it self with the very affliction that he inflicts upon us the lord knows how to strike us so that we shall lay hold on the hand that strikes us and kiss the instrument that wounds us god brings to the gate of death and by that gate he leads us to eternal life he kills us here that we may live for ever he puts us low here that we may be exalted hereafter and he has not discovered but made that northern passage to pass from that frozen sea of calamity and tribulation to the heavenly jerusalem there are some fruits that ripen not without frosts there are some natures that dispose not themselves to god but by afflictions and as nature looks for the season and does not produce any thing before so grace looks for the assent of the soul and does not perfect the whole work till that come it is nature that brings the season but grace the assent and till the season for the fruit till the assent of the soul come all is not done  this should be our consolation that how low soever god is pleased to cast us though it be to the earth yet he does not do it to cast us down but to bring us home and death it self is not so much a banishing us out of this world as it is a visitation of our friends that lie in the earth neither are any nearer of kin to us than the earth it self and the worms of the earth  of nobility observing the several alterations in nobility we shall find four principal actors on the theaters of great families the beginner advancer continuer and ruiner the beginner is he who either by his virtues merits or riches refineth himself from the dross of the vulgar and lays the foundation of his house an excellent workman indeed who not only brings his tools but makes his materials but yet ancient nobility seems no just ground to be proud and have a high opinion of our selves because it is borrowed those great actions wherein we had no share cannot be any part of our commendation especially if we have not abilities to imitate them et genus and proavos and quae non ferimus ipsi vix ea nostra voco that man must be very poor who has nothing of his own to appear in but must patch up his pedigree with the relics of the dead and with the tombstones and monuments of his ancestors next comes the advancer of nobility who improves the patrimony of honor he receives and what his ancestor found glass and made crystal he finds crystal and makes it pearl indeed if a man could bequeath his virtues merits and courage by will and settle his good sense learning and resolution upon his children as certainly as he can his lands a brave ancestor would be a mighty privilege and great advantage to his posterity next is the continuer of nobility who keeps his nobility alive and passes it to his children neither marring nor mending it but sends it to his son as he received it from his father now this advantage only by birth is often the effect of a sloathful and effeminate life when men will attempt nothing either in the field or in their closets when they will neither trouble themselves with study nor be contented to expose themselves to the weather which laziness renders them insignificant to the great purposes of life such men think it a great addition to their birth to stand at the bottom of a long parchment pedigree and that their blood has run through the channels of honor for many ages but alas this antiquity consists only in the continual frugality of the family who being once possessed of an estate had the discretion to keep it and so has the advantage of living in a better house and eating and drinking better than those who want a fortune indeed if ancient nobility did convey to us any advantage of body or mind and that every generation grew wiser stronger handsomer or longerlivd than other if the breed of a mans family were thus improved then indeed the quality of their arms would be contrary to their clothes the one would always grow better the other worse for wearing the last is the ruiner of families who basely degenerates from his ancestors so that nobility in him has run so far from its first starting that it is tired and whilst he lives he is no better than his grandfathers tomb without carved over with honorable titles within full of emptiness and corruption such noble men as these last look upon it as one of the best perfections of nature to dress themselves well and to come handsomely into a room but let me tell these ceremonygentlemen that i think it much better that a mans parts should lie in his head rather than in his heels indeed in some persons wellborn there is a peculiar nobleness of temper in them a man may distinguish their quality by the air of their faces which are good accomplishments and recommend them to company with some advantage but then men must not be fond of these small formalities nor magnify them too much i know in england that a plain gentleman of an ancient family is accounted a person of better quality than a new made knight though the reason of their knighthood was never so meritorious and therefore many such gentlemen have refused to be knighted but i think they were much in the wrong for the reason why those who are placed in that degree of honor precede others who are afterward raised in the same height is for encouragement of industry to make men forward to exert their earliest endeavors to deserve well of the prince or state it is but reasonable that merit should be considered of what date soever it is and a worthy action ought as well to be considered and rewarded as one of the same kind was a thousand years since if the inheritors of ancient honor have not by personal additions improved that stock which was granted to their ancestors there is no reason it should be valued above the same degree precedence excepted which is given now for to affirm that a family raised to nobility by king charles or king james is not as good as one raised by the conqueror is a reflection upon those kings and it supposes their judgment and authority less considerable and that the fountain of honor is dried up honor is not like china dishes which must lie some ages under ground before it comes to any perfection in taking a true esteem of nobility we are not so much to consider its antiquity as the merit of him to whom it was first granted and the distinction which the prince put upon it  no man will affirm an old shilling to be better than a new halfcrown or an old brass medal dug out of the ground long since to be more valuable than the same weight in gold if a man were to pay a debt the late king jamess image upon a piece of gold would be more serviceable to him than caesars old coins which are only valued for their usefulness because they often rectify chronology and explain history and retrieve us several material parts of learning which had otherwise been lost  conquerors made soldiers ambitious to follow them by sharing the fruits of their conquests with them and when their successors had not estates sufficient to reward all the glorious actions and eminent services which persons did for them being persuaded that a man of courage values nothing so much as honor which distinguishes him from other men they invented knighthood which without exhausting their treasure would gain them the honor of their subjects and inflame all others with an extreme desire to make themselves worthy of the same honor and it was for this reason that they created knights either just before the battle to make them engage more resolutely or presently after it to recompense those that had the greatest hand in the victory thus nobility is a quality acquired by virtuous actions and eminent services which some persons have performed to the prince and state and though fortune should have more influence than merit upon the dispensing of these qualities yet the same judgment is still to be made because princes are subject to their passions rewarding more bountifully and raising higher some of their servants than others but if a man be advanced for engaging himself in an unjust quarrel he has no better pretense to honor than a resolute highwayman may challenge and the marks of all favors that either come by servile flattery or a dextrous application to the vices of their princes are rather infamous than honorable to their posterity being enobled for those qualities for which they should have been punished it is a lessening to a mans nobility when the reasons or grounds of it are unknown and when the first principles of honor happen to be thus course and counterfeit it is not in the power of time to mend them when the rise of a family is owing to such an original a man has a particular reason not to flourish too much upon the gifts of his fortune since there is so much alloy in it nobility raised by arms when lawfully undertaken is certainly more great than that which comes by commerce the profession of a soldier has a particular title to honor it is more noble than the rest and no wise man will ever envy or lessen the just character of military glory the courage of a soldier does his country not much service after his death the consequences of his valor seldom reach beyond his death so there are few the better for it except those he engages for a martial man unless polished by learning is usually sour in his behavior the old heroes were none of the genteelest men achilles though a great soldier was very rugged and morose in his conversation the advantages of learning are certainly very great without some share of this war it self cannot be successful nay without the assistance of letters a man can never be qualified for any considerable post in the camp for courage without conduct is not fit to command and many times does more hurt than good it is learning that teaches a general the successes and events of actions in former ages it instructs him how to take advantage of his enemies and to avoid those miscarriages which have been fatal to others before him it teaches him how to fortify and assault how to manage the difference of ground and weather and the advantages of learning are more lasting than those of arms learning in a commander is like a diamond set in gold i do not intend that a commander should be versed in thorny schoolquestions but in history which is a silent study and reserved work those that are not versed in it have cricks in their necks and cannot look backward nor see behind them the actions which long since were performed history makes a young man to be old without gray hairs being privileged with the experience of age without the infirmities or inconveniences thereof nay it is not only making things past present but inables one to make a rational conjecture of things to come for this world affords no new accidents but in the same sense wherein we call it a new moon which is the old one in another shape and yet no other than what has been formerly old actions return again furbished over with some new and different circumstances  those that are only continuers of their honor or nobility deceive the desires and hopes of their friends good is not good when proceeding from them from whom far better is expected youthful virtues are so promising that they cannot come off at riper age with credit without performing something that may advance the honor of their family and build their houses one story higher than they found them  if our ancestors have gained honor by the war we should enquire whether it were in a just cause and whether enterprises or advantages were gained by bravery or whether by chance or treachery for a great many persons have ventured far and yet continue in their first obscurity and i have known some in my time that are now grown great men only by having the good fortune to fall under the notice of their general and being sent by him with the good news of a victory they have been highly rewarded and advanced such men as these are thrown up hill by another mans arms and made considerable by chancemedly their merits having been very inconsiderable or rather nothing at all when other men in the same battle performed much more signal service than that former person yet their courage was never rewarded but lost in the crowd and tumult of the action and got nothing but blows for their pains whereas the other are become great not by their genealogy but by good fortune and having their tongues well hung and telling their story handsomely which was their greatest merit men that are thus preferred should remember that there were others which ventured further and performed more considerable service which miscarried as to any private advantage because they were not so lucky to give an account to him that was able to reward so that we daily see many persons well furnished for employments and honor go out of the world as obscurely as they came into it only for want of a good occasion to bring them into light now such men as beforementioned who have received so valuable consideration for their small or no services ought to acquiesce and not press too much being gentlemen only of the first head and should therefore manage their advancement obligingly for by treating people roughly they do but expose themselves and reproach their own former condition  now he that is truly noble has far different sentiments his greatness is easy obliging and agreeable so that none have just cause to wish him less he is sensible it is the part of true nobility to be affable in his converse and generous in his temper he is equally removed from the extremes of pride and baseness and as prosperity does not make him haughty so neither does adversity make him demean himself he scorns either to trample upon those below him or to cringe to the greatest monarch  ancient nobility is very glorious when it is found with virtue which adds new splendor to the honor of his house and challenges respect from all but lewd greatness is nothing but the rigor of vice having both mind and merits to be uncontroulably lewd and a debauched son of a noble family is one of the intolerable burdens of the earth and the good education he has had is an auxiliary to his shame and the brightness of his ancestors makes his darkness more notorious to be good and great is an excellent commendation but he is more to be valued that is good whose father expired a clown than the vicious son of the greatest lord though his lineal descent be never so high for virtue in a man of obscure parents is like an unpolished diamond which lies among pebbles which though neglected by the vulgar yet the wise lapidary takes it up as a jewel  of contentment if peace as most believe establishes the throne of happiness and safely guards it it is contentment alone that crowns it if safety be the fort contentment is the magazine peace without contentment is but lethargy safety without it is but a prison but contentment without both is a kingdom if without following peace a man becomes his own enemy if without endeavoring safety he be his own traitor without enjoying contentment he is his own troubler the discontented man has neither neighbor nor friend nor indeed himself it is not in the rich fools barns nor in ahabs ravished vineyard nor in achitophels knack of wit no nor in wiser solomons dearbought experience no it is a quiet contentment of spirit that a man possesses himself a man may pick a quarrel with himself in the midst of all worldly happiness without this charm of selfcontentment the truth is discontent is the bone that the devil throws into every mans mouth to gnaw upon and break his teeth with you shall hardly find any man that complains not of some want though it be but want of his own will things go not right if they run not upon the vertiginous wheels of his own fancy the poor man thinks the world unequally dealt and the rich man thinks so too because the care together with the keys hang so heavily about him the scholar thinks the soldier has all the money and he again that the other has all the ease the single man wants a wife and the married man wants no less in that he wants not a wife and men strive to vexthemselves by their own discontents and flatter themselves in not doing what they should do by presuming what they would do were but their condition other than it is not considering that every estate has its weights as well as wings and that the true pleasure of life is to be free from perturbation to enjoy the present without any anxious dependence upon the future not to amuse our selves either with hopes or fears but to rest satisfied with what we have for he that is so wants nothing the great blessings of mankind are within us and within our reach but we shut our eyes and like people in the dark we fall foul upon every thing we search for without finding it an equality of mind makes every man his own supporter whereas he that is born up by any thing else may fall it is a contented mind that makes a man happy there must be a constancy in all conditions with such an indifferency for the bounties of fortune that either with them or without them we may live contentedly  it is the part of a great mind to be temperate in prosperity and resolute in adversity there are some that will close and grapple with ill fortune and will come off victorious but there are others again so delicate that they cannot so much as bear a scandalous report which is the same thing as if one should quarrel for being justled in a crowd or dashed as he walks in the streets a brave man must expect to be tossed for he is to steer his course in the teeth of fortune and to work against wind and weather  the greatest cause of impatience grows not so much from the force of calamity as from the reluctance of the mind of him that suffers it this raises the billows within for though the calamity may be rough and beyond our power to extricate yet when it meets with a mind as tumultuous as the calamity it raises a storm as when the wind and tide are contrary which may endanger the vessel  he that violently contends against misfortunes is like one bound with strong bonds his struggling gauls him more than his bonds would otherwise do and a proud spirit contributes more to his own uneasiness than his cross does but calmness of mind breaks the force of the calamity and the contented man looks upon his worst condition to be less than he deserves for so long as we live in this world there is no condition so troublesome but it may be worse if we be poor and under a cloud of ignominy and reproach yet if we have our health of body and composedness of mind that is more than we deserve nay if we be under a complication of misfortunes so long as our lives are spared there is hope and we must be patient under all conditions submitting our selves entirely to the will of god and that not only as an act of necessity and duty but as an act of choice and prudence since all the successes of our life are under the government of providence and we may be assured that god will either in due time remove them or support us under them  temporal afflictions are spiritual physic being administered by the no less tender than skillful hand of providence but we like foolish patients embitter our condition by chewing the pills which we should swallow we mingle our passions with our crosses and through impatience struggle with our yoke thereby making our burden more heavy and our afflictions the more grievous gods love is fatherly for ease as well as motherly for tenderness as a father he will sometimes humble his children by afflictions sustaining them with his hand not as a mother still indulging them in delights he does always send his staff with his rod his grace with his affliction to instruct support and comfort us wherefore it is well said that all the troubles and distresses that befall us though bitter arrows yet they come from the sweet hand of god whose special providence over us is such that he afflicts us in mercy gods patronage and protection is not like that of men who as salvian says they offend the miserable by defending them like the thorny bush to which in the storm when the poor sheep run for shelter they lose their fleeces but god is a sun and a shield to those in affliction a sun to enlighten them in the midst of darkness and a shield to defend them in the midst of dangers and by his spiritual providence he then saves when we seem to be past succor and therefore we have reason not only patiently to submit but cheerfully and contentedly to bear any condition which he dispenses and with an implicit faith to resign our wills to his being assured it is infinitely more wise and just than ours  seneca says optimi milites ad durissima mittuntur the stoutest soldiers are put upon the hottest service and so the best men upon the sharpest sufferings it is a mark of a generals esteem when he puts an officer upon a post of danger who does not say his general uses him ill but does him honor and so should we say that are commanded to encounter difficulties a master gives his hopeful scholars the hardest lessons so god deals with the most generous spirits and we are not to look upon the cross encounters of fortune as a cruelty but as a contest god tries and hardens us the familiarity of misfortunes brings us the contempt of them and that part is strongest which is most exercised the seamans hand is callous the soldiers arm is strong the tree that is exposed to the wind takes the best root those people that live in a perpetual winter in extremity of frost and want where a cave a lock of straw or a few leaves is all their covering and wild beasts their nourishment all this by custom is not only made tolerable but when once it is taken up by necessity by little and little it becomes pleasant to them why should we then account that condition of life a calamity which is the lot of many nations our life is a warfare and what brave man would not rather choose to be in a tent than in a shambles fortune seems to encounter a fearful man there is no honor in the victory where there is no danger in the way to it  she tries mutius by fire rutilius by banishment socrates by prison cato by death it is only in adverse fortune and bad times that we find great examples mutius thought himself happier with his hand in the flame than if it had been in the bosom of his mistress he was a man only of a military courage without the help either of philosophy or letters who when he found he had killed the secretary instead of porsenna the prince burnt his right hand to ashes for the mistake and held his arm in the flame till it was taken away by his very enemies and porsenna did more easily pardon mutius for his intent to kill him than mutius forgave himself for missing of his aim he might have done a luckier thing but never a braver metellus suffered exile resolutely rutilius cheerfully socrates disputed in the danger and though he might have escaped refused it to show the world how easy a thing it was to subdue the two great terrors of mankind death and pain the action of rutilius was commended by his very enemies who upon a glorious and public principle chose rather to lose his country than to return from banishment the only man who denied any thing to sylla the dictator who recalled him but he not only refused to come but retired farther off let them says he who think banishment a misfortune live slaves at rome under the imperious cruelties of sylla he that sets a price upon the heads of senators and after a law of his own institution against cutthroats becomes the greatest himself is it not better for a man to live abroad in exile than to be massacred at home it is not the torment but the cause we are to consider and in suffering for a good cause the more pain the more renown and we must look upon our banishment and hardships as acts of providence which suffers particulars many times to be wounded for conservation of the whole besides god chastizes some people under appearance of blessing them turning their prosperity to their ruin  what was regulus the worse because fortune made choice of him for an eminent instance of patience he was thrown into a case of wood stuck round on the inside with pointed nails so that which way soever he turned his body it rested upon his wounds his eyelids were cut off to keep him waking and yet mecaenas was not happier upon his bed than regulus upon his torments it has pleased the gods says he to single me out for an experiment of the force of humane nature indeed no man knows his own strength or value but by being put to the proof the pilot is tried in a storm the soldier in a battle no man can be happy that does not stand firm against all contingencies and misfortunes for the more we struggle with our necessities we draw the knot the harder the more the bird flutters in the snare the surer he is caught so that the best way is to submit and lie still under this double consideration that the proceedings of god are unquestionable and his decrees not to be revoked that man is only happy that is unmoved with any external misfortune or at least so little moved that the keenest arrow in the quiver of fortune is but as the prick of a needle to him rather than a wound and all her weapons fall upon him as hail upon the roof of a house that crackles and skip off again without any damage to the inhabitant  some philosophers have searched so far for arguments of comfort against pain as to doubt whether there was any such thing as sense of pain and yet when any great evil has befaln them they could sigh and groan and cry out as loud as other men others have held that afflictions are no real evils but only in opinion and therefore a wise man ought not to be troubled at them but he must be a very wise man that can forbear being troubled at things that are troublesome others would delude this trouble by a graver way of reasoning viz that these things are fatal and therefore we ought not to be troubled at them it being in vain to be troubled at what we cannot help but augustus made a sharp reply to one that ministered this comfort to him hoc ipsum est says he quod me male habit this was so far from giving any ease to his mind that it was the very thing that troubled him but the best moral argument of patience is the advantage of patience it self that is to bear evils as quietly as we can is the way to make them lighter and easier but to toss and fling and to be restless is good for nothing but to fret and inrage our pain it is like men in a fever who infinitely increase their heat by their tumbling and tossing more than if they lay still and thus we gall our sores and make the burden that is upon us sit more uneasy and like the ship that is not broken by the rock but by its own violent motion against it and therefore we must so manage our selves under afflictions as not to make them more grievous than indeed they are  if we give way to our passions we do but gratify our selves for the present in order to our future disquiet but if we resist and conquer them we lay the foundation of perpetual peace and tranquillity in our minds the more we gratify our lusts the more craving they will be crescit indulgens sibi diras hydrops every lust has a kind of hydropick distemper the more we drink the more we shall thirst so that by retrenching our inordinate desires we do not rob our selves of any pleasures but only the trouble of farther dissatisfaction  he that enjoys the greatest happiness in this world does still want one happiness more to secure him for the future what he possesses at present and if the enjoyments of this life were certain yet they are unsatisfying it is a hard thing that every thing in this world can trouble us but nothing can give us satisfaction i know not how it is but either we or the things of this world or both are so fantastical that we can neither be well with these things nor without them if we be hungry we are in pain and if we be full we are uneasy if we are poor we think our selves miserable and if we be rich we commonly really are so if we are in a low condition we fret and murmur if we chance to get up and are raised to greatness we are many times farther from content than before so that we pursue the happiness of this world just as little children chase birds when we think we are very near it and have it almost in our hands it flies farther from us than it was at first indeed the enjoyments of this world are so far from affording us satisfaction as the sweetest of them are most apt to satiate and cloy us all the pleasures of this world are so contrived as to yield us very little happiness if they go off soon they signify nothing and if they stay long we are sick of them after a full draught of any sensual pleasure we presently loath it and hate it as much after the enjoyment as we searched it and longed for it in expectation but the delights of the other world as they still give us full satisfaction so we shall never be weary of them every repetition of them will be accompanied with a new pleasure and contentment in the felicities of heaven two things will be reconciled which never met together in any sensual delight long and full enjoyment and yet a fresh and perpetual pleasure it would embitter the pleasures of heaven to see an end of them though at never so great a distance but god has so ordered things that the vain delights of this world should be temporary but the substantial pleasures of the next world be as lasting as they are excellent  that man is truly happy who is tempted to no anxious forecasts for future events knowing nothing can happen in contradiction of that supreme will in which he has sanctuary which will certainly choose for him with that tenderness that an indulgent father would for his child that casts its self into his arms when our will is thus enrolled with gods all calamities are unstringed and even those things which seem most repugnant to our sensitive natures are yet very agreeable to our spirits there is no face of adversity so formidable which set in this light will not look amiable let us but make sure of resignation and content will flow into us without our farther industry socrates said rightly of contentment opposing it to the riches of fortune that it is the wealth of nature for it gives every thing that we have learnt to want and really need and resignation in our present state bestows all things that a christian not only needs but can desire it is the usurpation of our will over our reasons which breeds all the confusions and tumults within our own hearts and there is no possibility of curbing its insolence but by putting them into safe custody by oommitting it to him who alone can order our unrully wills and nothing but experience can inform us of the serenity and calm of that soul who has resigned his will to god  it is certain in the course of the world there must be a greater number of crosses and troubles than of external comforts nay there is scarce any comfort but like jonahs gourd it has a worm at the root of it which not only withers the comfort it self but creates greater trouble and sorrow than the comfort it self has if entirely enjoyed so that in all worldly things the stock of troubles is three times greater than that of comforts so true is that of job a man is born to troubles as the sparks fly upward why therefore should a man sink into discontent because the world does but follow its own natural state  it is certain a prudent man is like the elixir it turns iron into gold makes the most sour condition of life not only tolerable but useful and convenient for a wise man will mould and frame his worst condition into a condition of comfort by his patience and he that can content himself with the good temper of his own heart has no reason to be discontented with his condition since if it be not good he can make it such the mind being the chief matter either in content or discontent we need no other proof than that of ahab and haman the one a great king the other a great favorite to a mighty monarch full of wealth and honor yet a covetous mind in the one and a proud mind in the other made the former seek for a little spot of ground and the latter grew so highly discontented for want of the knee of a poor jew that it withered all his enjoyments patience and resignation give us possession of our selves we then remain masters of our passions and though there be storms and tempests and rolling seas without us yet all is calm within and though i want something that others have yet i have somewhat that many better than i want if i want wealth yet i have health if i want health yet i have children which others want thus we should learn contentment by considering others wants and our enjoyments and not learn discomforts from others enjoyments though these are only moral considerations yet they are of much use and moment and carried the heathens a great way in the virtue of patience but we are furnished with a more excellent way because no affliction befalls us but is reached out to us from the hand of divine providence from whom we have our being the general state of mankind in this world is a state of trouble and affliction and is so incident to all degrees and conditions of mankind that no person of whatsoever age or sex but has a part in this common state of mankind and we find men in all ages that only by the direction of natural light have calmed their disquiets and reasoned themselves into contentment under the greatest and most terrible pressures men who amidst the acutest torments have still preserved a serenity of mind and have frustrated contempts and reproaches by disregarding them and surely we shall give a very ill account of christianity if we cannot do as much with it as they did without it  the greatest cause of discontent is that men have no definite measure of their desires it is not the supply of all their real wants will serve their urn their appetites are precarious and depend upon contingencies they hunger not because they are empty but because others are full many would like their own portion well enough if they had not seen another whose portion they liked better ahab might well have satisfied himself with the kingdom of israel had not naboths vineyard lay in his way haman could find no gust in all the sensualities of the persian court because a poor despicable jew denies his obeisance and thus every one of our passions keeps us upon the rack till they have obtained their designs if we will create imaginary wants to our selves why do we not create an imaginary satisfaction to them twere the merrier frenzy of the two to be like the mad athenian who thought all the ships that came into the harbor his own than to be still tormenting our selves with unsatiable desires for we generally find those that are farthest removed from want are so from content too they take no notice of the real substantial blessings they enjoy and go in quest after some fugitive satisfaction which like a shadow flies still faster in proportion to their pursuit a strange folly thus to court vexations and be miserable in chimera we chew the cud upon gall and wormwood and embitter our own lives merely by these imaginary sufferings nor do we only fright our selves with images of past calamities but we lay romantic scenes for distresses and raise alarms to our selves we do nicely and critically observe every little adverse accident of our lives and let a whole current of prosperity glide by without our notice like little children our fingers are never off the sore place till we have picked every light scratch into an ulcer whereas if we cast up our accounts justly we shall find our receipts have infinitely exceeded our disbursements and that for the few mites of obedience we have paid to our creator we have received talents of mercies from him but instead of entertaining our selves with the pleasanter parts of gods dispensations to us we always pore upon the harsher and look upon our misfortunes through all the magnifying optics our fancies can supply and we are so full of our selves that we can see nothing beyond it every man expects god should place him where he has a mind to be and though we are apt to tax it as a great injustice in a prince when he indulges any thing to a private favorite to the public disadvantage yet so unequal are we that we murmur at god for not doing that which we murmur at men for doing we must consider that other men have the same appetites with us and if we dislike an inferior state why should not we believe others do so too and we must not think god should be more concerned to humor us than those multitudes of others who have the same desires every man would be above and superior and if no man were below no man could be above so in wealth most men desire more but every man does at least desire to keep what he has how then shall one part of the world be supplied without the diminution of the other unless there should be as miraculous a multiplication of treasure for mens avarice as there was of loaves for their hunger it was a good answer which an ambassador of an oppressed province gave to anthony if o emperor thou will have double taxes from us thou must help us to double springs and harvests and sure god must be at the trouble of a new creation make a double world if he should oblige himself to satisfy all the unreasonable appetites of men the truth is we have generally in us the worser part of the levellers principles and though we can very contentedly behold multitudes below us yet we are impatient to see any above us and thus we create torments to our selves by our own repinings which only sets us farther from our aims  it is observable of the first two kings of israel who were of gods immediate election that he surpised them with that dignity when they were about a mean employment the one seeking his fathers asses the other keeping his fathers sheep and surely he that sits down with this acquiescence is a happier man than he that enjoys the greatest worldly splendour but infinitely more so than he who impatiently covets what he cannot attain for such a man puts himself upon a perpetual rack keeps his appetites up to the utmost stretch and yet has nothing wherewith to satisfy them for either we are troubled for the want of something we desire or at the suffering something we would avoid and there is no man who soberly recollects the events of his life but must confess that he has sometimes desired things that would have been to his mischief if he had had them and on the other side when he has obtained what he desired it has been to him a punishment rather than a satisfaction whereas by our acquiescence under the ills we suffer the bitterness is taken off from all our afflictions there being nothing which so much purifieth us if we do not frustrate their efficacy by our irregular management under them  afflictions wean us from the world we read in the story of the deluge so long as the earth was covered with waters the very raven was contented to take shelter in the ark but when all was fair and dry even the dove finally forsook it and it is much so with us the worst of men will commonly in distress have recourse to god when the best of us are apt to forget him in the blandishments of prosperity we should not therefore give our hearts to any external thing but let all the concerns of the world hang loose about us whereby we shall quit them insensibly whenever they are called for we must not look to be carried into heaven upon beds of ivory nor from the noise of harps and viols to be immediately wrapped up into the choir of angels we may certainly often find that those events which we have entertained with regret have in the consequences been very beneficial to us of which i am still a living testimony for all the good fortune and promotion which by their late majestys grace and favor i attained to was occasioned only by the dexterity i then showed in giving such good account of affairs abroad whilst i was then in prison at bruges nay sometimes the inhumanity of a mans relations are the occasion of his advantage thus the barbarous malice of josephs brethren was the first step to his dominion over egypt and it is a common observation in families that the most discouraged children usually prove better than the darlings and there is nothing more ordinary than for that which one esteems a great calamity to become the foundation of our future happiness  a low condition is a terrible thing in sound and opinion and that is all some men are banished and stripped of their estates others are poor in plenty which is the basest sort of beggary for to spare of what a man has not only what he may need but what he does need is not only to walk with a mans horse in his hand but to carry the saddle too and of the two it is a great deal better to die a beggar than to live a beggar we usually condemn villains to the mines and he that labors first to get money and then locks up his money from himself condemns both himself and it but again to the mines as if he envied both their very being above ground poverty is not a thing to be wished no more than war but if it be our lot we must bear our misfortunes as becomes wise and honest men we do not pray for war but for generosity and courage in all the extremities of war if it happens afflictions are but the exercises of virtue and an honest man is out of his element when he is idle it is a common argument against the justice of providence in the matter of reward and punishment the misfortunes of good men in this world and the prosperity of the wicked but alas misfortunes come by divine appointment and to those that are good men even for that very reason because they are good prosperity shows a man but one part of humane nature no body knows what such a mans good for neither in truth does he understand himself for want of experiment temporal happiness is for weak and vulgar minds but calamity is the touchstone of a brave mind that resolves to live and die free and master of it self and adversity is best for us for it is gods mercy to show the world their errors and that the things they fear and covet are neither good nor evil being the common and promiscuous lot both of good men and bad if they were good only the good should enjoy them and if bad only the wicked should suffer them a wise man carries all his treasure within himself and what fortune gives she may take but he leaves nothing at her mercy he stands firm and keeps his ground against all misfortunes without so much as changing countenance he is proof against all accidents he is a friend to providence and will not murmur at any thing that comes to pass by gods appointment and never any man was broken by adversity that was not first betrayed by prosperity the truth is we are generally mistaken in the nature of good and evil and have not the true measures of it that is truly good which makes a man the better and that truly evil which makes a man the worse if prosperity makes me thankful munificent and humble then it is good for me and makes me better but if it makes me proud it is evil for me if adversity makes me clamorous and murmur it is ill for me but if it makes me humble sober and patient then it is good and let every man impartially take the measure of the very same man in each condition he shall find ten to one receive more mischief by prosperity than adversity there is a strange witchcraft in prosperity which gets ground upon our mind and virtue especially upon our humility for worldly grandeur secretly steals away that virtue and impairs it sooner than any other pride is the devil that usually haunts and waits upon worldly greatness how many men have we seen that under the greatest pressures and calamities of poverty and reproach have yet kept up their reputation but in the warm beams and sunshine of prosperity have cast off their goodness as the traveller did his cloak in the fable and became as great oppressors and debauched livers as if they had never heard of heaven or hell true humility is a great guard upon the soul of a man against these rocks and hazards an humble man looks upon all his prosperity and plenty not as his own but as it is the disposition of the great master of the family of heaven and earth talents entrusted to him as a steward to employ for his masters service and honor and not for his own grandeur and pleasure our vices are the vermin that are commonly bred in us by the warm influences of prosperity  we do not compare the good of others with our good nor their evil with our evil but with an envious curiosity we amass together all the desirable circumstances of our neighbors condition and with a prying discontent we ransack all our grievances and confront to them this is but a thin piece of sophistry and we change the scene we compare our neighbors and our selves in point of mortality where we make his vices as much exceed ours as our calamities did his in the other instance however this is the pleasanter kind of deceit for a man has some joy in thinking himself less wicked than his neighbor but no comfort in thinking himself more miserable indeed if we could use our eyes aright and see things in their true shapes a competency would be more pleasing than abundance and the envied pomp of princes when balanced with the cares and hazards annexed would rather make a wise man fear than desire preferment and if a man well understood the right he would rather choose to wield a flail than a scepter and indeed there is no greater unhappiness than the fond admiration of other mens enjoyments and contempt of our own but if we would begin at the right end and look with as much compassion on the adversities of others as we do with envy at their prosperities every man would find cause to sit down contentedly with his own burden  david the man after gods own heart was no less signal for his afflictions than for his piety he was sometime an exile from his country and after being settled in his throne what a succession of calamities had he in his own family the incestuous rape of his daughter the retaliation of that by the murder of ammon and that seconded by the rebellious and barbarous conspiracy of absalon his expulsion from jerusalem the base revilings of shimei and lastly the loss of his darling son in the act of his sin it is an illnatured thing for any man to think himself more miserable because another is happy and yet it is this thing alone by which many men have made themselves wretched having created wants to themselves from the envious contemplation of other mens abundance whenever god administers to us a bitter cup we may be sure the ingredients are medicinal and such as our infirmities require he durst not trust our intemperate appetites with unmixed prosperities the lascivousness whereof though it may please our palates yet it may engender most fatal diseases but alas we do not understand our own interest because we do not rightly understand what we are our selves we consider our selves merely in our animal being our bodies and when we are invaded there we think we are undone though that breach be made only to retrieve that diviner part within us oppressed with the flesh about it for our body is to our soul but as a garment to the body a desent case and cover and certainly he must be a mad man that would not rather have his clothes cut than his flesh and we ought not to repine that our souls are cured at the cost of our bodies and our impatient resistances do only frustrate the medicinal part of our afflictions and our murmurings may ruin our souls but will never avert any of our outward calamities  to make a right estimate of this world we should consider it as a stage and our selves but as actors and to resolve that it is very little material what part we play so we do it well a comedian may get as much applause by acting the slave as the conqueror and he that acts the one to day may to morrow reverse the part and personate the other and certainly he that has well impressed upon his mind the vanity and vexation of the world cannot be much surprised at any thing that befalls him in it we take the magnifying glasses of discontent when we view our own miseries and others felicities but look upon our enjoyments and their sufferings through the contracting optics of ingratitude and incompassion it is a very illnatured thing for any man to think himself more miserable because another is happy and yet this is the very thing by which alone many men have made themselves wretched creating wants to themselves merely from the envious contemplation of other mens abundance lucifer was happy enough in his original state yet could not think himself so because he was not like the most high and by insolent ambition forfeited his bliss and those do perfectly transcribe his copy who cannot be satisfied with any inferior degree of prosperity but what their impatiencies with other mens enjoyments of what they cannot attain god never articled with the ambitious to give him honors with the covetous to fill his bags with the voluptuous to feed his luxury if therefore we expect to be satisfied let us modestly confine our desires within the limits god has set us and then every accession which he superadds will appear a bounty  the best expedient for contentment is to confine our thoughts to the present we often heap fantastic loads upon our selves by anxious presages of things which perhaps will never happen which is one of the greatest follies imaginable for either the evil will come or it will not if it will it is sure no such desirable guest that we should go on to meet it we shall feel it time enough when it comes we need not anticipate our sense of it but if it will not come what extreme madness is it for a man to torment himself with that which will never be to create to himself engines of tortures and by such chimerical afflictions make himself as miserable as the most real ones could do therefore let us rest our selves upon that admirable aphorism of our saviors sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof a querilous repining humor is one of the most pernicious habits incident to mankind but yet as deformed people are most often in love with themselves so this crooked piece of our temper is of all others the most indulgent to it self it will nourish it self with chimeras suborn a thousand imaginary distresses and is impatient of any diversion loves to converse only with it self men cherish this disease of their mind and improve their torment roll and chew the bitter pill in their mouths and by devoting all thoughts to the subject of their grief keep up an uninterrupted sense of it as if they had the same tyranny for themselves which caligula had for others and loved to feel themselves die this word calamity has an ill reputation in the world the very name is more grievous than the thing it self what need any man complain if he can turn that into a happiness which others count a misery a wise man is never surprised in the midst of plenty he prepares for poverty as a prudent prince does for war in the depth of peace our condition is good enough if we make the best on it and our felicity is in our own power every man should stand upon his guard against fortune and take heed to himself when she speaks him fairest a brave man looks upon himself as a citizen a soldier of the world in despite of accidents and oppositions he maintains his station and is more ambitious of being reputed good than happy mutius lost his right hand with more honor than he could have preserved it he was a greater conqueror without it than he could have been with it for with the very stump of it he overcame two kings tarquin and porsenna rutilia followed cotta into banishment she staid and she returned with him too and soon after she lost him without so much as shedding a tear a great instance of her courage in his banishment and of her prudence in his death  many men have longer intermissions from afflictions than others yet none are totally exempt from them and that man who has lived to the ordinary extent of the age of man will find his crosses and sufferings have outweighed the treasure of his comforts in this life the poor man reckons it his affliction that he wants wealth and the rich man is not without his affliction either in the loss of it or for fear of losing it  men in prosperity cannot suppose a change in their estates a healthful man can hardly think of dying the reason is that our present condition falls under our present sense and takes up our whole consideration and things that are not yet are only present by contemplation which does not so strongly affect the mind because it has not the like strength of impression upon the mind as that which is present and sensible whereas an apprehension of a disadvantageous change of our condition admirably fills a man with such a temper of spirit as becomes his changed condition but a man in prospetity that never puts himself under the sad thoughts of a change of his present happiness if such a change befalls him he is at his wits end he is surprised and overwhelmed with it being taken before he is prepared it is certain it is a very great improvidence for a man to be learning those virtues when the present necessity calls for the use of them it is like a thief who is to learn to read when he is to pray his clergy  affliction does not so much endanger a good man to lose his innocence as wealth and honor do let any man observe either in himself or others we are all equally the worse for prosperity and it is a far greater difficulty to manage a prosperous fortune than a low and afflicted condition and therefore those are securest from affliction that use their prosperity with equality of mind because they keep a check upon their corruptions and so stand in less need of this physic for my part i have quite forgot that ever i was prosperous and my ill fortune does now the less trouble me and i can well and truly say with seneca stet quicunque volet potens auloe culmine lubrico me dulcis saturet quies obscuro positus loco leni perfruar otio illi mors gravis incubat qui notus nimis omnibus ignotus moritur sibi let him that will ascend the tottering seat of courtly grandeur and become as great as are his mounting wishes as for me let sweet repose and rest my portion be give me some mean obscure recess a sphere out of the road of business or of fear of falling lower where nothing may annoy or hinder my retirement to enjoy death is a mere surprise a very snare to him that makes his life its greatest care to be a public pageant known to all but unacquainted with himself does fall   when job was scraping his sores upon the dunghill he said lord when i was in prosperity i heard thee but now in my affliction i see thee which shows nothing gives a more intimate knowledge of god than to be surrounded with tribulation the soul in prosperity grows proud deaf and careless so that she must smart in the senses to be made sensible we are not to be wrought upon but when afflicted and in misery jonas in the whales belly the prodigal in the pigsty the sick in hi fever the lascivious in his sweatingtub then they recollect themselves but when in sports and pastimes sailing in a sea of plenty and delights all our senses are shut up and no passage open solid virtue like a rose amidst thorns seldom springs forth but in the soil of crosses afflictions and austerities those men are truly virtuous who take as it were with the same relish the gall of misfortunes and the honey of prosperity no stormy seasons hinder their journey and that which distracts the soft and effeminate is to them matter of repose and joy all things that pass under the name of adversity are not so but to the wicked who make ill use of them in prising the creature more than the creator the delay our blessed savior made in sending succor to his disciples endangered by a storm at sea sufficiently hints unto us the pleasure god takes to see the just row against the stream tug and wrestle with all the force they can against the storms and afflictions of this world and therefore it is well observed that god laid open job to all the assaults of satan but with this reserve that he touched not his life and this not in regard that death would have eclipsed the glory of that great champion but because he would not be deprived of such a combatant to whose conflict god with his blessed angels were intent with much satisfaction and so would not lose the pleasure of seeing that stout skirmish fought to the last betwixt him and his enemy and something to this purpose st gregory nyssen declares upon gods proceeding with the israelites in commanding them to set up a brazen serpent at the sight of which those who should be bitten by those venomous creatures might immediately find their cure and asking the reason why god did not take a shorter course by destroying all those serpents which had given an end to the plague he at last satisfies himself with this reason that whilst the hebrews beheld the sovereign medicament in casting up their eyes to heaven they might thereby have occasion to consider from whence they received their deliverance which otherwise that gross ungrateful people would soon have forgot so that to draw them to pay what they owed to his goodness he was feign to lengthen out their afflictions  some men are tired with whatever they have enjoyed in this world and expect no greater satisfaction should they live a thousand years every pleasure appears but the same in different forms and they all agree in leaving us afflicted with the same or greater pain they found us in we walk here on earth in an enchanted castle of shadows and mockeries our whole life is full of vanity and mistake every mans fortune is but a repetition of ixions we court clouds instead of divinities and our most charming fruitions consist in emptiness  resignation and tranquillity are the golden mean and he that steps over this line on one side or the other falls into the same vanity which he bemoans or ridicules in the rest of mortals i have perused many books and conversed with more men yet none of them can inform me what i am my self for in this life we are faign to peep into the world through the close windows of our senses which are so darkened with the dust our passions raise besides the natural dullness of our compositions that we are faign to use the optics of our philosophy to help our sight yet after all we are still purblind and so are like to be during this mortal life  many great princes have exchanged the toilsome glory and royal fatigues of empire for the sweet tranquillity and ease of a country farm and the wholesome exercises of agriculture thus dioclesian quitted his throne for the sake of a private life and those hands which had been accustomed to weild a scepter became at last voluntarily familiar with the spade the plough and the harrow so grand cyrus monarch of the persians used to boast of the gardens planted and sowed with his own hands so may louis le grand well boast that he has exceeded all his predecessors nay even the poets themselves in their best descriptions in the gardens and waterworks he has made at marly versailles and triannon it is certain the fabii the lentuli the ciceros and pisoes derived their names from those kind of vegetables which they signify and which their fathers took delight in planting was not abraham a herdsman and moses the prophet familiar with god and david the prince of poets and the most illustrious heroes amongst the greeks and romans and other nations were keepers of sheep goats and oxen and the arabians are so at this day with the tartars and other nations of the east  we are all subject to various changes and vicissitudes in this mortal state our lives are alternatively chequered with good and evil virtue and vice have their turns in the series of most mens actions prosperity and adversity in the course of our lives and no man can with truth boast the contrary for we are all born to be adventurers which happen in the pellmell of humane conversation  it is impossible to express to the life the pleasure that a man feels in solitude when free and undisturbed he can for many hours behold the motions of the moon and stars which raise pious thoughts and contemplations within his breast his ravished soul is ready to break prison with joy when it is inspired with certain demonstrations of eternity after which a man is nauseated with the narrow principles of ignorant men and hates to profane his reason with the vain discourse of selfconceited fools and idiots a man is then cloyed with life and wishes to die amidst such charming speculations  the cast of an eye many times discovers the secret sentiments of the heart so does a shrug of the shoulders a pout of the lip or any other artificial gesture they are all significant and expressive of what affections and thoughts we harbor within there are some secret characters in every mans face which speak the nature of the person we read the hidden qualities of men at the first dash some men have the very signature of virtue in their faces and hence are lasting friendships often contracted  i have spent the spring and summer of my life in vanity error and ignorance it is time i should provide for the winter of my age a stock of solid wisdom and virtue  it is as natural for the vulgar to inveigh against generous souls as it is for dogs to bark at the moon and yet that planet is not moved at the snarles of inviduous animals so souls truly noble contemn the censures of the inferior part of men  god is pleased so to dispense his temporal blessings that he which has least has enough not only to oblige his acquiescence but his thankfulness though every man has not all he wishes yet he has that which is more valuable than that he complains to want we must keep our desires at home and not suffer them to ramble at things without our reach god has placed none of us in so barren a soil in so forlorn a state but there is something perhaps in it which may afford us comfort but if in a sullen humor we will not cultivate our own field because we have perhaps more mind to our neighbors we may thank our selves if we starve the despising of what god has given us is but a cold invitation to farther bounty this complaining humor is a sickness of the mind a perpetual craving of the appetite without any possibility of satisfaction and is the same in the heart which the caninus apetitus is in the stomach the generality of mankind being commonly made unhappy not by any thing without them but by those restless impatiences that are within them and if israel the lot of gods own inheritance that people whom he had singled out from all the nations of the world could forfeit gods favor by their unthankfulness sure none of us can suppose we have any surer entail to it as god loves a cheerful giver so he loves a cheerful receiver and we should soon leave off murmuring if we did but seriously consider that god owes us nothing and that whatever we receive is an alms and not a tribute diogenes being asked what wine drank the most pleasant answered that which is drunk at anothers cost and we can never miss of this circumstance to recommend our good things to us for be they little or much they come gratis it is the character of an ill nature to write injuries in marble and benefits in dust and however some may acquit themselves of this imputation as to men yet none can do so in relation to god and though he neither will nor can do injury yet we receive every cross accident with great resentment whilst his real benefits are not at all observed it is true some mens impatiences have risen so high as to cast away life because it was not clothed with all the circumstances they wished and though in an angry fit many men have with jonas wished to die yet ten to one should death then come they would be as willing to resist it as was the man in the apologue who wearied with his burden of sticks flung it down and called for death but when he came found no other occasion for him but to be helped up again with his bundle it is certain our repinings proceed not from any defect of gods bounty but from the malignant temper within us and as it is an easier thing to satisfy the cravings of a hungry appetite than to cure the nauseous recoilings of a surfeited stomach so certainly the discontents of the poor are more easier allayed than those of the rich the indigence of the one has contracted his desires into a narrow compass but the other who has his desires stretched and extended is capable of no satisfaction alas our body with all its enjoyments is but the lowest instance of gods bounty it is but a decent case for that inestimable jewel within it the soul like the ark is the thing for which this whole tabernacle was framed the more intellectual powers wherewith it is endued have exercised the curiosity and raised the admiration of the great contemplators of nature in all ages and though the simplest man knows he has the faculties of imagination apprehension memory and reflection yet the learned cannot affirm where they are seated or by what means they operate and considering whereof we are made our preservation is no less a work of omnipotence than our first framing nay perhaps it is rather a greater for we have now the principles of decay within us which tend to dissolution we want the supplies of several things without us the failing whereof returns us again to our dust the air which refreshes us may at another time starve us the meat that nourishes us may choke us nay there is no creature so inconsiderable which does not at some times serve us and which may not at any time if god permit ruin us and if the divine providence did not draw out the better properties of these creatures for our use and restrain the worser for our security we should quickly return to our dust and if the ebbing and flowing of the sea put the philosopher into such an ecstasy that he flung himself into it because he could not comprehend the cause of it in what perpetual raptures of admiration may we be who have every minute within us and about us more and greater wonders in our favor when we deserve the divine power should rather exert it self in our destruction aristippus being bemoaned for the loss of a farm replied with some sharpness upon his condoler you have but one field and i have three left why should i not rather grieve for you intimating that a man is not so much to estimate what he has lost as what he has left and we may easily be convinced that even in our worse estate our enjoyments are more than our sufferings and gods acts of grace do outnumber those of his severity to us  there is no man that can with reason affirm himself to be the most unhappy man there being innumerable distresses of others which he knows not of many sorrows may lie at the heart of him that carries a smiling face and many a man has been an object of envy to those who look only on the outside who yet to those that know his private griefs appears more worthy of compassion solon seeing his friend much oppressed with grief carried him to the top of a tower that overlooked the city of athens and showing him all the buildings said to him consider how many sorrows have do and shall in future ages inhabit under all those roofs and do not vex thy self with those inconveniences which are common to mortality as if they were only yours it was the saying of socrates that if there were a common bank made of all mens troubles most men would choose rather to take those they brought than to venture upon a new dividend but think best to sit down with their own he is an ill member of a community who in public assessments will shuffle off all payments and he is no better who in this common tax which god has laid upon our nature is not content to bear his share a sick fortune produces wholesome counsels and we reap this fruit by adverse fortune that it brings us at last to wisdom whereas prosperous fortune like a strong gale upon a strong current carries a man in a trice out of the sight of quiet and if it be not well regulated it is so far from easing us that it proves an oppression to us and a busy fortunate man in the world calls many his friends that were at most but his guests and men flock to him as they do a fountain in hot weather both to exhaust and trouble him  of women there is much to be said in the praise and dispraise of women as we are riddles to our selves so that sex is in a much higher degree mysterious for women have ways by themselves unknown to men their windings and turnings are as intricate as those of serpents and if daedalus were now alive though once the glory of labyrinthmakers he would be troubled to trace women in all their secret wild unknown maeanders and yet it is clear that womens inclinations are not only oftentimes better but their resolutions greater than mens and it is observed that as they are generally more virtuous than men so when they deviate to vice they are more hardened in it  the great actions in which they have born a part speak the excellencies of their nature judith in sacred writ is remembered with great glory and lucretia in the roman history by her resolution has raised her self an eternal monument neither must that noble virgin clelia be forgot who being given in hostage to king porsenna at the siege of rome she escaped her guards by night and mounting a horse she found in the way she swam over the tyber into rome whereupon and upon what mutius had a little before done and said porsenna as if terrified by the stupendous resolution of the romans consented to a peace  and though some out of wantonness of wit and extravagancy of paradoxes have called the abilities of women in question yet those abilities best appearing in matters of religion and government we are in neither of these without examples of able women the last age gave us so great a queen for government as scarce any former king did equal and this age such a queendowager to our late king that if plutarch were again in being to write lives by parallels he would not find for her majesty a parallel amongst women since no age has seen her equal for beauty piety virtue generosity and other most eminent abilities and princely endowments  the world indeed which is no just judge will scarce allow women to be wise and because they are generally commended enough for other qualities the world therefore delights to lessen on one side what it is forced to allow on the other for we usually find in women a delicacy of wit not common to men neither are mens actions commonly attended with so much gracefulness as womens and ladies are more skilful than men in what they do whether it be the advantage of pleasing be more natural to them or that finding their great strength to lie there they make it more their study from their childhood and where women have submitted themselves to as good education as men their sex has not prejudiced them from being great examples to others and this sex has always been esteemed and found by the english worthy of empire and when it has been enthroned it has bestowed great felicity upon the nation neither has it given place to the other sex for illustrious qualities and the highest virtues  in the venetian story we find certain matrons of that city were sent in quality as ambassadresses to an emperor with whom that state had occasion to treat and in the eastern parts of the world it is usual for women to be ambassadresses and in affairs of religion women have ever had a great hand though sometimes on the left as well as the right sometimes their abundant wealth sometimes their personal affections to churchmen and sometimes their indiscreet zeal many times the voices of great men both in civil and ecclesiastical assemblies have been in the power and disposition of women and hence it is that in the old epistles of some popes we find as many letters of those popes to the emperors wives mothers and sisters as to the emperors themselves  it would be a kind of unpardonable envy to conceal some other excellencies of women and the advantages they have of us in many respects some hebrew doctors from the different names of adam and eve draw arguments to prove the dignity and perfection of the female sex in that adam signifies earth but eve expresses life and they affirm that every name which god imposed on any thing describes its nature and quality as a picture represents the original and therefore by how much life is to be esteemed more than earth by so much more excellent in the opinion of these rabins is woman than man they endeavor to strengthen this opinion by showing that god having made man and then surveyed the system of his works found nothing more excellently and divinely framed than woman and therefore in her rested and commenced the sabbath as if he could not make the idea of another creature more perfect than her or as if he did not esteem the universe it self complete without the last and most accomplished of his works and as the end is always first in the intention and last in execution woman therefore being the last work of the creation it is thereby evident that she was the chief design and aim god almighty had in building this immense fabric which he furnished and adorned with infinite riches and delights and then introduced eve as into her native proper place there to reign as absolute queen over all his works and besides the particular place of her creation does much exalt her in that she was formed in paradise amongst the angels whereas adam was made in the common waste amongst the brutes but the most prevailing argument is from the stupendous beauty of that sex which like finer sorts of clouds in summer seem to ingross the splendour of the sun and to reflect his beams on the world how matchless is indeed a womans form what dazzling majesty environs her from hand to foot can you gaze on her lovely countenance without astonishment or fix your eyes upon her without an ecstasy indeed so admirable is the figure voice and mein of a beautiful woman that he is wilfully blind who does not see whatever beauties the whole world is capable of are concentred in that sex yet after all this they have their dark side too like the rest of mixed beings they are the frontier passes of the world above and of that below the gates of life and death the very avenues to heaven or hell according as they are used like fire they will warm and refresh a man if he keeps at a due distance but if he approach too near they scorch and blister him or like the other element of water they are very good and serviceable whilst kept within their bounds but let them once break down the banks of modesty they will threaten all with ruin in a word it is neither safe to vex them in the least or humor them too much the excess of fondness as well as the defect of natural love may equally undo us prudent generosity is the only method of making our selves happy in the enjoyment of them the frequent and familiar converse women are allowed with men within the bounds of modesty both in england and france is a great advantage to them and certainly the italians and spaniards in their so great strictness to this sex do much err for besides the injustice they act in depriving them of that liberty which god and nature allows them it is impossible they should ever become more virtuous by being confined to the melancholy of a cloister which must necessarily indulge and minister loose thoughts when if they converst in the world they might improve themselves by knowledge and the diversions they would receive from the company of others which would keep them from thinking of ill so frequently  the present jews of this age and turks have an odd opinion of women believing they are of an inferior creation to man and therefore they exclude them the first from their synagogues the other from their mosques which is not only partial but profane for the image of the creator shines as clearly if not more in the one as in the other and i believe there are as many female angels in heaven as males though in heaven there be many mansions to which may be added that there went better and more refined atoms to the creation of woman than there did of man  it is true it was a weak part in eve to yield to the seducements of the serpent but it was a weaker thing in adam to be tempted by eve who was the weaker vessel the ancient philosophers had a better opinion of that sex they ascribed all sciences to the muses all sweetness and morality to the graces and prophetic inspirations to the sibylls and we find in all authors high examples of the virtues of women and if they did but consider what an ascendant they have upon men and that though they were the source of all our miseries yet we still adore them they would be something more complacent for it is certainly a sign of good nature to be amorous of women and he is looked upon as a monster or degenerate person who feels no warmths of passions for that lovely sex women were sent into the world on purpose as many think to blow up those gentle flames which sublimate our grosser mould and make us more refined the love of women is riveted in our nature and our blood must first grow cold before this flame can be extinguished nay many times it is more fervent though of a short duration in our latest hours than in our prime as when the oil which feeds a lamp is almost spent the startled flame begins to rouse it self and burn afresh as if it would feign subsist a little longer and then it crackles and flashes with greater noise and luster than before but presently expires so does this amorous fire when we are nearest our dissolution begin to trouble us most and makes our souls blaze with fevers of desire and grief knowing its period is near i know some women are as shadows the more you follow them the faster they fly from you and they are of that odd humor that to feed their pride they will starve those natural passions which are owing from them to men i confess coyness becomes some beauties if handsomely acted and a frown from some faces penetrates more than the soft glances of a mincing smile but if this coyness or those frowns savor of pride they are odious if not ridiculous for it is a true rule where this kind of pride inhabits honor sits not long porter at the gate  there are indeed some beauties so strong that no batteries can do any good upon them there are others that are tenable a good while but will incline to parley at last and that fort which begins to parley is half won for my own part i think of women what philip of macedon thought of cities there is none so inexpugnable but an ass laden with gold may enter into it and as the spaniards say presents may rend rocks pearls and golden bullets may do much upon the most impregnable beauty that is and yet i knew an english lord that sent a little dog to a lady he esteemed much with a rich collar of diamonds she took the dog but returned the collar but what effect it wrought after i cannot say it is a powerful sex they were too strong for the first the strongest and the wisest man that ever was and yet for all their strength in point of value the italian says i will not say truly that a man of straw is worth a woman of gold in fine the best advice i can give in this case is when women are perverse retire handsomely there being as much honor to be got in a handsome retreat as in a hot pursuit and by this retreat you will get a greater victory than you think of for you will overcome your self which is the greatest conquest that can be made  those do great wrong to ladies that esteem them unable to govern a state since history tells us that the female sex is not only worthy to bear the scepter but that ladies have preserved and enlarged the kingdoms of spain england denmark and sweden who never flourished so much as under the two elizabeths margaret and christina never king of england was better obeyed than queen elizabeth the commanders freely acknowledged their victories proceeded as much from the happy genius of their queen as from their own valor and elizabeth of france wife to philip iv would have reestablished the affairs of spain if the impertinency of a favorite had not held her at a distance from the councils of the king her husband they are not all sufficiently qualified to rule neither are men there are but few women indeed because the malice or envy of men keeps them off from showing their abilities and making their prudence and generosity admired and if there were as many women as princes upon the throne we should often find female accomplishments superior to ours there being many ladies worthy to govern and would be many more if they were instructed and brought up to great affairs from their younger years  on the knowledge of god and against atheism with whatsoever other knowledge a man may be endued he is but ignorant who does not know god the duty he owes him and the way to praise him who can make him happy or miserable for ever though a man could know all that nature or art requires could attain to a mastery in all languages and sound the depths of all arts and sciences could discover the interests of all states the intrigues of all courts the reasons of all civil laws and constitutions and give an account of the history of all ages and yet should want the knowledge of god all this would be but an impertinent vanity and a glittering kind of ignorance such a man would be undone with all his knowledge and be like the philosopher who gazing upon the stars fell into the ditch for true wisdom regards our own interest and he is not a wise man who does not take care of his own concerns  nothing can more effectually undermine the foundation of our happiness than to banish the belief of a god out of the world for if there were no god man would be in a worse condition than beasts who are only sensible of present pain and when it is upon them they bear it as they can not being apprehensive of evils at a distance nor tormented with the prospect of what may befall them hereafter but man is liable to these evils and many others which are so much the greater because they are aggravated by the sharp reflections of our own thoughts and if there be no god we are wholly without comfort and without any other remedy than what time will give but if we believe there is a god that takes care of us this must be a mighty comfort to us both under our present affliction and the apprehension of evils at a distance for in that case we are secure that either god by his providence will prevent the evils we fear or will support us under them when they come or will make them the occasion of a greater good to us by turning them either to our advantage in this world or the increase of our happiness in the next  atheism has struck on a sudden into such a reputation that it scorns any longer to sculk but shows it self more publicly than most men dare do the contrary nothing passes for wit that has not its stamp and with it there is no metal of so base alloy but will go current every dull man that can but stoutly disdain his maker has by it secured his title to ingenuity and yet it is impossible for any man who sees only the smallest part of the universe to doubt of a free and supreme being until by the sense of his wickedness it becomes his interest there should be none for certainly there never was any man who said there was no god but he wished it first  twas good counsel given to the athenians to be very careful philip of macedon was dead before they expressed their joy at his death least they might find him alive to revenge their hasty triumph and so let the atheists be sure there is no god before they presume thus to defy him least they find him at last assert his being in their destruction  the great mystery of atheism is that men are wedded to their lusts and are resolved upon a wicked course and so it becomes their interest to wish there were no god and to believe so if they can so that nothing but the power of vicious inclinations sways mens minds toward atheism and when mens judgments are once biased they do not believe according to the evidence of things but according to their humor and interest for when men live as if there were no god it becomes expedient for them that there should be none and then they endeavor to persuade themselves so and are glad to find arguments to fortify themselves in that persuasion  that there have been many false gods devised is rather an argument that there is a true one than that there is none there would be no counterfeits but for the sake of something that is real for though all pretenders seem to be what they really are not yet they pretend to be something that really is there would be no brass money if there were not good and lawful money bristol stones would not pretend to be diamonds if there never had been any diamonds those two great counterfeits lambert simuel and perkin warbeck had never been set up in henry viis time if there had not once been a real plantagenet and duke of york so the idols of the heathens though they were set up in affront to the true god yet they rather prove there is one than the contrary  it is evident to common sense that man is not sufficient of himself to his own happiness he is liable to many miseries which he can neither prevent nor redress he is full of wants which he cannot supply and of infirmities which he cannot remove and obnoxious to dangers against which he cannot provide consider a man without gods protection and he is sure of nothing he enjoys and uncertain of every thing he hopes for he grieves for what he cannot help desires what he cannot obtain courts happiness which flies from him the farther he pursues it his hopes and expectations are bigger than his enjoyments his fears and jealousies more troublesome than the evils themselves so that the atheist deprives himself of all comfort that the apprehensions of a god can give a man and yet is liable to all the trouble and disgust of those apprehensions  of religion most people take up their religion for a fashion and receive it according to the country where they are born and are therefore of that religion and the reason why we are christians rather than jews turks or heathens is because christian religion had the fortune to come first in our way and bespeak us at our entrance into the world the christian religion may make archymedess challenge give it but where it may set its foot allow but a sober advertence to its proposals and it will move the whole world it comes with most convincing arguments but these must first obtain attention before they can force assent they will most infallibly weigh down the scales if you try and examine their weight  but it is to be feared we are so stupid and unconcerned that all the persuasive rhetoric of the gospel will make no impression upon us all the avenues of our reason are so blocked up that they will find no way of approaching we are like the indian serpents philostratus mentions proof against all charms but such as with their glittering splendour assault our eyes nothing moves us but what courts our senses and what is not gross enough to be seen we think too nice to be considered the form and name of christianity men find ready to their hands and it costs them no labor to call themselves christians as they do french or english only because they were born within such a territory and have taken up their religion as part of their fate the temper of their climate the entail of their ancestors the profession of it descends to them by way of inheritance and like young careless heirs they are never at the charge to survey it to inform themselves of the revenues of it what burden it lies under or what advantages it promises  it is to be feared that of those vast multitudes that have entered the baptismal vows most of them weigh it as little when they should perform it as they did when they made it and have no other notion of baptism but as a custom of the place or a time of feasting and consider no farther significancy in those spiritual bonds than they did in their swaddling clothes and can give no better account why they took on them christs livery than why they wear such garments as the common fashion of the country prescribes them but where men are so ignorant it must necessarily infer their parents negligence either in not infusing or their own stubborn perverseness in resisting instruction but it is more probable to conclude the former since if children were early instructed knowledge would insensibly insinuate it self before their years had armed them with obstinacy enough to make head against it and when by the parents remissness the proper seedtime is lost the soil grows stiff and untractable the labor of learning averts their childhood and the shame of it their manhood and they grow old in their ignorance and are ready to leave the world before they come to know any thing of that which is to succeed it this is a common and despicable case which loudly accuses their parents who thus wretchedly hazard their childrens greatest concernment and as it was a fault in their parents to let their children want those necessary infusions it is surely so in themselves to let their riper years continue in that ignorance having scarce ever thought of their religion since they could their lesson to avoid correction and then it is no wonder if they pass in the same forgetfulness with other the occurrences of that slippery age but if to some their memory has been so faithful as to retain those early impressions which were made in it yet alas it avails little for a mans remembrance of his creed may tell him there is a god and that he is almighty but if his reason be so much asleep as not to infer from thence the necessity of reverencing and obeying him he may repeat the creed every day and yet be an atheist  the difficulty of removing what is imprinted in us by education is very hard that which men take in by education being next to that which is natural and most men owe the principles of their religion to their education or climate wherein they were born being bred up either to confirm those principles their parents instilled into them or by a general consent proceed in the religion of their country there being a geography of religions as well as lands and every climate is not only distinguished by their laws and limits but circumscribed by their doctrines not considering whether true or false but only according to their interest and if we consider the lives of most men of all conditions we shall find the honors and pleasures of the world which we renounced in baptism are the very gods which share the world amongst us  though we have seen overturnings of states and kingdoms and great changes yet the true church that adores that god that was ever adored subsists without interruption and that religion which has always been opposed still subsists it has many a time been almost extinguished yet god has always been pleased to raise and recover it by wonders of his goodness and power and what is also very observable is that it has never submitted to yield or bow to the will of tyrants let us but take a serious view of the apostles chosen by jesus christ those persons that were ignorant and unlearned of a sudden were found sufficiently able to put to silence the wisest philosophers and courageous enough to oppose the greatest kings or tyrants that resisted the christian religion which they taught and preached if we see a miracle say some men we would be converted they think there is no more in conversion but to believe there is a god when the devil does that and trembles but true conversion consists in humbling our selves before the savior of the world whom we have so often povoked and who might justly every minute destroy us to confess we can do nothing without him and that we have deserved nothing but his displeasure it consists in acknowledging that there is a great enmity betwixt god and us and without a mediator we could have had no access nor favor  i know very well that good men may and often do blemish the reputation of their piety by overacting some things in religion by an ungrateful austerity and sourness which religion does not require a substantial discreet and unaffected piety makes no great noise nor show but expresses it self in a constant serious devotion accompanied with good works and kindness which makes a man pleasing both to god and his neighbor religion makes men obedient to government and conformable to laws it makes men peaceable to each other it heals the natures of men and sweetens their spirits it corrects their passions and mortifies all those lusts which are the causes of enmity and divisions if men would live as religion requires they should do the world would be a quiet habitation and the true reason why the societies of men are so full of tumult and disorder is because there is so little true religion amongst them so that if it were not for some small remainders of piety and virtue which are yet scattered amongst mankind humane society would in a short time disband and run into confusion the earth would grow wild and become a great forest and men would turn beasts of prey one toward the other so that religion has so great an influence upon the felicity of man that it ought to be upheld out of regard to their temporal peace and prosperity as well as to their eternal religion does qualify all sorts of men and makes them in public affairs the more serviceable governors apter to rule with conscience and inferiors for conscience sake the willinger to obey and it is a great truth that all duties are by so much the better performed by how much the men are more religious from whose abilities the same proceed and if magistrates who are employed about the public administration of justice follow it only as a trade for gainssake the formality of justice will then only serve to smother right and that which was necessarily ordained for the common good will be the cause of common misery  religion has a superiority above all other things and is as necessary to our living happy in this world as it is to our being saved in the next without it a man is an abandoned creature one of the worst beasts nature has produced and fit only for the society of wolves and bears and therefore in all ages it has been the foundation of government and therefore as nothing is better for being sour it would be hard religion should be so which is the best of things and is so cheerful and so far from being always at odds with good humor that it is inseparably united to it and nothing of unpleasantness belongs to it a virtue stuck with bristles is too rough it must be adorned with some flowers or else it will be unwillingly entertained so that even where it may be fit to strike do it gently and where one takes care to do it he would wound others more and hurt himself less by soft strokes than by being harsh and violent  most people keep to that religion which is grown up with them thinking that the best and the reason of staying in it upon that ground is somewhat stronger for women than will be allowed for men who are bound to search the truth  though kings be gods on earth yet they are subjects of heaven and accountable to god religion in a king strengthens his authority it procures veneration and gains a reputation and in all public affairs so much reputation is really so much power and even in men of low degree religion will command some reverence and respect but in persons of eminent place and dignity it casts a luster upon them and by a strong reflection doubles the beams of majesty as the clearness of the eye disposes for a quicker sight so the clearness of the mind disposes us to more perfect acts of religion few things are well learnt but by easy precepts those well infused will make them natural and we are never sure of retaining what is valuable till by continual habit we have made it a piece of us  we must not think the rewards of heaven like ripe fruit upon a full laden bough should stoop down to us to be taken by every idle and wanton hand that heaven should be prostituted to the lazy desires and ordinary endeavors of slothful men god will not so much disparage eternal life and happiness as to bestow it upon those who have so low an opinion of it as not to think it worth taking pains for we must use our best endeavors doing what we can and then we may expect gods gracious assistance but when men expect religion should cost them no pains and that happiness should drop into their laps without any labor on their part and that god should snatch them up into heaven when they die as he did the good thief they will at last find themselves much mistaken in their measures it is troublesome at first i confess for a man to begin a new life but when he begins to habituate himself to a religious and virtuous life the trouble will soon go off and unspeakable pleasure succeed in its place it was an excellent rule which pythagoras gave to his scholars optimum vitae genus eligito nam consuetudo faciet jucundissimum resolve always to do what is most reasonable and custom will soon make it easy and those who upon pretense of the difficulties of religion abandon themselves to a wicked course of life may easily be convinced though perhaps when it is too late that they took more pains to make themselves miserable than would have been to bring them to happiness  the difference betwixt an atheist and an enthusiast is this the atheist thinks nothing unlawful as believing no god to judge him an enthusiast thinks every thing that comes into his head not only lawful but the inspiration of god and as such is prompted with a fiery zeal to propagate it with the hazard of his life the overturning of government and embroiling the world and when a man is once fully possessed with this spirit which works upon his imagination his reason is wholly clouded his discourses are inconsistent he has nothing in his view but his present impulse and as that alters he pursues the quite contrary with the same vehemence not reflecting that it is opposite to his former sentiments now this is most certainly a great excess of pride which yet recommends it self to many wellinclined and religiously disposed people under the notion of abstraction from the world of humility and selfdenial for what greater exaltation of ones self can be imagined and indeed rebellion against god than to think my self exempted upon account of my own holiness from those institutions which god has appointed and from that authority which he has ordained amongst men and by whose hands he does dispense his blessings to us what greater delusion than to think that we can contrive a shorter and safer way to heaven than that which god has commanded us not to be contented with that station wherein he has placed us but to raise our selves above that order by which he governs the world who as long as they administer justice are to be revered as gods vicegerents upon earth to despise dominion and speak evil of dignities which is a sign of reprobation it is no less than assuming the power of god to our selves to usurp his throne and as far as in us lies to take the government of the world out of his hands all this is the effect of enthusiasm all the looseness and wickedness of this age is to have no principles but guided wholly by our humor and fancy and most of the heresies or schisms which have divided the church came from this fountain  st augustine tell us that the mighty success and strong prosperity of the romans was a reward given them by god for their eminent justice and other virtues as to particular persons the providence of god are promiscuously given in this world so that we cannot certainly conclude gods love or hatred to any person by any thing that befalls him in this life but god deals otherwise with nations because public states and communities as such can only be rewarded and punished in this world for in the next all public societies will be dissolved and every man shall give an account of himself to god the great crying sins of a nation cannot hope to escape public judgments which god may defer for a time to give people a longer space of repentance but sooner or later they have reason to expect his vengeance god has leaden feet but iron hands he is longere he punishes but strikes home at last and usually the longer punishment is delayed it is the heavier when it comes experience in all ages has made this good we find through the history of the old testament the interchangeable providence of god toward the people of israel always suited to their manners they were constantly prosperous or afflicted as virtue and piety flourished and declined amongst them and thus god deals with all others the roman empire whilst that people remained virtuous was firm and strong as iron but upon dissolution of their manners the iron was soon mixed with miry clay and the feet upon which that empire stood were soon broken  of kings and princes and the education of a prince there are found admirable occurrences in the lives of all men but much more in princes who moving in a higher sphere their actions are more conspicuous and worthy to be transmitted to posterity as instructive to their successors and though prosperity is more agreeable to our nature yet adversity is more beneficial when princes make a right improvement of it to shun those rocks whereon some princes have been split  it is very necessary to accustom a young prince to divert himself amongst pleasant men one cannot find a more sure and less painful way to render him a most accomplished prince than having such courtiers about him in his youth but the difficulty is to find such a prince will not fail to learn insensibly the manners and actions of those and whatsoever he gains that way becomes natural to him those that are near him should make use as much as is possible of that way to instruct him it being absolutely necessary that those who have wit and are wellbred men should not only be received by the prince but that means be taken to find them out for commonly such men are not overforward to show themselves they know how to be content with their own small fortunes and besides such men are so rarely met with that those who understand them need not fear to be troubled with too many of them for i do not remember in all my time who have spent many years in the world to have seen so few of them as at present  to make a prince speak well it is necessary to mix a little art and study and a prince ought to have something of both for to the completing of a worthy honest man there is nothing more necessary than wellspeaking and welldoing what gracefulness so clear a source gives to all our actions how does it beautify our words and thoughts how amiable a thing it is to speak well when sincerity goes along with it  young princes are commonly more active than speculative and most easily carried away with the pleasures of the world yet there are some who by nature are serious enough and are capable to retire into themselves as king charles the first and king james the second it were to be wished that a young prince be neither too active nor too serious the best temper is to partake of both and be able to pass with ease from the one to the other some attempts might be made to give a young prince the apprehension of certain things with which children are not to entertain themselves as surpassing their ordinary capacity for though a child understands not at first what is said to them yet it prepares him against another time and they are as little essays of reason which come not all at once it is necessary for him that would attain virtues to begin gradually at the lowest step to guard his senses and set a watch upon the avenues of his passions for man becomes neither perfectly virtuous or vicious all at once and jesus the son of syrach has said he that contemns little things shall fall by little and little the smallest occasion suffices to say something that pleases and it is of much importance to form a princes will agreeably for then he will take pleasure to hearken to a man that has judgment and wit and will be desirous to be instructed by him and if persons about a prince have a grace in their words and actions the prince will retain the manner how to behave and express himself this agreeable way of talking is of great consequence and the surest way to acquire it is to let such as have and practice it come into the princes company those princes who are young and understand not all that is said to them want often that some body put them in mind and when princes keep company with such they take some observations which they should never have of themselves and we our selves find if many things had been discovered to us in our youth which we have since found by our own experience and reflections we had saved much time and one word to the purpose then had made us comprehend a world of things which we know not nor shall ever know whilst we live but we reflect not on those opportunities till we have lost them and we are not aware of them till it be too late all the world commits faults but the greatest are only perceived  those who have the education of young princes should endeavor to make them love or hate that which deserves the one or the other that the prince may have a good taste or discernment for this would make him understand what he should learn and the means to be excellent in it for if a prince had beforehand a right apprehension of good and evil the very course of things would instruct him and the aversion to what is evil whenever he saw it would be sufficient to avoid it a young prince cannot have too curious a taste to discern betwixt true and false pleasures and not to be deceived in either the most agreeable way of instructing is to do that well which we see others do ill by which we make our life more easy besides those that are about a young prince should endeavor that the wit and heart of the prince should be disposed as they ought to be it is true that wit finds out the way to attain perfection but the heart is necessary to put in practice what is judged to be the best and that which we call the having a good taste or discernment is oftenest found in a young prince who is usually born with more than an ordinary genius though a late eminent philosopher holds that all children naturally have near the same capacity and that the chief difference proceeds from the care that is taken to inform children but i think the first advantage is rather to be ascribed to a happy birth and that art does afterward perfect it and i have always believed we should not so much wish for any thing in a young prince as wit it being impossible not to have it if he be educated in the company of some people as to the learning by ones self it very seldom happens that the mind without some extraordinary help takes the right course to do it it is true indeed our late king charles the second was a very excellent and knowing man and had a great insight into men and manners though in his youth by the reason of our intestine troubles and the rebellion raised against his royal father he was taught very little yet he had an excellent governor in his tender years which was the marquis of hartford and after him the earl of newcastle but when that prince went generalissimo into the west of england his highness had the poorest and weakest man for his governor that i ever saw yet they who had interest in the prince and were near about him instructed him in so pleasant a way that he was most agreeable in conversation and when he came to the throne if he had loved business as well as he understood it he had been one of the greatest princes of the last age but he was wholly addicted to his pleasures and chamberpractice which much shortened his days and yet he may be reckoned amongst the most admired princes of his time who had formed and instructed himself amongst the bestbred princes in europe  a young prince should never be over burdened with a long chain of instructions his tutor should rather choose to speak few things and let each precept take its effect and should give the prince a reason of all he tells him so that the prince of his own accord might insensibly make the application to himself it being much better to enlighten his understanding than to charge his memory  and above all things he should teach the prince to be free and affable which virtues make princes to be beloved and it is of great consequence for a young prince to have the art of making himself be beloved when majesty and civility are mixed together it makes men find with pleasure that such princes are their masters the more princes condescend the more ready are their servants to submit especially if they be wellbred persons who never presume too much the most eminent princes were wont to communicate freely and were very familiar caesar was so with his own soldiers which so charmed them that when they fought for his glory they found nothing difficult and were not apprehensive of danger heaven takes those hearts into its protection and in fighting fifty battles which caesar did without losing one he was always very active and yet never received any hurt such princes are always beloved and though fortune which is ever inconstant leaves their side yet glory and honor never forsake them  caesar was of this number he had nothing in him which savored not of grandeur he was brave and full of civility he would hazard his own person to save the meanest of his soldiers he loved all those that loved his fortune he shared with them the glory as he did the danger he understood well how to make himself be beloved vt ameris ama which is a sure way if it be performed handsomely the principal secret consists in managing it so that the persons whom one loves should be glad of it  there is nothing so much to be feared in a young prince as giving him an ill master for the best natural parts would be but of little use if care be not taken to improve them one can never take any thing right without having learnt it and who can believe that either to do a thing well or to do it better if one does it well that study can ever hinder it we see in all exercises how much good masters are necessary and it were very strange that the body should be capable of instruction and not the mind for what likelihood is there that practice and good masters are effectual to make a young man skillful in riding the great horse and that to the making of an accomplished person they should both be needless  the body and the mind are seldom as one would wish but the defects of the body seem more difficult to be corrected for the mind is naturally supple and may be redressed if a right course be taken and the reason why it falls out otherwise is when we learn to do a thing of an ill master one learns to do it ill and it is much more difficult to choose good masters for framing the mind than for the body for the advantages of the body are much more remarkable than those of the mind to be able and wellbred to such a degree as one would have a great prince one cannot know too many things if we have skill to make a right use of them and know how to value them but to have read much or to have learnt a number of different opinions discovers nothing of certainty for we know nothing well but what we see clearly and that which we can make others see presently and understand if they be clearsighted and we should mistrust all which we see as through a cloud and which we cannot make plain to the sight of another there are some princes who would have been very gallant men if care had been taken at first to put them in a right way and to have showed them what was to be done for a great prince upon whom the happiness of the public depends by whose example his people will fashion themselves as being the most noble model no care in the world should be neglected the business is to make a young prince happy and that all who live under him may be so it being reasonable that those should a little share in the happiness who are in duty obliged to sacrifice themselves for prosecuting of it and therefore this first point of their education is of much greater importance to them than to private persons for when princes are no longer under the conduct of governors all that they do or say is approved or at least it is so in appearance for no person comes into their presence but with a design to please them because although he loves them yet one easily inclines to love their favor more and it were a great imprudence for any man to draw the hatred of his prince upon himself and to advise him as he would one of his particular friends unless at first the prince had signified his pleasure to have it so however those persons that are near about princes that be young if they are not too much swayed by interest may very securely tell them in an agreeable manner all which may contribute to their glory and happiness it is certain a very easy thing to give them good advice as to their glory but it is not so to their happiness which depends more upon the temper and whosoever will ascertain a prince what will make him happy must know him perfectly well for most commonly we our selves know not what would be best for our own happiness but when all is done it seems to me that with a very little help it were no difficult thing for a young prince to be happy  certainly that young prince is in a fair way to it who sees himself one of the first amongst the masters of the world and that fortune has nothing greater to give and therefore princes should consider what pleasure it is to do good that there is nothing more noble and that this delight was made only for princes for the more favors they bestow the more they are in condition to grant provided their gifts be with choice and esteem which supports their grandeur and renders them more powerful it is not riches that are principally desired from kings but employments and trusts and that which makes men desire high commands is not for convenience of life for their lives are by them made more troublesome but it is hopes of making it appear that they have merit in them and are useful to the public and when just persons that have worth and fidelity are put into employments they make themselves soon known and their princes are well served we have lately seen in england a sad example of taking false measures herein the ill choice of our late kings ministers was his ruin besides what greater slavery can there be than that princes are chained to their posts and cannot make themselves less all their words and actions are descanted upon and made public discourse a prince cannot with dignity quit his guards fortune has him in custody a train besets him wherever he goes and there is no making an escape but still he that is the master of many is the servant of more  the great and honorable fame of a king in this world depends more upon his wise administration than upon his private morals the goodness of his government depends chiefly upon those that advise him and execute under him it being an infallible maxim that he is the worst at least the most unhappy king who has the worst counselors and ministers under him  princes should endeavor to couple warlike and peaceable virtues together to know at all times how to rule their own state and protect their subjects to honor the good and chastise the wicked to change the pleasures of the body into those of the mind to seek their content in the acquisition of those things which may raise them above other persons but this perfection is not easily met with at court where every thing stands in opposition to good designs princes are born to govern and therefore they must govern well without amusing themselves with knowledge more curious than useful which would better become a professor of philosophy than a prince  there is no doubt but sciences do adorn the titles of princes as diadems do their heads and jewels their crowns but the most necessary philosophy for a prince is to know how to do justice to his people and to defend them from their enemies and to understand what persons are able to serve him well nevertheless many princes enter upon the government before they have passed an apprentiship for it and take least care of what concerns them most  foreign languages are most necessary for a prince and serve for a great ornament to him the princes electors of germany would admit no man heretofore to the imperial dignity unless he was able to speak latin italian sclavonian and dutch and the emperor frederick the second could besides speak elegant french spanish and turkish which was very rare in his time he was also skilful in the ancient vulgar greek and indeed the intercourse of princes who live upon the continent permits them not to neglect these languages without running a great inconveniency the english genius for clear speaking and writing is always to the point they look upon rambling discouses with contempt and as men of reason they stand more upon strength of argument than all the pomp of rhetoric not so much concerned to move the hearers affections as to warm his reason perhaps no nation is more satirical and quicker in repartees which argues wit to express themselves significantly we have a most happy language compounded chiefly of saxon latin and french of which saxon is the stock the other two being ingrafted into it the english is so significant that it does almost equalize the greek and does even exceed the latin in a particular grace of compounding words which is as great a beauty as can be in language in point of sweetness the french and the italian run smoother but they want sinews especially the last the spanish is majestical but boisterous the high dutch manly but very harsh whereas the english is both sweet and manly if we look upon the famous men of our nation which have been learned or soldiers we shall find many very famous as venerable bede sir thomas moor lord bacon smith spelman camden seldom daniel drayton ben johnson shakespeare beaumont fletcher sir philip sidney cowley oldham dryden and many others but is impossible to learn languages without traveling which embellishes the minds of those that use it prudently a young prince that travels will understand nations imitate what they have of good and avoid the rest he should heedfully regard the laws and fundamental maxims of state the inclinations of sovereigns their revenues the order of their courts their alliances their power and their favorites that prince who has seen europe with judgment knows every thing that can carry him to glorious actions and certainly a young prince that travils profits more in two years than if he had stayed in his study ten years travel teaches them to understand the plenty of countries the force of rivers and which are the most eminent places of traffic and commerce the convenience of bridges the distance of places the strength and situation of cities and castles the number of the people the inclination of the subjects the humor of princes the sympathy and antipathy of nations and many other things which may instruct a general of an army to fortify places to entrench to camp an army advantagiously to draw up a body of men in battle to lead an army to fight and to show themselves eminent examples to their followers travel also gives a prince lessons of temperance modesty and patience and the languages which are useful to all men are most necessary to princes and to those who would have any command of armies spanish is the noblest of all bastard languages it not being a mother tongue but compounded of latin gothic arabic and spanish the romans goths and moors having reigned some ages in that country did introduce a mixture of all those languages a prince should also learn the mathematics which will teach him to besiege and fortify places these are the most needful studies for a prince and not to spend his time upon logical notions but to choose such studies as are proportionable to his condition it is sufficient that a prince be ready in sacred and profane history that he take a delight in some books and sometimes consult the dead who will say that which none of the living dare say to him he should read such books as may teach him to know the condition of his friends and enemies he should learn principles of generosity and honor distinctly to know those that love the public good and interest and to favor them with such offices as they deserve and to punish them that do otherwise and though it be honorable for kings to aggrandize their best deserving subjects yet a prince ought not to diffuse his graces too prodigally least the servant should become the master which in all courts and at all times has proved very prejudicial the planets would have little regard to the sun if they had no need of his light nor a servant of his master if he could do him no good princes ought therefore to be circumspect in distribution of their favors if they would not lose that honor and respect which their subjects give them a king gives an account of his actions to none but god he ought nevertheless to act equitably and not to plunge brave men into despair than which nothing is more dangerous who having lost their estates by their most faithful and long services thinking they have nothing more to lose are capable to make the greatest report of their wrongs it is true kings may take the benefits bestowed when they that received them become unworthy of them but before a king comes to that extremity he should endeavor to reduce them to their duty and having tried all fair ways the prince must be careful not faintly to execute his resolution nor rashly to enter upon a great action which in prudence he must afterward abandon a prince should think seriously of a thing before he enters upon it but having begun he should carry it through for there is nothing more repugnant to authority of kings than to act by halfs nor any thing that encourages subjects so much to rebellion as to see their masters are afraid of them a prince ought to spend some time in reading especially history which will render him able and knowing and it is a good guide and what concerns life which it does antidate and makes the reader contemporary with the times past and by running up beyond his nativity the prince will be something the wiser for it and will have a stock of sense without much trouble of his own and it is of great use to persuade by example that which we have a mind to history is a kind of experience and we may reap much by it besides there are some histories written by so good hands which though we know yet it is a pleasure to read them as thucidides polibius caesars commentaries with the duke of rohan and sir clement edmonds observations upon them and hugo grotius de jure pacis and belli and seldens mare clausum but to read over much and to be constantly poring upon books brings neither pleasure nor profit reading too much overcharges nature it is thought and digestion that makes reading profitable which being well managed gives a great insight into all things he that depends upon his own experience has but a few materials to work upon and to take measures wholly from books without looking into men and business is like traveling in a map where only countries and cities are well distinguished but villages and private houses are seldom or never marked  young princes after some hours in their study should bestow some others upon sports because the mind being taken up too long with contemplation will disrelish study if it be not refreshed with some recreations in which hunting is one of the most agreeable to princes and because youth runs easily down the hill toward pleasures therefore princes should sometimes play at tennis though most commonly young princes would rather endure the pains of hunting a whole day than studying but two hours which they think a labor which is really nothing but pure delight and studying would be a sensual pleasure if the mind were capable of any in those younger years for those that have once tasted it can never take themselves off again in such manner that they become despicable and good for nothing else as for exercises hunting has always been the recreation of princes nor never disesteemed but by those that know not the benefit of it it withdraws the great men about the prince from idleness which is the mother of all vices or from gaming which is unsuitable to their condition it makes princes strong active and bold almost all princes love hunting and apply themselves to it because it is a representation of war a good huntsman is or may easily be a good soldier to surprise the wolf or the fox a man must use a certain subtilty which teaches us to lay ambushes for the enemy to take a wild boar one must know how to present the boar spear to advantage just as one would do a pike or a halbert when two bodies of soldiers come to push of pike to shoot a deer or hare running a patridge or a quale flying one must be as good a marksman as the best fusileer in the army besides hunting enures a prince to endure hunger thirst heat cold rain snow and all the incommodities of the air without which it is impossible to be a good soldier  i confess princes should endeavor to couple moral and martial virtues together i know liberality is counted the proper virtue of a prince it being much better for him to be profuse than covetuous prodigality having a resemblance of something more noble than avarice and really it is less odious nay those that gain by it make it pass for a virtue but perhaps it is more prejudicial to posterity and more dangerous than the other extreme for though a king should give away his whole kingdom he would not satisfy all that ask no nor all that think they deserve much of him it is then more convenient to give with reason and never to draw so near the bottom but that the prince may always have wherewith to gratify persons of merit and above all the prince should take special care that his liberalities be exercised without oppressing his people to avoid murmuring which is the ready way to produce rebellion but there is little need at this time of making laws against giving too much princes are not too free in this age and there are not many that want an overseer in this kind especially in our english court it is certain that kings by the eminency of their places are highly obliged to integrity because the least blemish in them grows up to a monstrous deformity they are the primum mobile upon which all other orbs depend and assiadorus says it were more credible that nature should err than for a prince to frame a commonwealth different from the constitution of his own life he being a glass issuing forth incentives to imitation and where that is wanting the government cannot long subsist was not rome warlike under romulus religious under numa continent under fabricius dissolute under lucullus and antony idolatrous under julian immerged in arianism under valens to show that people are always molded into the temper of their prince and where that is not the government is short and we find in holy writ judgment threatened to princes who have been a snare instead of a sanctuary to their subjects and st augustine calls them the worst of homicides in destroying the souls of their subjects and therefore that king who understands his duty to god cannot be ignorant how many obligations of virtue are annexed to a crown since the lives of his subjects are shaded under his protection and since a king mediates between god and his people it is as necessary that he should adhere first to god as he would have his people be faithful to him so that he must in the first place consecrate himself next his kingdom to the service of his creator and whoever does not this he overturns both divine and humane laws kings are not to be esteemed happy for their conquests but by using their power in the advancement of gods honor and service the royal dignity is not sufficiently great of it self to render him happy that injoys it by the sole considering what he is for if a king be left alone without any company to think of himself at leisure he will find himself to be a man full of miseries and that feels them as well as other common persons and therefore carefully to avoid this there never fail to be near the persons of kings a great many that continually watch to make divertisements for princes and supply their leisure time with pleasures and pastimes that none of their time may be vacant which is to say that kings are encompassed round with persons that are very careful kings should not be alone to think of themselves knowing very well that a king as he is he would be very miserable if he should be left alone and indeed the chief thing that supports men in great employments is that they are perpetually hindered from thinking of themselves for it is the noise and bustle that divert us and is most grateful men have a secret instinct that intices them to seek divertisements which proceeds from the continual sense of their misery and they feel another secret instinct that remains from the greatness of their first nature which makes them know that their happiness consists only in rest and these two contrary instincts flatter them that the satisfaction they expect will come by opening the door that will admit them to rest which is usually sought by struggling with some opposition in vain and therefore cyneas the philosopher said well to pyrrhus who promised he would enjoy his pleasures with his friends when he had conquered a good part of the world but cyneas told him he would do better to advance his own happiness by enjoying that rest presently than to seek it by so many troubles but pyrrhus could not be happy either before or after conquering a great part of the world and the sensual life his ministers advised him to was less able to content him than the agitation of so great wars and so many voyages as he designed  it is certain man hunts after felicity in all his actions for all men desire to be happy and what ever different means they use all tends to this end it is the same desire in both that inclines one to go the war and the other not to go the will does never move one step but with regard to this object of felicity it is the true and real motive of all mens actions nay even of those that hang themselves when people believe their prince is liberal valiant and prudent they will more readily obey his will and receive his commands with respect but to gain the reputation of being a prudent prince he should be very careful that his ministers and servants be friends to the public good that they be affable modest and generous the prince must show a constant resolution to maintain his people in their ancient splendor that adversity cast him not down nor prosperity make him insolent and to give a fairer luster to his liberality he should take care that what he bestows do not arise out of the oppression of any and being such without drawing his sword or giving much to his subjects his friends and enemies too will esteem him valiant liberal and prudent and all of them fearing to offend him will pay him the duties of subjects friends and neighbors and he need not doubt but god will dissipate his enemies and all the mutinous malicious designs of his malicious subjects and ambitious neighbors  we must know that kings are considered in a double capacity that of nature and that of policy the politic body never dies and is never defective of authority or direction the acts of the body politic are not abated by the natural bodys access the body politic is not disabled to govern by the nonage of the natural by the    lib assis placit    justice thorps judgment was that the gift of the king is not defeated by his nonage and in the assis title droit placit    in the sixth year of king edward the third a writ of right was brought by the king of a manor as heir to king richard the second the exceptions of nonage against the king was not admitted for though the natural body dies the politic never dies so in the  th of queen elizabeth the leases of the duchy of lancaster made by edward the sixth were resolved by all the judges to be good though made in the kings minority and the change of religion made by edward the sixth in his minority was good though he had not age to discern what he did being then in the hands of his uncle the protector and if catholics should pretend to make void the change of religion made in that kings time because of his minority they would be laughed at by all the world and their pretense would be ridiculous  of man the transactions of this world are the most unpleasant speculations that ever entertained my mind the whole offspring of nature moves as at first but only man who was designed master of the whole runs a course contrary to all order and the whole progeny of adam is obnoxious to his original guilt we have innate affections and propensities to do evil since our first mothers converse with the serpent and the sad effects of adams fate are derived to all but yet no evil is in us but the cure is in our own power no poisonous herb sprouts out but in the same field its antidote is placed it is therefore a wonder that men who know they have rational souls should only follow the dictates of sense and for one hour of pleasure here suffer an eternity of torments hereafter for by embracing our heady appetites we have changed the whole mass of our nature and have set our selves a diametrical opposition to all that is called good so that all our actions are impertinent and we level our designs at a false end and we wander in those paths which will lead us to the gates of destruction  the enjoyment of what the world affords is that we only seek after the devil began with these in his first temptation of eve in paradise and it seems he had not four thousand years after found out three better engines for his turn than these for he used the very same in the wilderness to our savior the promised seed of the woman that he had prevailed with on eve her self in paradise so long before make these stones bread there is the lust of the flesh he shows him all the kingdoms of the world there is the lust of the eyes cast thy self down from the pinnacle the angels are thy guard to bear thee up in their hands there is the pride of life it is true the devil can do no more but tempt us his power however great is limited though we cannot easily set out the bounds of it he has his chains of restraint as well as torment it seems an invasion of gods prerogative and a giving the devil more than his due to allow him a power of immediate and impressive injection into our minds without the help of our own innate corruptions for it is by these we hold the candle to him and the wedge too of the temptation whilst he drives it the mud is still in the bottom he does but stir it up by shaking it or drawing it forth by some outward objects there is no easier way to outreach a man than to outend him if once the devil can get a man to shoot with him in his own bow and make his engines a mans end the match is lost as we use to say in the very making  now if any man will but seriously try he shall find it more possible to withold his affection from the things of this world than enjoy the satisfaction of his taste in it socrates had more true joy in safely looking on all the olympic games and thanking the gods that they had made him not to need the many things they had made for others pursuits than alcibiades in his hazardous obtaining them which made socrates cry out quos diderunt dii quibus non indigeo it is worth our observation to consider the toil that such men take who are in love with the pleasures of this world to eternize if possible their earthly happiness by a succession of variety and to take off the weariness of one pleasure by another between the oil and the wine as seneca speaks homines inter vinum and oleum occupati but all in vain for after those few evaporated minutes of pleasure the body quietly fails the mind and the mind the desire and the desire the satisfaction and all the man there is indeed nothing more in all these pleasures besides bare imagination and expectation which though they may draw out the affections do never satisfy them nay do the more dissatisfie and disappoint them and pleasure is but an earnest laid down for grief if not for ruin  this adventure has no other return and if this be a mans end it is an end that quickly ends both it self and him many have come to their end by it never any enjoyed their end in it alexander was a greater conqueror in overcoming his own desire of seeing darius his wife and daughters than in subduing them victor magis darii uxorem non videndo quam darium vincendo  in the next place we shall see some men rake riches together as children do snow rolling it up with no little pains and hazards of their health into heaps and then fashioning them into horses giants and castles and the next shower washes them away and leaves nothing in the place but dirt it was well said of themistocles that great general to a common soldier thou who art not themistocles take this trash to thee meaning the jewels and the rich persian spoils after a victory wealth certainly is one of the greatest bankrupts in the world and does not satisfy the debt it promises for a man may as soon fill a quart pot with virtue as a rational mind with wealth there must be a proportion between the ingredient and the capacity we call that well or brain empty that has not water or wit though the first be full of air the other of vapor they are still empty of what should fill them and so will the heart of man be though never so full of wealth and much of it does but let us see how much more of it we want the world is not so unequally dealt as we talk the rich want a stomach oftener than the poor do meat if the poor mans hunger and labor be more his meat and sleep are sweeter and what happinesses are these that are as well not received as enjoyed as well wanted as had the will would certainly never be satisfied if it had all it desired but one is presently satisfied if he renounces it in complying with the will we shall never be at quiet not complying with it we shall always be at rest solomon and job have best known the happiness and misery of man and have the best described it one of them the happiest and the other the most wretched of men the one knew the vanity of all pleasure the other the reality of all evils by experience  pleasure instead of satisfying does satiate but riches does neither for my own part my humor does not much depend upon these things i have always fair and soul weather within my self good or ill success in my affairs does not much move me i sometimes set my self against ill fortune and the glory of overcoming it makes me master it with pleasure whereas at other times i am very indifferent and as it were dissatisfied even with prosperity looking upon worldly glory but as a fancy if we fish for it we shall find it nothing an apparition like the night mare in a dream you imagine it a substance you grasp at it you awake and it is nothing pleasure yet and wealth will abide a sense or two but this of glory can neither be felt seen or understood besides the slipperiness of it should make us undervalue it let us remember the consul bibulus in his triumphant chariot by the fall of a tilestone from a house made a sacrifice before he could reach the capitol to offer up the bulls and garlands he had prepared or in that prodigious favorite sejanus whom the same day saw attended by the senate and torn in pieces by the people nay we need not go so far back we need but think of the de wits in holland who governed absolutely that common wealth and were so torn in pieces by the people in the morning that there scarce remained ere night so much as a mammeck of flesh it has raised some but it has ruined more and those whom it has most raised it has much ruined paucos beavit sed and plures perdidit and quos heavit perdidit certainly if there be any thing glorious in this world it is a mind that contemns that glory diogenes had more of it by his contempt than alexander by his command of it when he commanded himself to be made a god  of greatness of mind when leonidas was to carry his  00 men into the streights of the thermopyle to put a stop to xerxess huge army come fellow soldiers says he eat your dinner here as if you were to sup in another world and they answered his resolution how plain was that speech of cedilius to his men upon a desperate action soldiers says he it is necessary for us to go but not for us to return this brief and pertinent harangue had in it a glorious mixture both of bravery and prudence  the action of caesar upon taking pompeys cabinet at the battle of pharsalia was noble it is probable that the letters in it might have discovered who were his friends and who his enemies and yet he burnt it without so much as opening it esteeming it the noblest way of pardoning to keep himself ignorant both of the offender and of the offense  it was also a brave presence of mind in alexander who upon advice in a letter that his physician philip intended to poison him took the letter of advice in one hand and the cup in the other delivering philip the letter to read whilst he drank up the poison resolution is the inexpugnable defense of humane weakness and is usually attended with wonderful providence  horatius cocles offered his single body to the whole army of his enemies till the bridge was broken down behind him and then leapt into the river with his sword in his hand and came off safe to his party  when epicurus was ready to expire with an extreme torment of the stone this says he is the last and blessed day of my life it is never said of the  00 fabii that they were overcome but that they were slain nor of regulus that he was vanquished by the carthaginians but that he was taken and yet there is a great difference in the same action done by a brave person and by a stupid as the death of cato was esteemed honorable but that of brutus shameful  how wise and happy was saladine the great conqueror of asia who triumphed over himself and in his victorious return caused a shirt to be carried before him on the point of a spear with this proclamation that after all his glories he should carry nothing to the grave but that poor shirt so adrianus a roman emperor to qualify the excessive joys of his high fortune celebrated his own funeral and caused his coffin to be carried before him when he went a public calvacade through rome which was a sacred triumph and a heroic insult over himself and death  when regulus was unhappily taken prisoner at the siege of a battle with the carthaginians they sent him back to the senate of rome to propose a peace and the exchange of prisoners but he was of a contrary sentiment and dissuaded the senate from harkening to his proposal choosing rather bravely to return to his captivity there to be crucified than to be instrumental to the least dishonor or disadvantage to his country  of children the making or marring is in the first age of children for then their minds by their parents skill no less than their bodies by the midwifes hand may with ease be molded into such a fashion as will be durable in afterages the seeds of virtue should be so early ingrafted into them that they should not know whether nature or precepts were the teachers of them many parents do endeavor unseasonably to sow wisdom in them which does but corrupt their natures not yet ripe for such instructions they should rather let them enjoy that freedom which nature in pity has bestowed on them and not force them to endure the punishment of human cares before they have deserved them let harmless wantonness be freely allowed them and let them rather fear than feel the correction of their parents to colts and young cattle we freely allow an uncontrolled freedom least their first strength which is then growing should be hindered and yet we are so blind in what we behold in other creatures we either neglect or will not understand in our own children who after they have fulfilled the folly of their first years age does by little and little change their desires and the roots of virtue will spring up in them and therefore such as will call the raw minds of children to too hasty a ripeness of studies are very ignorant of the strength which nature bestowed on that age some children indeed have early wits as papyriuss childhood that was judged worthy of the roman senate the humors of children are very various some seem to be made of a better mould than others there are often seen presages of future abilities in children as in cyrus who first founded the persian monarchy who was bred up and believed to be a shepherds child till after a more strict inquiry he was found to be the grandchild of astyages and cato in his infancy was more than a child but this is very uncertain and they are often deceived who by the behavior of children will judge too hastily of their future disposition for it must be some great sign and firmly constant above the levity of that age which must be brought as an effectual argument to judge of the inclination of their future and flexible years though some children are more governable and easier gained by gentle usage yet their manners are generally according to their education the neglect of discipline and the force of example makes the difference and causes children to succeed or miscarry but those who are naturally most inclined to ill are in most danger and since education is the chief reason of their first principles great care must be taken to set the bias right at first and that virtue may be early instilled into their minds which will make their lives happy for the future and then custom will make it easy to them and indeed children should be treated with great wariness they should hear and see nothing that should be dangerous in the imitation and the indiscretion of parents is very often of ill consequence in this particular which puts me in mind of what montaign says to this purpose who being present whilst the governante was hearing his daughter read and there being an obscene word she forbad her the naming it whereupon the father was very angry with the governante and said she had done his daughter much hurt in taking notice of that word which she should have let pass without any observation  childhood is certainly the principal time for improvement whilst the mind is at liberty the memory strong pleasures unknown to them and they are like white paper where you may write what you please and we should never design children to any profession before their capacities are known and their genius and inclinations examined for otherwise their nature may be crossed and to strive against the stream is altogether in vain and if care were taken that the inclinations of young people were suited to their professions we should see them improve much faster than they do for men must not endeavor to fly without wings and to undertake business that is too hard for them the passions of young men often carry them with full speed when they want the bridle and not the spur and like a ship without a pilot they often overset themselves being launched without ballast and wanting a compass to steer by they are soon under water and indeed youth without good breeding is in a dangerous condition and soon lost being subject to great rashness and therefore those that are young should be very careful of their carriage since we see oftentimes those that are very promising in their youth flag at the last and fall short of expectation  young men at their first entrance into mans estate the heat of blood breeds in them a wonderful change carries away their mind with a tide of inconsiderate confidence and vain security they know not how to be provident for aftertimes neither can they consider how obnoxious they are to the ruins of fortune  the office of childhood is to learn and retain by a strong memory the deeds and speeches of their ancestors of youth to invent and speak things altogether new of middle age to moderate it self by observation from both the former for then our bodies and minds are exceedingly changed from what they were heretofore and as we grow in years our pleasures and inclinations are not the same even our manners and all our desires are much different and molded as it were anew no age of man is more cunning than the middle age in dissembling friendship and governing their affections it can then wonder at it self that it could so improvidently go astray and endeavors to repair the ruins of his younger years and renews with much vigor the errors of the same memory is ever greatest in children being then able to retain what they learn and still safely store it up in the closets of their memory but as age increases it will decay and therefore their minds ought to be filled with profitable history whilst they are young for memory is like the dew which in hot countries falls upon the leaves of holly unless it be gathered by break of day it vanishes at sun rising things of little labor and no judgment will easily be attained by children who are neither strong for labor nor ripe for judgment  public ministers when they have a mind to prolong their families in honor should always breed at least one of their children in their office under them this the french do constantly practice which is disused in england to the great prejudice of the crown where those great places are most commonly sold and commonly ignorant men put into those great employments if they have but money enough believing great places make great men which it always does as to their estates but very seldom as to their interior qualifications which made king james the first say that he had a secretary that could not write and an archbishop who could not preach  the chinese have that wholesome piece of policy that the son is always of the fathers trade and it is all the learning he aims at which makes them admirable artisans for besides the dextrousness and propensity of the child being lineally descended from so many of the same trade the fathers more careful to instruct him and to discover to him all the mystery of it and this general custom or law keeps their heads from running at random after book learning and other vocations the extravagant custom of england herein is not to be commended where all men aspire to book learning when there is not a simpler animal and a more superfluous member of a state than mere scholar telluris inutile pondus the goths forbore to destroy the libraries of the greeks and italians because books should still keep them soft and simple to warlike affairs it is reported that grosthead bishop of lincoln had a brother a husbandman who seeing his brother come to that great station came to him in expectation of some great preferment or something very considerable but the bishop told him that if he wanted money to mend his plow or cart or to buy a new one of if he wanted tackling for his horses or any other things belonging to his husbandry he should not want what was fitting but he wished him to aim no higher for husbandman he found him and a husbandman he would leave him and to show the force of education and that the learned men are not always the wisest there goes a famous story of thomas aquinas and saint bonaventure being both invited to dinner by the french king on purpose to observe their humors being brought into the room where the table was covered and made ready the first fell to eating of bread as fast as he could and at last breaking out of a brown study he cried out concafum est contra manichaeos the other fell gazing upon the queen and the king asking him how he liked her oh sir says he if an earthly queen be so beautiful what shall we think of the queen of heaven this latter was esteemed the better courtier but from hence we may infer that the learned men are not always the civillest and best moral men and there is too great a number of them who lead a soft sedentary life feeding only their own fancies upon the public and therefore it were to be wished that the english had not so general an itching after book learning  i well remember to have known a person of honor and great quality in england to have had three sons by the same lady but of the most different geniuss and contrariety of humors that have been ever seen the eldest the most fantastical proudest and foolishest in all his actions the second the most learned sober and yet bigoted in devotion the third the most dissolute and drunken that could be seen but yet very witty in conversation insomuch that there could not be found a more pregnant instance to prove that humane souls come not extraduce and by seminal production from their parents  of law it is the effect of law quod homo homini deus non lupus that we do protect and not devour each other and therefore aristotle well observes quod optimum animal homo lege fruens sed pessimum animal homo lege devians man is the best creature with the law but the worst without it the end and aim for which men enter into society is not barely to live which they may do dispersed but to live happily answerable to the dignity of mankind which end they cannot accomplish without submission to the laws and living according to the prescriptions thereof laws being the instruments and sinews of all outward blessings it is an englishmans happiness that as he is born to inherit his lands so to inherit the laws which are our birthright and the best inheritance we have which cannot be taken from us  religion and justice are the two supporters of every commonwealth they are the pillars of all government without them the whole state civil and ecclesiastical will like a melted vessel run into confusion and disorder the law of a nation is the soul of a nation it is the rudder by which the vessel of the commonwealth is steered it is the yoke wherewith all are kept in obedience and that commonwealth where men and not laws govern will be quickly like the field of the sluggard all grown over with thorns and nettles and therefore there had need be weeders that is good magistrates to keep the field of a commonwealth from being overspread with thorns and nettles that is disorderly lewd persons and they had need be good laws that must keep in such unruly beasts the disturbers of the peace to what purpose do laws enjoin punishments if they are not put in execution for laws must not be like cobwebs to catch only small flies and to be broken by great ones it were better not to make any for this makes every particular mans offense the sin of the public quis non vetat peccare cum potest jubet to omit the punishment of an offense under our charge is to commit it the due observation of the laws of god and the careful execution of the laws of men make a nation flourish they are indeed the very spirit and sinews of every state for all humane laws have their dependence upon the laws of god who is the great lawgiver and the nearer our copies draw to that original the better they are and the more like to continue in pessima republica leges plurimae and therefore the curse of the prophet has been expounded by the multitude of penal laws which are worse than showers of hail and tempest upon the cattle for they fall upon men and where religion and laws are not preserved we cannot properly call them commonwealths but magna latrocinia great confederacies of thieves if religion be not upheld if the laws be not observed if vice goes unpunished and virtue unrewarded if a due respect be not given to magistrates who are the living stamps of the supreme authority all our happiness and contentment in this life and the next will be taken away and the whole frame of government will fall to the ground and dissolve the rulers of the earth belong unto god and from hence we should learn our duty of honor reverence and loyalty they were the sons of belial that despised saul without governors or government one man will be bread for another and we should be as the fishes in the sea the great would devour the small it is no particular conceit but a great truth that all duties are by so much the better performed by how much the men are more religious from whose abilities the same proceed but if magistrates who are employed about the public administration of justice follow it only as a trade for gains sake the formalities of it will only then serve to smother right and what was necessarily ordained for the common good will through the abuse of it be the cause of common misery the laws without execution is putting arrows into a quiver from whence they are not drawn out this is to make the magistrate an immovable statue a george on horseback seeming always ready but never strikes the law without execution is a chimera which only serves to fright  justice and fortune are painted blind to show us what the one should do and what the other should not do for the one gives without respect and the other is in no respect to take for none should execute the office of justice but such whose eyes are blind from respecting persons and whose hands are closed from accepting rewards the thebans painted their judges and magistrates without hands since when their hands are over long it is to be feared their feet will become gouty their tongue tied their ears deafened and their eyes dimmed it is a shame and reproach to us to see pagans that have showed greater integrity and more uncorruption and affection to the public good than we do civillians say the magistrate is the living law and that his good example should be a lively and perpetual promulgation of that law for example prevails much more than precept and reduces more under its yoke though naked than the law with all its enforcements and the reason is obvious for the arms of law only strike the body but the shafts of example strike into the soul and we see men daily trust more to their eyes than to their ears more to what they see than to what they hear facilius est errare naturam quam principem dissimilem sui formare rempublicam we shall never see princes frame an age unlike themselves under romulus rome was warlike under numa religious under the fabritii continent under the catos regular under the luculluss and antonies intemperate and dissolute under julian idolatrous under valens arrian and the example of king jeroboam caused all the people to commit idolatry whereas under the reign of king david ezekias and josias religion and piety were seen to flourish for people generally are like clay without form in themselves but easily wrought by the potters hand they behold most affairs with the eyes of their magistrates and suffer themselves easily to be directed by their examples and to dislike whatever they reject  an ancient father has said he that is not a good husband cannot be a good magistrate for he that rules not his family well cannot govern others which is a rational deduction but he that is not an honest man cannot be a good magistrate for he that will make shipwreck of his own reputation will never take care of the commonwealth the justice every man owes to himself does oblige him first to regulate his own affections and passions and then he will be more capable to render justice to others for both natural and divine laws do propose our selves for a rule and measure of what we owe to our neighbors magistrates are to give good examples to others owing it themselves for ordering their own lives and they owe to it the public for imitation the just and good man is a rule and measure of all others since being what all men ought to be he shows what all men ought to do integrity is so necessary in a magistrate that without it all other qualities are but instruments of particular profit and public loss all the grecian commonwealths fell to ruin for want of this gold breeds the scurvy in some mens mouths and ambition breeds imposthumes in some mens hearts he must not look upon private interest but the public and submit his particular affairs to the interest of the whole virtutis pretium est non posse pretio cepi her reward is that she cannot be allured by reward  the love of the public is the inseparable quality of a good commonwealthsman without which he is no more a man but an idol as david said of the idols of the gentiles that have eyes and see not ears and hear not  on old age i hope it will not be thought unreasonable for an old man who can scarce remember his climacterical year who spent his blooming youth in the service of the crown under king charles the first who in the battle of edgehill fought the   d of october      received a dangerous wound in his head still visible as a mark of loyalty to his sovereign and was soon after that battle made a captain of horse and from thence by degrees advanced to be a general officer of horse and served in that quality during those wars and was engaged in several battles with various successes which ended with the murder of one of the best of kings accompanied with such barbarous circumstances as cannot be paralleled in any history and fitter to be buried in oblivion than remembered i have thereupon thought it not improper to show that the strength of my mind is still in being which with gods blessing i hope to keep in repair so long as my body lasts and have therefore presumed in this following discourse to show some advantages of old age of which i am at present a living testimony even in this year   0   the life of man is usually divided into childhood youth mans estate and old age all which degrees we bring into that narrow compass whilst our life consumes insensibly infancy is only a state of hope and most commonly supported by the indulgent tenderness of parents and nurses youth if well educated will soon blossom and after yield fruit mans estate like a flame well kindled and supplied will burn long but old age does usually soon pass away and if we do not watch we lose our opportunities if we do not make haste we are left behind our best hours fly from us the worst are to come the purest part of our life runs first and leaves only the dregs at the bottom unless we take great care and then our strength and desires will fall off together and our years will sit easy upon us when we are thus satisfied and composed it smooths our passage to the other world and makes us slide into the grave with a more gentle and insensible motion indeed if we could observe the state of our infancy when we came first into the world with the progress of our growth and the beginning of our reason it would certainly be a pleasant retrospection but divine providence has hid this from our sight at our birth neither our limbs nor understanding were born at their full growth but we increase by degrees and being infants in our bodies we are not men in our souls the first ten years we may call an animal life the powers of reason are then feeble in us and we do but sleep that time away but afterward the advances of age are very gradual but yet this gradation is so slow that we cannot take much notice of it nor see it with our eyes and so we think all goes well since we are not thrown so suddenly out of our youth into our manhood and from that into old age which would be much more sensible to us and concerns us more but we walk gently up hill from our youth to our middle state and as gently down the hill from our manhood into old age without perceiving the change we have made till we come at the bottom however we must needs be troubled when we consider the greatest part of life is no better than a slow consumption and that at last we must fall into a state of weakness and be unacceptable both to others and to our selves but we seldom think of this because we seem to be the same men in the morning as we were the night before now he that would have his health hold out to the last and grow old with advantage must be regular in his youth and not live too fast we must husband our constitution and not throw it away till we have done living for our vices destroy our lives as well as our fortunes intemperance antidates our infirmities and makes us die much sooner than we should and though we have the world before us we do not play the good husband early enough for it is too late to spare at the bottom when all is drawn out to the lees it is true we old men cannot but be something concerned to think that we grow less and less every day doing the same things over again and that we live only to nurse up our decays which is troublesome to us especially since there is nothing in this world to make us in love with it or fond of it none yet were ever fully pleased with it for though it seems a juno in the pursuit it is but a cloud in our embraces and therefore those who are sorry to see their voyage fixed are overfond of their native country and hang about life a little too meanly indeed when our senses droop and all the faculties of our souls and bodies decay apace it is then high time to bid adieu to the active life and not only to abandon the vanities of this fading world but the very remembrance and thoughts of them our minds begin then to be nauseated with the ideas of our past folly which we falsely called pleasure and that retrospect is unpleasant when we reflect upon a life to be repented of it is but reason when we approach near the grave when all our senses put us daily in mind of our mortality that we should begin to recollect our selves and think whereabouts we are that we may not be surpised and die less than our selves it should be our care before we grow old to live well and then we may be sure to die well it is the duty of life to prepare our selves for death there is not one hour we live that does not mind us of our mortality time runs on the period is certain though it lies in the dark our term is set and none of us know how near it is and therefore we should not wonder to have that befall us to day which might have happened to us any minute since we were born this consideration should make us live as if every minute were our last but we fear death only because we know not where we shall go and we never begin to reform till our old age after having spent our former years in all sorts of vanity which is better late than never but it is a miserable case not to know the value of a treasure till we are going to lose it to begin our frugality when we are ready to turn bankrupts we should therefore begin early to do that which will always please and young men should carefully avoid throwing away their time as if they came into the world for no other end but to eat and sleep or else to spend their days in wantonness and folly and to make vice their business thus we see in general that age grows worse upon the progress and has no relief to expect but the grave yet in some health vigor and sense hold out to the last many of the ancient philosophers and romans were examples of this truth tully who wrote excellently well de senectute was a lively example hereof being past sixty when he wrote his philippicks in which his rhetoric is more correct and moving than in his younger orations the poetic fire which is usually soonest extinct in men i have found by experience in my self has lasted much beyond that period of which i could give modern proof but i will leave that to my son only this i can with truth affirm that the poems i have made since my age of seventy have more of force and spirit than those i had written some years before but this is a particular grace of god it being very unusual in the generality and very hard for men to seem young when they are old and much more strange to be so for though at ones death fuimus may make a good motto yet in life it is stark naught  none can imagine how green and vigorous some mens minds are in old age having a perpetual conflict with their bodies who were illmatchd unless to show that an active spirit may be lodged in a decayed body it is certainly a particular happiness to preserve the force of the mind in the decay of the body to live to that age that neither cares for any thing nor stands in need of any thing that though it can much longer yet it will not still do the same things over again which it ought not to do age having put an end to his desires certainly there can be no gentler end than thus to melt away in a kind of dissolution  where fire meets with opposition and matter to work upon it is furious and rages but when it finds no fuel as in old age it goes out quickly for want of nourishment nor is the body the settled habitation of the soul but a temporary lodging which we must leave whenever the master of the house pleases it is true every man has naturally a love for his own body as poor people love even their own beggarly cottages they are old acquaintances and loath to part yet old men though they may somewhat indulge their bodies yet they make not themselves slaves to them nor care any more what becomes of their carcasses when dead than a man does for the shaving of his beard under the hand of a barber however age it self is not without its pleasures if we knew rightly how to use them the best morsel being still reserved for the last or almost it is equivalent to the enjoying of pleasures not to stand in need of them time indeed goes faster with old men than young because they reckon most upon it there is hardly any man so old but he may hope for one day more yet and the longest life is but a multiplication of days nay hours and moments for the end of our lives is set and the first breath we draw is but the first step to our last the course of all things in this world being only a long connection of providential appointments and though there be great variety in our lives yet all tend to the same issue death old men find most easy because it is complied with without struggling for by dying of old age a man does no more than go to bed when he is weary it being childish to go out of the world as we came into it groaning and crying for these and many other reasons i cannot agree with them that seem to impute much inconvenience to long life and that length of days does much rather impair than improve us for if we follow the course of nature and of reason old age is a mighty blessing were it only in regard that it gives time leave to vent and boil away the unquietness and turbulency that follow our passions in our younger years and weans us gently from carnal affections and at last to drop with ease and willingness like ripe fruit from the tree for when before the season fruit is pulled off with violent hands or shaken down by rude and boisterous winds it has an indigested raw taste of the wood and has an unpleasant eagerness in its juice that makes it unfit for use till length of time has mellowed it so souls that go out of their bodies with affection to those objects they leave behind which usually is as long as they can relish them do retain still as some think even to their separation a bias and languishing toward them besides we must consider that old age is not always a burden and encumbrance there are several peculiar privileges annexed to this part of life which will relieve us under the decays of the body for the imperfections of old age are not so unavoidable as gray hairs the quiet composure of an old mans mind keeps him from wearing out so fast it props up his strength and makes him live cheerfully to the last moment for easy thoughts are excellent opiates which will not only mitigate old mens distemper but make them almost to despise their misery thus most men take care to live long but few take care to live well which is in every mans power to do but in no mans power to do the former  we consume our lives in providing the very instruments of life so that we do not properly live but we are about to live and we only propound to begin to live at our old age to which very few people arrive  there are other very remarkable advantages of old age for those who have had the longest time to improve themselves must needs be the wisest men such have seen greater variety of events have had more opportunities of observing humors and interests their judgments are more exact they know more things and those better than young men bringing their thoughts to a second test for trying what they took upon trust in their youth old men are usually free from violent passions matters of moment are better considered by them whereas younger persons are apt to judge amiss their prospect being too short and certainly age is the time in which the mind is most discerning and furnished with the best materials for wisdom those who have been longest in public employments whose performances have been more than ordinary who have done most service for their king and country deserve certainly a more particular respect and should be considered with more regards and should have the fairest acknowledgments and treated with the best civility like parting friends that are ready to take leave of the world but alas this seldom happens for old services are usually forgotten especially in an age where young men see visions and old men dream their former actions and repeated good services being no more taken notice of than if they had never been though even decency and goodnature should at least make them be respected for them  thus the state of mortals in this life is very changeable if we are invited to cast anchor awhile in some calm serene season if we are permitted to careen and recruit our weatherbeaten spirits enjoying some short interval of rest and ease the indulgence soon expires and we are forced to hoist sail with double diligence least we suffer a wreck for we fly at random in a sea of perpetual hazards and difficulties and yet the shortness of life is the common complaint of most people who make it short either by doing ill doing nothing or doing things besides their business so that this large extent of life will not perhaps amount to the minority of man so that it may be a long being perhaps a short life for it is not the number of years that makes death easy to us but the temper of the mind he that would live a little longer this day would be as loath to die a thousand years hence go we must at last no matter how soon it is the work of the almighty to make us live long but it is own business to make a short life sufficient life is to be measured by our actions not by time a man may die old at thirty and young at eighty the one lives after death the other perished before he died and therefore that noble general similis who lived to a great age and retired from business to his devotion seven years before his death would have only this epitaph in substance engraved upon his tombstone here lies similis of a very great age and yet lived only seven years  old age is the effect of providence how long i shall live is only in gods power but it is in my power how well how great a shame is it then to be laying new foundations of life at our last gasp for an old man with one foot in the grave to go to school again while we are young we may learn because our minds are then tractable and our bodies fit for labor but when old age comes on we are commonly seized with sloth and afflicted with diseases and at last we leave the world as ignorant as we came into it only we die worse than we were born which is our own fault i wish with all my soul that i had thought better and sooner of my end but i must now make the more haste and being in good health i must spur on like those that set out late upon a journey it is better to learn late than not at all although it be only to instruct me how i may leave the stage of this world with a perfect resignation with a true sense of the sins of my forepassed life with a true fear of god and a sure trust in his mercy and thus i shall sink with ease into my grave and though i die old i shall rise young in the other world for that state is an eternal spring ever flourishing and shall gently pass from one extreme to another  finis books printed for and sold by jonas brown at the black swan
