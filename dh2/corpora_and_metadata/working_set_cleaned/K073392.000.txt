an essay on sculpture  pericles from a bust in the possession of charles tley eq  portrait of pericles  an essay on sculpture in a series of epistles to john flaxman esquire ra with notes   themistius orat de amicitia scrissi i sensi dun cor sincero e bianco che se in vaghezza poi manca lo style nel zelo almeno e nell amor non manco salvator rosa by william hayley esquire  london printed by a strahan printers street for t cadell jun and w davies in the strand   00  introductory letter to mr flaxman  receive my dear friend with your usual kindness the longsuspended work of which i had the pleasure of repeating to you a few verses as a joyous salute on your safe arrival from rome in the year      i then hoped to render it a more early and a more cheerful tribute to your improved talents and to our long friendship my production is not such as i intended yet i trust in its present state it is not utterly unworthy of your acceptance or of that favor which every warm heart must be inclined to hope its endeavors to celebrate the genius of a friend may receive from the public  you know but too well what impediments of anxiety and affliction have thwarted for years the progress of a performance that the honest pride of friendship would have zealously labored to make more worthy of the artist to whom it is inscribed i am yet willing to think that affliction so often useful in life may have had some sort of beneficial influence on this composition sunt lacrymae rerum et mentem mortalia tangunt  as much as my work has lost in knowledge and refinement by the severe trouble that interrupted and changed its course it may have gained perhaps in nature and pathos i could hardly convert the sufferings of your dear disciple to a use more noble than that of making them instrumental in any degree to the reputation of such an instructor  when i began the poem i intended that it should comprize a sketch of modern as well as ancient art but my attention has been turned from donatello ghiberti and their successors to the dearer juvenile artist who after the fairest promise of future excellence under your tender and animating care has been destined to lose the uncommon advantages he possessed and valued by a length of sickness and complicated sufferings  i have now watched you know considerably more than two years over this interesting invalide i have seen him enduring a horrible series and variety of increasing tortures yet in this very long trial of a martyrs constancy and courage i have never heard a single murmur escape from his lips but have beheld him triumph over the severest unmerited corporeal torments by the serenity fortitude and sweetness of a spirit truly angelic in a part of this long and distressing period i have resumed at his affectionate request my suspended work and advanced in it by such troubled industry as those only can perfectly conceive who have forced the mind to labor with motives of similar affection and with similar disquietude  under such circumstances you will not blame me for allowing my just admiration of your affectionate and magnanimous though disabled disciple to alter the intended current of my verse writing as i have ever done from the heart i have followed its imperious suggestions and your sympathy my dear friend which i am confident i shall obtain in this part of my subject will form at once my justification and my reward  for your credit i ought perhaps to apprize my reader that whatever defects he may discover in my book they are to be ascribed solely to myself as my sequestered life has not allowed me to derive from several distant friends of intelligence far superior to mine on the subject which i presume to treat that light which might otherwise have embellished my composition i ought not to expose them to a suspicion of having suggested or countenanced any erroneous ideas that a production of retired yet often interrupted study may happen to contain  to guard myself also from a charge of presumption it may be proper to declare that in venturing to write upon sculpture i pretend not to instruct the accomplished artist or the real connoisseur two classes of men whom i ought rather to consult for information and from whom i must ever have much to learn but i had persuaded myself that by an extensive poem on this untried subject i might be so fortunate as to promote the celebrity of a friend in whose talents i delight and afford some kind of assistance to all the admirers of sculpture in their various endeavors to naturalize a deserving art which may still be considered as little more than an alien in our country if we compare the portion of public notice and favor which it has hitherto obtained among us to the honor and influence it enjoyed in the ancient world  to encourage a general delight in the ingenious arts and to extend the reputation of their successful professors has ever appeared to me one of the most desirable purposes that poetry can pursue and particularly when that purpose is happily blended with the interest and the honor of friendship  should the wishes of those whom i regard induce me in a season of more tranquillity and leisure to delineate the rise and progress of modern art in another poem for which i have abundant materials i shall probably introduce that new subject by a sketch of the injuries that sculpture sustained from the sect of iconoclasts or imagebreakers and the animation it might acquire from the discovery of herculaneum and a more spirited research in the subterranean cities  i intimate these topics to obviate any surprise that my reader might feel on not finding them mentioned in the present work they appeared to me as more suited to form the line of connection between the two distinct provinces of ancient and modern sculpture  but whatever fortune may attend me as the admirer and the eulogist of your noble art that you my excellent friend may long cultivate and improve it and that universal applause and increasing felicity may be justly and graciously bestowed by earth and heaven on your labors and your life is the cordial wish of  your very sincere and fervent though deeplyafflicted friend w h april      00 epistle the first cognatas arts studiumque affine sequamur milton argument of the first epistle fervent wipes for the safety of the sculptor returning

faithful still to thee with martial fire to speak in marble even till war expire thus ardent flaxman while you now review romes sculptured glories in a fond adieu now haste admonished by instructive time with filial pride to englands rougher clime the studious hermit who in that dear isle you left deprived of healths inspiring smile to prosper your return with votive lays resumes the lyre of friendship and of praise dear student active as the greeks of old in toil as steady as in fancy bold blending of discipline each separate part diffusive knowledge with concentered art and adding as you climb discoverys hill the scholars learning to the sculptors skill those years that rolled over thee with luster kind ripening thy labors much and more thy mind those years that gave thy faculties to shine in mists of malady enshrouded mine think with what grief the spirit of thy friend anxious as thine but anxious to no end year after year of feverish sloth the prey has seen each project of his mind decay and drop like buds that when the parent rose sickening in drought where no kind current flows feels parching heat its genial powers enthrall unblown unscented and discolored fall disease dread fiend whatever name thou bear i most abhor thee as the child of care nor fixed of feature nor of station sure thy power as noxious as thy shape obscure while thy cold vapors with a baleful gloom blight intellectual fruits however they bloom yet even over thee in thy despotic hours when thou have chained the minds excursive powers though to thy gloomy keep by pain betrayed that mind can triumph by celestial aid from thee dull monitor even then can learn a mental lesson of most high concern  to know the suffering spirits sure resource and hail the hallowed fount of human force god of those grateful hearts that own thy sway however their fibers flourish or decay safe in thy goodness with no will but thine thy dearest gifts i cherish or resign yet if by storms of many a

gift from thee poets dear sculptor who to fame aspire fearless pretend to inspirations fire we boast of muses who without reward furnish the favored harp with golden chord yet to be frank though pensive from my youth i played with fiction as a child of truth when my free mind in healths light vest was clad a feeling heart was all the lyre i had but quick as memnons statue felt the day and spoke responsive to the rising ray so quick the fibers of that heart i deem of excellence new risen to feel the beam feel the pure light a vocal transport raise and fondly hail it with melodious praise but pain dear flaxman the dull tyrant pain a new cambyses broke this lyre in twain still like the statue severed on the ground though weaker still its wonted voice is found warmed by that light they love the very fragments sound see note i  o could the texture of this suffering brain the pleasing toil of patient thought sustain unwearied now as when in grantas shade friendship endeared the rites to learning paid when keen for action whether weak or strong my minddisdaind repose and to prolong the literary days too brief delight assigned to social study half the night with ardour then proportioned to thy own my verse dear flaxman in a louder tone should lead thy country with a parents hope to give thy talents animating scope pleased ere thy genius its best record frame to sound a prelude to thy future fame but worn with anguish may thy bard command such notes as flowed spontaneous from his hand in that blessed hour when his applauded muse fond of no theme but what his heart might choose appeared that hearts ambitious hope to crown the happy herald of a friends renown when truth reechoed her ingenuous praise and our loved romney triumphed in her lays the arts and friendship are angelic powers worshipped by me through all my checkered hours my early offerings at their feet i cast be theirs my present song and theirs my last if health to him who often with fruitless sighs watches the glance of her averted eyes those eyes whose light can withered minds renew those stars that shed an intellectual dew  if health will yet her inspiration give call into life my verse and bid it live years that like visions vanish all by stealth when time is dancing to the harp of health  but long long links of an oppressive chain when his dull steps are told by lassitude and pain  years have elapsed since full of hope for thee thy bard though wrecked on studys restless sea yet aimed to give by friendships kind control miltonic see note ii temper to thy fervent soul and well have thou to make those years conduce to future honor and immediate use assigned of early life thy studious prime to bright italias artenlightend clime that clime where milton at an age like thine imbibed the fervor of sublime design as emulation winged his soul with fire in song to triumph over the tuscan quire and tassos muse with epic glory bright impelled his fancy to a nobler flight so may the modern lord of sculptures sphere whose mighty hand to many an art was dear  may lofty angelo thy mind inflame as happily to vie with tuscan fame then shall thy country while thy works display force feeling truth and beautys moral sway radiant at last with sculptural renown a gem long wanting in her lucid crown feel new distinction animate her heart and high precedence hold in every

friend whose wellinstructed youth engraved on thy heart this animating truth talents are power which men from god deduce and best acknowledge by benignant use  may thou by years of prosperous study reach remote perfection that no precepts teach may thou like angelo and milton close a life of labor in divine repose in that calm vale of years by science blessed where wellearnd honor warms the

guide a crippled boatswain for old englands sake by his shrill note may abler seamen wake to happier service than himself could yield if yet unshatterd on the watery field o generous passion under just command enlightened fondness for our native land thy potent fire the grecian arts refined and made them idols of the cultured mind from thee the hero as the artist caught vigor of nerve and dignity of thought great were thy wonders in the world of old when glory triumphed over inferior gold but skeptics say that in the modern breast the patriot passion is a sordid jest the knavish politicians pompous mask that to the wise betrays his secret task to cheat a nation with fictitious zeal and ape the noble warmth he never can feel o blind to nature the false sage who thinks that by the touch of time her treasure sinks the mighty parent draws from heaven the power freely to lavish her exhaustless dower that useful pride which under many a name the spring of action in the human frame gives at all periods through her wide domain force to the heart and fancy to the brain  the fruit may fail as time and chance decree but every age and soil produce the tree  that pride the generous root of grecian praise lives yet unweakend lives in modern days and often it shoots as many bards attest with attic vigor in an english breast say fervent flaxman when with new delight thy travels led thee first to feast thy sight where sculpture reigns and holds her triumph still with hoarded miracles of ancient skill when first thine eyes those darling forms surveyed that make the colors of description fade feeling their potent charms in every vein till admiration rose almost to pain  proved not thy swelling heart a proud desire that if pure health will guard thy mental fire thou by impassioned toils repeated touch for thy dear england may achieve as much as ever grecian hand for greece achievd when hands gave life to all the soul conceived feelings like these the fervent milton found roving in studious youth over tuscan ground such of refined ambition justly proud his candid spirit to the world avowed when of his lot he spoke his early sense and consecrated life to toil intense see note iii  let pert conceit whom lighter fancies guide the aid of toil and piety deride let flippant wit conceive them dull allies that might forbid his active wing to rise and with a swallows flight to dart at gilded flies pure minds to whom the highest powers are given own what they owe to industry and heaven milton by ceaseless toil to glory climbed and strong devotions fire his soul sublimed meek newton thus his modest wisdom taught all that i have done is due to patient thought see note iv  hard is their fate most pitiably hard who feel the shattered mind from toil debarred whom on exploits of intellect intent distemper holds in sloths dark prison pent forbid in fancys favorite wilds to range and destined with reluctance to exchange refined ambitions brave and spotless strife for low and little cares of languid life see note v  how often dear active friend in listless pain thy distant invalid has wished in vain for strength through roman fanes with thee to rove and pausing near the capitolian jove in scenes with solemn inspiration fraught catch the strong impulse of inspiring thought while thou in mental luxury refined have nobly banqueted thy thirsty mind with all that art could yield or taste require as purest aliment to fancys fire  while thy unwearied hand and soul elate have jointly toiled to copy or create my suffering mind would to itself complain too conscious that the cloister of the brain seemed like a fabric ransacked by a goth whose cruel enmity and wasteful wrath defacing all that truth had treasured there left but a cell for sorrows silent prayer but hence desponding sloth hence dull complaint that make even pitys wearied spirit faint if health like fortune with capricious sway chequers the course of lifes contracting day from each coy goddess with delight we learn long absence but endears the late return since my firm friend for travels noblest use sailed with the blessing of a sick recluse i have not lost though cramped and cabind here in fruitless sloth each intervening year though health denied me limbs that might ascend rough alpine heights with my excursive friend a different cause and of a later date fixing to english ground my studious fate bade me no more that pleasing hope resume with thee instructive guide to study rome see note vi  the high and hallowed bard whose muse of fire may as i wished thy plastic hand inspire milton himself with unresisted sway held me from thee and roman joys away justice and truth with strong affection joined imperious rulers of the feeling mind urged me to vindicate from many a wrong the slandered paramount of english song happy dear friend if this reviving hand the line of just resemblance may command true as thy chissel that can marble warm with all the life that speaks in outward form o if in kind beneficence profuse heaven deigns at destined periods to produce superior spirits on this earthly stage to light and elevate a groveling age to show how genius bears afflictions rod and fix the desultory soul on god such the fond reverence of the world to claim nature to england gave in miltons name by darkness undismayed by toil untird when conscience dictated or heaven inspired first of poetic minds if fondly true my willing heart has paid thee homage due if this weak hand elaborately just cleared thy bright image from detractions rust teach me to baffle adverse healths control with all thy fervency and force of soul as amulets against all worldly ill in my free breast thy sentiments instill not thy crude thoughts of democratic sway the hasty fruits of a distempered day but never changing with the changeful hour thy sense of human hopes and heavenly power in one sensation one  my dearest pride  well may i boast a heart to thine allied in this my thoughts with thy frank words agree that if by nature or by fates decree no toils of mine can teach me to ascend heights of perfection that may wait my friend the powers of heaven or earth will never prevent my minds persisting in its favorite bent to joy in excellence and honor those on whom that coyest queen her smile bestows see note vii  blessed if to future time my verse descend a just record of an excelling friend blessed if with generous sympathy surveyed and its pure aim against its failings weighed it serve to quicken in the public mind love for those gentler arts that grace mankind thus my dear flaxman while i now descry thy goddess sculpture in my mental eye hoping the winds by her entreaties won will waft in safety home her traveled son thy bard resuming longforsaken rhyme soothes in this rambling verse the anxious time musing if heaven may to his mind afford joys inspiration for a friend restored how he may raise in that propitious hour an altar worthy of thy guardian power describe her progress from her distant birth and all her bounty to the embellished earth then how pure zeal in this enlightened isle may court her presence may ensure her smile and cherish hope that here she may attain dominion equal to her attic reign yes though fierce havoc in these frantic times makes each fine art recoil from mortal crimes yet in celestial wraths relenting day those

friend of the mourner guardian of the tomb may i chaste sculpture without blame presume rude in thy laws thy glory to relate to trace through checkered years thy changeful fate and praise thee forming with a potent hand thy new dominion in my native land while zeal thus bids the breath of incense roll from that pure censer a benignant soul and with the fond sincerity of youth would blazon merit in the tints of truth enlivening friendship shall those aids supply that injured health and troubled years deny her hallowed fire like inspirations beam may raise the poet to his honored theme as

refined enthroned each science in his ample mind tells in his hallowed page how sculpture rose to soothe the anguish of parental woes how first a father in afflictions storm of his dead darling wrought the mimic form impassioned natures laudable relief till impious worship grew from tender grief see note iii  no single region of the spacious earth can take exclusive pride in sculptures birth wherever god with bounty unconfined gave man his image a creative mind its lovely children arts mimetic sprung and spoke through different lands in every tongue though keen research elate with learnings pride from vain conjecture would in vain decide how sculpture first in early twilights hour made the first essay of her infant power though clouds of fabulous tradition hide her famed

bold description of a greek her favorite arts primaeval skill was seen to form the semblance of that syrian queen whose daring hand the dart of triumph hurled who ruled in babylon the eastern world

immortality they gave see note xi  how different the roman sculptors fate who followed in a tame and abject state an art not raised to glory or to grace deemed the poor trade of a dependent race the chissel to a servile hand consigned shows but the weakness of a servile mind hence liberal sculpture raised no roman name high in her annals of ingenious fame and hence the goddess with a scornful smile spurns the distinction of her roman style see note xii  with just disdain that to abhorrence swelled she the base arrogance of rome beheld saw roman robbers of heroic size not merely seize as bold ambitions prize her dearest wealth in desolated greece but as presumption will with spoils increase from her greek statue its just name efface and fix a lying title in its place so ruffian pride that fortune deigns to crown would with a swindlers fraud usurp renown while dauntless truth undazzled by the blaze of romes fierce power in her despotic days upbraids that empress with reproof severe for follies and for crimes in sculptures sphere while scorn condemns her rapine and her fraud with equal warmth let justice still applaud one proof of noble spirit that prevailed even in this very sphere where most she failed yes it was spirit suited to such worth as well might claim preeminence on earth which in the walls he labored to oerthrow honored the statue of her fiercest foe such brave

feelings fled on blood the hell hounds of proscription fed met not a righteous sword or potent hand to free from such a pest his native land yet though he stemmed the streams of blood he spilt he died a lesson to gigantic guilt for on his bed of death as long he lay avenging vermin made his living frame their prey and he whose thirst of power and thirst of praise taught fortunes temple in new pomp

his liberal care to force the grave her buried works to spare to guard the rescued and the lost to seek let corinth rising from her ruins speak that brilliant queen of arts at caesars word sprung from

firm brutus not pronounced his doom his power to fascinate relenting rome his varying genius fashioned to prevail in peaceful projects of the grandest scale would over the state have thrown such

vanish in the friend julius thou proof how mists of pride may blind the eye of reason in the strongest mind it was thy fatal weakness to believe thy sculptured form from romans might receive homage as tame as asian slaves could pay their babylonish king of boundless sway where all for leave his city gate to pass bent to his statue of imperial brass with equal pomp by vain ambition placed thy sculptured form the capitol disgraced for on a trampled globe insulting sense it sought to awe the world with proud pretense nor did thou only in thy proper frame call art to second thy aspiring aim

bid fair sculpture a new pomp assume and sit the public patroness of rome for such great charge to her he seemed to give when the lost worthies she had taught to live whose blended merits in the tide

light they love the very fragments sound an allusion to the frequentlycited verse of juvenal dimidio magicae resonant ubi memnone chordae  there is hardly any work of antiquity more celebrated than this mysterious image a favorite object of ancient and of modern curiosity considering the attention paid to it in different ages it is singular that the mutilated statue should still retain a name which according to an ancient tradition was assigned to it improperly  this miraculous colossal figure is commonly called the statue of memnon and supposed to represent an ethiopian prince of that name the son of tithonus and aurora but pausanias from whom we derive one of the early accounts of it expressly says the inhabitants of the city where it was placed the thebans of egypt asserted that it was not a representation of memnon  pausanias p  0  edit kuhnii  but of phamenophis a native of their country and i have heard persons affirm continues pausanias that it is the statue of sesostris which cambyses broke asunder and now as much of it as extends from the head to the middle of the body is thrown down the remainder is still sitting and sounds every day at the rising of the sun its sound is most like the bursting of a string on the harp or lyre  the intelligent and accurate strabo has recorded his own visit in a more early age to this statue in company with his friend aelius gallus and a military train he declares that he heard the miraculous sound but intimates a doubt whether it really proceeded from the base from the fragment of the figure or from the artifice of persons who formed a busy circle round it  strabo lib xvii p      edit   0   strabo does not assign any name to the statue in question but calls the scene where it was placed the memnonium here he says are two colossal figures each of a single stone and near to each other one is preserved the upper part of the other has fallen and as they say by an earthquake  the sagacious geographer expresses in very strong terms his unwillingness to believe that the surprising sound he heard could be the spontaneous production of the stone itself    a respectable traveller of our own country the learned faithful and elaborate pococke has labored to gratify curiosity concerning this this celebrated image by a very minute description illustrated by engravings yet with every advantage that erudition and a survey of the fragment could afford him he is obliged to leave the subject still involved in considerable darkness for among the various statues that he examined in this interesting scene the ruins of thebes he found that two of them had pretensions to be regarded as the miraculous image mr de caylus has distinguished the statue of remote antiquity from that of a later time in the following remark on egyptian antiquities  il ne faut pas confondre la statue de memnon dont parle pline avec celle qui subsiste et qui a inspire une si grande curiosite aux voyageurs anciens et modernes non seulement cette derniere est colossale mais elle est de granite dailleurs elle etoit antique a legard de pline puisqu elle etoit placee de son tems dans lendroit quelle occupe aujourdhui cesta dire horse de la ville de thebes assez pres des tombeaux des anciens rois d aegypte et quelle avoit ete elevee avaunt la conquete que les perses firent de ce pays tandis que la statue de basalte que pline present comme un objet beaucoup moins considerable etoit consacree dans un temple de serapis dont le culte na ete introduit en aegypte que sous les ptolemees antiquites de m de caylus tom v p     and of these he has given the following circumstantial account  in the second court of the temple are remains of two statues of black granite that to the west which is sitting measured from the hand to the elbow five feet thence to the shoulder four the head is three feet and a half long and the ear is one foot in length the statue to the east is three feet five inches long in the foot at a distance from it is the head with the cap it is three feet six inches long and behind it is the ornament of the domeleaf some persons have thought that one of these is the statue of memnon from the temple i went to the statues which i shall call the colossal statues of memnon they are toward medinethabou i spent above half a day at these statues they are of a very particular sort of porous hard granite such as i never saw before it most resembles the eaglestone  the statues look to the southsoutheast and are on a pedestal or plinth entirely plain that to the north is thirty feet long and seventeen broad the pedestal of the other is thirtythree feet long and nineteen wide and they are about thirty feet apart that to the south is of one stone the statue to the north has been broken off at the middle above the arms that lie on the hams and it has been built up with five tiers of stones  one to the top of the clinch of the elbow another almost half way up the arm one to the armpits the fourth to the neck and the fifth the head and neck of one stone the other tiers have two stones in front except that the middle tier has three and there are two stones in the thickness of the statue the feet are broken a quarter off from the toes but as i did not take a particular draught of the parts of the statue that are maimed i thought it better to give it entire from the drawing and observations i did make i found the height from the bottom of the foot to the top of the knee to be about nineteen feet from the bottom of the foot to the ankle two feet six inches to the top of the instep four feet the foot is five feet broad and the leg is four feet deep the ornament behind the head seemed to be the domeleaf as i have it on a statue of harpocrates at the side of the legs are two reliefs and one between the legs of the natural height but much defaced between the former and the great statue are hieroglyphics the pedestal of the imperfect statue is cracked across at the distance of about ten feet from the back part there are also some flaws and cracks in the other statue but it is of one stone which i dare positively affirm and in which i could not be mistaken having been twice at the statues i spent half a day there and took down in my notes an account of every stone of which the upper part of the other is built on the pedestal of the imperfect statue is a greek epigram and on the insteps and legs for about eight feet high are several inscriptions in greek and latin some being epigrams in honor of memnon others the greater part testimonies of those who heard the sound and some also in unknown characters all the inscriptions are ill cut and in bad language both on account of the hardness of the stone and the ignorance of the people who probably made money by cutting these inscriptions for those that came to hear the sound i copied them with all the exactness i could though many of them were very difficult to be understood and i was not entirely undisturbed while i was doing it  thus far i have transcribed the industrious and accurate pococke because his mensuration affords a satisfactory idea of egyptian sculpture i omit his discussion of the arguments concerning the point which of the two statues he has mentioned is the real memnon because some ideas suggested by a later and more lively traveller of france have led me to believe that the report of pausanias was perfectly true and that the mavelous statue was never intended to represent the prince of aethiopia how it acquired the name of memnon we shall gradually discover  m savary in his elegant amusing letters on egypt has compared such relics of thebes as he could investigate himself with the descriptions of this magnificent scenery that are to be found in ancient authors particularly diodorus siculus and strabo by whose assistance he endeavors to throw new light on this miraculous image he falls however into an evident mistake in saying that strabo calls it the statue of memnon that illustrious and accurate geographer only says after naming a place which he calls  a word that may signify the temple or perhaps merely the monuments of memnon that it contained two colossal statues which he proceeds to describe in the manner i have already mentioned but the ingenious french traveller borrowing perhaps a hint from strabo  strabo p       though he does not intimate that he did has ventured to bestow on the broken colossus commonly called the statue of memnon the name of osymanduas as he conceives that the dimensions of the figure and the scene around it sufficiently answer to the magnificent description by which diodorus has commemorated the tomb of that egyptian monarch whose title pococke bestows on another colossal figure m savary goes still farther in his probable conjecture and imagines that cambyses was tempted to break the stupendous image by the inscription which it bore according to the narrative of the greek historian which inscription the french traveller translates in the following words je suis osimandue roi des rois si lon veut savoir combien je suis grand et ou je repose que lon detruise quelquun de ces ouvrages  diodorus siculus   i am osymanduas the king of kings if any one wishes to know how great i am and where i repose let him conquer some of my works the word  literally let him conquer is rendered by the english traveller let him surpass by the french traveller let him destroy the latter in his interpretation of this superb inscription seems to reduce it to a level with the pleasant mysterious epitaph in gil bias a qui esta encerrada el alma del licenciado pedro garcias and to suppose that it was designed to lead some ingenious interpreter to the happy discovery of a latent treasure though i presume to rally the accomplished traveller of france for his subtle construction i am still particularly inclined to credit the conjecture of m savary concerning the proper title of this celebrated colossal figure because it tends to confirm another conjecture by which i would account for the manner in which it acquired the very different name of memnon diodorus siculus in describing the tomb of osymanduas and the colossal statues with which it was adorned declares that these statues were the work of memnon sycnites this sculptor must have been an artist of the highest celebrity in his time hence perhaps his most remarkable statue assumed the name of its maker in preference to that of the monarch whom it was designed to represent and hence as the name of this mavelous sculptor happened to be also the name by which an heroic prince of aethiopia was distinguished who is supposed to have founded the city of abydus in egypt many fabulous stories seem to have been invented to account for what in all probability never existed i mean a sculptural representation of the ethiopian hero the ally of priam and the unsuccessful antagonist of achilles among the colossal statues of thebes  having expatiated so far on the name of this interesting image i will add but a few remarks on its miraculous sound strabo and savary seem to have agreed in the idea that the wonder was rather to be slighted as the mysterious device of priestcraft than to be regarded as a genuine miracle of nature yet the eminent philosophical poet of derbyshire who has introduced this fascinating statue into his delightful botanic garden appears in a note to that poem to think that philosophy might very honestly contrive to produce a similar effect  it may be well worth the attention both of artists and philosophers to consider how far it may be possible and proper to engage the sense of hearing as an assistant to enhance the pleasure of sight when that pleasure arises from any grand work of art antiquity has proved that the picture of a battle may be exhibited to advantage with an accompaniment of martial music and perhaps in a great naval monument it would be easy to introduce and conceal such works of musical mechanism as might occasionally increase in a most powerful degree the delight arising from such a spectacle  i cannot quit the statue of memnon without mentioning the most illustrious of his ancient visitors these were the emperor hadrian with his empress sabina and a prince perhaps not less accomplished and certainly more amiable than hadrian that deserving idol of the roman people germanicus the historian tacitus who has recorded the visit of the latter to this attractive statue says not a syllable expressive of his own opinion concerning the miraculous sound ceterum germanicus aliis quoque miraculis intendit animum quorum praecipua fuere memnonis saea effigies ubi radiis solis icta est vocalem sonum reddens tacitus  i confess myself inclined to imagine that the marvel originated in the avaricious ingenuity of those who were engaged in showing this celebrated spectacle but a different opinion was entertained by a modern writer on statues whose authority is so respectable that i shall submit to the reader his more candid ideas on this interesting image the abbe comte de guasco whose learned and elegant historical essay de lusage des statues i shall have very frequent occasion to cite and to applaud speaks of this figure in his chapter on the prodigies and miracles attributed to statues he describes it as a statue raised to memnon by amenophis the second on the banks of the nile and after noticing the incredulity of strabo he says in a note which i shall transcribe that modern travelers had assured him they had been witnesses of the phenomenon which in his opinion may be fairly and naturally explained by atmospherical influence des voyageurs modernes mont assure avoir ete temoins de ce phenomene il nest pas etonnant que dans

the energy of those inventive passions love and grief we might be induced to suppose that the earliest efforts of rude sculpture would be such as they suggested for the purpose of obtaining a resemblance however imperfect of some mortal infinitely beloved or regretted but history proves that superstitious fear is a passion still more creative and in greece which may be considered as the home though not the native climate of sculpture it is evident that endeavors to represent different divinities by the rudest symbols preceded every attempt to express human features by any kind of model stocks and stones were confessedly worshipped as celestial powers in that land of ingenuity before any thing like a statue bust or medallion appeared the trunk of an old tree was solemnly preserved by the thespians and idolized as their juno clemens alexandrinus who gives a similar account of several ancient idols informs us that these rude symbols were gradually exchanged for statues of the human form which acquired the appellation   but stones of a cubic form were their more general symbols and pausanias mentions a collection of these at pharae in achaia in number about thirty and each distinguished by the name of a particular divinity  pausanias p      they stood near a statue of mercury and were probably regarded in the age of pausanias as curious relics of that ancient mode of worship which according to his account had been prevalent among all the greeks  at orchomenos the favorite seat of the graces so happily celebrated by pindar those interesting divinities were originally represented by three white stones when a rude symbol was exchanged in process of time for a more refined image the greeks were solicitous to preserve some idea of the original type a practice well illustrated by dhancarville in his remark on these memorable symbols that first represented the graces he imagines that the union of the symbols gave rise to the attitude which these patronesses of grecian art assumed in their subsequent form  lunion des trois pierres blanches qui indiquoient les graces a orchomene fut conservee lorsque la sculpture convertit ces pierres en

pleasure we naturally feel in such a contrast has induced many writers to investigate with great labor the obscure origin of different arts m dhancarville in the ingenious dissertations prefixed to his etruscan antiquities has endeavored to trace the rise and early progress of sculpture through many centuries of darkness prior to the age of daedalus a period with which the active enthusiasm of winkelman had seemed to satisfy itself in his elaborate and animated history of ancient art  if the conjectures of a writer may be trusted who ventures to delineate a period so very distant and dark the origin of grecian sculpture may be assigned to the reign of apis the successor of phoroneus about      years before the christian era ainsi linvention de la statuaire remonte jusquau tems de cet

disposition to fond idolatry in an afflicted parent two striking though very different characters of the ancient world are remarkable examples of this disposition  nimrod and cicero the strong feelings of nature on the loss of a beloved child produced the same wildness of affectionate fancy in the imperial hunter and in the republican philosopher those who recollect the infinite tenderness with which the great roman orator speaks in his letters of his darling tullia will forgive and pity the unhappy father whose excess of affliction led him so far to forget his own philosophical principles as to think very seriously of building not a tomb but a temple to his departed child as a proper object of worship the abbe mongault has clearly ascertained this intention of cicero in his interesting remarks on the fanum tulliae in the memoirs of the french academy  note iv ver    thy famed prometheus thy primaeval pride of all the celebrated personages of antiquity there is not one who seems to have had a harder fate in every point of view than this extraordinary character he has peculiar claims to a place in this work from having been long regarded as the very first of pagan artists and indeed the first of philosophers  aeschylus  the poets have represented him as suffering the severest of tortures for ingenuity and benevolence his acute and energetic spirit nobly painted by aeschylus rendered him a favorite hero of the athenian and afterward of the roman stage as we may conjecture from the fragments of accius at athens he had an altar inscribed to him in the academy and a festival was held in his honor distinguished by a race in which the candidates for the prize carried a flame as they ran and he only was considered as the victor who brought it alive to the goal  pausanias p    m de caylus has inserted in the first volume of his antiquities a vignette formed from a monument found in athens alluding to this race    pausanias who mentions this tribute to the memory of prometheus relates also that the inhabitants of phocis preserved with great veneration some relics of the very clay from which this first of modellers was said to have fashioned man  p  0   yet some of the pagan philosophers did not scruple to deny the mortal existence of prometheus and to reduce him to a mere symbol of mans inventive faculty some early christian writers treat him with still more severity the respectable lactantius in particular allows him his existence and his ingenuity but describes him as employing his rare powers to the basest of purposes to promote the preposterous ambition of his relation jupiter and as contriving by his sculptural art to convert the tyrant into a god stultus igitur et amens qui adorat quod ipse fabricavit cujus artificii

elaborate and candid history of philosophy has very modestly stated such conjectures of his own concerning this celebrated personage as account in a very probable manner for all his fabulous adventures this author imagines that prometheus was a servant high in the confidence of osiris an egyptian monarch who venturing without the permission of his sovereign to communicate the arts of egypt to the ruder greeks was imprisoned for that offense and tormented till the egyptian officer who guarded him was slain by hercules and the prisoner set free dicemus tamen quod nobis hac de re in

two palaces at each end of the bridge upon the bank of the river euphrates that on the west had an high and stately wall made of a round circumference upon which were pourtrayed in the bricks before they were burnt all sorts of living creatures as if it were to the life laid with great art in curious colors this wall was in circuit forty furlongs three hundred bricks thick and in height as ctesias says a hundred yards upon which were turrets a hundred and forty yards high the third and most inward wall immediately surrounded the palace thirty furlongs in compass and far surmounted the middle wall both in height and thickness and on this wall and the towers were represented the shapes of all sorts of living creatures artificially expressed in most lively colors especially was represented a general hunting of all sorts of wild beasts each four cubits high and upwards amongst these was to be seen semiramis on horseback striking a leopard through with a dart and next to her her husband ninus in close fight with a lion piercing him with his lance this palace far excelled that on the other side of the river both in greatness and adornments for the outmost wall of that made of wellburnt brick was but thirty furlongs in compass instead of the curious portraiture of beasts there were the brazen statues of ninus and semiramis the great officers and of jupiter whom the babylonians call belus and likewise armies drawn up in battalia and diverse sorts of hunting were there represented to the great diversion and pleasure of the beholders in the middle of the city she built a temple to jupiter whom the babylonians call belus upon the top she placed three statues of beaten gold of jupiter juno and rhea that of jupiter stood upright in the posture as if he were walking he was forty feet in height and weighed a thousand babylonish talents the statue of rhea was of the same weight sitting on a golden throne having two lions standing on either side one at her knees and near to them two exceeding great serpents of silver weighing thirty talents apiece here likewise the image of juno stood upright and weighed eight hundred talents grasping a serpent by the head in her right hand and holding a scepter adorned with precious stones in her left diodorus siculus translated by booth b ii chapter   such are the wonders of early art which diodorus has recorded as the works of semiramis on the authority of ctesias a native of cnidos who became the favorite physician of a persian monarch artaxerxes mnemon and in that situation had better opportunities of acquiring historical information concerning the antiquities of asia than his countrymen in general possessed of ctesiass extensive writings only a few fragments remain which are printed as a supplement to herodotus in the best editions of that historian the credit of ctesias has been severely attacked both by ancient and modern writers but m freret vindicates his veracity in several particulars like a very able advocate in more than one of his elaborate dissertations on points of ancient history inserted in the memoirs of the french academy the kind of credit that we may rationally give to the curious description that i have cited seems to be very heartily ascertained by the abbe guasco who thinks that although works of such magnificence were hardly executed at a period so early as that assigned to semiramis yet it is probable that such actually appeared in babylon in later ages but before art had made any considerable progress in greece or in egypt quelque

beauty as for her talents and power  aelian var hist lib   c     note vi ver    and hold semiramis herself a dream the boldest enemy to the mortal existence of this celebrated queen is the illustrious mythologist mr bryant who confidently says in the second volume of his great work i have shown that there was no such person as semiramis and again i think it is plain that semiramis was an emblem and that the name was a compound of sama ramas or ramis and it signified the divine token the type of providence and as a military ensign for as such it was used it may with some latitude be interpreted the standard of the most high it consisted of the figure of a dove which was probably circled with the iris as those two emblems were often represented together all who went under that standard or who paid any deference to that emblem were styled semarim or samorim  without robbing this highly respectable writer of the credit he justly derives from having thrown many satisfactory rays of light on the dove of the ark it might still perhaps be no very difficult task to establish the existence of one or of more than one semiramis against the supposition of his annihilating fancy and should the animated mr morrit amuse himself and his readers in vindicating the life and beauty of semiramis with the same spirit that he defended the palace of old priam against the destroying whirlwind of mr bryants imagination i hope the venerable coryphaeus of classical erudition who has himself made so free with the arguments and conjectures of the highest literary names will not feel angrily unwilling

disfigure their immortal works with the supposition that the inhabitants of england labor under a natural incapacity of attaining excellence in the fine arts a supposition that can only disgrace those who admit and endeavor to support it  note xi ver   0 and blessed a bold progenitor in thee daedalus was universally revered by antiquity as the father of grecian sculpture but in proportion as his genius became an object of public veneration his personal history was so involved in the decorations or disguises of fable that to the regret of those who love to investigate the lives of meritorious men it is hardly possible to obtain a satisfactory account of this celebrated sculptor architect and mechanist whose early and successful ingenuity has so justly endeared his name to every lover of art  the learned junius has assigned a very copious article to daedalus in his catalogue of ancient artists and the abbe gedoyn the respectable translator of quintilian and pausanias has introduced a history of daedalus into the memoirs of the french academy these two elaborate writers have collected all that antiquity could furnish to elucidate his life but they both seem to admit as an established fact one most dishonorable circumstance in the history of their hero which i am inclined to consider as not more entitled to serious credit than the most fabulous portion of his adventures i mean the horrid supposition that he enviously murdered his nephew and his disciple for possessing ingenuity superior to his own  of this i shall speak in its place let me first relate the more early particulars that ancient writers have recorded concerning this celebrated sculptor he was by birth an athenian and though authors differ on the name of his father they agree in representing him as the grandson or greatgrandson of erectheus the sixth sovereign of athens and pausanias asserts that he lived in the period when oedipus reigned in thebes that is about half a century before the siege of troy diodorus siculus who may be called the earliest biographer of daedalus that we possess describes him as having greatly improved the rude sculpture of his age and excited the admiration of his contemporaries before the charge of having destroyed his disciple reduced him to the necessity of flying from his country  in the account that diodorus has given of this very improbable crime there is one particular that seems to mark the whole story as a fabulous invention it is said that this ingenious disciple the son of his sister was led to invent a saw by the accident of finding the jaw of a serpent and by observing the use to which its teeth might be successfully applied it is also said that daedalus being surprised and questioned in the act of burying the murdered youth answered that he was consigning a serpent to the earth  the historian mentions it as a wonder and it seems one of those specious wonders which the greeks were so fond of inventing that the same animal the serpent should prove both the source of a most useful invention and the means of detecting an execrable crime the supposed criminal is said to have been condemned by that solemn tribunal the areopagus but the mode in which the royal sculptor is imagined to have accomplished the destruction of his disciple is such that it could hardly admit any legal proof of a murderous intention ovid has briefly and forcibly stated the circumstance to which i allude daedalus invidit sacraque ex arce minervae praecipitem misit lapsum mentitus   the poet adds that the falling youth was metamorphosed into a partridge by the pity of minerva and i confess that i consider the metamorphosis and the murder as equally fabulous  every good mind that reflects on the subject will esteem it hardly possible that a man in an elevated rank of life and blessed himself with a variety of talents could be induced to murder a promising youth whom he had engaged to instruct and the child of his own sister for displaying such ingenuity as a master and a relation would be naturally disposed to admire and encourage a fact of this complexion ought for the honor of human nature never to be admitted except in cases where the evidence that supports it is irresistible  for the glory of daedalus we may affirm that the improbable atrocity imputed to him is so far from being proved by any testimony that it rests only on dark tradition and the whole story has so much the air of a fable that it ought long ago to have been discountenanced and discarded by every serious biographer of this illustrious artist yet writers are so apt to transcribe the wonderful tales of their predecessors without examination or to credit enormities ascribed to men of talents and distinction that this barbarous story has been credulously repeated from age to age the modern and enlightened authors who have recently discussed the history of daedalus do not scruple to paint him as an assaisin the abbe gedoyn endeavors to varnish his own cruel credulity on this subject by the following remark de tout tems une basse jalousie a ete le vice des artisans meme de ceux qui font profession des arts les plus nobles jen pourrois citer plusieurs exemples en france comme ailleurs  an italian writer of our own time francesco milisia who has published an entertaining and successful history of architects ancient and modern speaks of daedalus in his architectural character and repeats in brief but energetic terms his visionary crime fra suoi allievi si contraddistinse un suo nipote da alcuni detto calo da altri attalo il quale invento tra le altre cose la sega el compasso ma dedalo ne concepi si nera gelosia che luccise  memory degli architetti antichi e moderni tomo i p    parma       as i am inclined to believe that the artists of england may be less acquainted with these feelings of nera gelosia to use the words of the italian whom i have quoted than the more impassioned natives of france and italy i hope they will approve my endeavor to vindicate from the horrible imputation of an envious murder their ancient brother of athens at all events i have a pleasure in persuading myself that he was as clearly innocent as he was confessedly ingenious when he removed from attica whatever the cause of that removal might be he is said to have obtained the friendship of minos the second of that name who reigned in crete and to have executed in wood two statues of phaedra and ariadne the celebrated daughters of the cretan monarch in crete he is reported to have built a labyrinth of mavelous intricacy and copied on a smaller scale from a portentous edifice of egypt he must have studied therefore the works of egyptian art in their own country before his visit to crete the cretans were ever remarkable for their gross deviation from truth and the narrative of some sculptural works ascribed to daedalus in their island contains the most filthy and disgusting fable that ever sullied the pages of fiction the reader acquainted with mythology will immediately perceive that i allude to the fable of pasiphae the most cruelly calumniated queen that ever suffered from the licentiousness of fancy some decent interpreters of her story have supposed that she was enamoured of a cretan officer who bore the name of taurus and that daedalus was employed in assisting their illicit attachment but lucian with an admirable mixture of wit and goodnature imagines the taurus of pasiphaes affection to have been merely the sign of the zodiac distinguished by that appellation and deadalus is very happily metamorphosed by this supposition from the culpable confident of a dishonorable intrigue into an innocent master of astronomy but however blameless the intercourse might be between the slandered pasiphae and the ingenious athenian daedalus appears to have incurred the resentment of the cretan monarch and to have been under the necessity of escaping from his dominion with secret rapidity hence arose the fable of his inventing wings for himself and his son icarus a fable so captivating to the fancy of the latin poets that ovid has related it twice at considerable length metamorph lib viii artis amatoriae libii  virgil has embellished it in a few verses of singular delicacy and pathos horace silius italicus and ausonius have all mentioned it occasionally the ancient and sensible interpreter of incredible fictions palaephatus has turned the fabulous wings of daedalus and his son into sails he asserts that being imprisoned by minos they escaped from a window of their prison and embarked in a skiff but being pursued by the vessels of minos in tempestuous weather the father only got safe to land and completed his escape apollodorus relates that hercules found the body of icarus cast ashore upon an island to which he gave the name of icaria in honor of the youth whom he buried the same author adds that daedalus rewarded his illustrious friend for this humanity shown to his unfortunate child by executing a statue of hercules which that hero mistaking in the night for a living figure is said to have struck with a stone pausanias mentions this statue as preserved by the thebans in a temple of hercules and gives a similar account of its origin as a tribute of gratitude from the afflicted father whose escape from crete he also ascribes like palaephatus to the use of sails though virgil and silius italicus represent daedalus as building the temple of the cumaean apollo immediately after his escape from the tyranny of minos the greek historian of his adventures supposes him to have proceeded from crete to sicily and to have ingratiated himself so successfully with cocalus a prince of that country that when minos with a naval force pursued and demanded the fugitive his generous protector instead of betraying his ingenious guest from whose architectural talents he is said to have derived great advantage endeavored to negotiate with minos in his favor the cretan monarch accepted the invitation of the sicilian prince and according to the accounts of more than one ancient greek author the daughters of cocalus contrived from their partiality to the athenian artist to destroy his formidable enemy which they are said to have accomplished by the means of a hot bath in such a manner that the cretans who attended their king supposed his death to be natural and departed in peace with his remains  a tale that has much the appearance of fiction  daedalus is reported to have expressed his gratitude toward his sicilian protector by executing many ingenious works in his country diodorus relates that he built an impregnable palace for his royal friend that he fortified and adorned the temple of venus erycina and that he constructed a vapourbath in which the sick were pleasantly cured of their infirmities without suffering from its heat  diodorus siculus lib   a curious proof of the antiquity and excellence of vapourbaths    concerning the latter days and death of daedalus antiquity furnishes no anecdotes but the learned abbe gedoyn imagines with great probability that from italy he passed again into egypt and ended his life in that country  an idea that he rests on the authority of the egyptian priests who reported according to the narrative of diodorus siculus that daedalus constructed a most beautiful vestibule to the temple of vulcan at memphis and was held in such veneration by the egyptians that they placed in that temple a statue which he had carved in wood of himself and raised in one of the adjacent islands a temple to the artist in which his memory was religiously worshipped by the natives of that country  thus incomplete are the best accounts that ancient and modern authors afford of this extraordinary and interesting personage whose existence like that of prometheus and semiramis has been questioned by the scrutinizing spirit of modern refinement a very ingenious and learned french commentator on pliny who seems actuated like mr bryant by a passion for etymological chemistry would reduce the active athenian artist into a mere syrian symbol daedale est un nom syrien dont les racines se retrouvent dans les deux mots hebreux dai preposition qui de meme que da en grec augmente le seus du mot quelle precede et dal pauvre daedale est done lembleme de la pauvrete du besoin premiere source necessaire des artson reconnoit manifestement le genie oriental dans cette fiction morase  m poinsinet de sivry in a note to his splendid and elaborate edition of pliny in latin and french twelve vols quarto it is remarkable that pliny does not mention the elder daedalus as a sculptor but celebrates him as the inventor of the saw the hatchet the level the gimblet isinglas and glue    but presuming on the evidence of several works very credibly imputed to this early sculptor that he really existed and presuming this with the more confidence because one of his works has the happy and immortal distinction of being described by homer i shall proceed to enumerate those memorable productions in sculpture which antiquity assigned to him and which the course of this narrative has not yet led me to mention of these the most striking are two statues of himself and his son icarus the one formed of tin the other of brass and said to have been stationed in those islands of the adriatic gulf that were called electrides  stephanus byzantinus de urbibus edit      p       aristotle from whom stephanus of byzantium borrowed his account of these questionable statues has mentioned daedalus as a maker of puppets that moved by an infusion of quicksilver an idea that dhancarville has ridiculed with contemptuous pleasantry  sur le temoignage dun certain philippe aristote plus de neuf cents ans apres dedale assuroit quau moyen du vif argent il fit une statue qui marchoit effectivement beaucoup dauteurs malheureusement tresgraves dion

seriusement de tells contes ils serviroient euxmemes de justification a ma croyance pausanias records with particular care the more authentic works of daedalus that remained in his time his statue of hercules at thebes of trophonius among the lebadenses in boeotia those of britomartis and of minerva in crete with the dance of ariadne mentioned by homer in the iliad and wrought on white marble among the delians a venus in wood with her right hand perishing by time and raised on a square basis instead of feet i am persuaded says pausanias that ariadne received this image from daedalus and carried it with her when she attended theseus the delians affirm that theseus himself devoted it to their apollo that it might not on his return to his own country awaken in his mind a painful and passionate recollection of ariadne besides these concludes pausanias i know not any works of daedalus remaining for as to those which the argives had consecrated in their temple of juno and those removed to gela in sicily from omphace they have disappeared by the influence of time  pausanias in a former part of his description had mentioned another statue of hercules by the same artist executed also in wood and placed near a temple of minerva in the territory of corinth this statue described as naked may be therefore considered as the source of the fashion that prevailed in the heroic images of greece and pausanias in his account of it delivers his opinion on the works of daedalus in general they did not satisfy the sight accustomed to the productions of improved art yet they had in them an air of inspiration  pausanias p       from this candid account a modern reader may easily conceive the kind of deficiency and the degree of animation that were visible in the statues of this early artist his extraordinary skill as a sculptor seems to rest on his marble basrelief representing the dance of ariadne i shall therefore close this long yet imperfect note on the father of grecian art by transcribing the description which homer has given of his most memorable work with the lively remarks of dhancarville on this ancient and interesting sculpture  homer in describing the shield of achilles pays the following tribute to the merit of daedalus                 iliad    v   0 a figured dance succeeds such once was seen in lofty gnossus for the cretan queen

version of my admirable friend which he has lately and happily retouched is more faithful to homer and to daedalus to these the glorious artist added next a varied dance resembling that of old in cretes broad isle by daedalus composed for brighthaird ariadne there the youths and youthalluring maidens hand in hand danced jocund every maiden neatattird in finest linen and the youths in vests wellwoven glossy as the glaze of oil these all wore garlands and bright faulchions those of burnished gold in silver trappings hung they with welltutord steps now nimbly ran the circle swift as when

parcequils touchent le coeur peuvent inspirer des idees riantes a lesprit par le souvenir des chooses agreables quils lui rappellent et fournir a tous deux les images charmantes dont il a fait usage  antiquites etrusques grecques et romans tom iii p    i have transcribed these copious remarks because they seem to place in a very fair and judicious point of view the merits of the early sculptor whose obscure history i have wished to illustrate with such a desire i have particularly to regret one of the lost comedies ascribed to aristophanes which bore the name of daedalus yet it is possible that such a composition might not have afforded that clear light concerning the life and character of the artist which we might eagerly expect from its title as it was the favorite amusement of aristophanes to ridicule the tragic poets of his country perhaps his daedalus contained little more than a ludicrous parody on the prometheus of aeschylus however this might be the name of daedalus appears to have been generally honored by the poets of greece and i hasten to conclude this attempt to elucidate and confirm his reputation with the words of a greek epigram that represent him as a paragon of excellence    momus will scoff at art in every shape nor could her hero daedalus escape   there were two subsequent artists of considerable eminence who bore the name of daedalus the first a native of sicyon acquired celebrity by many statues that are mentioned by pliny and pausanias the latter was probably a bithynian as he is supposed to have executed at nicomedia a wonderful image of jupiter the patron of armies  eustathius apud junium   the learned abbe barthelemy says in a note to his elaborate and lively travels of anacharsis je ne nie pas lexistence dun dedale tres ancien je dis seulement que les premiers progres de la sculpture doivent etre attribues a celui de sicyone  tom iii p      i am sorry to differ from so accomplished a judge of antiquity but i consider the sculptural merit of the elder daedalus as completely proved by the testimony of homer the works of endaeus the athenian disciple of this early artist are mentioned by athenagoras and pausanias the latter seems to have examined the works of endaeus with peculiar attention  note xii ver   0 and from oblivion saved the artist and the bard although the lacedaemonians were so little attached to the pacific and elegant pursuits of life that according to a bold expression of isocrates concerning them they were hardly acquainted with their letters yet they seem to have paid particular regard to the art of sculpture pausanias with his usual accuracy has recorded that this early and accomplished artist gitiadas whom he celebrates for the variety of his talents was a native of sparta  pausanias p   0  the minute and intelligent describer of his sculptural works speaks highly of the figures that he executed in brass particularly those of neptune and amphitrite that the lacedaemonians had a strong passion for sculpture seems evident from the magnificence of their amyclaean apollo whose throne was decorated by bathycles an artist of magnesia and comprised as m de caylus has justly observed an epitome of ancient mythology winkelman supposes bathycles to have lived in the age of solon one singular advantage which the spartans expected to derive from the possession of fine statues was to improve the beauty of their offspring a source of their partiality both to sculpture and to painting which junius has explained in the following passage lacedaemonii quondam in reliquis horridiores pulcherrimas quasque picturas in summo semper habuerunt pretio dicuntur enim de liberorum suorum pulchritudine tantopere solliciti fuisse ut formosissimorum adolescentium nirei narcissi hiacinthi castoris et pollucis deorumque speciosissimorum apollinis nempe ac bacchi effigies gravidis uxoribus repraesentarent junius de pictura veterum p     on the works of gitiadas which consisted of brazen basreliefs in the temple of the spartan minerva dhancarville has made the following judicious remark  la sculpture dans les ouvrages de gitiadas etoit aussi avancee que letoit la peinture dans ceux dhelotas faits peu avaunt lui suivant le rapport de pline cet art etoit par consequent arrive en greece au point ou il parvint en italy quand laurent ghiberti fit en bronze les admirables basreliefs

in the age of romulus  note xiii ver  0  where haste insulted his unfinished toil dipaenus and scyllis are usually mentioned together as brothers and associates in their art which they learnt from daedalus some authors according to pausanias supposed them to be his sons the most striking part of their history is contained in the following passage of pliny  marmore scalpendo primi omnium inclaruerunt dipaenus et scyllis geniti in creta insula etiamnum medis imperantibus priusque quam cyrus in persis regnare inciperet hoc est olympiade circiter l ii sicyonem se contulere quae diu fuit

preserved at constantinople    cedrenus p     edit venet note xiv ver     and blamed the mean abuse of mental power anthermus a sculptor in the island of chios had two sons of his own profession bupalus and athenis the brothers became famous by works of considerable merit in their art and still more so by their degrading it into an instrument of malevolence against the poet hipponax this animated but illfavored bard distinguished by mental talents and personal deformity is supposed to have been in love with the daughter of bupalus who to prevent a connection that he disliked is said to have exhibited a caricatura of the formidable lover the exasperated poet retaliated by a satire of such severity against the offending sculptors that according to tradition it made them frantic and impelled them to suicide  a story which as pliny justly observes upon it was sufficiently refuted by their subsequent productions  their caricature of hipponax perhaps the first caricature upon record is supposed by dhancarville to have suggested to thespis their contemporary the idea of furnishing his actors with a mask instead of coloring their faces with vermilion the satire of the vindictive poet though we may hope it did not produce the horrible effect ascribed to it appears to have given celebrity to its indignant author the greek anthologia contains no less than four inscriptions on this powerful satirist i have selected the two best of them for the amusement of my reader         grotii versio quam potes hinc tacitus transi ne forte crabronem expergefacias quem sopor altus habet

tomb for quiets sake lest you the bitter sleeping hornet wake for he whose gibes against his parents glanced here now the keen hipponax lies entranced beware for still his fiery words may flow and

dormi see here the bard hipponax lie hence from his grave if wicked fly here rest if thou in life art pure and if thou wish it sleep secure hipponax was a native of ephesus and he is celebrated by athenaeus as the inventor of parody but his title to that invention is in some measure controverted by the abbe sallier in his dissertation on the origin and character of parody in the memoirs of the french academy bail has an article on hipponax in which he has collected many curious examples of persons who have suffered from the dangerous severity of literary vengeance the enmity between the sculptor of chios and the ephesian satirist will probably recall to the recollection of an english reader the similar enmity between those bitter and powerful antagonists hogarth and churchill  from the slight fragments that remain of hipponax i am inclined to believe that his satires celebrated as they have been were inferior in genius and perhaps in acrimony to the vindictive performance of the english poet which contains so many beautiful passages beautiful both in sentiment and expression that although goodnature must wish the quarrel which produced it had never existed the poem is still admirable as a masterpiece of poetical indignation  note xv ver     whose very silence cried aloud be free the passion of the greeks for liberty was at once proclaimed and nourished by the various honors which they paid to the memory of harmodius and aristogiton  these celebrated young friends had perished in their perilous exploit of delivering athens from the tyranny of hipparchus but the grateful athenians revered them as the restorers of freedom and according to the animated expressions of demosthenes in their praise the veneration which they received from public gratitude was equal to that of heroes and of gods the four statuaries antenor critias antigonus and praxiteles had distinguished themselves at different periods in executing the statues of these favorite public characters pliny relates that this work of praxiteles was carried off by xerxes in the plunder of athens and restored to that city by alexander the great after his conquest of persia arrian appears so much pleased with this munificence of his hero to athens that he has mentioned the restitution of these interesting statues in two different passages of his history and exultingly says in his account of them they are now in the ceramicus   arrian de expedit alexandri lib iii  pausanias asserts that the statues were restored to athens by antiochus and valerius maximus ascribes the honor of their restitution to seleucus these contradictory accounts may be reconciled if we recollect that many statues were executed of these idolized martyrs to freedom and as it is probable that several of these were carried out of their country by the persian plunderers the honor of their restitution might of course be truly ascribed to more than one victorious friend to the arts and monuments of greece sculpture and poetry seem to have vied with each other in their endeavors to immortalize these young tyrannicides the athenian song of harmodius is proverbially famous and its potent enthusiasm is thus forcibly described by our learned and eloquent lowth in his admirable praelectiones  tam vehemens tamque animosum poeseos genus permultum habuisse momenti necesse est in hominum mentibus cum ad

spirited but dangerous repartee of antiphon who being asked by the tyrant dionysius what kind of brass was esteemed the best replied that which forms the statues of harmodius and aristogiton  note xvi ver     the future sunshine of a fairer hour among the infinite number of interesting personal anecdotes which the history of ancient sculpture displays there are hardly any more pleasing to the fancy or more calculated to exhibit the grecian character in a favorable point of view than the anecdotes preserved by pausanias concerning the athenian women and their children who having found a friendly refuge in the walls of traezene when the persian invasion reduced them to the necessity of flying from their native city had their statues erected in a portico of the traezenian forum i presume that these statues were a present from the people of athens they were such memorials as every patriot of greece must have contemplated with peculiar delight they were graceful monuments of grecian courage benevolence and gratitude the traezenians probably took infinite pride in these public ornaments of their city for they are described by pausanias as a people who delighted in every circumstance that reflected honor on the spot they inhabited  pausanias p       end of the notes on the second epistle notes on the third epistle note i ver    a thirst for praise and panting for the goal i follow the authority of cicero vitruvius and quintilian in naming myron as the earliest of the more accomplished grecian sculptors who acquired infinite celebrity by making near approaches to perfection in their art pausanias speaks of myron as an athenian but pliny affirms that he was born at eleutherae a city of baeotia and a disciple of agelades an artist of argos the bacchus of myron is said by pausanias to have excelled all his other productions except his statue of erectheus at athens but this very diligent artist appears to have executed many works of considerable excellence and to have been most commended for what he probably regarded as a trifling performance i allude to his famous heifer of brass celebrated by no less than thirtysix epigrams in the greek anthologia upon which the french sculptor falconet says with some pleasantry and some justice les atheniens etoient les francois de la greece et devoient fair autant de jolis verse sur un vache que nous en avons faits sur la chatte en sculpture de madame de lesdiguieres traduction des       et    livres de pline avec des notes par etienne falconet tom i p      i ought however to observe for the credit of athens that these epigrams are far from having been all produced by her citizens they form altogether such a heap of insipid compliments as would not i think have appeared very flattering to an artist of attic genius the following i believe is one of the best of them     grotii versio aut superinducta est isti cutis aenea vaccae aut aes hoc animam quae movet intus habet either this heifer has a brazen skin or else the brass contains a soul within myron whose discobolos proved how successfully he had studied the human figure could he have heard and understood the judicious language in which quintilian has mentioned that elaborate statue quid tam distortum et elaboratum quam est ille discobolos myronis si quis tamen ut parum rectum improbet opus nonne is ab intellectu artis absuerit in qua vel praecipue laudabilis est illa ipsa novitas et difficultas quintilian lib   c     would have been more gratified perhaps by the praise of the latin critic than by all the greek epigrams on his heifer this remark cannot be extended to pliny who has described the works of myron as rather deficient in expression an opinion which falconet pronounces to be an egregious mistake if the antique head of jupiter that was stationed in the garden of versailles and ascribed to myron is in truth a performance of this celebrated artist though i am generally disposed to take the part of pliny against the pert malevolence with which the lively and keen falconet has attacked and derided his opinions i must confess that i think the respectable connoisseur of ancient rome mistaken in the present point and his mistake appears sufficiently proved by the following animated greek verses on the ladas of myron a statue which if the poet who describes it may be trusted was surely a masterpiece of expression           grotii versio qualis eras lada fugiens vestigia thymi alipedis premeres cum pede flabra tuo nobilis ad pisae contendens praemia talem corpore te toto fecit in aere myron implet eum spes quanta vides et anhelitus ore cernitur ex imis ilibus exoriens prosiliet mox aes ad serta nec ipsa tenebit credo basis citus est spiritus ars citior anonymous on a footracer such as when foremost in the race you were and seemed to bound upon the buoyant air such ladas here by myrons skill you breathe ardent in all your frame for pisas wreath the fervid spirit from the heaving chest shines in the lips where is not hope expressed the brass springs forward in the nimble strife oh art more vivid than the breath of life i have sometimes thought that a new and more expressive reading might be introduced in the second line of this greek epigram thus  but i submit the fancied emendation to those readers who are particularly familiar with the most admirable of languages if they approve the slight change in the orthography which makes a considerable difference in the sense i would alter the english version of the couplet in the following manner such as when flying with the whirlwinds haste in your foots point your eager soul you placed etc   myron like other greek artists indulged his fancy in some works of supernatural magnitude and in some of extreme minuteness  strabo has recorded that the island of samos contained three colossal divinities by myron on one basis antony seized the whole groupe but augustus restored two of them hercules and minerva to their original station reserving the third a jupiter to adorn the capitol  strabo p      as to the minuter works of myron pliny has mentioned his monument of a grasshopper as celebrated in the verses of the poetess erinna a lusus of art executed probably to please some fanciful fair to whom the sculptor might be tenderly attached the lovers of sculpture must lament that an artist of such merit and celebrity had the misfortune of ending his days in deplorable indigence as junius with too much probability supposes him to have done from the following passage of petronius arbiter  myron qui pene hominum animas ferarum que aere comprehenderat non invenit haeredem note ii ver    the amazon of phidias yields to thine polycletus who obtained this singular triumph was a native of sicyon and a fellowstudent with myron under the same master agelades we are indebted to pliny for this interesting account of a contest for preeminence in beauty among the sculptured amazons executed by artists of different periods and consecrated in the temple of the ephesian diana he says that the artists who were present adjudged the point by declaring which statue each artist esteemed as second to his own by this ingenious mode of decision polycletus ranked as the first of the rival sculptors phidias the second ctesilas the third cydon the fourth and phragmon the fifth venere autem et in certamen laudatissimi quanquam diversis aetatibus geniti quoniam fecerant amazonas quae cum in templo ephesiae dianae dicarentur placuit eligi probatissimam ipsorum artificum qui praesentes erant judicio cum apparuit eam esse quam omnes secundam a sua quisque judicassent haec est polycleti proxima ab ea phidiae tertia ctesilae quarta cydonis quinta phragnonis plin lib    c    the modern french sculptor falconet exults in this anecdote as a proof of his favorite maxim que le peintre et le statuaire sont de meilleurs juges des productions de leur art que le public meme eclaire sur dautres matieres  as to the general merit of polycletus the words of the intelligent strabo give a very high idea of it where he says that the statues of this artist were in technical excellence most beautiful but in high finishing and magnificence inferior to those of phidias  strabo p       cicero has also mentioned the works of polycletus as examples of perfection nondum myronis satis ad veritatem adducta jam tamen quae non dubites pulchra dicere pulchriora etiam polycleti et jam plane perfecta ut mihi quidem videri solet  in his orations against verres the roman orator expatiates on the extreme beauty of two bronze figures the celebrated canephorae of polycletus and winkelman in his monumenti inediti no     has engraved from a basrelief in terracotta two athenian virgins that he supposes to have been copied from these favorite statues  but the most considerable performance of polycletus was his juno of argos or rather of mycenae according to the local description which strabo has given of her temple this admired statue is described by pausanias as a grand sitting figure of ivory and gold adorned with a crown on which the graces and the hours were represented the majestic image is also celebrated in the following greek epigram       grotii versio unus junonem vidit polycletus ab argis et nobis quantum viderat art dedit et decora ostendit quae fas modo caetera nam quae vest latens soli sunt ea nota jovi parmenio on the statue of juno the argive polyclete alone surveyed juno and such as he beheld portrayed the charms that man might view his art expressed no eyes but those of jove command the rest the reputation of polycletus seems to have been much extended by a treatise on proportion illustrated by a statue regarded as a model of perfect symmetry and said to have been studied as such in a later period by lysippus many writers have mentioned this remarkable statue but the most satisfactory account of it is contained in a passage of galen quoted by junius which expressly says that it was designed to confirm those principles of art which the sculptor taught in writing upon symmetry and that both his treatise and his statue were distinguished by a common name the canon of polycletus  galenus apud junium in catalogo artificum p      dhancarville in the following passage points out a mode of recovering the lost theory of the grecian artist  ces commentaires de polyclete malheureusement perdus aujourdhui ayant ete regardes autrefois comme la regle constamment suivie depuis son tems jusqua celui des antonins menechme xenocrates apelles qui vecurent dans cet intervalle ayant compose differens ouvrages sur les raisons de lart on ne peut douter quil naient contenu les principes de polyclete sur les symmetries et nous les y retrouverions si le tems neut pas detruit ces ecrits mais comme a son imitation les plus habiles artistes de lantiquite firent leurs statues dapres les regles etablies dans ses livres nous pouvons retrouver dans les plus belles statues antiques les proportions quil enseignoit devoir y entrer et juger dapres ces proportions sur quoi se fondoit la theorie des principes renfermes dans les ouvrages des anciens sur les symmetries et la beauty ideale the author pursues his idea in discussing proportions relating to the face collected by mengs and cited by winkelman from the finest specimens of ancient sculpture into the minutiae of such a discussion the intent of this work does not lead me to enter he draws an inference from these researches which i confess myself unwilling to allow for he says  quand les anciens arriverent a la decouverte des proportions convenables a la beauty ideale leur analogy avec les proportions harmoniques servit a prouver quils avoient incontestablement atteint au but de lart et limpossibilite de trouver une beauty superieure a celle qui resulta de ses proportions elle nous sert maintenant a demontrer que lart des grecs ne peut eh aucun tems ni en aucun lieu ni par aucun moyen etre surpass antiquites etrusques grecques et romans tom iv p      with an enthusiastic esteem and admiration for the excellence of the greeks in art and in literature the moderns ought to cherish a persuasion that even that excellence great as it is may possibly be surpassed such an idea may be censured as presumptuous but in every arduous pursuit a degree of presumption is the very source of success reason and fancy may unite in refusing to believe that in cultivating the fine arts any nation or any individual has yet arrived at the utmost limits of attainable perfection in sculpture indeed it is not very probable that any modern artist in any part of the globe may possess all the advantages to lead him to excellence which the sculptors of antiquity possessed yet the modern may avail himself of some advantages to which the ancient was a stranger but i forbear to enter on a topic which may be more properly discussed when modern art is the immediate subject before us  i return to polycletus  winkelman has styled him a sublime poet in his art and he seems indeed to have enjoyed that rare mixture of industry confidence and imagination which is so favorable to felicity in the works of his profession  aelian has related the following anecdote to show how successfully he corrected the temerity of popular criticism  polycletus executed two statues at the same time gratifying in the one the caprice of the crowd in the other adhering to the rules of art he gratified the multitude in this manner according to the suggestion of all his visitors he retouched and altered something in conformity to the opinion of each at last he produced his two figures the one was universally admired the other derided yet this said polycletus which you condemn is your own work and the other which you admire is mine  aelian var hist lib xiv c     it is recorded of this excellent sculptor that he excelled also as an architect and pausanias extols the temple of aesculapius which he built for the epidaurians as surpassing in harmonious beauty all the magnificent structures of the romans i shall close my imperfect account of this accomplished artist with the greek epigram on his statue of polyxena         grotii versio iste tuus labor est polyclete polyxena sensit non aliam felix ista tabella manum germanum junonis opus cerne ut sibi prudens obducat rupta tegmina vest pudor pro vita

to his juno decent care hides the rent vest that leaves her body bare wretched she prays for life and in her eyes lo troys whole war and all its trouble lies note iii ver     that athens was eclipsed by her olympian fane the talents and reputation of phidias were so great that they are allowed to form the most honorable era in the history of art the abbe gedoyn has added to his history of daedalus an account of this his most illustrious successor for the sake of displaying at once in the lives of these two memorable men the commencement and the perfection of sculpture athens had the honor of giving birth to them both for phidias by the authority of plato is proved to be an athenian he studied under two masters of no great celebrity agelas and hippias but he had the advantage of having two brothers distinguished by their talents as painters and the still greater advantage of having cultivated and brought to maturity his own genius at that fortunate period when the triumphant state of his country and the magnificent spirit of pericles afforded him a most favorable field for its exertion with what patriotic pride and delight must an attic sculptor have exerted his powers in converting that very marble which the persian invaders had brought with them to form a trophy of their conquest into a memorial of their defeat i allude to the nemesis of phidias a statue executed under these animating circumstances according to pausanias and stationed in a temple at rhamnus at the distance of sixty stadia from marathon  a statue celebrated in the following epigram             grotii versio me niveum viva lapidem de rupe cecidit marmoream rumpens cuspide duritiem persa daret cum vela notis ut fingeret ex me de cecropis victrix gente trophaea manus cladibus at marathon

nec minus assyriis theaetetus on the rhamnusian statue of nemesis of snowy whiteness from a mountain rock a median sculptor in a massive block shipped me for attica and doomed to stand his mark of triumph over this attic land but when at marathon fallen persia groaned and for invasion shattered ships atoned by attic art perfections nurse i rose in form a goddess who the proud oerthrows in different characters my figure speaks to persians vengeance victory to greeks      grotii versio figere quan tumidus sperabat persa trophaeum quam been nunc versus sum lapis in nemesim sto dea justa

happy truth imparts athenians triumph both in arms and arts phidias is said to have distinguished himself by his general knowledge and a perfect acquaintance with the laws of proportion and the principles of optics  that singular metrical compiler of anecdotes tzetzes has related in his versus politici a professional contest between phidias and alcamenes in which if credit may be given to such an historian this admired chief of athenian sculptors ran some danger of his life from the ignorance and irritability of his judges       the rival artists contended in forming a minerva of bronze for the city the most beautiful figure was to be chosen and stationed on a lofty column the two statues were produced that of alcamenes was immediately admired for its delicacy and the work of phidias appeared so disgusting to the people from its open lips and distended nostrils that its author was in some danger of being stoned to death by popular indignation      tzetzes chil       but when the rival goddesses were raised to their intended height alcamenes became the jest and phidias the favorite of the people  such is the amusing story of tzetzes what degree of serious credit it may deserve i leave to the judgment of my reader and hasten to notice the two most celebrated works of phidias his more magnificent minerva stationed as the patroness of athens in her temple called parthenon and the statue extolled as the masterpiece of antiquity his olympian jupiter at elis  pausanias describes this minerva as an upright figure with a garment descending to her feet he does not mention her height but m de caylus from the expression of pliny cubitorum viginti sex estimates it at thirtynine feet of the french measure the costly splendour of the statue says winkelman may be conceived from the quantity of gold employed in its decoration this as we learn from a speech of pericles preserved in thucydides amounted to forty talents the drapery was of gold and the uncovered parts of the figure formed of ivory the latter material was also employed in the head of medusa that appeared on the breast of the goddess according to the description of pausanias and perhaps gold and ivory were united in the image of victory of four cubits that was placed in one of her hands though its position is not ascertained by pausanias who only says that in her hand she held a spear but the smaller figure of victory that was frequently added as a decoration to a colossal statue and displayed in the extended hand of the triumphant divinity was sometimes of solid gold as we may conjecture from the profane jest of dionysius the tyrant of syracuse who in stealing such figures said it would be folly not to take from the gods what they appeared to offer  but to return to the minerva of phidias pliny says that on the prominent side of her shield the battle of the amazons was represented and in the concave part the conflict between the giants and the gods nay even her sandals were decorated according to his account with the battle of the centaurs and the lapithae  m de caylus has ventured to criticize with a becoming spirit these minute decorations  apres avoir

severe on the respectable connoisseur of his own country whom i have just quoted yet highly commends these remarks on the minerva of phidias at the same time he makes a lively but a rash attempt to vindicate the athenian artist in the following conjecture  mais si phidias na point fait ces petits ornemens sils nont ete ajoutes a sa minerve dor et dyvoire que plusieurs annees apres la mort de

inaccuracy of respectable writers on subjects relating to his own profession has fallen himself into considerable inaccuracies in speaking of this celebrated minerva i shall not enter into a minute discussion of these but merely observe that his conjecture concerning the figures on the shield of the goddess is entirely overthrown by many passages from ancient authors collected by junius to illustrate this statue  it was alleged as a crime against phidias that he had introduced his own portrait and that of pericles in the battle of the amazons which formed the most striking ornament of the shield in question and junius has cited a passage from aristotle particularly remarkable as it displays the ingenious solicitude of the sculptor to preserve his own figure from the malignity of any one who might wish to strike it out of the group  phidiam illum quem fictorem probum fuisse tradit memoria vidi ipse in clypeo minervae quae arcibus atheniensibus praesidet oris sui similitudinem

catal artif p       plutarch considers the base attempt to ruin phidias in the esteem of the athenians as a political maneuver to try the public influence of his patron pericles we owe to that invaluable biographer the anecdote to which i have alluded in the poem i mean the friendly precaution of pericles by which he protected the sculptor from the slanderous accusation of having embezzled a part of the gold consigned to him for the decoration of minerva by the advice of his illustrious friend the artist is said to have contrived the golden habiliments of the goddess in such a manner that they might be easily removed and his probity ascertained by the infallible test of the scales  the vindication of his innocence in this important article did not secure phidias from the insidious rancour of his enemies he was accused of alluring the chaste matrons of athens to his house under the pretense of showing his statues for the dishonorable purpose of gratifying the licentious passions of his patron it has been said that he perised in prison under the popular indignation which this calumny excited but the indefatigable meursius has proved by the authority of an old scholiast on aristophanes that the persecuted artist escaped to elis and ended his days with honor in a scene which he is supposed to have adorned in gratitude for the protection it afforded him with the sublimest work of sculpture that was ever produced even by grecian talents  his olympian jupiter an image which he conceived according to his own ingenuous account from homers description of the god phidias

transcribing all the animated passages in ancient authors which allude to this most memorable statue but as it may gratify my reader to have an immediate opportunity of comparing my sketch of it in

have expressed in iambic verse are not preserved but from a passage in strabo which represents the head of the sitting figure as near the roof of the temple in height sixty feet we are enabled to form some conjectures concerning its magnitude falconet supposes that the temple and the statue were wretchedly disproportioned to each other but the general voice of antiquity in praise of the very sublime effect which this spectacle altogether produced is sufficient to refute his supposition livy describes this effect very forcibly in speaking of paulus aemilius olympiam ascendit ubi et alia

so frequently erroneous the same city contained also a reclining jupiter in marble by this illustrious artist   cedrenus p       but it is time to take leave of phidias  let me first observe that he sometimes used the pencil as well as the implements of sculpture and painted a portrait of his kind and powerful friend pericles distinguished by his lofty title the olympian  cum et phidiam ipsum initio pictorem fuisse tradatur olympiumque athenis ab eo pictum  plin lib    pliny mentions a portrait of pericles in bronze by the sculptor ctesilaus with the fame appellation ctesilaus fecit periclem olmypium dignum cognomine many artists were undoubtedly patronized by this magnificent statesman but phidias was his favorite and entrusted with the superintendance of those splendid public works with which the liberal ambition of pericles delighted to decorate his country  note iv ver   0 her shame his pride her ornaments his prey how deplorable was the fate of athens repeatedly the captive of two the most artful sanguinary and impious wretches that dishonored the list of ancient heroes  lysander and sylla both these barbarous conquerors had a passion for sculpture so great was the influence of that powerful art over the sternest spirits of antiquity plutarch informs us that after lysander had taken athens he devoted a part of his spoil to the expense of raising his own statue and those of his officers at delphi yet so truly savage was this detestable victor that plutarch rather seems to believe the report he mentions of lysanders having proposed in the council of the allies to reduce the athenians to slavery a theban officer according to the same authority proposed the utter demolition of the city and athens is said to have been saved by the happy voice of a phocensian who sung to the conquerors at a banquet a few verses from a tragedy of euripides which awakened their humanity and made them shrink from their horrible purpose of annihilating a city so admirable and the parent of men so illustrious  milton alludes to this incident in the close of his  th sonnet  and the repeated air of sad electras poet had the power to save the athenian walls from ruin bare   note v ver     and to new sons new excellence assigned sculpture is assuredly one of the most difficult of the fine arts yet it is a striking truth that greece produced several sculptors of the first rate though she could only boast a single homer it is also remarkable that the grecian sculptors were more numerous than the painters of their country that intelligent and contemplative observer of antiquity m de caylus has had the curiosity to compare their respective numbers as far as the narratives of pausanias and pliny enabled him to make the comparison of the former he says il ne fait mention que de quinze peintres tandis quil distingue de la maniere la plus claire cent soixante et neuf sculpteurs il faut cependant convenir que pline fait mention de cent trentetrois peintres grecs bons ou mediocres on pourroic repondre pour concilier les deux auteurs que pline a parle de tous les peintres de la greece de lasie mineure de la sicile et de ce que lon appelloit la grande greece etc et que pausanias na pas meme visit toute la greece proprement dite quil necrivoit point lhistoire des artistes et quil parloit seulement de ceux dont il avoit vu les ouvrages ouvrages dont le nombre etoit encore diminue par lavidite des romans qui devastoient ce pays depuis environs quatrevingt ans a compter le tems qui setoit ecoule depuis pline jusqua lui  il resultera toujours de ce calcul quil y avoit plus de statues que de tableaux dans la greece  antiquites tom ii p  0  of all the arts in which they excelled sculpture seems indeed to have been the prime favorite of the greeks and to the national enthusiasm in its favor the grecian statues are principally indebted for their exquisite perfection  ver  0  records her sorrow and preserves her fame scopas a native of paros is mentioned by pliny as a contemporary with myron and polycletus in the   th olympiad he is represented also by the same author and by vitruvius as one of the eminent artists employed by the magnificent artemisia in decorating the monument of her husband mausolus  but as a sculptor who lived so early could hardly have been living at the time when that sumptuous monument was raised winkelman conjectures that more than one artist was distinguished by the name of scopas it seems rather more probable that pliny was mistaken in the period he assigned to this admirable sculptor and indeed the chronology of almost all the ancient artists and their most memorable works is so full of perplexities and contradiction that mistakes of this kind are almost unavoidable in a cursory view of their productions  the works of scopas seem to have been full of fancy and feeling yet it is not easy to form an exact idea of his three statues representing the variations of love as they are briefly described by pausanias  the commentator on pausanias to elucidate these three greek titles of cupid refers his reader to the grecian phurnutus de natura deorum but on consulting phurnutus i find no light but rather the darkness visible of ridiculous etymologies   pliny has enumerated many works of scopas that held in the period when he wrote a very high rank among the sculptural decorations of rome the palatine apollo a sitting vesta with two female attendants and a collection of marine divinities which according to the lively expression of the enthusiastic pliny might be termed a glorious performance if it had employed the whole life of the artist sed in maxima dignatione cn domitii delubro in circo flaminio neptunus ipse et thetis atque achilles nereides supra delphinos et cete et hippocampos fedentes item tritones chorusque phorci et pristes ac multa alia marina omnia ejusdem manus praeclarum opus etiamsi totius vitae fuisset  plin lib xxxvi c     m de caylus imagines that these nereids riding on their seahorses were executed in basrelief falconet is of a different opinion it is however probable that they were so and that they are still preserved  i have seen admirable sketches of such nereids as answer to plinys description executed at rome by mr howard an english artist who has the rare talent of drawing from sculpture with such precision and delicacy that england may soon surpass other countries in a just and graceful representation of those ancient statues which her men of fortune and taste have collected especially as the dilettanti society have judiciously confided to this artist the conduct of such a work peculiarly calculated to display his abilities and to reflect an honor on their own institution it is much to be lamented that almost all the prints designed to illustrate the many voluminous and costly books upon sculpture are rather caricatures of ancient art than a faithful copy of its perfections  but to return to the ancient artist whose works are the immediate subject of this note  pliny has very highly praised a venus by scopas and is supposed to have said that it excelled the gnidian venus of praxiteles which he had just celebrated as the most beautiful statue to be found on earth falconet with his usual petulance derides pliny for so gross a contradiction and even his liberal friend and admirer m de caylus laments this striking inconsistency let me hazard what appears to me a probable conjecture to save the credit of an author to whom the lovers of art have infinite obligation i am persuaded that all the blame which pliny has incurred for this supposed contradiction arose solely from a slip of the pen in the original manuscript but to elucidate the point i must transcribe the passage as it stands and add the new reading i wish to introduce praeterea venus in eodem loco nuda praxitelicam illam gnidiam antecedens et quemcunque alium locum nobilitatura  according to the present reading there is not only a contradiction of what he had just asserted concerning the preeminence of the gnidian statue but the latter part of the sentence has little or no meaning by the following slight change in the orthography the absurd contradiction will be utterly removed and a significant spirit will appear in the close of the sentence praeterea venus in eodem loco nuda praxitelicam illam gnidi non antecedens at quemcunque alium locum nobilitatura  a naked venus not surpassing indeed that of praxiteles at gnidos but such as would ennoble any other place  pliny mentions it as a doubt in his age whether the niobe at rome is the work of praxiteles or of scopas m de caylus makes a pleasant remark on the modesty of the roman author and recommends it as a lesson to modern connoisseurs  on

pour lordinaire imperieuse et sans appel  mem de lacademie tom xxv p     among the impassioned works of scopas his bacchanal was particularly admired junius in his account of this artist has inserted two greek epigrams from the anthologia in praise of the figure to which i allude but there is a third epigram by paulus silentiarius one of the best among the late writers in that motley collection which was probably composed on the same statue and which i prefer to the two epigrams cited by junius it runs thus    this bacchanal grew wild by art alone art that infused delirium in the stone   there is a very pompous eulogy on the bacchanal of scopas in that singular little work descriptions of fourteen ancient statues in greek prose by callistratus it is surprising that two such scholars as meursius and olearius could suppose these descriptions to be written by the very callistratus whom demosthenes attended with delight as his master in eloquence they rather seem the production of some trifling and declamatory sophist of a much later period the description of the bacchanal closes however with a high compliment to the genius of scopas as it asserts that his sculpture displayed that sort of energy and spirit which characterised the orations of demosthenes olearius who published callistratus in his excellent edition of the two philostrati supposes this comparison of the sculptor with the orator to have been added to the original description by some later hand as it is peculiarly honorable to scopas i will transcribe it at the bottom of the page   callistrati statuae p       this eminent artist like his predecessor phidias and many of the greeks was doubly distinguished as an architect and a sculptor perhaps he was employed in both capacities on the magnificent tomb of mausolus a work celebrated by many writers of antiquity as one of the seven wonders of the world and ingeniously illustrated by m de caylus in a dissertation on its form and dimensions which the curious reader may find in the memoirs of the french academy five artists of distinction were engaged in this stupendous structure which rose to the height of an hundred and forty feet including what crowned the summit  a triumphal chariot of marble the columns that surrounded the lower part of the fabric amounted to thirtysix comprising its four fronts those to the south and north were more extensive than the other two the eastern aspect was assigned to the conduct of scopas the monument is doubly remarkable as a work of magnificent expense and of genuine affection the fair sovereign of caria was so sincere a mourner that she is said to have died literally of grief for the lost mausolus before his sumptuous monument could be completed she had however sufficient energy of character to act as a heroine after his decease and vitruvius records an anecdote of her prowess which i am induced to mention as it shows in a very forcible light the veneration paid by the ancients to the statues erected under the auspices of victory  the rhodians who were subject to mausolus rebelled against his widow artemisia the indignant queen by a very bold stratagem took possession of their city and raised in it as a trophy of her conquest two statues of brass her own figure and another representing rhodes submitting to her authority the rhodians says vitruvius were prevented by their religion from removing those statues but they built around them to conceal from the view of the public memorials of their disgrace tunc arthemisia rhodo capta principibus occisis trophaeum in urbe rhodo suae victoriae constituit aeneasque duas statuas fecit unam rhodiorum civitatis alteram suae imaginis et istam figuravit rhodiorum civitati stigmata imponentem postea autem rhodii religione

galiani p      demosthenes in his fine oration in favor of the rhodians intimates that artemisia would not oppose such efforts as athens might honorably make to restore the liberty of rhodes  there is a medal of this affectionate heroine with the mausoleum but it is a counterfeit as i learn from the instructive and entertaining essay on medals by mr pinkerton a writer equally admirable for depth of research and vivacity of description  note vi ver   0 and cupid soon her own repays the fond device praxiteles who is mentioned by pliny as flourishing with his brother artist euphranor in the  0 th olympiad arose to the highest distinction for the impassioned delicacy of his works both in brass and marble but particularly in marble the rank he held in the public esteem is evident from the petty anecdote recorded in phaedrus that those who had delicate pieces of sculpture to sell enhanced the price of them by erasing the name of myron and inserting that of praxiteles in its place ut quidam artifices nostro faciunt saeculo qui pretium operibus majus inveniunt novo si marmori adscripserint praxitelem suo detrito myrone argento phaedrus  pliny who has enumerated many productions of praxiteles celebrates his gnidian venus as the most perfect image of beauty that sculpture ever produced and relates some amusing incidents in proof of its perfection particularly an offer made to the inhabitants of gnidos by the king nicomedes who was desirous of purchasing this admired statue on the liberal terms of paying the heavy public debt of their island they chose rather to struggle with any difficulties than to relinquish a work of art with which praxiteles had ennobled their country the statue was stationed in a small open temple that the form of the goddess might be visible in every direction and it was esteemed admirable in every point of view praxitelis aetatem inter statuarios diximus qui marmoris gloria superavit etiam semet opera ejus sunt athenis in ceramico sed ante

have selected the two following from the anthologia       grotii versio quis lapidi spirare dedit quis cyprida vidit in terris quantum marmor amoris habet praxitelis manus est venere ut puto regia coeli jam caret ad gnidios venit ut ipsa venus who gave the stone a soul say who has seen and of this marble made affections queen praxiteles thy work makes heaven appear now desolate and venus only here    grotii versio alma venus tibi sacro tuam sub imagine formam pulchrius hac potuit nil tibi diva dari venus to thee i raised thy form divine convinced no offering can thy form outshine the glory that praxiteles acquired from the excellence of his venus was increased by the felicity with which he executed more than one statue of cupid the orations of cicero against verres have given celebrity to the marble cupid which the orator represents as a rival to one still more famous by the same artist that formed the pride and the wealth of the thespians  a statue spared by mummius when he plundered the cities of greece the rapacious verres had robbed an ingenious and friendly sicilian of a similar exquisite and invaluable work of art which cicero describes as the production of praxiteles it is remarkable that the roman orator speaks with singular modesty on this occasion of his own knowledge as a connoisseur marmoreum praxitelis nimirum didici etiam dum in istum inquiro artificum nomina the rapacity of the infamous governor had indeed amassed such a collection of sculpture that an examination of his plunder was almost sufficient to form a roman connoisseur the curious reader may find this collection agreeably illustrated in a dissertation by the abbe fraguier inserted in the memoires of the french academy and entitled the gallery of verres  the happiest of ciceros repartees alluded to a statue of this collection a very valuable sphinx of bronze which formed a part of the powerful extortioners sicilian plunder verres had bestowed it as a retaining fee on his advocate the celebrated orator hortensius who had a strong passion for works of art in the course of the pleadings hortensius happened to say to his antagonist i do not understand these riddles  but you ought replied cicero for you have the sphinx at home both pliny and quintilian have recorded this bon mot the latter cites it as a model of oratorical urbanity ex historia etiam ducere urbanitatem eruditum ut cicero fecit cum ei testem in judicio verris roganti dixisset hortensius non intelligo haec aenigmata atqui debes inquit cum sphingem domi habeas acceperat autem ille a verre sphingem aeneam magnae pecuniae  quintil lib vi c     to return to the cupid of praxiteles  the sculptor falconet has censured his countryman m de jaucourt for inserting in the french encyclopedia an anecdote relating to this celebrated statue told on the authority of the president de thou the story says that the marchioness of mantua possessed in the year      the cupid of praxiteles and the sleeping cupid of michael angelo and that de thou with other guests of the marchioness were charmed with the work of the modern artist till they compared it with a superior work of antiquity that seemed to annihilate its merit the story is certainly improbable in many points of view and falconet exults in producing what he considers as a proof that the fact was impossible i mean the testimony of pausanias declaring that the famous cupid of praxiteles a statue of marble and the idol of the thespians perished after a variety of adventures in a fire at rome the evidence of pausanias sufficiently proves indeed the fate of the thespian statue but it does not amount to a proof that it was impossible for the marchioness of mantua to possess a cupid executed by praxiteles because we have already seen that there existed two marble cupids of acknowledged beauty by this illustrious sculptor and among the statues described by callistratus two cupids by the same artist in bronze are celebrated as works of exquisite perfection on one of these perhaps the following epigram was written though junius imagined that it was composed on the thespian cupid and that the poet had taken the liberty to turn the marble into brass         grotii versio praxiteles famulante manu me fecit amorem sub pedibus pressus colla superba meis fecit ut in venis quem sensit aheneus essem ut phrynae

said to have obtained the cupid i have described with a little variation from pausanias    pausanias p    this highlyadmired sculptor had the happiness of training his son cephissodorus to considerable excellence in his own profession that pleasing and accurate writer the abbe guasco has fallen i think into a little mistake concerning this son of praxiteles whom he represents as pursuing the art of his father without inheriting his talents the words of pliny who mentions several statues executed by this eminent son of a father still more eminent may rather lead us to think that the genius as well as the property of his parent descended to the filial artist praxitelis filius cephissodorus rei et artis haeres suit cujus laudatum est pergami symplegma signum nobile digitis

ronium strabo speaks of this jupiter as the second of colossal figures in magnitude inferior only to the colossus of rhodes    than by his devotional ideas for he carried off the hercules a colossus of inferior bulk to place it in the capitol and plutarch censures this wary roman for being more rapacious in tarentum than marcellus was in syracuse  rome possessed another work of lysippus particularly memorable as it discovers the lively interest which the roman people took in these grecian ornaments of their city the statue i allude to represented a man rubbing himself after the use of the bath it had been stationed with the usual solemnities before the baths of agrippa but as it happened to delight the fancy of tiberius that subtle and cautious emperor was rash enough to remove it to his own chamber the people demanded by loud clamours in the theater that the statue should be restored to its proper place and the sovereign submitted to its restoration plin lib xxxiv c    the history of statues is particularly interesting as it illustrates the manners and the feelings of the ancient world what a portrait does this anecdote exhibit of the roman people who could clamorously solicit and obtain the restoration of a public statue a simple foreign figure when they had not courage or virtue enough left to vindicate their liberty against this timid licentious and despicable tyrant  but to return to lysippus the work which was probably his own favorite performance i mean his equestrian statues of alexander and the guardian attendants of that idolized monarch were transported to rome after the roman conquest of macedonia and adorned the portico of metellus hic est metellus macedonicus qui porticus quae fuere circumdatae duabus aedibus sine inscriptione positis quae nunc octaviae porticibus ambiuntur fecerat quique hanc turmam statuarum equestrium quae frontem aedium spectant hodieque maximum ornamentum ejus loci ex macedonia detulit cujus turmae hanc causam referunt magnum alexandrum impetrasse a lysippo singulari talium auctore operum ut eorum equitum qui ex ipsius turma apud granicum stumen ceciderant expressa similitudine figurarum faceret statuas et ipsius quoque iis interponeret  velleius paterculus lib i   the anthologia contains more than one epigram on the portrait of alexander by lysippus the following appears to be the best       grotii versio aequat alexandri vultumque animumque ferocem lysippus tantum posse quis era putet aereus iste jovem spectans clamare videtur subdo mihi terras tu pater astra tene archelaus or according to others aesclepiades on the statue of alexander all alexanders powers of form and mind thy skill lysippus in this brass enshrined the bronze exclaims with heavendirected eyes earth is my empire jove rule thou the skies plutarch in one of his moral treatises has cited with some applause the two last lines of this epigram and a very elegant accomplished writer of our own country mr webb has inserted a translation of them in his  th dialogue on the beauties of painting but i think he has made the supposed speech of the hero rather more disrespectful to jupiter than the greek poet intended i will give my reader an immediate opportunity of correcting me if i am wrong in this supposition by transcribing the couplet to which i allude let us divide o jove the conqueror cries i lord of earth thou tyrant of the skies webb p     edit       we are indebted to plutarch for the interesting anecdote concerning the just reproof of lysippus to his brother artist apelles   plutarchus de iside et osiride p  0 edit cantab       the character of this great statuary appears to have been so noble that his life was probably as worthy of being recorded for its virtues as his productions were for their fidelity to truth and nature yet to our regret we can know but very little of his personal history and of his numerous invaluable works the two eminent antiquarians winkelman and caylus have supposed that not a single fragment remains dhancarville is inclined to believe that a bust of bacchus preserved at portici is a real work of this exquisite artist and his reasons for thinking so may serve to illustrate the peculiar excellencies of lysippus  le beau buste bacchus en bronze conserve a portici etant un chefdoeuvre de lart il fut necessairement execute avaunt la perte des anciennes

lib xxxiv statuariae arti plurimum traditur contulisse capillum exprimendo capita minora faciendo quam antiquipropriae hujus videntur esse argutiae operum custoditae in minimis quoque rebus in speaking of lysippus i musst not fail to observe that his brother lysistratus was also an eminent statuary and particularly distinguished as the first who executed portraits with the utmost exactness by the ingenious device of taking a cast in plaster from the face  in citing the words of pliny which celebrate lysistratus for this invention i will venture to suggest a new reading in the passage which may vindicate as i imagine this interesting author from the charge of having expressed himself rather absurdly on this subject hominis autem imaginem gypso e facie ipsa primus omnium expressit ceraque in eam formam gypsi infusa emendare instituit lysistratus sicyonius frater lysippi de quo diximus sic et similitudinem reddere instituit ante eum quam pulcherrimas facere studebant idem et de signis effigiem exprimere invenit crevitque res in tantum utnulla signa statuaeve sine argilla fierent quo apparet antiquiorem hanc fuisse scientiam quam fundendi aeris lib xxxv c     so stood the passage till the paris editor of pliny in twelve quartos made the following alteration ut nulla signa sua sine argilla fierent by changing the superfluous word statuaeve into sua he hoped to rectify the weakness of the passage but i apprehend another very slight alteration may improve it much more instead of sine agilla i would read sine art illa considering those words as expressing the invention of lysistratus and giving a little better sense to the close of the passage antiquiorem hanc fuisse scientiam quam fundendi aeris which may then signify that this practice of casting the real features in plaster was prior to the formation of perfect portraits in bronze   i have seen it somewhere observed that a statue resembling the diminutive hercules of lysippus was formerly in the possession of the celebrated pithou who has been called the varro of france but i apprehend that interesting work of ancient art has long ceased to exist and as the animated poem in which statius has described the statue and its most amiable possessor has not appeared to my recollection in our language i shall conclude this note with an entire version of the latin epistle i allude to as the most pleasing tribute that antiquity has paid to the talents of lysippus  hercules epitrapezios hercules epitrapezios forte remittentem curas phoeboque levatum pectora cum patulis tererem vagus otia septis

french academy with a circumstantial account of the rhodian colossus collected from the authors of remote and recent times who have occasionally mentioned this most magnificent of all colossal figures the memorable production of a little island once ennobled by the united influence of liberty art and naval power yet after the researches of an accomplished writer on a subject so attractive to his fancy we must still remain in ignorance of some particulars relating to this interesting image that a lover of the arts would be glad to ascertain much however is known pliny has described the fragments of this colossus in clear and animated language ante onines autem in admiratione suit solis colossus rhodi quem fecerat chares lindins lysippi supra dicti discipulus septuaginta cubitorum

according to different readings from seventy to eighty cubits m de caylus forming his calculation from the expression of pliny that few men could embrace the thumb concludes that the height of the perfect statue was about an hundred and five feet  we learn from strabo that it was broken asunder at the knees and that the rhodians considered themselves as prohibited by an oracle from replacing it they probably guarded the fragments with a religious veneration i know not otherwise how to account for a very surprising fact which my deceased friend gibbon has recorded with his usual elegance and energy of expression he observes that after standing fiftysix years the colossus of rhodes was overthrown by an earthquake but the massy trunk and huge fragments lay scattered eight centuries on the ground i cannot transcribe the words of an accomplished author whose memory is so justly dear to me without reflecting with poignant regret what infinite advantages for the improvement of my present work i might have derived from his taste knowledge and kindness had his life been extended according to my wishes gibbon though he was not a collector of statues or pictures had a lively esteem for all the fine arts  i return to the rhodian apollo  if we may trust the byzantine writers theophanes and constantine the brass of this colossus was gilt   constant de adminis imp edit    0 p     the saracen chief who invaded rhodes in the year     seized and transported this ponderous plunder into syria where it was publicly sold to a jew of edessa the story of loading nine hundred camels with the weight of these stupendous relies has the air of an arabian tale m de caylus imagines that modern writers have fallen into a great mistake concerning the attitude and the station of the standing colossus by representing it as a striding figure at the entrance of the port as the reader may have seen it in ordinary prints with vessels failing between its legs this intelligent writer rather supposes it to have been placed on the shore upon a single triangular basis of white marble he says that no ancient author no ancient monument is found to countenance the modern supposition of a striding attitude yet i apprehend the following epigram in the anthologia according to one mode of construction amounts almost to a proof that the statue had a double basis part on the land and part in the water           on the statue raised to the sun by the rhodians to thee o sun thy rhodians bade arise this bright colossus towering to the skies of brass for they invasions tide repressed thus crowned their isle with spoils true valors test over land and water it was theirs to raise unconquered libertys enlivening blaze for they who drew from hercules their birth were heirs of empire over the sea and earth but circumstances relating to this celebrated work are so far from being clearly known that the statue has been ascribed to different artists to chares to laches and to lysippus himself meursius supposes with great probability that it was begun by chares and finished by laches these two sculptors were both natives of lindus a rhodian city and chares is known to have been a favorite disciple of lysippus a passage of cicero in which he is mentioned as such informs us in what particular parts of the human figure different sculptors of eminence were thought to excel chares

considerare poterat  rhet ad herennium lib iv   note x ver     servility benumbs the soul of greece winkelmann who justly estimated the influence of freedom upon art has observed that after greece was reduced to the condition of a roman province history mentions no greek artist of any note till the period of the roman triumvirate the liberty of the greeks says that animated author was buried in the ruins of corinth art sunk entirely in magna graecia where it had flourished with the philosophy of pythagoras and of zeno in the bosom of many free and opulent cities it perished utterly by the arms and the barbarity of the romans  note xi ver     and faintly promising to flourish died the learned and enthusiastic historian of ancient art in noticing its migration from the desolated cities of greece into syria and egypt remarks that being employed to serve the pomp and pageantry of courts it lost an infinite portion of its grandeur and genius under the seleucides and the ptolemies yet he asserts that under ptolemy philadelphus alexandria became almost what athens had been  is not this paying rather too high a compliment to the egyptian monarch he was however a patron of art and a lover of magnificence his regard for a grecian city distinguished by talents appears conspicuous from a circumstance recorded by athenaeus in the description of a splendid festival with which ptolemy amused himself and the people of alexandria in this gorgeous scene an immense multitude of statues were carried in procession and near to that of ptolemy himself who was attended by three oddlygrouped companions alexander virtue and priapus was the image of corinth adorned with a diadem of gold   athenaeus p  0    winkelmann imagines from the profusion of statues which appeared in this sumptuous pageant that a great number of grecian statuaries found at this peirod an asylum in alexandria if they did it is but too probable that their talents were enfeebled by their change of situation since winkelmann himself has observed that of the artists who then flourished in egypt we know only the name of a single sculptor satyreius who formed of crystal a portrait of arsinoe the wife of ptolemy philadelphus a performance celebrated in the following greek epigram from the fourth book of the anthologia       grotii versio zeuxidos et color et gratia sed satureius tam varias lauds exhibet arsinoes in glacie parva dominae sum tantula tantae effigies in me nil tamen ejus abest diodorus on the sculptured crystal thine zeuxis grace and color yet in me small crystal image for arsinoe by satureius formed her charms are seen true as they sparkle in the living queen winkelmann considers this representation of arsinoe as an engraved gem but i have seen a small bust of crystal and porphyry united which may possibly be the very portrait described by diodorus  ptolemy was so fond of the arts and of his queen that he is said to have projected a temple to her memory so vaulted with loadstone as to keep a metallic statue of arsinoe suspended in the air a project which the death of his famous architect dimocrates is supposed to have defeated arsinoe happened to suffer in a singular manner in consequence of her husbands passion for sculpture in marrying his daughter to antiochus king of syria ptolemy had affectionately conducted the bride to seleucia and being charmed by a magnificent statue of diana he received it as a present from his soninlaw and transported it to alexandria but arsinoe falling sick on its arrival saw in her troubled dreams the offended goddess who complained of being removed from her syrian temple ptolemy had tenderness sufficient to calm the disturbed fancy of his queen by sending back the favorite statue but had not the reward he deserved for his humanity  the delight of restoring the health of his arsinoe  winkelmann in speaking of the arts at the court of seleucia asserts that the grecian sculptors who migrated into asia surpassed in their works such of their brethren as remained in their own country and he quotes the last character of theophrastus in proof of this assertion in consulting the character referred to i find nothing that can relate to works of art but in a character very near the last the   d on ostentation i find a passage which if it proves any thing may be thought rather to prove the reverse of what the learned historian of art has in this instance advanced with an inaccuracy very pardonable in an animated writer whose researches were so extensive and whose general merits are so great theophrastus makes his man of ostentation who boasts of his campaigns with alexander contend that the artists in asia are superior to those in europe whence we may reasonably infer not that they really were so but that theophrastus rather thought the contrary the passage however alludes not to statues but to goblets and gems   theophrastus edit newton p       the learned heyne in his dissertation on the ptolemies has justly observed primorum statim regum studia artium et cupiditates operum ad fastum et magnificentiam potius se inclinasse quam ad judicii elegantiam aut verae pulchritudinis sensum ex

whether we contemplate the excellence or the number of ancient statues that have been wonderfully recovered in the three last centuries our obligations to time as a preserver are such as may justly excite astonishment and gratitude had he restored only the laocoon the apollo of the belvedere and the medicaean venus a lover of the arts might consider his kindness in the department of sculpture as equivalent to his literary beneficence in preserving the compositions of demosthenes plato and homer the liberality of time as a restorer will appear in the strongest point of view if we contrast what poggio said of the statues in rome in the fifteenth century and what the abbe guasco wrote to his brother on the same subject about fifty years ago i will transcribe the two passages i allude to observing that the testimony of poggio is the more to be depended on as he was particularly fond of ancient sculpture his delight in collecting fragments of antiquity is recorded by the accomplished

possessing only five ancient statues in the year    0 according to gibbons remarks on the date of his elegant moral lecture de varietate fortunae in the year      the abbe guasco writing from rome to his brother gives the following account of the sculpture that had delighted him in that city  ses anciennes productions sont innombrables et else passent toute expression autant en beauty quen

executed himself the figure of laocoon and agesanders two sons athenodorus and polydorus the two younger figures of the group an idea so pleasing that the fancy and the heart are both willing to embrace it  felix de fredis a roman citizen had the good fortune to discover the laocoon and to receive from pope julius the second an ecclesiastical pension for his discovery leo the tenth exonerated the revenues of the church from this pension and gave to fredis in exchange the post of apostolical secretary in the year      the raising of this glorious work of art from its grave might form perhaps a very interesting historical picture as some eminent personages might be introduced as spectators of the scene the following latin verses were written on the statue soon after its revival by

a doubt in the age of pliny whether the niobe should be ascribed to praxiteles or to scopas winkelmann and the abbe guasco agree in assigning it to the latter  if their conjecture be just it is yet probable that praxiteles also executed a statue of niobe from the following epigram in the anthologia     grotii versio ex viva lapidem dii me fecere sed ecce praxiteles vivam me facit ex lapide gods

his reader the choice of three eminent heralds of antiquity who were slain in despite of their pacific office  polyphontes the herald of laius killed by oedipus copreas the herald of eurystheus

decline of life rests on the authority of sandrart who published his admiranda sculpturae veteris in    0 bottari in the book that i have cited in the preceding note expresses himself rather angrily against sandrart for having represented michel angelo as blind a circumstance that he considers as false but the laborious painter of germany who published such extensive wellintended yet very imperfect works upon art might very innocently call a noble veteran of ninety blind without meaning more than such infirmity of vision as naturally belongs to that age or perhaps he might too easily credit a popular report that sandrart was credulous in the extreme the reader will readily allow who happens to recollect the ridiculous things he has related concerning the apollo of the belvedere in his admiranda sculpturae  note xviii ver     scorn for the rancour of malignant foes of all the productions of art that have escaped destruction the statue of apollo says winkelmann is unquestionably

truth reserved for future verse some of the most accomplished of recent writers on painting and sculpture particularly winkelmann and webb seem to consider the influence of revealed religion as unfavourable to each of these interesting professions on the contrary it may i think be proved that christianity is as much superior to paganism for the favorable guidance of art as it confessedly is for the moral conduct of life a point that i hope to illustrate more at large if i should happen to have powers and opportunity to execute what i originally thought of blending with the present

not only the mask the buskin and the brazen trumpet but almost all the pomp and circumstance of glorious war and particularly the solemnities of triumphal magnificence  this early and zealous advocate for the glory of etruria is angry with strabo for having imagined that the romans had borrowed such solemnities from the greeks videtur strabo triumphandi apparatum ad romanos quidem a tuscis venisse

to the lares of the latins yet i imagine it may be justly asserted that the etruscans were peculiarly distinguished by their remarkable attention to these domestic deities the word lar is etruscan and originally signified a hero in that language the lararia  in domibus secreta quaedam penetralia in quibus diligentissime dii domestici servabantur lares et genii utriusque sexus the scenes in which these household deities were guarded and worshipped are frequently displayed in the works of etruscan art so that we may almost say in the words of old ennius altered a little for this application of them hoc filo pendebit etruria tota  i cannot conclude this note without observing that the domestic deities afford a delightful subject for poetry and that the subject has been treated with great moral elegance and exquisite sensibility in a poem entitled hymn to the penates by mr southey  note iii ver    foiled in sharp conflict from the tyrrhene coast it appears from a passage in athenaeus

father mnesarchus a sculptor of gems but wherever this illustrious philosopher was born the moral influence of his doctrine on the cities of tuscany is universally allowed and brucker in his elaborate

sculpture except the rapacity with which they seized the statues of the various nations who surpassed them in ingenuity  their public ravages of this kind were often followed by petty acts of barbarism and baseness still more detestable for not contented with having carried off the monuments of public merit from the countries they overcame they erased inscriptions from the statues of illustrious men and inserted false titles of their own on this occasion it is justice to exclaim with cicero odi falsas inscriptiones statuarum alienarum  the learned figrelius who has written at length on the statues of the romans relates some curious examples of this sculptural forgery it appears from the authority of dio chrysostom that alcibiades was turned into aenobarbus and according to zonaras even constantine the great did not scruple to put his own name on a statue of apollo but if he did so we may hope it was rather to annihilate the worship he condemned than to impose the figure of a pagan divinity on the people as the real representative of a christian emperor  in justice to the romans it is proper to remark that they might possibly learn from the greeks themselves the disingenuous practice of falsifying the statues of ancient worthies we know that rhodes one of the most magnificent marts of sculpture in the pagan world incurred considerable disgrace by this species of falsehood for which dio chrysostom reproves the rhodians in a very copious animated and beautiful oration which contains some interesting anecdotes of sculpture and an eloquent description of its influence on the spirit of antiquity   says the indignant orator   dionis rhodiaca oration p     edit folio   0  the learned and judicious casaubon joins with photius in pronouncing this the best of

national character these were arrogance and rapacity vices generally stigmatized when they appear in an individual and certainly not deserving a censure less severe when they form the characteristics of a nation yet so fascinating is the pride of successful valor that the nation of antiquity most injurious in its conduct toward the rest of the world is often commended as an object for modern emulation the most flagrant enormities of which the governors of france both regal and republican have been guilty seem to have been greatly owing to an indiscriminate and fantastic imitation of roman spirit with a preposterous passion sometimes concealed and sometimes avowed for universal dominion the french appear to believe the romans to have been what they supposed themselves to be  a divine race of men destined by superior virtue to subdue the other nations of the earth or to use the words of their elegant but servile flatterer virgil  progeniem virtute futuram egregiam et totum quae

his masterly sketch of her grandeur and decline particularly in the chapter entitled de la conduite que les romans tinrent pour soumettre tous les peuples  but the sublimest censure on the national conduct of rome is that which milton has passed upon it in his paradise regained where to exhibit her ambition in the most execrable point of view he makes the archfiend propose it as a model in one

grecian philosophers seem to have looked upon them with a very jealous not to say an evil eye even plato and plutarch have occasionally spoken of artists with a sort of envious disrespect that is particularly unbecoming in men of such cultivated minds these two enlightened and benevolent philosophers might have reflected that an accomplished sculptor whose art is properly directed may be considered like themselves as the true servant of moral philosophy  a nation can hardly honor too highly the successful professors of any refined and arduous art whose productions have an evident and graceful tendency to give elevation and dignity to national character since as cicero says very nobly in his oration pro muraena omnes enim arts quae nobis populi studia conciliant et admirabilem

socrates and lucian were bred to the profession of sculpture the vivacity of lucian and his antipathy to a severe relation his master probably precluded that comic genius from making any considerable advances in an art which requires the steadiest union of industry and talent but socrates is known to have executed some works as a statuary that were objects of public regard pausanias has noticed

discover what artist introduced the custom prevalent in his time of representing the graces naked falconet imagines that statues executed by socrates could have but a trifling degree of merit as works of art from the philosophers having quitted the profession very early in life but the more candid greeks seem inclined to applaud the laudable endeavors of juvenile talent and a greek epigram on a

offer of his sword in defense of malta then threatened by the turks the alarm of that island passed away and the count returned to paris the love of traveling and a passionate attachment to the study of antiquities now induced him to relinquish his military profession he wished to visit the scenes of ancient art and seized the opportunity of embarking for the east with a new ambassador from his country to constantinople as they stopped at smyrna he was eager to survey the ruins of ephesus their distance from smyrna was only the journey of a day his friends endeavored to dissuade him from attempting it by displaying the danger he must incur as the country was infested by a merciless banditti under a formidable chief caracayali  but in the comte de caylus says his eulogist fear was always subordinate to desire he accomplished his wishes by an adventurous device clothing himself in a simple linen dress and taking with him nothing that could tempt rapacity he set forth with two of the banditti who were suffered from motives of public apprehension to visit smyrna occasionally he had made a bargain with these men on a promise of paying them liberally on his safe return they conducted him with an interpreter to their captain caracayali pleased with his animated visitor took a pleasure in gratifying his curiosity he told him there were ruins still nearer that deserved his attention and to convey him thither with the utmost celerity he supplied him with two of the finest arabian coursers the comte seemed to be transported by magic to the interesting spot it presented to him the ruins of colopton after enjoying that unexpected and delightful scene he returned to pass the night in a fort that formed the residence of caracayali and the next day he devoted to the ruins of ephesus of the state in which he found the famous temple of diana he has left a memoir but the nature of my present work does not allow me to dwell on the extended life and numerous productions of this engaging character i hasten to speak of his latter days after returning to france and visiting london more than once after passing many years in active though sedentary life in various compositions particularly his academical memoirs on different branches of painting and sculpture and his very comprehensive collection of antiquities this amiable practical student and munificent patron of art began in      to show that his robust frame was tending to dissolution he triumphed for some time over the corporeal miseries of decaying nature by the exertions of an active enlightened

anonymous  this english gentleman was i believe the late mr hollis whose life was uncommonly devoted to the continual exercise of refined liberality  many readers will smile at the romantic spirit of

afflicting and universally execrated evils to which both the spirit and the letter of christianity seem to promise a perfect antidote  its efficacy as such is certainly not visible at present but it

disadvantages he executed some original designs that are thought by less partial judges to promise great future excellence if heaven graciously restores him from a state of the most calamitous and complicated sufferings which he has now supported for more than two years with the mildest magnanimity my reader has an opportunity of judging if i speak too partially of the designs executed by this

pursue my work at a little distance from him that it might save me from sympathising too intensely in pangs that i could not relieve sometimes i could obey his tender injunctions and sometimes i have

imperfections yet with feelings of gratitude to the great giver of all gifts that under the bitterest disquietude and distress of heart he has still granted me such powers of application as have
