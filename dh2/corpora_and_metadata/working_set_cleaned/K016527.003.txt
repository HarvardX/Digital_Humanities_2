the history of sir charles grandison in a series of letters published from the originals by the editor of pamela and clarissa  in seven volumes  vol iii  london printed by s richardson and dublin reprinted and sold by the booksellers m dcc liii  the history of sir charles grandison bart letter i miss harriet byron to miss lucy selby saturday march    self my dear lucy is a very wicked thing a sanctifier if one would give way to its partialities of actions which in others we should have no doubt to condemn delicacy too is often a misleader an idol at whose shrine we sometimes offer up oar sincerity but in that case it should be called indelicacy  nothing surely can be delicate that is not true or that gives birth to equivocation yet how was i pleased with lord and lady l and miss crandison for endeavoring to pass me off to good dr bartlett in the light i had no title to appear in  as if my mind in a certain point remained to be known and would so remain till the gentleman had discovered his  and are there some situations in which a woman must conceal her true sentiments in which it would be thought immodesty to speak out  why was i born with an heart so open and sincere but why indeed as sir charles has said in his letter relating to the danbys should women be blamed for owning modestly a passion for a worthy and suitable object is it that they will not speak out lest if their wishes should not be crowned with success by one man they should deprive themselves of a chance to succeed with another do they not propose to make the man they love happy  and is it a crime to acknowledge that they are so well disposed to a worthy object a worthy object i repeat for that is what will warrant the open heart what a littleness is there in the custom that compels us to be insincere and suppose we do not succeed with a first object shall we cheat a future lover with the notion that he was the first  hitherto i had acted with some selfapprobation i told mr greville mr fenwick mr orme mr fowler that i had not seen the man to whom i could wish to give my hand at the altar but when i found my heart engaged i was desirous lady d should know that it was but yet misled by this same notion of delicacy i could think myself obliged to the two sisters and my lord that they endeavored to throw a blind over the eyes of good dr bartlett when the right measure i now think would have been not to have endeavored to obtain lights from him that we all thought he was not commissioned to give or if we had to have related to him the whole truth and not have put on disguises to him but to have lest him wholly a judge of the fit and the unfit  and this is love is it that puts an honest girl upon approving of such tricks  begone love i banish thee if thou would corrupt the simplicity of that heart which was taught to glory in truth  and yet i had like to have been drawn into a greater fault for what do you think  miss grandison had by some means or other she would not tell me how in dr bartletts absence on a visit to one of the canons of windsor got at a letter brought early this morning from her brother to that good man and which he had left opened on his desk  here harriet said she is the letter so lately brought not perhaps quite honestly come at from my brother to dr bartlett holding it out to me you are warmly mentioned in it shall i put it where i had it or will you so far partake of my fault as to read it first  o miss grandison said i and am i warmly mentioned in it pray oblige me with the perusal of it and i held out my more than half guilty hand and took it but immediately recollecting myself did you not hint that you came at it by means not honest  take it again i will not partake of your fault  but cruel charlotte how could you tempt me so and i laid it on a chair  read the first paragraph harriet she took it up unfolded it and pointed to the first paragraph  tempter said i how can you wish me to imitate our first pattern and down i sat and put both my hands before my eyes take it away take it away while yet i am innocent dear miss grandison dont give me cause for selfreproach i will not partake of your acknowledged fault  she read a line or two and then said shall i read farther harriet the very next word is your name i will   no no no said i putting my fingers in my ears  yet had you come honestly by it i should have longed to read it  by what means   why if people will leave their closetdoors open let them take the consequence  if people will do so  but was it so  and yet if it was would you be willing to have your letters looked into  well then i will carry it back  shall i holding it out to me shall i harriet  i will put it where i had it  shall i and twice or thrice went from me and came back to me with a provoking archness in her looks  only tell me miss grandison is there anything in it that you think your brother would not have us see  but i am sure there is or the obliging dr bartlett who has shown us others would have favored us with communicating the contents of this  i would not but have seen this letter for half i am worth o harriet there are such things in it  bologna paris grandisonhall  be gone siren letters are sacred things replace it  dont you own that you came not honestly by it  and yet   ah lucy i was ready to yield to the curiosity she had raised but recollecting myself be gone said i carry back the letter i am afraid of myself  why harriet here is one passage the contents of which you must be acquainted with in a very little while   i will not be tempted miss grandison i will stay till it is communicated to me be it what it will  but you may be surprised harriet at the time and know not what answer to give to it  you had as good read it  here take it  was there ever such a scrupulous creature  it is about you and emily   about me and emily o miss grandison what can there be about me and emily  and where is the difference harriet between asking me a out the contents and reading them  but i ll tell you   no you shall not i will not hear the contents i never will ask you can nobody act greatly but your brother let you and i charlotte be the better for his example you shall neither read them nor tell me of them i would not be so used myself  such praises did i never hear of woman  oh harriet  such praises   praises charlotte  from your brother  o this curiosity the first fault of our first parent but i will not be tempted if you provoke me to ask questions laugh at me and welcome but i beseech you answer me not dear creature if you love me replace the letter and do not seek to make me mean in my own eyes  how you reflect upon me harriet  but let me ask you are you willing as a third sister to take emily into your guardianship and carry her down with you into northamptonshire  answer me that  ah miss grandison and is there such a proposal as that mentioned  but answer me not i beseech you whatever proposal is intended to be made me let it be made it will be too soon whenever that is if it be a disagreeable one  but let me say madam and tears were in my eyes that i will not be treated with indignity by the best man on earth and while i can refuse to yield to a thing that i think unworthy of myself you are a sister madam and have nothing either to hope or fear i have a title to act with spirit when occasions call for it  my dear you are serious  twice madam in one breath i will not forgive you you ought now to hear that passage read which relates to you and emily if you will not read it yourself  and she was looking for it i suppose intending to read it to me  no miss grandison said i laying my spread hand upon the letter i will neither read it nor hear it read i begin to apprehend that there will be occasion for me to exert all my fortitude and while it is yet in my power to do a right or wrong thing i will not deprive myself of the consciousness of having merited well whatever may be my lot  excuse me madam  i went to the door and was opening it  when she ran to me  dear creature you are angry with me but how that pride becomes you there is a dignity in it that awes me o harriet how infinitely does it become the only woman in the world that is worthy of the best man in it only say you are not angry with me say that you can and do forgive me  forgive you my charlotte i  i do but can you say that you came not honestly by that letter and yet forgive yourself but my dear miss grandison instantly replace it and do you watch over me like a true friend if in a future hour of weakness you should find me desirous to know any of the contents of a paper so naughtily come at i own that i had like to have been overcome and if i had all the information it would have given me could never have recompensed me for what i should have suffered in my own opinion when i reflected on the means by which i had obtained it  superior creature how you shame me i will replace the letter and i promise you that if i cannot forget the contents of it myself and yet they are glorious to my brother i will never mention any of them to you unless the letter be fairly communicated to you and to us all  i threw my arms about her neck she fervently returned the sisterly embrace we separated she retiring at one door in order to go up to replace the letter i at the other to reconsider all that had passed on the occasion and i hope i shall love her the better for taking so kindly a behavior so contrary to what her own had been  well but dont you congratulate me my dear on my escape from my curiosity i am sure my grandmamma and my aunt will be pleased with their girl yet it was an hard struggle i own in the suspense i am in a very hard struggle but though wishes will play about my heart that i knew such of the contents as it might concern me to know yet i am infinitely better pleased that i yielded not to the temptation than i should have been if i had and then methinks my pride is gratified in the superiority this lady ascribes to me over herself whom so lately i thought greatly my superior  yet what merit have i in this since if i had considered only rules of policy i should have been utterly wrong had i yielded to the temptation for what use could i have made of any knowledge i might have obtained by this means if any proposal is to be made me of what nature soever it must in that case have appeared to be quite new to me and what an affectation must that have occasioned what dissimulation in your harriet  and how would a creature educated as i have been have behaved under such trials as might have arisen from a knowledge so faultily obtained  and had i been discovered had i given cause of suspicion either to dr bartlett or sir charles i should have appeared as the principal in the fact it would have been mean to accuse miss grandison as the tempter in a temptation yielded to with my eyes open and should i not have cast a slur upon that curiosity which dr barlett before had not refused to gratify as well as shut myself out from all future communications and confidence  it is very possible besides that unused as i have been to artifice and disguise i should have betrayed myself especially had i found any of the contents of the letter very affecting  thus you see lucy that policy as well as rectitude of manners justify me and in this particular i am an happy girl  miss grandison has just now told her sister what passed between us lady l says she would not have been miss grandison in taking the letter by what means soever come at for how said she did i know what secrets there might be in it before i read it but i think verily when it had been got at and offered me i could not have been miss byron  and she threw her arms about me and hugged me to her dear creature said she you must be lady grandison  must said miss grandison she shall  who lucy whether that may ever come to pass or not would not on reflection thus approved by both sisters rejoice that she conquered her curiosity and acted as she did  miss grandison talked to lady l of its being likely that her brother would go to bologna of a visit he is soon to make to grandisonhall and she to go with him of his going to paris in order to settle some matters relating to the will of his late friend mr danby   well lucy my time in town is hastening to its period why am i not reminded that my three allotted months are near expired will you receive the poor girl who perhaps will not be able to carry down with her the heart she brought up and yet to go down to such dear friends without it what an ungrateful sound has that  miss grandison began to talk of other subjects relating to her brother and those greatly to his praise i could have heard all she had to say with infinite pleasure i do love to hear him praised but as i doubted not but these subjects arose from the letter so surreptitiously obtained i restrained myself and withdrew  of what an happy temper is miss grandison she was much affected with the scene that passed between us but all is over with her already one lesson upon her harpsichord sets everything right with her she has been raillying lord l with as much life and spirit as if she had done nothing to be vexed at had i been induced by her to read the letter which she got at dishonestly as she owned what a poor figure should i have made in my own eyes for a month to come  but did she not as soon overcome the mortification given her by her brother on the detection of captain andersons affair how unmercifully did she railly me within a few hours after  yet she has fine qualities one cannot help loving her i do love her but is it not a weakness to look without abatement of affection on those faults in one person which we should hold utterly inexcusable in another in miss grandisons case however dont say it is lucy o what a partiality yet she has within these few minutes owned that she thought the step she had taken a faulty one before she came to me with the letter and hoped to induce me to countenance her in what she had done  i called her a little satan on this occasion but after all what if the dear charlottes curiosity was more for my sake than her own no motive of friendship you will say can justify a wrong action  why no lucy that is very true but if you knew miss grandison you would love her dearly  letter ii sir charles grandison to dr bartlett the letter which miss byron refused to read or hear read  friday night mar    i hope my lord l and my sisters will be able to make colnebrooke so agreeable to miss byron that i may have the pleasure of finding her there in the beginning of the week  my lord w is in town he has invited me to dine with him tomorrow and must not be denied was a part of his message brought me by halden his steward who says that his lordship has something of consequence to consult me upon  when my dear friend shall i find time for myself pray make my compliments to my lord l and to my three sisters and tell them from me that when i have the happiness of being in their company then it is that i think i give time to myself  i have a letter from bologna from the faithful camilla the contents of it give me great concern she urges me to make one more visit there she tells me that the bishop said in her hearing it would be kind if i would were such a visit to be requested generally and it were likely to be of service you may believe that i would cheerfully make it  i should go for a fortnight at least to grandisonhall burgess has let me know that the workmen have gone almost as far as they can go without my further orders and the churchwardens have signified to me that the church is completely beautified according to my directions so that it will be ready to be opened on the sunday after next at farthest and entreat my presence both as patron and benefactor i will now hasten my designed alterations at the hall  i had rather not be present at the opening yet the propriety of my being there will probably prevail upon me to comply with the entreaties of the churchwardens who in their letter signify the expectations of sir samuel clarke sir william turner and mr barnham of seeing me and my sister charlotte you will be pleased to mention this to her  i wish without putting a slight upon good mr dobson that you my dear friend could oblige us with the first sermon all then would be decent and worthy of the occasion and the praise would be given properly and not to the agent but as it would be a little mortifying to mr dobson of whose praise only i am apprehensive so much as to hint such a wish i will write to him that he will oblige me if he say not one word that shall carry the eyes of the audience to my seat  the execution of the orders i gave that five other pews should be equally distinguished and ornamented with mine carries not with it the appearance of affectation does it my good dr bartlett especially as so many considerable families have seats there i would not seem guilty of a false modesty which breaking out into singularity would give the suspicion of a wrong direction in cases where it may be of use to suppose a right one  what can i do in relation to my emily she is of the stature of woman she ought according to the present taste to be introduced into public life i am not fond of that life and what knowledge she will gain by the introduction she had better be without yet i think we should conform something to the tas e of the times in which we live womens minds have generally a lighter turn than those of men they should be innocently indulged and on this principle it was that last winter i attended her and my sisters very often to the places of public entertainment that she having seen everything that was the general subject of polite conversation might judge of such entertainments as they deserve and not add expectation which runs very high in young minds and is seldom answered to the ideal seenes this indulgence answered as i wish emily can now hear talk of the emulation of actors and managers and of the other public diversions with tranquillity and be satisfied as she reads with representing over again to herself the parts in which the particular actors excelled and thus a boundary is set to her imagination and that by her own choice for she thinks lightly of them when she can be obliged by the company of my two sisters and lord l  but new scenes will arise in an age so studious as this to gratify the eye and the ear from these a young woman of fortune must not be totally excluded i am a young man and as emily is so well grown for her years i think i cannot so properly be her introducer to them as i might were i fifteen or twenty years older  i live to my own heart and i know i think i do that it is not a bad one but as i cannot intend anything with regard to my emily i must for her sake be more observant of the worlds opinion than i hope i need to be for my own you have taught me that it is not good manners to despise the worlds opinion though we should regard it only in the second place  emily has too large a fortune i have an high opinion of her discretion but she is but a girl womens eyes are wanderers and too often bring home guests that are very troublesome to them and whom once introduced they cannot get out of the house  i wish she had only ten thousand pounds she would then stand a better chance for happiness than she can do i doubt with five times ten and would have five persons to one that she has now to choose out of for how few are there who can make proposals to the father or guardian of a girl who has  0 000 l  indeed there are not wanting in our sex forward spirits who will think that sum not too much for their merits though they may not deserve  000 l nor even one and hence arises the danger of a woman of great fortune from those who will not dare to make proposals to a guardian after an introduction and how easy is that now made at public places a woman of the greatest fortune is but a woman and is to be attacked and prevailed upon by the same methods which succeed with a person of the slenderest and perhaps is won with equal if not with greater ease since if the lady has a little romance in her head and her lover a great deal of art and flattery she will call that romantic turn generosity and thinking she can lay the man who has obtained her attention under obligation she will meet him her full halfway  emily is desirous to be constantly with us my sister is very obliging i know she will comply with whatever i shall request of her in relation to emily but where the reputation of a lady is concerned a man should not depend too much upon his own character especially a young man be it ever so unexceptionable her mother has already given out foolish hints she demands her daughter the unhappy woman has no regard to truth her own character lost and so deservedly will she have any tenderness for that of emily who will scruple to believe what a mother though ever so wicked will report of her daughter under twenty and her guardian under thirty if they live constantly together her guardian at the same time carrying his heart in his countenance and loving the girl though with as much innocence as if she were his sister once i had thoughts of craving the assistance of the court of chancery for the protection of her person and fortune but an hint of this nature distressed her for many days unknown to me had i been acquainted that she took it so heavily i would not have made her unhappy for one day  i have looked out among the quality for a future husband for her but where can i find one with whom i think she will be happy there are many who would be glad of her fortune as i said her fortune is too large it is enough to render every mans address to her suspected and to make a guardian apprehensive that her person agreeable as it is and every day improving and her mind opening to avantage every hour of her life would be but the second if the second view of a man professing to love her and were she to marry what a damp would the slights of an husband give to the genius of a young lady whose native modesty would always make her want encouragement  i have also cast an eye over the gentry within my knowledge but have not met with one whom i could wish to be the husband of my emily so tender so gentle so ductile as she is a fierce a rash an indelicate even a careless or indifferent man would either harden her heart or shorten her life and as the latter would be much more easy to be effected than the former what must she suffer before she could return indifference for disrespect and reach the quiet end of it  see what a man sir walter warkyns is my sister only could deal with such an one a superiority in her so visible he must fear her yet a generosity so great and a dignity so conspicuous in her whole behavior as well as countenance he must love her everybodys respect to her would oblige love and reverence from him but my weakhearted diffident emily what would she do with such a man  what would she do with a sir hargrave pollexfen what with such a man as mr greville as sir hargrave describes him i mention these men for are not there many such  i am not apt to run into grave declamations against the times and yet by what i have seen abroad and now lately since my arrival at home and have heard from men of greater observation and who have lived longer in the world than i have i cannot but think that englishmen are not what they were a wretched effeminacy seems to prevail among them marriage itself is every day more and more out of fashion and even virtuous women give not the institution so much of their countenance as to discourage by their contempt the freelivers a good woman as such has therefore but few chances for happiness in marriage yet shall i not endeavor the more endeavor to save and serve my emily  i have one encouragement since my happy acquaintance with miss byron to think that the age is not entirely lost to a sense of virtue and goodness see we not how everybody reveres her even a sir hargrave pollexfen a greville a fenwick men of free lives adore her and at the same time she meets with the love of all good men and the respect of women whether gay or serious but i am afraid that the first attraction with men is her beauty i am afraid that few see in that admirable young lady what i see in her a mind great and noble a sincerity beyond that of women a goodness unaffected and which shows itself in action and not merely in words and outward appearance a wit lively and inossensive and an understanding solid and useful all which render her a fit companion either in the social or contemplative hour and yet she thinks herself not above the knowledge of those duties the performance of which makes an essential of the female character  but i am not giving a character of miss byron to you my good dr bartlett who admire her as much as i do  do you think it impossible for me to procure for my emily such a guardian and companion as miss byron on her return to northamptonshire would make her  such worthy relations as she would introduce her to would be a further happiness to my ward  i am far from undervaluing my sisters good qualities but if emily lives with her she must live also with me indeed the affairs in which i am engaged for other people if i may call those who have a claim upon me for every instance of my friendship other people will occasion me to be often absent but still while grandisonhall and st jamess square are the visible places of residence equally of the guardian and ward emilys mother will tell the world that we live together  miss jervois does not choose to return to mrs lane and indeed i dont think she would be safe there in a family of women though very worthy ones from the attempts of one of the sex who having brought her into the world calls herself her mother and especially now that the unhappy woman has begun to be troublesome there i beg of you therefore my dear dr bartlett who know more of my heart and situation than any one living my dear beauchamp excepted to consider what i have written and give me your opinion of that part of it which relates to miss byron and emily  i was insensibly drawing myself in to enumerate the engagements which at present press most upon me let me add to the subject  i must soon go to paris in order finally to settle such of the affairs of my late worthy friend as cannot be so well done by any other hand the three thousand pounds which he has directed to be disposed of to charitable uses in france as well as in england at the discretion of his executor is one of them  perhaps equity will allow me to add to this limited sum from what will remain in my hands after the establishment of the nephews and niece as they are young and brought up with a hope that they will make a figure in the world by their diligence i would not by any means make them independent on that the whole estate divided among them would not be sufficient to answer that purpose happily though it might be enough to abate the edge of their industry  the charity that i am most intent upon promoting in france and in england too is that of giving little fortunes to young maidens in marriage with honest men of their own degree who might from such an outsetting begin the world as it is called with some hope of success  by this time my dear dr bartlett you will guess that i have a design upon you it is that you will assist me in executing the will of my late friend make enquiries after and reccommend to me objects worthy of relief you was very desirous some time ago to retire to the hall but i knew not how to spare you and i hoped to attend you thither you shall now set out for that place as soon as you please and that neither may be or as little as possible losers by the separation everything that we would say to each other were we together that as we used to do we will say by pen and ink we will be joint executors in the first place for this sum of  000 l  make enquiries then as soon as you get down for worthy objects  the industrious poor of all persuasions reduced either by age infirmity or accident those who labor under incurable maladies youth of either sex capable of beginning the world to advantage but destitute of the means these in particular are the objects we both think worthy of assistance you shall take  00 l down with you for a beginning  it is my pride it is my glory that i can say dr bartlett and charles grandison on all benevolent occasions are actuated by one soul my dear friend adieu  letter iii miss byron to miss selby sat night march    i have furnished the ladies and my lord with more letters and so they have all my heart before them  i dont care the man is sir charles grandison and they railly me not so much as before while they thought i affected reserves to them indeed it would be cruel if they did and i should have run away from them  i am glad you all think that the two sisters used me severely they really did but i have this gratification of my pride in reflecting upon their treatment of me  i would not have done so by them had situations been exchanged and i think myself nearer an equality with them than i had thought myself before  but they are good ladies and my sincere friends and wellwishers and i forgive them and so must my dear grandmamma  i am sorry mthinks that her delicacy has been offended on the occasion and did she weep at the hearing read my account of that attack made upon her girl by the overlively charlotte  o the dear the indulgent parent how tender was it of my aunt too to be concerned for the poor harriets delicacy so hard put to it as she was it did indeed as she distinguishes in her usual charming manner look as if they put a great price upon their intended friendship to me with regard to my interest in their brothers heart as if the favor done to the humbled girl if they could jointly procure for her their brothers countenance might well allow of their raillery  dont pray dont my dear grandmamma call it by a severer name they did not i am sure they did not mean to hurt me so much as i really was hurt so let it pass humor and raillery are very difficult things to rein in they are ever curveting like a prancing horse and they will often throw the rider who depends more upon his skill in managing them than he has reason to do  my uncle was charmed with the scene and thinks the two ladies did just as he would have done he means it a compliment to their delicacy i presume but i am of my aunt selbys opinion that their generous brother would not have given them thanks for their raillery to the poor frighted harriet i am very happy however that my behavior and frankness on the occasion are not disapproved at selbyhouse and shirleymanor and by you my lucy and here let that matter rest  should i not begin to think of going back to you all my lucy i believe i blush ten times a day when alone to find myself waiting and waiting as if for the gracious motion yet apprehending that it never will never can be made and all you my friends indulging an absence that your goodness makes painful to you in the same hope it looks  dont it lucy  so like a design upon  i dont know how it looks  but at times i cannot endure myself and yet while the love of virtue a little too personal perhaps is the foundation of these designs these waitings these emotions i think i am not wholly inexcusable  i am sure i should not esteem him were he not the good man he is  pray let me ask you  do you think he could not be put upon saying something affronting to me upon doing something unworthy of his character  o then i am sure i should hate him all the other instances of his goodness would then be as nothing i will be captious i think and study to be affronted whether he intends to affront me or not  but what a multitude of foolish notions comes into the head of a silly girl who little as she knows knows more of anything or of anybody than she knows of herself  i wish my godfather had not put it in my head that emily is cherishing perhaps unknown to herself a flame that will devour her peace for to be sure this young creature can have no hope that  yet  0000 l is a vast fortune but it can never buy her guardian do you think such a man as sir charles grandison has a price  i am sure he has not  i watch the countenance the words the air of the girl when he is spoken of and with pity i see that he cannot be named but her eyes sparkle her eye is taken off her work or book as she happens to be engaged in either and she seems as if she would look the person through who is praising her guardian for the life of her she cannot work and hear and then she sighs  upon my word lucy there is no such thing as proceeding with his praises before her  the girl so sighs  so young a creature  yet how can one caution the poor thing  but what makes me a little more observant of her than i should otherwise perhaps have been additional to my godfathers observation is an hint given me by lady l which perhaps she has from miss grandison and she not unlikely from the stolen letter for miss grandison hinted at it but i thought it was only to excite my curiosity when one is not in good humor how ones very style is encumbred the hint is this that it is more than probable it will be actually proposed to me to take down with me to northamptonshire this young lady  i who want a governess myself to be  but let it be proposed  in a conversation that passed just now between us women on the subject of love a favorite topic with all girls this poor thing gave her opinion unasked and for a young girl was quite alert i thought she used to be more attentive than talkative  i whispered miss grandison once dont you think miss jervois talks more than she used to do madam  i think she does madam rewhispered the arch lady  i beg your pardon  charlotte then  you have it harriet then  but let her prate she is not often in the humor  nay with all my heart i love miss jervois but i cannot but watch when habits begin to change and i am always afraid of young creatures exposing themselves when they are between girls and women  i dont love whispering said miss jervois more pertly than ever but my guardian loves me and you ladies love me and so my heart is easy  her heart easy  who thought of her heart her guardian loves her  emily shant go down with me lucy  sunday monday march  0 o but lucy we are alarmed here on miss jervoiss account by a letter which dr bartlett received a little late last night from sir charles so showed it us not till this morning as we were at breakfast the unhappy woman her mother has made him a visit poor emily dear child what a mother she has  i have so much obliged the doctor by delivering into his hands the papers that our other friends have just perused and let me say with high approbation that he made no scruple of allowing me to send this letter to you i asked the favor as i know you will all now be very attentive to whatever relates to emily return everything the doctor shall entrust me with by the first opportunity  by the latter part of this letter you will find that the doctor has acquainted sir charles with his sisters wishes of a correspondence with him by letter he consents to it you will all see but upon terms that are not likely to be complied with by any of his three sisters for he puts me in three sisters his third sister  the repetition has such an officiousness in it he is a good man but he can be severe upon our sex  it is not in woman to be unreserved  you will find that one of the reflections upon us he adds and to be impartial perhaps they should not why so  but is not this a piece of advice given to myself to make me more reserved than i am but he gives not himself opportunity to see whether i am or am not reserved i will not be mean lucy i repeat for the twentieth time i will not deserve to be despised by him  no though he were the sovereign of the greatest empire on earth in this believe  your harriet byron   letter iv sir charles grandison to dr bartlett inclosed in the preceding  march    i have had a visit my dear and reverend friend from emilys mother she will very probably make one also at colnebrooke before i can be so happy as to get thither i dispatch this therefore to apprise you and lord l of such a probability which is the greater as she knows emily to be there through the inadvertence of saunders and finds me to be in town i will give you the particulars of what passed between us for your better information if she goes to colnebrooke  i was preparing to attend lord w as by appointment when she sent in her name to me  i received her civilly she had the assurance to make up to me with a full expectation that i would salute her but i took or rather received her ready hand and led her to a chair by the fireside you have never seen her she thinks herself still handsome and did not her vices make her odious and her whole aspect show her heart she would not be much mistaken  how does emily sir gallanting her fan is the girl here bid her come to me i will see her  she is not here madam  where is she then she has not been at mrs lanes for some time  she is in the best protection she is with my two sisters  and pray sir charles grandison what do you intend to do with her the girl begins to be womanly  she laughed and her heart spoke out at her eyes  tell me what you propose to do with her you know added she affecting a serious air that she is my child  if madam you deserve to be thought her mother you will be satisfied with the hands she is in  pish  i never loved you good men where a fine girl comes in their way i know what i know   she looked wantonly and laughed again  i am not to talk seriously with you mrs jervois but what have you to say to my ward  say  why you know sir i am her mother and i have a mind to have the care of her person myself you must so her father directed have the care of her fortune but i have a mind for her reputationsake to take the girl out of the hands of so young a guardian i hope you will not oppose me  if this be all your business madam i must be excused i am preparing as you see to dress  where is emily i will see the girl  if your motive be motherly love little madam as you have acted the mother by her you shall see her when she is in town but her person and reputation as well as fortune must be my care  i am married sir and my husband is a man of honor  your marriage madam gives a new reason why emily must not be in your care  let me tell you sir that my husband is a man of honor and as brave a man as yourself and he will see me righted  be he who he will he can have no business with emily did you come to tell me you are married mama  i did sir dont you wish me joy   joy madam i wish you to deserve joy and you will then perhaps have it you will excuse me  i shall make my friends wait  i could not restrain my indignation this woman marries as she calls it twice or thrice a year  well sir then you will find time perhaps to talk with major o hara he is of one of the best families in ireland and he will not let me be robbed of my daughter  major ohara madam has nothing to do with the daughter of my late unhappy friend nor have i anything to say to him emily is in my protection and i am sorry to say that she never had been so were not the woman who calls herself her mother the person least fit to be entrusted with her daughter permit me the favor of leading you to your chair  she then broke out into the language in which she always concludes these visits she threatened me with the resentments of major ohara and told me he had been a conqueror in half a dozen duels  i offered my hand she refused it not i led her to her chair  i will call again tomorrow afternoon said she threatening with her head perhaps with the major sir and i expect you will produce the little harlotry   i withdrew in silent contempt vile woman  but let nothing of this escape you to my emily i think she should not see her but in my presence the poor girl will be terrified into fits as she was the last time she saw her if she comes and i am not there but possibly i may hear no more of this wicked woman for a month or two having a power to make her annuity either one or two hundred pounds according to her behavior at my own discretion the man she has married who could have no inducement but the annuity if he has married her will not suffer her to incur such a reduction of it for you know i have always hitherto paid her two hundred pounds a year her threatening to see me tomorrow may be to amuss me while she goes the woman is a foolish woman but being accustomed to intrigue she aims at cunning and contrivance  i am now hastening to lord w i hope his woman will not be admitted to his table as the generally is let who will be present yet it seems knows not how to be silent whatever be the subject i have never chosen either to dine or sup with my lord that i might not be under a necessity of objecting to her company and were i not to object to it as i am a near kinsman to my lord and know the situation she is in with him my complaisance might be imputed to motives altogether unworthy of a man of spirit  yours of this morning was brought me just as i was concluding there is one paragraph in it that greatly interests me  you hint to me that my sisters though my absences are short would be glad to receive nowandthen a letter from me you my dear friend have engaged me into a kind of habit which makes me write to you with ease and pleasure  to you and to our beauchamp methinks i can write anything use it is true would make it equally agreeable to me to write to my sisters i would not have them think that there is a brother in the world that better loves his sisters than i do mine and now you know i have three but why have they not signified as much to me could i give pleasure to any whom i love without giving great pain to myself it would be unpardonable not to do it  i could easily carry on a correspondence with my sisters were they to be very earnest about it but then it must be a correspondence the writing mut not be all of one side do they think i should not be equally pleased to hear what they are about from time to time and what occasionally their sentiments are upon persons and things if it fall in your way and you think it not a mere temporary wish for young ladies often wish and think no more of the matter then propose the condition  but caution them that the moment i discover that they are less frank and more reserved than i am there will be an end of the correspondence my three sisters are most amiably frank for women  but thus challenged dare they enter the lists upon honor with a man a brother upon equal terms  o no they dare not it is not in woman to be unreserved in some points and to be impartial perhaps they should not yet surely there is nowandthen a man a brother to be met with who would be the more grateful for the confidence reposed in him  were this proposal to be accepted i could write to them many of the things that i communicate to you i have but few secrets i only wish to keep from relations so dear to me things that could not possibly yield them pleasure i am sure i could trust to your judgment the passages that might be read to them from my letters to you  sometimes indeed i love to divert myself with charlottes humorous curiosity for she seems as i told her lately to love to suppose secrets where there are none for a compliment to her own sagacity when she thinks she has found them out and i love at such times to see her puzzled and at a fault as a punishment for her declining to speak out  you have told me heretofore in excuse for the distance which my two elder sisters observe to their brother when i have complained of it to you that it proceeded from awe from reverence for him but why should there be that awe that reverence surely my dear friend if this is spontaneous and invincible in them there must be some fault in my behavior some seeming want of freedom in my manner with which you will not acquaint me it is otherwise impossible that between brothers and sisters where the love is not doubted on either side such a distance should subsist you must consult them upon it and get them to explain themselves on this subject to you and when they have done so tell me of my fault and i will endeavor to render myself more agreeable more familiar shall i say to them but i will not by any means excuse them if they give me cause to think that the distance is owing to the will and the power i have been blessed with to do my duty by them what would this be but indirectly to declare that once they expected not justice from their brother but no more of this subject at present i am impatient to be with you all at colnebrooke you cannot think how impatient selfdenial is a very hard doctrine to be learned my good dr bartlett so in some cases is it found to be by  your charles grandison  letter v miss byron to miss selby colnebrooke sunday evening poor emily her heart is almost broken this ignoble passion what a meanspirited creature had it like to have made me  be quiet be quiet lucy  i will call it ignoble did you ever know me before so little  and had it not like to have put me upon being hardhearted envious and i cannot tell what to a poor fatherless girl just starting into woman and therefore into more danger than she ever was in before wanting to be protected  from whom from a mother  dreadful circumstance  yet i am ready to grudge the poor girl her guardian and her innocent prattle  but let me be despised by the man i love if i do not conquer this newdiscovered envy jealousy littleness at least with regard to this unhappy girl whose calamity endears her to me  dear child sweet emily you shall go down with me if it be proposed my grandmamma and uncle and aunt will permit me to carry you with me they are generous they have no little passion to mislead their beneficence they are what i hope to be now i have found myself out  and what if her gratitude shall make her heart overflow into love has she not excuse for it if harriet has any  well but to the occasion of the poor emilys distress  about twelve this day soon after lord l and the two sisters and i came from church for emily happened not to go a coach and four stopped at the gate and a servant in a sorry livery alighting from behind it enquired for lord l two gentlemen who by their dress and appearance were military men and one lady were in it  my lord ordered them to be invited to alight and received them with his usual politeness  dont let me call this unhappy woman emilys mother o hara is the name she owns  she addressed herself to my lord i am the mother of emily jervois my lord this gentleman major o hara is my husband  the major bowed strutted and acknowleged her for his wife and this gentleman my lord said he is captain salmeret a very brave man he is in foreign service his lady is my own sister  my lord took notice of each  i understand my lord that my daughter is here i desire to see her  one of my lords servants at that time passing by the door which was open pray sir said she to him let miss jervois know that her mamma is come to see her desire her to come to me  major i long to see my new daughter i hear she is a charming young lady she may depend upon the and es of a fher from me  capt de man of honor and good nature be my broders general cha ract er i do assure your lordship  he spoke english as a frenchman my lord says but pronounced the word character as an irishman  major bowing no need of this my dear friend my lord has the cha ract er of a fine gentleman himself and knows how to receive a gentleman who waits upon him with due respect  lord l i hope i do but madam you know whose protection the lady is in  mrs ohara i do my lord sir charles grandison is a very fine gentleman  capt de vinest cha ract er in de vorld by my salvation everybody say so  mrs ohara but sir charles my lord is a very young gentleman to be guardian to so young a creature especially now that she is growing into woman i have had some few faults i own who lives that has not but i have been basely scandalized my first husband had his and much greater than i had he was set against me by some of his own relations vile creatures  he left me and went abroad but he has answered for all by this time and for the scanty allowance he made me his great fortune considered but as long as my child will be the better for it that i can forgive  emily my dear   she stepped to the door on hearing the rustling of silks supposing her at hand but it was miss grandison followed by a servant with chocolate to afford her pretense to see the visitors and at the same time having a mind to hint to them that they were not to expect to be asked to stay to dinner  it is to miss grandison that i owe the description of each the account of what passed and the broken dialect  mrs ohara has been an handsome woman but well might sir charles be disgusted with her aspect she has a leering fly yet confident eye and a very bold countenance she is not ungenteel yet her very dress denotes her turn of mind her complexion sallowish streaked with red makes her face which is not so plump as it once has been look like a withering johnapple that never ripened kindly  miss grandison has a way of saying illnatured things in such a goodnatured manner that one cannot forbear smiling though one should not altogether approve of them and yet sometimes one would be ready to wonder how she came by her images  the major is pert bold vain and seemed particularly sond of his new scarlet coat and laced waistcoat he is certainly miss grandison says a low man though a soldier anderson added she is worth fifty of him his face fiery and highly pimpled is set off to advantage by an enormous solitaire his bad and straggling teeth are shown continually by an affected laugh and his empty discourse is interlarded with eaths which with my uncles leave i shall omit  captain salmonet she says appeared to her in a middle way between a beau and a dutch boor aiming at gentility with a person and shape uncommonly clumsy  they both assumed military airs which not sitting naturally gave them what miss grandison called the swagger of soldierly importance  emily was in her own apartment almost fainting with terror for the servant to whom mrs ohara had spoken to bid her daughter come to her had officiously carried up the message  to what mrs ohara had said in defense of her own character my lord answered mr jervois had a right madam to do what he pleased with a fortune acquired by his own industry a disagreement in marriage is very unhappy but in this case as in a duel the survivor is hardly ever in fault i have nothing to do in this matter miss jervois is very happy in sir charles grandisons protection she thinks so and so does everybody that knows her it is your misfortune if you do not  mrs o hara my lord i make no dispute of sir charless being the guardian of her fortune but no father can give away the authority a mother has as well as himself over her child  major that child a daughter too my lord  lord l to all this i have nothing to say you will not be able i believe to persuade my brother grandison to give up his wards person to you madam  mrs ohara chancery may my lord   lord l i have nothing to say to this madam no man in england knows better what is to be done in this case than sir charles grandison and no man will be readier to do what is just and fitting without law but i enter not into the case you must not talk to me on this subject  miss gr do you think madam that your marriage intitles you the rather to have the care of miss jervois  major with great quickness i hope madam that my honor and my cha ract er   miss gr be they ever so unquestionable will not entitle you sir to the guardianship of miss jervoiss person  major i do not pretend to it madam but i hope that no fathers will no guardians power is to set aside the natural authority which a mother has over her child  lord l this is not my affair i am not inclined to enter into a dispute with you madam on this subject  mrs ohara let emily be called down to her mother i hope i may see my child she is in this house my lord i hope i may see my child  major your lordship and you madam will allow that it would be the greatest hardship in the world to deny to a mother the sight of her child  capt de very greatest hardship of all hardships your lordship will not refuse to let de daughter come to her mother  lord l her guardian perhaps will not deny it you must apply to him he is in town miss jervois is here but as a guest she will be soon in town i must not have her alarmed she has very weak spirits  mrs ohara weak spirits my lord  a child to have spirits too weak to see her mother  and she felt for her handkerchief  miss gr it sounds a little harshly i own to deny to a mother the sight of her daughter but unless my brother were present i think my lord it cannot be allowed  major not allowed madam  capt a mother to be denied to see her daughter jesu and he crossed himself  mrs ohara putting her handkerchief to hide her eyes for it seems she wept not i am a very unhappy mother indeed   major embracing her my dearest life my best love i must not bear these tears  would to god sir charles were here and thought fit  but i came not here to threaten  you my lord are a man of the greatest honor so is sir charles  but whatever were the misunderstandings between husband and wife they should not be kept up and propagated between mother and child my wife at present desires only to see her child that is all my lord were your brother present madam he would not deny her this then again embracing his wise my dear soul be comforted you will be allowed to see your daughter no doubt of it i am able to protect and right you my dear soul be comforted  she sobbed miss grandison says and the goodnatured lord l was moved  let miss jervois be asked said he if she chooses to come down  i will go to her myself said miss grandison  she came down presently again   miss byron and miss jervois said she are gone out together in the chariot  major nay madam   capt upon my salvation this must not pass  and he swaggered about the room  mrs ohara looked with an air of incredulity  it was true however for the poor girl being ready to saint i was called in to her lady l had been making a visit in the chariot and it had just brought her back o save me save me dear madam said miss emily to me wringing her hands i cannot i cannot see my mother out of my guardians presence and the will make me own her new husband i beseech you save me hide me  i saw the chariot from the window and without asking any questions i hurried miss emily down stairs and conducted the trembling dear into it and whipping in after her ordered the coachman to drive anywhere except toward london and then the poor girl threw her arms about my neck smothering me with her kisses and calling me by all the tender names that terror and mingled gratitude could suggest to her  miss grandison told the circumstances pretty near as above adding i think my lord that miss emily wants not apology for her terror on this occasion that lady in her own heart knows that the poor girl has reason for it  madam said the major my wife is cruelly used your brother  but i shall talk to him upon the subect he is said to be a man of conscience and honor i hope i shall find him so i know how to protect and right my wife  and i will stand by my brother and his lady said the captain to de very last drop of my blood  he looked fierce and put his hand on his sword  lord l you dont by these airs mean to insult me gentlemen  if you do   major no no my lord but we must seek our remedy elsewhere surprising that a mother is denied the sight of her daughter very surprising  capt very surprising indeed  ver dis to be done in my country  in france  english liberty begar ver pretty liberty  a daughter to be supported against her mother  whew ver pretty liberty by my salvation   mrs o hara and is indeed my vile child run away to avoid seeing her mother  strange does she always intend to do thus  she must see me  and dearly shall she repent it  and she looked fierce and particularly spiteful and then declared that she would stay there till emily came back were it midnight  lord l you will have my leave for that madam  major had we not best go into our coach and let that drive in quest of her  she cannot be far off it will be easy to trace a chariot  lord l since this matter is carried so far let me tell you that in the absence of her guardian i will protect her since miss jervois is thus averse she shall be indulged in it if you see her madam it must be by the consent and in the presence of her guardian  major well my dear since the matter stands thus since your child is taught to shun you thus let us see what sir charles grandison will say to it he is the principal in this affair and is not privileged if he thinks fit  and there he stopped and blustered and offered his hand to his bride  i am able both to protect and right you madam and i will but you have a letter for the girl written on a supposition that she was not here  little did you think or i think that she was in the house when we came and that she should be spirited away to avoid paying her duty to her mother  very true very true and very true said each and mrs ohara pulled out the letter laying it on one of the chairs and desired it might be given to her daughter and then they all went away very much dissatisfied the two men muttering and threatening and resolving as they said to make a visit to sir charles  i hope we shall see him here very soon i hope these wretches will not insult him or endanger a life so precious poor emily i pity her from my heart she is as much grieved on this occasion as i was in dread of the resentment of sir hargrave pollexfen  let me give you some account of what passed between emily and me you will be charmed with her beautiful simplicity  when we were in the chariot she told me that the last time she saw her mother it was at mrs lanes the bad woman made a pretense of private business with her daughter and withdrew with her into another room and then insisted that she should go off with her unknown to anybody and because i desired to be excused said she my mother laid her hands upon me and said she would trample me under her foot it is true unhappy woman she was  then the dear girl whispered me though nobody was near us  sweet modest creature loath to reveal this part of her mothers shame even to me aloud and blushed as she spoke   she was in her cups  my mamma is as naughty as some men in that respect and i believe she would have been as good as her word but on my screaming for i was very much frighted mrs lane who had an eye upon us ran in with two servants and one of her daughters and rescued me she had torn my cap  yet it was a sad thing you know madam to see ones mother put out of the house against her will and then she raised the neighborhood lord bless me i thought i should have ded i did fall into fits then was mrs lane forced to tell every one what a sad woman my mother was it was such a disgrace to me  it was a month before i eould go to church or look anybody in the face but mrs lanes character was of her side and my guardians goodness was a help  shall i say a help against my mother  poor woman we heard afterward she was dead but my guardian would not believe it if it would please god to take me i should rejoice many a tear does my poor mother and the trouble i give to the best of men cost me when nobody sees me and many a time do i cry myself to sleep when i think it impossible i should get such a kind relief  i was moved at the dear girls melancholy tale i clasped my arms about her and wept on her gentle bosom her calamity which was the greatest that could happen to a good child i told her had endeared her to me i would love her as my sister  and so i will dear child i will for ever love her and i am ready to hate myself for some passages in my last letter o how deceitful is the heart i could not have thought it possible that mine could have been so narrow  the dear girl rejoiced in my assurances and promsed grateful love to the latest hour of her life  indeed madam i have a grateful heart said she for all i am so unhappy in a certain relation i have none of those sort of faults that give me a resemblance in any way to my poor mother but how shall i make out what i say you will mistrust me i fear you will be apt to doubt my principles but will you promise to take my heart in your hand and guide it as you please  indeed it is an honest one i wish you aw it through and through  if ever i do a wrong thing mistrust my head if you please but not my heart but in everything i will be directed by you and then my head will be as right as my heart  i told her that good often resulted from evil it was an happy thing perhaps for both that her mothers visit had been made look upon me my dear emily as your entire friend we will have but one heart between us  let me add lucy that if you find me capable of drawing this sweet girl into consessions of her insant love and of making ungenerous advantage of them though the event were to be fatal to my peace if i did not i now call upon all you my dear friends to despise and renounce the treacherous friend in harriet byron  she besought me to let her write to me to let her come to me for advice as often as she wanted it whether here in my dressing room or chamber or at mr reevess when i went from colnebrooke  i consented very cheerfully and at her request for indeed said she i would not be an intruder for the world promised by a nod at her entrance to let her know if she came when i was busy that she must retire and come another time  you are too young a lady added she to be called my mamma  alas i have never a mamma you know but i will love you and obey you on the holding up of your finger as i would my mother were she as good as you  does not the beautiful simplicity of this charming girl affect you lucy but her eyes swimming in tears her earnest looks her throbbing bosom her hands now clasped about me now in one another added such graces to what she said that it is impossible to do justice to it and yet i am affected as i write but not so much you may believe as at the time she told her tender tale  indeed her calamity has given her an absolute possession of my heart i who had such good parents and have had my loss of them so happily alleviated and even supplied by a grandmamma and an aunt so truly maternal as well as by the love of every one to whom i have the happiness to be related how unworthy of such blessings should i be if i did not know how to pity a poor girl who must reckon a living mother as her heaviest misfortune  sir charles from the time of the disturbance which this unhappy woman made in mrs lanes neighborhood and of her violence to his emily not only threatened to take from her that moiety of the annuity which he is at liberty to withdraw but gave orders that she should never again be allowed to see his ward but in his presence and she has been quiet till of late only threatening and demanding but now she seems on this her marriage with major ohara to have meditated new schemes or is aiming perhaps at new methods to bring to bear an old one of which sir charles had private intimation given him by one of the persons to whom in her cups she once boasted of it which was that as soon as miss emily was marriageable she would endeavor either by fair means or foul to get her into her hands and if she did but for one week she should the next come out the wife of a man she had in view who would think half the fortune more than sufficient for himself and make over the other half to her and then she should come into her right which she deems to be half of the fortune of which her husband died possessed  this that follows is a copy of the letter left for emily by this mother which though not well spelled might have been written by a better woman who had hardships to complain of which might have entitled her to pity  my dear emily if you have any love any duty left for an unhappy mother whose faults have been barbarously aggravated to justify the ill usage of a husband who was not faultless i conjure you to insist upon making me a visit either at my new lodgings in deanstreet soho or that you will send me word where i can see you supposing i am not permitted to see you as this day or that you should not be at colnebrooke where it seems you have been some days i cannot believe that your guardian for his own reputationsake as well as for justicesake as he is supposed to be a good man will deny you if you insist upon it as you ought to do if you have half the love for me that i have for you  can i doubt that you will insist upon it i cannot i long to see you i long to lay you in my bosom and i have given hopes to major ohara a man of one of the best families in ireland and a very worthy man and a brave man too who knows how to right an injured wife if he is put to it but who wishes to proceed amicably that you will not scruple as my husband to call him father  i hear a very good account of your improvements emily and i am told that you are grown very tall and pretty o my emily  what a grievous thing is it to say that i am told these things and not to have been allowed to see you and to behold your growth and those improvements which must rejoice my heart and do though i am so basely belied as i have been do not you emily despise her that bore you it is a dreadful thing with such fortunes as your father left that i must be made poor and dependent and then be despised for being so  but if you my child are taught to be and will be one of those what though i have such happy prospects in my present marriage will be my fate but a bitter death which your want of duty will hasten for what mother can bear the contempts of her child and in that case your great fortune will not set you above gods judgments but better things are hoped of my emily by her  indulgent though heretofore unhappy mother helen ohara saturday march     my lord thought fit to open this letter he is sorry that he did because the poor girl is so lowspirited that he does not choose to let her see it but will leave it to her guardian to give it to her or not as he pleases  miss grandison lifted up her hands and eyes as she read it such a wretch as this said she to remind emily of gods judgments and that line written as even as the rest how was it possible if her wicked heart could suggest such words that her fingers could steadily write them but indeed she verifies the words of the wise man there is no wickedness like the wickedness of a woman  we all long to see sir charles poor emily in particular will be unhappy till he comes  while we expect a favored person though rich in the company of the friends we are with what a diminution does it give to enjoyments that would be complete were it not for that expectation the mind is uneasy not content with itself and always looking out for the person wanted  emily was told that her mother left a letter for her but is advised not to be solicitous to see it till her guardian comes my lord owned to her that he had opened it and pleased tenderness as he justly might in excuse of having taken that liberty she thanked his lordship and said it was for such girls as she to be directed by such good and kind friends  she has just now left me i was writing and wanted to close i gave her a nod with a smile as agreed upon a little before thank you thank you dear madam said she for this freedom she stopped at the door and with it in her hand in a whispering accent bending forwards only tell me that you love me as well as you did in the chariot  indeed my dear i do and better i think if possible because i have been putting part of our conversation upon paper and so have fastened your merits on my memory  god bless you madam i am gone and away she tript  but i will make her amends before i go to rest and confirm all that i said to her in the chariot for most cordially i can  i am my dear lucy and will be  ever yours harriet byron  letter vi mr deane to mrs selby london friday night mar    you wished me my dear mrs selby as i was obliged to go to london on my own affairs to call at colnebrooke and to give you my observations on the state of matters there and whether there were any likelihood of the event we are all so desirous should be brought about and particularly if an opportunity offered that i would at distance sound sir charles himself on the subject i told you that you need not be afraid of my regard to our dear childs delicacy and that she herself should not have reason to mistrust me on this nice subject  it seems his great engagements in town and some he has had in kent have hindered him from giving lord l and his sisters much of his company though our harriet is there which they all extremely regret  i dined at colnebroke lord l is a very worthy and agreeable man lady l and miss grandison are charming women miss jervois is a pretty young lady  but more of her byandby  the cousin grandison you spoke of is gone down to grandisonhall whither sir charles himself thinks shortly of going  but this and other distant matters i refer to our harriets own account  my visit to sir charles is most in my head and i will mention that and give place to other observations afterward  after dinner i pursued my journey to london as my own business was likely to engage me for the whole time i had to stay in town i alighted at his house in st jamess square and was immediately on sending in my name introduced to him  let me stop to say he is indeed a very fine gentleman majesty and sweetness are mingled in every feature of his face and the latter rather than the former predominates in his whole behavior well may harriet love him  i told him that i hoped on my coming to town on particular affairs he would excuse the intrusion of a man who was personally a stranger to him but who had long wished for an opportunity to thank him for the relief he had given to a young lady in whom i claimed an interest that was truly paternal at the same time i congratulated him on the noble manner in which he had extricated himself to the confusion of men whom he had taught to find out and to be ashamed that they were savages  he received my compliments as a man might be supposed to do to whom praise is not a new thing and made me very handsome ones declaring himself acquainted with my character with my connections with your family and with one of the most excellent of young ladies this naturally introduced the praises of our harriet in which he joined in so high and so just a strain that i saw his heart was touched i am sure it is so set yours at rest it must do everything is moving and that not slowly to the event so desirable i led to the graces of her person he to those of her mind he allowed her to be for both one of the most perfect beauties he had ever seen in short mrs selby i am convinced that the important affair will ripen of itself his sisters lord l dr bartlett all avowedly in our lovely girls favor and her merit so extraordinary it must do dont you remember what the old song says  when phoebus does his beams display to tell men gravely that it is day is to suppose them blind all i want methinks is to have them oftener together idleness i believe is a great friend to love i wish his affairs would let him be a little idle they must be dispatched soon be they what they will for lord l said that when he is master of a subject his execution is as swift as thought sir charles hinted that he should soon be obliged to go to france seas are nothing to him dr bartlett said that he considers all nations as joined on the same continent and doubted not but if he had a call he would undertake a journey to constantinople or pekin with as little difficulty as some others would he might have named me for one to the landsend indeed he appears to be just that kind of man yet he seems not to have any of that sort of fire in his constitution that goes off with a bounce and leaves nothing but vapor aod smoke behind it  you are in doubt about our girls fortune it is not a despicable one he may no question have a woman with a much greater and so may she a man  what say you to lady ds proposal rejected for his sake at haphazard too as the saying is but let it once come to that question and leave it to me to answer it  you bid me remark how harriet looks she is as lovely as ever but i think not quite so lively and somewhat paler but it is a clear and healthy not a sickly paleness and there is a languor in her fine eyes that i never saw in them before she never was a pert girl but she has more meekness and humility in her countenance than methinks i would wish her to have because it gives to miss grandison who has fine spirits some advantages in conversation over harriet that if she had methinks she should not take but they perfectly understand one another  but now for a word or two about miss jervois i could not but take notice to our miss byron of the greediness with which she eats and drinks the praises given her guardian of the glow that overspreads her cheeks and of a sigh that nowandthen seems to escape even her own observation when he is spoken of so like a neice of mine that drew herself in and was afterward unhappy and by these symptoms i conclude that this young creature is certainly giving way to love she has a very great fortune is a pretty girl and an improving beauty she is tall and womanly i thought her sixteen or seventeen but it seems she is hardly fourteen there is as much difference in girls as in fruits as to their maturing as i may say my mother i remember once said of an early bloom in a neice of here is that such were born to woe i hope it will not be so with this for she certainly is a good young creature but has not had great opportunities of knowing either the world or herself brought up in a confined manner in her fathers house at leghorn till twelve or thirteen whatopportunities could she have no mothers wings to be sheltered under her mothers wickedness giving occasion the more to streighten her education and at a time of life so young and in so restraining a country as italy for girls and young maidens and since brought over put to board with a retired country gentlewoman  what can she know poor thing she has been but a little while with miss grandison and that but as a guest so that the world before her is all new to her and indeed there seems to be in her pretty wonder and honest declarations of her whole heart a simplicity that sometimes borders upon childishness though at other times a kind of womanly prudence i am not afraid of her on our harriets account and yet harriet loverlike perhaps was alarmed at my hinting it to her but i am on her own i wish as i said before sir charles were more among them he would soon discover whose love is fit to be discountenanced and whose to be encouraged and by that means give ease to twenty hearts for i cannot believe that such a man as this would be guilty i will call it of reserve to such a young lady as ours were he but to have the shadow of a thought that he has an interest in her heart  my affairs are more untoward than i expected but on my return to peterborough i will call at shirleyhouse and selbymanor  and then as i hope to see sir charles again either in london or at colnebrooke i will talk to you of all these matters mean time believe me to be  your affectionate and faithful humble servant thomas deane  letter vii miss byron to miss selby monday march  0 after we had taken leave of one another for the night i tapt at fmilys chamber door which being immediately opened by her maid is it you my dear miss byron said she running to me how good this is  i am come my dear late as it is to pass an agreeable halfhour with you if it will not be unseasonable  that it can never be  you must then let your anne go to bed said i else as her time is not her own i shall shorten my visit i will assit you in any little services myself i have dismissed jenny  god bless you madam said she you consider everybody anne tells me that the servants throughout the house adore you and i am sure their principals do  anne you may go to your rest  jenny who attends me here has more than once hinted to me that miss jervois loves to sit up late either reading or being read to by anne who though she reads well is not fond of the task  servants said i are as sensible as their masters and mistresses they speak to their feelings i question not but they love miss jervois as well as they do me i should as soon choose to take my measures of the goodness of principals by their servants love of them as by any other rule dont you see by the silent veneration and assiduities of the servants of sir charles grandison how much they adore their master  i am very fond of being esteemed by servants said she from that very observation of my guardians goodness and his servants worthiness as well as from what my maid tells me all of them say of you but you and my guardian are so much alike in every thing that you seem to be born for one another  and then she sighed involuntarily yet seemed not to endeavor to restrain or recall her sigh  why sighs my dear young friend why sighs my emily  that is good of you to call me you emily my guardian calls me his emily i am always proud when he calls me so  i dont know why i sigh but i have lately got a trick of sighing i think will it do me harm anne tells me it will and says i must break myself of it she says is is not pretty in a young lady to sigh but where is the unprettiness of it  sighing is said to be a sign of being in love and young ladies   ah madam and yet you sigh very often   i felt myself blush  i often catch myself sighing my dear said i it is a trick as you call it which i would not have you learn  but i have reason for sighing madam which you have not  such a mother a mother that i wanted to be good not so much to me as to herself a mother so unhappy that one must be glad to run away from her my poor papa so good as he was to every body and even to her yet had his heart broken  o madam  flinging her arms about me and hiding her face in my bosom have i not cause to sigh  i wept on her neck i could not help it so dutifully sensible of her calamity and for such a calamity who could forbear  such a disgrace too said she raising her head poor woman  yet she has the worst of it do you think that that is not enough to make one sigh  amiable goodness kissing her cheek i shall love you too well  you are too good to me you must not be so good to me that even that will make me sigh my guardians goodness to me gives me pain and i think verily i sigh more since last i left mrs lane and have seen more of his goodness and how everybody admires and owns obligation to him than i did before  to have a stranger as one may say and so very fine a gentleman to be so good to one and to have such an unhappy mother  who gives him so much trouble  how can one help sighing for both reasons  dear girl said i my heart overflowing with compassion for her you and i are bound equally by the tie of gratitude to esteem him  ah madam you will one day be the happiest of all women  and so you deserve to be  what means my emily  dont i see dont i hear what is designed to be brought about by lord and lady l and miss grandison and dont i hear from my anne what every body expects and wishes for  and does everybody expect and wish my emily   i stopped she went on  and dont i see that my guardian himself loves you  do you think so emily  o how he dwells upon your words when you speak  you fansy so my dear  you have not observed his eyes so much as i have done when he is in your company i have watched your eyes too but have not seen that you mind him quite so much as he does you  indeed he loves you dearly  and then she sighed again  but why that sigh my emily  were i so happy as you think in the esteem of this good man would you envy me my dear  envy you  i such a simple girl as i envy you no indeed why should i envy you  but tell me now dear madam tell me dont you love my guardian  every body does you my emily love him  and so i do but you love him madam with a hope that no one else will have reason to entertain  dear now place a little confidence in your emily my guardian shall never know it from me by the least hint i beg you will own it you cannot think how you will oblige me your confidence in me will give me importance with myself  will you emily be as frankhearted with me as you would have me be with you  indeed i will  i do my dear greatly esteem your guardian  esteem is that the word is that the ladies word for love and is not the word love a pretty word for women i mean no harm by it i am sure  and i am sure you cannot mean harm i will be sincere with my emily but you must not let any one living know what i say to you of this nature i would prefer your guardian my dear to a king in all his glory  and so madam would i if i were you i should be glad to be thought like you in everything  amiable innocence but tell me miss jervois would you not have me esteem your guardian you know he was my guardian too and that at an exigence when i most wanted one  indeed i would would you have me wish such a good young lady as miss byron to be ungrateful no indeed  and again she sighed  why then sighed my emily you said you would be frankhearted  so i will madam but i really cannot tell why i sighed then i wish my guardian to be the happiest man in the world i wish you madam to be the happiest woman and how can either be so but in one another  but i am grieved i believe that there seems to be something in the way of your mutual happiness  i dont know whether that is all neither  i dont know what it is  if i did i would tell you  but i have such throbs sometimes at my heart as make me fetch my breath hard  i dont know what it is  such a weight here as makes me sigh and i have a pleasure i think because i have an ease in sighing  what can it be   go on my dear you are a pretty describer  why now if anybody as anne did last time my guardian came hither was to run up stairs in an hurry and to say miss miss miss your guardian is come i should be in such a flutter my heart would seem to be too big for my bosom i should sit down as much out of breath as if i had ran down an high hill  and for half an hour may be so tremble that i should not be able to see the dear guardian that perhaps i had wanted to see and to hear him with a voice of gentleness as if he pitied me for having so unhappy a mother call me his emily  dont you think he has a sweet voice  and your voice too madam is also so sweet  everybody says that even in your common speech your voice is melody  now anne says   o my agreeable little flatterer  i dont flatter madam dont call me a flatterer i am a very sincere girl indeed i am  i dare say you are but you raise my vanity my dear it is not your fault to tell me what people say of me but it is mine to be proud of their commendations  but you were going to tell me what anne says on your being so much affected when she tolls you in an hurry that your guardian is come  why anne says that all those are signs of love foolish creature  and yet so they may but not of such love as she means  such a love as she as good as owns she had in her days of slutteration as she whimsically calls them which as she explains it were when she was two or three years older than i am in the first place i am very young you know madam a mere girl and such a simple thing  i never had a mother nor sister neither nor a companion of my own sex  mrs lanes daughters what were they  they looked upon me as a child as i was in the next place i do love my guardian that is true but with as much reverence as if he were my father i never had a thought that had not that deep that profound reverence for him as i remember i had for my father  but you had not my dear any of those flutters those throbs that you spoke of on any returns of your father after little absences  why no i cannot say i had nor though i always rejoiced when my guardian came to see me at mrs lanes had i as i remember any such violent emotions as i have had now of late i dont know how it is  can you tell me  do you not lucy both love and pity this sweet girl  my dear emily  these are symptoms i doubt   symptoms of what madam  pray tell me sincerely i will not hide a thought of my heart from you  if encouraged my dear   what then madam   it would be love i doubt  that sort of love that would make you uneasy   no that cannot be surely why madam at that rate i should never dare to stand in your presence upon my word i wish no one in the world but you to be lady grandison i have but one fear   and what is that  that my guardian will not love me so well when he marries as he does now  are you afraid that the woman he marries will endeavor to narrow so large an heart as his  no not if that woman were you  but forgive my folly and she looked down he would not take my hand so kindly as now he does he would not look in my face with pleasure and with pity on my mothers account as he does now he would not call me his emily he would not bespeak ever ones regard for his ward  my dear you are now almost a woman he will if he remain a single man soon draw back into his heart that kindness and love for you which while you are a girl he suffers to dwell upon his lips you must expect this change of behavior soon from his prudence you yourself my love will set him the example you will grow more reserved in your outward behavior than hitherto there was reason to be   o madam never tell me that i should break my heart were i twenty and he did not treat me with the tenderness that he has always treated me with if indeed he find me an incroacher if he find me forward and indiscreet and troublesome then let him call me any bodys emily rather than his  you will have different notions my dear before that time   then i think i shant desire to live to see the time why madam all the comfort i have to set against my unhappiness from my mother is that so good so virtuous and so prudent a man as sir charles grandison calls me his emily and loves me as his child would you madam were you lady grandison now tell me would you grudge me these instances of his favor and affection  indeed my dear i would not if i know my own heart i would not  and would you permit me to live with you  now it is out  will you permit me to live with my guardian and you  this is a question i wanted to put to you but was both ashamed and afraid till you thus kindly emboldened me  indeed i would if your guardian had no objection  that dont satisfy me madam would you be my earnest my sincere advocate and plead for me he would not deny you anything and would you come madam i will put you to it  would you say look you here sir charles grandison this girl this emily is a good sort of girl she has a great fortune snares may be laid for her she has no papa but you she has poor thing i hope you would call me by names of pity to move him no mamma or is more unhappy than if she had none where can you dispose of her so properly as to let her be with us i will be her protectress her friend her mamma yes do madam let me choose a mamma dont let the poor girl be without a mamma if you can give her one i am sure i will study to give you pleasure and not pain  i insist upon it sir charles it will make the poor girls heart easy she is told of the arts and tricks of men where girls have great fortunes and she is always in dread about them and about her unhappy mother who will form plots against her if she is with us  dear dear madam you are moved in my favor  who could have forborne being affected by her tender prattle and she threw her arms about me i see you are moved in my favor  and i will be your attendant i will be your waitingmaid i will help to adorn you and to make you more and more lovely in the eyes of my guardian  i could not bear this  no more no more my lovely girl my innocent my generous my irresistible girl  were it come to that it became me to be unreserved for more reasons than one to this sweet child  not one request should my emily make that heart and mind i would not comply with not one wish that i would not endeavor to promote and accomplish for her  i folded her to my heart as she hung about my neck  i grieve you  i would not for the world grieve my young mamma said she  henceforth let me call you my mamma  mamma as i have heard the word explained is a more tender name even than mother  the unhappy mrs jervois shall be mrs ohara if she pleases and only mother a child must not renounce her mother though the mother should renounce or worse than renounce her child  i must leave you emily  say then my emily  i must leave you my and more than my emily  you have cured me of sleepiness for this night  o then i am sorry   no dont be sorry you have given me pain it is true but i think it is the sweetest pain that ever entered into an human heart such goodness such innocence such generosity  i thank god my love that there is in my knowledge so worthy a young heart as yours  now how good this is and again she wrapped her arms about me and will you go  i must i must my dear  i can stay no longer  but take this assurance that my emily shall have a first place in my heart for ever i will study to promote your happiness and your wishes shall be the leaders of mine  then i am sure i shall live with my guardian and you for ever as i may say and god grant and down on her knees she dropped with her arms wrapped about mine that you may be the happiest of women and that scon for my sake as well as your own in marriage with the best of men  my guardian exultingly said she and say amen  do god bless you madam say amen to my prayer  i struggled from her  o my sweet girl i cannot bear you  i hastened out at the door to go to my chamber  you are not angry madam following me and taking my hand and kissing it with eagerness say you are not displeased with me i will not leave you till you do  angry my love who can be angry how you have distressed me by your sweet goodness of heart  thank god i have not offended you and now say once more my emily  say good rest to you my emily  my love  and all those tender names  and say god bless you my child as if you were my mamma and i will leave you and i shall in fancy go to sleep with angels  angels only are fit company for my emily  god bless my emily good night be your slumbers happy  and i kissed her once twice thrice with fervor and away she tript but stopped at the door courtesying low as i delighted yet painfully delighted looked after her  ruminating in my retirement on all the dear girl had said and on what might be my fate so many different thoughts came into my head that i could not close my eyes i therefore arose before day and while my thoughts were agitated with the affecting subject had recourse to my pen  do my lucy and do you my grandmamma my aunt my uncle more than give me leave bid me command me if it shall be proposed to bring down with me my emily and yet she shall not come if you dont all promise to love her as well as you do  your for ever obliged harriet byron  letter viii miss byron to miss selby monday mar  0 the active the restless goodness of this sir charles grandison absolutely dazles me lucy  the good dr bartlett has obliged us all with the sight of two letters which give an account of what he has done for lord w his uncle he has been more than a father to his uncle does not that sound strange but he is to be the obliger of everybody  the doctor said that since miss grandison had claimed the benefit of her brothers permission for him to use his own discretion in communicating to us such of the letters as he was favored with by sir charles he believed he could not more unexceptionably oblige lord l and the sisters than by reading to them those two letters as they were a kind of family subject  after the doctor had done reading he withdrew to his closet i stole up after him and obtained his leave to transmit them to you  lucy be chary of them and return them when perused  there is no such thing as pointing out particular passages of generosity justice prudence disinterestedness beneficence that strike one in those letters without transcribing every paragraph in them and ah lucy there are other observations to be made mortifying ones i fear  only let me say that i think if sir charles grandison could and would tender himself to my acceptance i ought to decline his hand do you think if i were his i should not live in continual dread of a separation from him even by that inevitable stroke which alone could be the means of completing his existence  this is the man ye modest ye tenderhearted fair ones whom ye should seek to entitle to your vows not the lewd the obscene libertine soul harpy son of riot and of erebus glorying in his wickedness triumphing in your weakness and seeking by storm to win an heart that ought to shrink at his approach shall not like cleave to like  henceforth may it be so wishes  your harriet byron  letter ix sir charles grandison to dr bartlett sat night mar    as soon as i had seen mrs jervois to her chair i went to attend lord w  he received me with great expressions of esteem and affection  he commanded his attendants to withdraw and told me taking my hand that my character rose upon him from every mouth he was in love with me he said i was my mothers son  he commended me for my economy and complimented into generosity the justice i had done to some of my friends  i frankly own said he that at your first arrival and even till now that i am determined to be the man you cousin would wish me to be i had thought it but prudent to hold back for i imagined that your father had lived at such a rate that you would have applied to me to extricate you from difficulties and particularly for money to marry your elder sister at least i took notice young man proceeded he and i heard others observe that you had not eyes to see any of your fathers faults either when he was living or departed and this gave me reason to apprehend that you had your fathers extravagant turn and i was resolved if i were applied to to wrap myself close about in a general denial else all i had been gathering together for so many years past might soon have been dissipated and i should only have taken a thorn out of the foot of another and put it into my own  and then he threw out some disagreeable reflections on my fathers spirit  to those i answered that every man had a right to judge for himself in those articles for which he himself only is accountable my father and your lordship continued i had very different ways of thinking magnificence was his taste prudence so your lordship must account it is yours there are people in the world who would give different names to both tastes but would not your lordship think it very presumptuous in any man to arraign you at the bar of his judgment as mistaken in the measures of your prudence  look you ne hew i dont well know what to make of your speech but i judge that you mean not to affront me  i do not my lord while you was apprehensive that you might be a sufferer by me you acted with your usual prudence to discourage an application my father had in your lordships judgment but one fault and he was the principal sufferer by it himself had he looked into his affairs he would have avoided the necessity of doing several things that were disagreeable to him and must ever be to a man of spirit his very timber that required as i may say the ax would have furnished him with all he wanted and he paid interest for a less sum of money than actually was in the hands of his stewards unaccounted for  but what a glory to you cousin   no compliment to me my lord i pray you to the discredit of my fathers memory he had a right to do what he did your lordship does what you think fit i too now i am my own master do as i please my taste is different from both i pursue mine as he did his if i should happen to be more right than my father in some things he might have the advantage of me in others and in those i happen to do that are generally thought laudable what merit have i since all this time directed by a natural bias i am pursuing my own predominant passion and that perhaps with as much ardour and as little power to resist it as my father had to restrain his  bravo bravo said my lord  let me ask you nephew  may all young men if they will improve by traveling as you have done  if they may by my troth nine parts in ten of those who go abroad ought to be hanged up at their fathers doors on their return  very severe my lord but thinking minds will be thoughtful whether abroad or at home unthinking ones call for our pity  well sir i do assure you that i am proud of my nephew whatever you are of your uncle and there are two or three things that i want to talk to you about and one or two that i would consult you upon  he rang and asked what time dinner would be ready  in half an hour was the answer  mrs gissard came in her face glowed with passion my lord seemed affected at her entrance it was easy to see that they were upon ill terms with each other and that my lord was more afraid of her than she was of him  she endeavored to assume a complaisant air to me but it was so visibly struggled for that it sat very aukwardly on her countenance and her lips trembled when she broke silence to ask officiously as she did after the health of my sister charlotte  i would be alone with my nephew said my lord in a passionate tone  you shall be alone my lord impertinently replied she with an air that looked as if they had quarrelled more then once before and that she had made it up on her own terms she pulled the door after her with a rudeness that he only could take and deserve who was conscious of having degraded himself  foolish woman why came she in when i was there except to show her supposed consequence at the expense of his honor she knew what my opinion was of her she would by a third hand once have made overtures to me of her interest with my lord but i should have thought meanly of myself had i not with disdain rejected the tender of her services  a damned woman said my lord but looked fist as if he would be sure she was out of hearing  this woman nephew and her behavior is one of the subjects i wanted to consult you upon  defer this subject my lord till you have recovered your temper you did not design to begin with it you are discomposed  and so i am and he puffed and panted as if out of breath  i asked him some indifferent questions to have followed him upon the subject at that time whatever resolutions he had taken they would probably have gone off when the passion to which they would have owed their vigor had subsided  when he had answered them his color and his wrath went down together  he then ran out into my praises again and particularly for my behavior to mrs oldham who he said lived now very happily and very exemplarily and never opened her lips when she was led to mention me but with blessings heaped upon me  that woman my lord said i was once good a recovery where a person is not totally abandoned is more to be hoped for than the reformation of one who never was wellprincipled all that is wished for in the latter is that she may be made unhurtful her highest good was never more then harmlessness she that was once good cannot be easy when she is in a true state of penitence till she is restored to that from which she was induced to depart  you understand these matters cousin i dont but if you will favor me with more of your company i shall i believe be the better for your notions but i must talk about this woman nephew i am calm now i must talk of this woman now  i am resolved to part with her i can bear her no longer did you n mind how she pulled the door after her though you were present  i did my lord but it was plain that something disagreeable had passed before or she could not so entirely have forgot herself but my lord we will postpone this subject if you please if you yourself lead to it after dinner i will attend to it with all my heart  well then be it so but now tell me have you nephew any thoughts of marriage  i have great honor for the state an hope to be one day happy in it  well said  and are you at liberty kinsman to receive a proposal of that nature  and then without waiting for my answer he proposed lady frances n and said he had been spoken to on that subject  i answered that the lady was very deserving but that i should think myself under too great obligations to a wife for my own ease if there were a woman in the world whom i could prefer to her  well what think you of lady anne s i am told that she is likely to be the lady she has a noble fortune your sisters i hear are friends to lady anne  my sisters wish me happily married i have such an opinion of both those ladies that it would give me some little pain to imagine each would not in her turn refuse me were i offered to her as i cannot myself make the offer i cannot bear my lord to think of returning slight for respect to my own sex but as to ladies how can we expect that delicacy and dignity from them which are the bulwarks of their virtue if we do not treat them with dignity  charming notions if you had them not abroad you had them from your mother she was all that was excellent in woman  indeed she was excellent woman she was always before my eyes  and excellent kinsman too now i know your reverence for your mother i will allow of all you say of your father because i see it is all from principle i have known some men who have spoken with reverence of their mothers to give themselves dignity that is to say for bringing creatures so important as themselves into the world and who have exacted respect to the good old women who were merely good old women as we call them in order to take the incense offered the parent into their own nostrils this was duty in parade  the observation my good dr barlett i thought above my lord w i think i have heard one like it made by my father who saw very far into men but was sometimes led by his wit into saying a severe thing and yet whenever i hear a man praised highly for the performance of common duties as for being a good husband a good son or a kind father though each is comparatively praiseworthy i conclude that there is nothing extraordinary to be said of him to call a man a good friend is indeed comprizing all the duties in one word for friendship is the balm as well as seasoning of life and a man cannot be defective in any of the social duties who is capable of it when the term is rightly understood  well cousin since you cannot think of either of those ladies how should you like the rich and beautiful countess of r you know what an excellent character she bears  i do but my lord i should not choose to marry a widow and yet generally i do not disrespect widows nor imagine those men to blame who marry them but as my circumstances are not unhappy and as riches will never be my principal inducement in the choice of a wife i may be allowed to indulge my peculiarities especially as i shall hope and i should not deserve a good wife if i did not that when once married i shall be married for my whole life  the countess once declared said my lord before half a score in company two of them her particular admirers that she never would marry any man in the world except he were just such another in mind and manners as sir charles grandison  ladies my lord who in absence speak favorably of a man that forms not pretensions upon them nor is likely to be troublesome to them would soon convince that man of his mistake were his presumption to rise upon their declared good opinions  i wonder proceeded my lord that every young man is not good i have heard you cousin praised in all the circles where you have been mentioned it was certainly an advantage to you to come back to us a stranger as i may say many youthful follies may perhaps be overpassed that we shall never know anything of but be that as it will i can tell you sir that i have heard such praises of you as have made my eyes glisten because of my relation to you i was told within this month past that no fewer than five ladies out of one circle declared that they would stand out by consent and let you pick and choose a wife from among them  what your lordship has heard of this nature let me say without affecting to disclaim a compliment apparently too high for my merits is much more to the honor of the one sex than of the other i should be glad that policy if not principle principle might take root and grow from it would mend us men  so should i nephew but i poor man he hung down his head have not been a better man than i ought to be do you not despise me in your heart cousin  you must have heard  that cursed woman  but i begin to repent and the truly good i believe cannot be either censorious or uncharitable tell me however do you not despise me  despise my mothers brother no my lord yet were a sovereign to warrant my freedom and there was a likelihood that he would be the better for it i would with decency tell him my whole mind i am sorry to say it but your lordship if you have not had virtue to make you worthy of being imitated has too many examples among the great as well as among the middling to cause you to be censured for singularity but your lordship adds to a confession that is not an ungenerous one that you begin to repent  indeed i do and your character cousin has made me halfashamed of myself  i am not accustomed my lord to harangue on these subjects to men who know their duty but let me say that your lordships good resolutions to be efficacious must be built upon a better foundation than occasional disgust or disobligation but here again we are verging to a subject that we are both agreed to defer till after dinner  i am charmed with your treatment of me cousin i shall for my own sake adore my sisters son had i consulted my chaplain who is a good man too he would have too roughly treated me  divines my lord must do their duty  he then introduced the affair between sir hargrave pollexfen and me of which i found he was more particularly informed than i could have imagined and after he had launched out upon that and upon my refusal of a duel he by a transition that was very natural mentioned the rescued lady as he called her i have heard cousin said he that she is the most beautiful woman in england  i think her so my lord replied i and she has one excellence that i never before met with in a beauty she is not proud of it  i then gave my opinion of miss byron in such terms as made my lord challenge me as my sisters once did on the warmth of my description and praises of her  and does your lordship think that i cannot do justice to the merits of such a lady as miss byron but with an interested view i do assure you that what i have said is short of what i think of her but i can praise a lady without meaning a compliment to myself i look upon it however as one of the most fortunate accidents of my life that i have been able to serve her and save her from a forced marriage with a man whom she disliked and who could not deserve her there is hardly anything gives me more pain than when i see a worthy woman very unequally yoked if her own choice has not been at first consulted and who yet though deeply sensible of her misfortune irreproachably supports her part of the yoke  you are a great friend to the sex kinsman  i am i think the man who is not must have fallen into bad company and deserves not to have been favored with better yet to unwomanly faults to want of morals and even to want of delicacy no man is more quicksighted  i dont know how it is but i have not at this rate fallen into the best company but perhaps it is for want of that delicacy in my own mind which you are speaking of  were we men my lord to value women and to let it be known that we do for those qualities which are principally valuable in the sex the less estimable if they would not be reformed would shrink out of our company into company more suitable to their taste and we should never want objects worthy of our knowledge and even of our admiration to associate with there is a kind of magnetism in goodness bad people will indeed find out bad people and confederate with them in order to keep one another in countenance but they are bound together by a rope of sand while trust confidence love sympathy and a reciprocation of beneficent actions twist a cord which ties good men to good men and cannot be easily broken  i have never had these notions cousin and yet they are good ones i took people as i found them and to own the truth meaning to serve myself rather than anybody else i never took pains to look out for worthy attachments the people i had to do with had the same views upon me as i had upon them and thus i went on in a state of hostility with all men mistrusting and guarding as well as i could and not doubting that every man i had to do with would impose upon me if i placed a confidence in him but as to this miss byron nephew i shall never rest till i see her  pray what is her fortune they tell me it is not above   000 l  what is that to the offers you have had made you  just then we were told dinner was on the table  i am wishing for an inclination to rest but it flies me the last letter from beauchamp dated from bologna as well as those from the bishop afflict me why have i such a feeling heart were the unhappy situation of affairs there owing to my own enterprizing spirit i should deserve the pain it gives me but i should be too happy had i not these withoutdoor perplexities as i may call them to torment me thank god that they arise not from within though they make themselves too easy a passage to my heart  my paper is written out if i am likely to find a drowsy moment i shall welcome its approach if not i will rise and continue my subject  letter x sir charles grandison to dr bartlett sunday mar    i have had two happy hours of forgetfulness i could not though i tried for it prevail for more and i will continue my subject  after dinner every attendant being dismissed my lord making me first see that nobody was listening n the passages began as follows  i am determined nephew to part with this giffard she is the plague of my life i would have done it half a year ago on an occasion that i will not mention to you because you would despise me if i did for my weakness and now she wants to bring in upon me a sister of hers and her husband and to part with two other worthy folks that i know love me but of whom for that reason she is jealous and then they would divide me among them for this man and his wife have six children all of whom of late make an appearance that cannot be honestly supported  and have you any difficulty my lord in parting with her but what arises from your own want of resolution  the most insolent devil that ever was about a man at one time and the most whining at another dont despise me nephew you know i have taken her as  you know what i mean   i understand you my lord  but say you dont despise me sir charles grandison as i hope to live i am half afraid of you  my pity my lord where i see compunction is stronger than my censure  that is well said  now i agreed with this woman in a weak moment and she has held me to it to give her an annuity of   0 l for life which was to be made up   0 l if i parted with her without her consent and here we have been for several months plaguing one another whether i shall turn her out of the house or she will leave me for she has told me that she will not stay unless i take in her sister and brother yet will not go because she will then have no more than the   0 l a year and that is too much for her deserts for these two years past  your lordship sees the inconveniences of this way of life and i need not mention to you how much happier that state is which binds a man and woman together by interest as well as by affection if discretion be not forgotten in the choice but let me express my surprise that your lordship who has so ample an estate and no child should seem to value your peace of mind at so low a rate as  00 l a year  i will not let her go away with such a triumph she has not deserved from me   pray my lord was she of reputation when you took her  she was a widow   but was her character tolerable in the eye of the world she might be a greater object of pity for being a widow  my gouty disorders made me want a woman about me i hated menfellows   well my lord this regards your motive but have you any previous or later incontinence to charge her with  i cannot say i have her cursed temper would frighten rather than invite lovers i heard it was no good one but it broke not out to me till within these two years  your lordship surely must not dispute the matter with her if you are determined to part with her give her the   0 l a year and let her go  to reward a cursed woman for misbehaviour  i cannot do it  give me leave to say that your lordship has deserved some punishment give her the annuity not as a reward to her but as a punishment to yourself  you hurt my sore place nephew  consider my lord that   0 l a year for life or even for ever is a poor price for the reputation of a woman with whom a man of your quality and fortune condescended to enter into treaty every quarterly payment must strike her to the heart if she live to have compunction seize her when she thinks that she is receiving for subsistence the wages of her shame be that her punishment you intimate that she has so behaved herself that she has but few friends part with her without giving her cause of complaint that may engage pity for her if not friends at your expense a woman who has lost her reputation will not be regardful of yours suppose she sue you for nonperformance of covenants would your lordship appear to such a prosecution you cannot be capable of pleading your privilege on such a prosecution as would otherwise go against you you cannot be in earnest to part with this woman she cannot have offended you beyond forgiveness if you scruple  00 l a year to get rid of her  he servently swore that he was in earnest and added i am resolved nephew to marry and live honest  he looked at me as if he expected that i should be surprised  i believe i could not change countenance on such an hint as this you have come to a good resolution my lord and if you marry a prudent woman your lordship will find the difference in your own reflections as well as in your reputation and interest and shall the difference of  00 l a year  dont let me say that i am ashamed for my lord w  i knew that you would despise me sir charles  i know my lord that i should despise myself were i not to deal freely with you in this respect indeed my lord you have not had so good reason forgive me to think hardly of my fathers spirit as you had to correct your own  i cannot bear this nephew he looked displeased  you must not be angry my lord i will not bear anger from any man breathing and keep him company who consulting me shall be displeased with me for speaking my mind with freedom and sincerity  what a man am i talking to  well rid me of this torment you have spirit nephew and nobody can reproach you with acting contrary to your own principles and i will for ever love you but talk to her i hardly dare she whimpers and sobs and threatens by turns and i cannot bear it  once she was going to tie herself up  would to god i had not prevented her  and then o my folly we went on again  my good dr bartlett i was ashamed of my uncle but you see what an artful as well as insolent woman this is what solly is there in wickedness folly encounters with folly or how could it succeed so often as it does  yet my mothers brother to wish he had suffered a creature with whom he had been familiar to destroy herself  i could hardly bear him only that i thought it would be serving both wretches and giving both a chance for repentance or i should not have kept my seat  but we see in my mother and in her brother how habitual wickedness debases and how habitual goodness exalts the human mind in their youth they were supposed nearer an equality in their understandings and seize than in their maturity when occasion called out into action their respective talents but perhaps the brother was not the better man for the uninterrupted prosperity that attended him and for having never met with check or control whereas the most happily married woman in the world must have a will to which she must sometimes resign her own what a glory to a good woman must it be who can not only resign her will but make so happy an use of her resignation as my mother did  my lord repeated his request that i would talk with the woman and that directly  i withdrew and sent for her accordingly  she came to me out of breath with passion and as i thought partly with apprehension for what her own behavior might be before me  i see mrs giffard said i that you are in great emotion i am desired to talk with you a task i am not very fond of but you will find nothing but civility such as is due to you for your sexs sake from me calm therefore your mind i will see you again in a few moments  i took a turn and soon came back her face looked not quite so bloated and she burst into tears she began to make a merit of her services her care her honesty and then inveighed against my lord for the narrowness of his spirit she paid some compliments to me and talked of being ashamed to appear before me as a guilty creature introductory to what she was prepared to say of her sacrifices the loss of her good name and the like on which with respect to my lord and his ingratitude to her as she called it she laid great stress  i am never displeased my dear friend with the testimony which the most profligate women bear to the honor of virtue when they come to set a value upon their departure from it  you have it not to say mrs giffard that my lord betrayed seduced or deceived you i say not this so much for reproach as for justicesake and not to suffer you to deceive yourself and to load him with greater faults than he has been guilty of you were your own mistress you had no father mother husband to question you or to be offended with you you knew your duty you were treated with as a sole and independent person one hundred and fifty pounds a year mrs giffard though a small price for the virtue of a good woman which is indeed above all price is nevertheless greatly above the price of common service i never seek to palliate faults of a flagrant nature though it is not my meaning to assront a woman especially and one who supposes herself in distress you must know madam the frail tenure by which you are likely to hold you stipulated therefore for a provision accordingly the woman who never hoped to be a wife can have no hardships to take the stipulation and once more give herself the opportunity to recover her lost fame this independence my lord is desirous to give you   what independence sir  one hundred and fifty   two hundred and fifty sir if you please  if my lord thinks fit to dismiss me  my lord has told me that that was indeed the stipulation but he pleads misbehaviour  i was willing to make a little difficulty of the  00 l a year though i thought my lord ought not  and as to misbehaviour dr bartlett i hardly know how to punish a woman for that to her keeper does she not first misbehave to herself and to the laws of god and man and ought a man that brings her to violate her first duties to expect from her a regard to a mere discretionary obligation i would have all these moralists as they affect to call themselves suffer by such libertine principles as cannot be pursued but in violation of the very first laws of morality  misbehaviour sir he makes this plea to cover his own baseness of heart i never misbehaved as he calls it till i saw   well madam this may lead to a debate that can answer no end i presume you are as willing to leave my lord as he is to part with you it must be a wretchedness beyond what i can well imagine to live a life of guilt i must not palliate in this case and yet of hatred and animosity with the person who is a partaker in that guilt  i am put upon a very unequal task sir to talk with you on this subject my lord will not refuse to see me i hope i know what to say to him  he has requested me to talk with you madam as i told you i am not fond of the task we have all our faults god knows what he will pardon and what he will punish his pardon however in a great measure depends upon yourself you have health and time to all appearance before you your future life may be a life of penitence i am no divine madam i would not be thought to preach to you but you have now a prospect opened of future happiness through your mutual misunderstandings that you never otherwise might have had and let me make an observation to you that where hate or dislike have once taken place of liking the first separation in such a case as this is always the best affection or esteem between man and woman once forfeited hardly ever is recovered tell me truth  dont you as heartily dislike my lord as he does you  i do sir  he is   i will not hear what he is from the mouth of declared prejudice he has his faults one great fault is that which you have been joint partakers in  but if you might would you choose to live together to be torments to each other  i can torment him more than he can me   diabolical temper  woman and i stood up and looked sternly can you forget to whom you say this  and of whom  is not lord w my uncle  this as i intended it should startled hershe asked my pardon  what a fine hand proceeded i has a peer of the realm made of it to have this said of him and perhaps had you been in his presence to him by a woman whose courage is founded in his weakness  let me tell you madam   she held up her clasped hands  for gods sake forgive me sir and stand my friend  an hundred and fifty pounds a year madam is rich payment for any consideration that a woman could give who has more spirit than virtue had you kept that madam you would though the daughter of cottagers have been superior to the greatestman on earth who wanted to corrupt you  but thus far and as a punishment to my lord for his wilful weakness i will be your friend  retire from my lord you shall have   0 l a year and as you were not brought up to the expectation of one half of the fortune bestow the hundred a year that was in debate upon young creatures of your sex as an encouragement to them to preserve that chastity which you with your eyes open gave up and with the rest live a life suitable to that disposition and then as my fellow creature i will wish you happy  she begged leave to withdraw she could not she said stand in my presence i had indeed spoken with warmth she withdrew trembling courtesying mortified and i returned to my lord  he was very earnest to hear my report i again put it to him whether he adhered to his resolution of parting with his woman he declared in the affirmative with greater earnestness than before and begged to know if i could manage it that she should go and that without seeing him i cannot bear to see her said he  bravoes of the law cowards and cullies to their paramours are these keepers generally i have ever suspected the courage to magnanimity they must be strangers of men who can desy the laws of society i pitied him and believing that it would not be difficult to manage this heroine who had made her weak lord afraid of her i said have you a mind my lord that she shall quit the house this night and before i leave it if you have i think i can undertake that she shall  and can you do this for me if you can you shall be my great apollo that will indeed make me happy for the moment you are gone she will force herself into my presence and will throw the gout perhaps into my stomach she reproaches me as if she had been an innocent woman and i the most ungrateful of men for gods sake nephew release me from her and i shall be happy i would have left her behind me in the country proceeded he but she would come with me she was afraid that i would appeal to you she stands in awe of nobody else you will be my guardian angel if you will rid me of this plague  well then my lord you will leave it to me to do the best i can with her but it cannot be the best on your side for your honors sake if we do her not that justice that the law would or ought to do her in a word my lord you must forgive me for saying that you shall not resume that dignity to distress this woman which you laid aside when you entered into treaty with her  well well i refer myself to your management only this  00 l a year  once again i say it would hurt me to reward a woman for plaguing me and   0 l a year is twothirds more than ever she or any of her family were entitled to  the worst and meanest are entitled to justice my lord and i hope your lordship will not refuse to perform engagements that you entered into with your eyes open you must not if i take any concern in this affair  just then the woman sent in to beg the favor of an audience as she called it of me  she addressed me in terms above her education there is something said she in your countenance sir so terrible and yet so sweet that one must fear your anger and yet hope for your forgiveness when one has offended i was too free in speaking of my lord to his nephew  and then she made a compliment to my character and told me she would be determined by my pleasure be it what it would  how seldom are violent spirits true spirits when overawed how tame are they generally in their submission yet this woman was not without art in hers she saw that displeased as she apprehended i was with her i had given her hopes of the payment of the hundred pounds a year penalty and this made her so acquiescent  i was indeed displeased with you mrs giffard and could not from what you said but conclude in your disfavour in justification of my lords complaints against you  will you give me leave sir to lay before you the true state of everything between my lord and me indeed sir you dont know   when two persons who have lived in familiarity differ the fault is seldom wholly on one side but thus far i judge between you and desire not to hear particulars the man who dispenses with a known duty in such a case as this before us must render himself despicable in the eyes of the very person whom he raises into consequence by sinking his own chastity is the crown and glory of a woman the most profligate of men love modesty in the sex at the very time they are forming plots to destroy it in a particular object when a woman has submitted to put a price upon her honor she must appear at times despicable in the eyes even of her seducer and when these two break out into animosity ought either to wish to live with the other  indeed indeed sir i am struck with remorse i see my error and she put her handkerchief to her eyes and seemed to weep  i proceeded you mrs giffard doubted the continuance of my lords passion you made your terms therefore and proposed a penalty besides my lord submitted to the terms and by that means secured his right of dismissing you at his pleasure the only convenience that a man dishonouring himself by despising marriage can think he has between him and you what remains to be said though you are both answerable at a tribunal higher than your own but that you should have separated long ago yet you would not consent to it you would not leave him at liberty to assert the right he had reserved to himself strange weakness in him that he would suffer that to depend upon you but one weakness is the parent of another  she then visibly wept  you found it out that you could torment your lord in an higher degree than he could torment you and how acting upon such principles you have lived together for some time past you have let every one see  she on her knees besought my pardon for the freedom of that expression not from motives of contrition as i apprehend but from those of policy  she was strong enough to raise herself without my assistance she did unbidden on seeing me step backward a pace or two to give her an opportunity to do so and looked very silly and the more for having missed my assisting hand by which i supposed that she had usually better success with my lord whenever she had prevailed on herself to kneel to him  it is easy my good dr bartlett from small crevices to discover day in an artful womans heart nothing can be weaker in the eye of an observer who himself disdains artifice than a woman who makes artifice her study in such a departure from honest nature there will be such curvings that the eyes the countenance must ever betray the heart while the lips either breaking out into apologies or aiming at reserve confirm the suspicion that all is not right in the mind  i excuse you mrs giffard said i my lord has deservedly brought much of what has distressed him upon himself but now it is best for you to part my lord chooses not to see you i would advise you to remove this very afternoon  what sir and not have my   0 l a year  will you leave the house this night if i give you my word   for the whole sum sir  two hundred and fifty pounds a year sir  yes for the whole sum  i will sir with all my heart and soul most of my things are in the conntry my lord came up in a passion to talk with you sir two or three bandboxes are all i have here mr halden he is my lords favorite shall go down and see i take nothing but my own  i will trust to your word of honor sir  and leave for ever the most ungrateful   hush mrs giffard these tears are tears of passion there is not a female feature at this instant in your face  what a command of countenance it cleared up in a moment i expected it from her a penitent spirit is an humble a broken spirit you show at present no sign of it  she dropped me a courtesy with such an air though not designed i believe as showed that the benefit she was to reap from the advice would not be sudden if ever and immediately repeated her question if she had my honor for the payment of the entire sum  and you dont insist sir i have poor relations that i shall pay out the hundred a year as you mentioned  you are to do with the whole annuity as you please if your relations are worthy you cannot do better than to relieve their necessities but remember mrs giffard that every quarter brings you the wages of iniquity and endeavor at some atonement  the woman could too well bear this severity  had a finger been sufficient to have made her feel i would not have laid upon her the weight of my whole hand  she assured me that she would leave the house in two hours time and i returned to my lord and told him so  he got up and embraced me and called me his good angel i advised him to give his orders to halden or to whom he thought sit to do her and himself justice as to what belonged to her in the country  but the terms the terms cried my lord if you have brought me off for   0 l i will adore you  these are the terms you promised to leave them to me you pay no more than   0 l a year for her life till you assure me upon your honor that you cheerfully and on mature consideration make it up   0 l  how is that how is that nephew  then i never shall pay more depend upon it  nor will i ever ask you  he rubbed his hands forgetting the gout but was remembered by the pain and cried oh   but how did you manage it kinsman  i never should have brought her to anything how did you manage it  your lordship does not repent her going  he swore that it was the happiest event that could have befallen him i hope said he she will go without wishing to see me whether she would whine or curse it would be impossible for me to see her and be myself  i believe she will go without desiring to see you perhaps while i am here  thank god a fair riddance thank god  but is it possible kinsman that you could bring me off for   0 l a year tell me truly  it is and i tell your lordship that it shall cost you no more till you shall know how to value the comfort and happiness of your future life at more than  00 l a year till then the respect i pay to my mothers brother and the regard i have for his honor will make me cheerfully pay the  00 l a year in dispute out of my own pocket  he looked around him his head turning as if on a pivot and at last bursting out into tears and speech together  and is it thus is it thus you subdue me is it thus you convince me of my shameful littleness i cannot bear it all that this woman has done to me is nothing to this i can neither leave you nor stay in your presence leave me leave me for six minutes only  jesus how shall i bear my own littleness  i arose one word only my lord when i reenter say not a syllable more on this subject let it pass as i put it i would part with a greater sum than an hundred a year for the satisfaction of giving to my uncle the tranquillity he has so long wanted in his own house rather than that a person who has had a dependence upon him should think herself entitled to complain of injustice from him  he caught my hand and would have met it with his lips i withdrew it hastily and retired leaving him to recollect himself  when i returned he thrust into my hand a paper and held it there and swore that i should take it if the wretch live ten years nephew said she that will reimburse you if she die sooner the difference is yours and for gods sake for the sake of your mothers memory dont despise me that is all the favor i ask you no man on earth was ever so nobly overcome by all that is good you shall chalk me out my path blessed be my sisters memory for giving me such a kinsman the name of grandison that i ever disliked till now is the first of names and may it be perpetuated to the end of time  he held the paper in my hand till he had done speaking i then opened it and found it to be a bank note of  000 l i was earnest to return it but he swore so vehemently that he would have it so that i at last acquiesced but declared that i would pay the whole annuity as far as the sum went and this as well in justice to him as to save him the pain of attending to an affair that must be grievous to him and i insisted upon giving him an acknowlegement under my hand for that sum and to be accountable to him for it as his banker would in the like case  and thus ended this affair the woman went away before me she begged the favor at the door of one word with me my lord started up at her voice his complexion varied he whipped as nimbly behind the door as if he had no gout in his foot i will not see her said he  i stepped out she complimented thanked me and wept but in the height of her concern would have uttered bitter things against my lord but i stopped her mouth by telling her that i was to be her paymaster quarterly of the   0 l a year she turned her execrations against her lord into blessings on me but after all departed with reluctance  pride and not tenderness was visibly the occasion could she have secured her whole annuity she would have gratified that pride by leaving her lord in triumph while she thought her departure would have given him regret but to be dismissed was a disgrace that affected her and gave bitterness to her insolent spirit  letter xi sir charles grandison to dr bartlett in continuation my lord though he had acquitted himself on the occasion in such a manner as darted into my mind a little ray of my beloved mothers spirit could not forbear giving way to his habitual littleness when he was assured giffard was out of the house he called halden to him who entered with joy in his countenance arising as it came out from the same occasion and ordered him to make all his domestics happy for what he meanly called his deliverance asking if there were anybody in the house who loved her not a single soul said halden and i am sure that i may venture to congratulate your lordship in the names of all your servants for she was proud imperious and indeed a tyranness to all beneath her  i then for the first time pitied the woman and should have pitied her still more true as this might in some measure be had she not gone away so amply rewarded for in this little family i looked forward to the family of the state the sovereign and his ministers how often has a minister who has made a tyrannical use of his power and even some who have not experienced on his dismission the like treatment from those who had they had his power would perhaps have made as bad use of it who in its plenitude were sawning creeping slaves as these servants might be to this mistress of their lord we read but of one grateful cromwell in all the superb train of wolsey when he had fallen into disgrace and yet he had in it hundreds some not ignobly born and all of them less meanly descended than their magnificent master  halden addressed himself to me as having been the means of making his lord and his whole household happy let the joy be moderate halden said i the poor woman might possibly have numbered among her wellwishers she could not have disobliged every body some of those who now will be most forward to load her with obloquy you must not make her too considerable it is best for my lord as well as for those who loved her not to forget there ever was such a woman except to avoid her faults and to imitate her in what was commendable she boasts of her honesty and management my lord charges her not with infidelity of any kind  halden bowed and withdrew  my lord swore by his soul that i had not my good name for nothing blessed said he be the name of the grandisons this last plaudit gratified my pride i need not tell my dr bartlett that i have pride the more gratified it as lord ws animosity to my father made him out of love with his name  i did not think when my lord began his story to me that i should so soon have brought about a separation of guilt from guilt but their matual disgusts had prepared the way resentment and pride mingled with avarice on one side and selfinterestedness founded reasonably on a stipulation made and not complied with on the other were all that hindered it from taking place as from themselves a mediator had nothing then to do but to advise an act of justice and so to gild it by a precedent of disinterestedness in himself as should inspire an emulation in a proud spirit that if not then must when passion had subsided have arisen to make all end as it ought  when i found my lords joy a little moderated i drew my chair near him well my lord and now as to your hints of marriage   blessed god  why nephew you overturn me with your generosity are you not my next of kin and can you give your consent were i to ask it that i should marry  i give you not only my consent as you condescendingly phrase it but my advice to marry  good god i could not in the like case do thus but nephew i am not a young man  the more need of a prudent a discreet a tender assistant your lordship hinted that you liked not menservants about your person in your illness you are often indisposed with the gout servants will not always be servants when they find themselves of use infirmity requires indulgence in the very nature of the word and thing indulgence cannot exist with servility between man and wife it may the same interest unites them mutual confidence who can enough value the joy the tranquillity at least that results from mutual confidence a man gives his own consequence to the woman he marries and he sees himself respected in the respect paid her she extends his dignity and confirms it there is such a tenderness such an helpfulness such a sympathy in suffering in a good woman that i am always for excusing men in years who marry prudently while i censure for the same reason women in years male nurses are unnatural creatures there is not such a character that can be respectable womens sphere is the house and their shiningplace the sick chamber in which they can exert all their amiable and shall i say lenient qualities marry mylord by all means you are hardly fifty but were you seventy and so often indisposed so wealthy no children to repine at a motherinlaw and to render your life or hers uncomfortable by their little jealousies i would advise you to marry the man or woman deserves not to be benefited in the disposition of your affairs that would wish you to continue in the hands of mean people and to rob you of the joys of confidence and the comfort of tender help from an equal or from one who deserves to be made your equal in degree only my lord marry so as not to defeat your own end marry not a gay creature who will be sluttering about in public while you are groaning in your chamber and wishing for her presence  blessings on your heart my nephew best of men i can bold no longer there was no bearing before your generosity what can i say now  but you must be in earnest  have you my lord asked i any lady in your eye  no said he indeed i have not  i was the better pleased with him that he had not because i was afraid that like our viiith henry he had some other woman in view which might have made him more uneasy than he would otherwise have been with giffard for though it was better that he should marry than live in scandal and a woman of untainted character rather than one who had let the world see that she could take a price for her honor yet i thought him better justified in his complaints of that womans misbehaviour than in the other case he would have been and that it was an happiness to both if a right use were made of the event that they had been unable to live on as they had set out  he told me that he should think himself the happiest of men if i could find out and recommend to him a woman that i thought worthy of his addresses and even would court her for him  your lordship ought not to expect fortune  i do not  she should be a gentlewoman by birth and education a woman of a serious turn such an one is not likely in affluence to run into those scenes of life from which perhaps only want of fortune has restrained the gayer creature i would not have your lordship fix an age though i think you should not marry a girl some women at thirty are more discreet than others at forty and if your lordship should be blessed with a child or two to inherit your great estate that happy event would domesticate the lady and make your latter years more happy than your former  my lord held up his hands and eyes and tears seemed to make themselves surrows on his cheeks  he made me look at him by what he said on this occasion and with anger till he explained himself  by my soul said he and clapped his two liftedup hands together i have your father i never heartily loved him but now i hate him more than ever i did in my life  my lord   dont be surprised i hate him for keeping so long abroad a son who would have converted us both lessons of morality given in so noble a manner by regular practice rather than by preaching theory those were his words not only where there is no interest proposed to be served but against interest must have subdued us both and that by our own consents o my sister and he clasped his hands and lifted up his eyes as if he had the dear object of his brotherly address before him how have you blessed me in your son   this apostrophe to my mother affected me what a mixture is there in the character of lord w what a good man might he have made had he been later his own master  his father died before he was of age  he declared that i had described the very wife he wished to have find out such an one for me my dear kinsman said he and i give you charte blanch but let her not be younger than fifty make the settlements for me i am very rich i will sign them blindsold if the lady be such an one as you say i ought to love i will love her only let her say she can be grateful for my love and for the provision you shall direct me to make for her and my first interview with her shall be at the altar  i think my friend i have in my eye such a woman as my lord ought to do very handsome things for if she condescend to have him i will not tell you not even you whom i mean till i know she will encourage such a proposal and for her own fortunes sake i think she should but i had her not in my thoughts when i proposed to my lord the character of the woman he should wish for  adieu my dear friend  letter xii miss byron to miss selby tuesday mar    dr bartlett went to town yesterday he returned early enough to breakfast with us he found at dinner with his patron the whole danby family and mr sylvester as also the two masters of the young gentlemen with mr galliard whose son is in love with miss danby and she with him there all the parties had confirmed to them the generous goodness of sir charless of which he had assured mr sylvester and the two brothers and sister before  i am sorry methinks the doctor went to town we should otherwise perhaps have had the particulars of all from the pen of the benevolent man such joy such admiration such gratitude the doctor says were expressed from every mouth that his own eyes as well as mr sylvesters and most of those present more than once were ready to overflow  every thing was there settled and even a match proposed by sir charles and the proposal received with approbation on both sides between the elder miss galliard and that audacious young man the drugmerchant who recovered by his behavior in this meeting his reputation with sir charles and everybody  the doctor says that mr hervey and mr poussin the two masters of the young gentlemen are very worthy men so is mr galliard and they behaved so handsomely on the occasion that sir charles expressed himself highly pleased with them all for mr hervey and mr galliard offered to accept of less money than sir charles made the young people worth the one for a portion with miss danby the other for admitting the elder danby into a partnership with him on his marriage with his niece but sir charles had no notion he said of putting young men of good characters and abilities to difficulties at their entrance into the world the greatest expenses he observed were then incurred in slight or scanty beginnings scanty plans must be laid and pursued mr galliard then declared that the younger danby should have the handsomer fortune with his daughter if she approved of him for the very handsome one miss danby would carry to his son  sir charless example in short fired every one with emulation and three marriages with the happiest prospects are likely very soon to follow these noble instances of generosity mr sylvester proposed the celebration on one day in that case the gentlemen joined to hope sir charles would honor them with his presence he assentingly bowed how many families are here at once made happy  dr bartlett after he had given us this relation said on our joining in one general blessing of his patron you know not ladies you know not my lord what a general philanthropist your brother is his whole delight is in doing good it has always been so and to mend the hearts as well as fortunes of men is his glory  we could not but congratulate the doctor on his having so considerable a hand as sir charles always lord l said delighted to own in cultivating his innate good principles at so critical a time of life as that was in which they became acquainted  the doctor very modesty received the compliment and to wave our praises gave us another instance of the great manner in which sir charles conferred benefits as follows  he once said the doctor when his fortune was not what it now is lent a very honest man a merchant of leghorn when he resided there as he did sometimes for a month or two together for the convenience of the english chapel a considerable sum and took his bond for it after a while things not answering to the poor mans expectation mr grandison took notice to me said the doctor that he appeared greatly depressed and dejected and occasionally came into his company with such a sense of obligation in his countenance and behavior that he could not bear it and why said he should i keep it in my power to distress a man whose modesty and diffidence show that he deserves to be made easy  i may die suddenly my executors may think it but justice to exact payment and that exaction may involve him in as great difficulties as those were from which the loan delivered him  i will make his heart light instead of suffering him to sigh over his uncertain prospects at his board or in his bed i will make both his board and his bed easy to him his wife and his five children shall rejoice with him they shall see the good mans countenance as it used to do shine upon them and occasionally meet mine with grateful comfort  he then cancelled the bond and at the same time fearing the mans distress might be deeper than he owned offered him the loan of a further sum but by his behavior upon it i found said mr grandison that the sum he owed and the doubt he had of being able to pay it in time were the whole of the honest mans grievance he declined with gratitude the additional offer and walked ever after erect  he is now living and happy proceeded the doctor and just before mr grandison left italy would have made him some part of payment from the happier turn in his affairs which probably was owing to his revived spirits but mr grandison asked what he thought he meant when he cancelled the obligation  yet he told him that it was not wrong in him to make the tender for free minds he said loved not to be ungenerously dealt with  what a man is this lucy  no wonder thus gloriously employed with my lord w and the danbys said lord l and perhaps in other acts of goodness that we know nothing of besides the duties of his executorship that we are deprived of his company but some of these as he has so good a friend as dr bartlett he might transfer to him  and oblige us more with his presence and the rather as he declares it would be obliging himself  ah my lord said the doctor and looked round him his eyes dwelling longest on me  you dont know  he stopped we all were silent he proceeded  sir charles grandison does nothing without reason a good man must have difficulties to encounter with that a mere man of the world would not be embarrassed by  but how i engage your attention ladies   the doctor arose for breakfast was over  dear doctor said miss grandison dont leave us  as to that bologna that camilla that bishop  tell us more of them dear doctor  excuse me ladies excuse me my lord he bowed and withdrew  how we looked at one another how the fool in particular blushed how her heart throbbed  at what   but lucy give me your opinion  dr bartlett guesses that i am far from being indifferent to sir charles grandison he must be assured that my own heart must be absolutely void of benevolence if i did not more and more esteem sir charles for his and would dr bartlett be so cruel as to contribute to a flame that perhaps is with difficulty kept from blazing out as one hears new instances of his generous goodness if he knew that sir charles grandison was so engaged as to render it impossible  what shall i say  o this cruel cruel suspense  what hopes what fears what contradictory conjectures  but all will too soon perhaps  here he is come  sir charles grandison is come   o no  a false alarm  he is not come it is only my lord l returned from an airing  i could beat this girl this emily  it was owing to her  a chit  how we have fluttered each other  but send for me down to northamptonshire my dear friends before i am quite a fool  pray  do you know lucy what is the business that calls mr deane to town at this season of the year he has made a visit to sir charles grandison for dr bartlett told me as a grateful compliment that sir charles was much pleased with him yet mr deane did not tell me that he designed it i beseech you my dear friends  do not  but you would not you could not  i would be torn in pieces i would not accept of  i dont know what i would say only add not disgrace to distress  but i am safe if nothing be done but at the motion of my grandmamma and aunt selby they would not permit mr deane or anybody to make improper visits  but dont you think that it must look particular to sir charles to have a visit paid him by a man expressing for me so much undeserved tenderness and affection so long after the affair was over which afforded him a motive for it  i dread as much for mr deans sake as my own everything that may be construed into officiousness or particularity by so nice a discerner does he not say that no man is more quicksighted than himself to those saults in women which are owing to want of delicacy  i have been very earnest with lord and lady l and miss grandison that they do not suffer their friendship for me to lay me under any difficulties with their brother they all took my meaning and promised to consult my punctilio as well as my inclination miss grandison was more kindly in earnest in her assurances of this nature than i was afraid she would be and my lord said it was fit that i should find even niceness gratified in this particular  i absolutely confide in you lucy to place hooks where i forget to put them and where in your delicate mind you think i ought to put them that they may direct your eye when you come to read out before my uncle to omit those passages which very few men have delicacy or seriousness enough to be trusted with yet a mighty piece of sagacity to find out a girl of little more than twenty in love as it is called and to make a jest of her for it  but i am peevish as well as saucy  this also goes between hooks  adieu my dear letter xiii sir charles grandison to dr bartlett monday night mar  0 i am very much dissatisfied with myself my dear dr bartlett what pains have i taken to conquer those sudden gusts of passion to which from my early youth i have been subject as you have often heard me confess yet to find at times that i am unequal  to myself shall i say  to myself i will say since i have been so much amended by your precepts and example but i will give you the occasion  my guests and you had but just left me when the wretched jervois and her o hara and another bullying man desired to speak with me  i bid the servant show the woman into the drawingroom next my study and the men into the adjoining parlour but they both followed her into the drawing room i went to her and after a little stiff civility i could not help it asked if these gentlemen had business with me  that gentleman is major ohara sir he is my husband that gentleman is captain salmonet he is the majors brotherinlaw he is an officer of equal worth and bravery  they gave themselves airs of importance and familiarity and the major motioned as if he would have taken my hand  i encouraged not the motion will you gentlemen walk this way  i led the way to my study the woman arose and would have come with them  if you please to stay where you are madam i will attend you presently  they entered and as if they would have me think them connoisseurs began to admire the globes the orrery the pictures and busts  i took off that sort of attention  pray gentlemen what are your commands with me  i am called major ohara sir i am the husband of the lady in the next room as she told you  and what pray sir have i to do either with you or your marriage i pay that lady as the widow of mr jervois  00 l a year i am not obliged to pay her more then one she has no demands upon me much less has her husband  the men had so much the air of bullies and the woman is so very wicked that my departed friend and the name by which she so lately called the poor emily were in my head and i had too little command of my temper  look ye sir charles grandison i would have you to know   and he put his left hand upon his swordhandle pressing it down which tilted up the point with an air extremely insolent  what am i to understand by that motion sir  nothing at all sir charles  dn me if i mean any thing by it   you are called major you say sir  do you bear the kings commission sir  i have borne it sir if i do not now  that and the house you are in give you a title to civility but sir i cannot allow that your marriage with the lady in the next room gives you pretense to business with me if you have on any other account pray let me know what it is  the man seemed at a loss what to say but not from bashfulness he looked about him as if for his woman set his teeth bit his lip and took snuff with an air so like defiance that for fear i should not be able to forbear taking notice of it i turned to the other pray captain salmonet said i what are your commands with me  he spoke in broken english and said he had the honor to be major oharas brother he had married the majors sister  and why sir might you not have favored me with the company of all your relations  have you any business with me sir on your own account  i come i come said he to see my brother righted sir   who has wronged him  take care gentlemen how  but mr ohara what are your pretensions  why lookye sir charles grandison throwing open his coat and sticking one hand in his side the other thrown out with a flourish lookye sir repeated he   i found my choler rising i was afraid of my self  when i treat you familiarly sir then treat me so till when please to withdraw   i rang frederick came in  show these gentleman into the little parlour  you will excuse me sirs i attend the lady  they muttered and gave themselves brisk and angry airs nodding their heads at each other but followed the servant into that parlour  i went to mrs ohara as she calls herself  well madam what is your business with me now  where are the gentlemen sir where is my husband  they are both in the next room and within hearing of all that shall pass between you and me  and do you hold them unworthy of your presence sir  not madam while you are before me and if they had any business with me or i with them  has not an husband business where his wife is  neither wife nor husband has business with me  yes sir i am come to demand my daughter i come to demand a mothers right  i answer not to such a demand you know you have no right to make it  i have been at colnebrooke she was kept from me my child was carried out of the house that i might not see her  and have you then terrified the poor girl  i have left a letter for her and i expect to see her upon it  her new father as worthy and as brave a man as yourself sir longs to see her   her new father madam  you expect to see her madam  what was your behavior to her unnatural woman the last time you saw her but if you do see her it must be in my presence and without your man if he form pretensions on your account that may give either her or me disturbance  you are only sir to take care of her fortune so i am advised i as her mother have the natural right over her person the chancery will give it to me  then seek your remedy in chancery let me never hear of you again but by the officers of that cour  i opened the door leading into the room where the two men were  they are not officers i dare say common men of the town i doubt not newdressed for the occasion ohara as she calls him is probably one of her temporary husbands only  pray walk in gentlemen said i this lady intimates to me that she will apply to chancery against me the chancery if she have any grievance will be a proper recourse she can have no business with me after such a declaration  much less can either of you  and opening the drawing room door that led to the hall frederick said i attend the lady and the gentlemen to their coach  and i turned from them to go into my study  the major as he was called asked me with a fierce air his hand on his sword if this were treatment due to gentlemen  this house in which however you are an intruder sir is your protection or that motion and that air if you mean anything by either would cost you dear  i am sir the protector of my wife you have insulted her sir   have i insulted your wife sir  and i stepped up to him but just in time recovered myself remembering where i was  take care sir  but you are safe here  frederick wait upon the gentlemen to the door   frederick was not in hearing the wellmeaning man apprehending consequences went it seems into the offices to get together some of his fellowsersants  salmonet putting himself into violent motion swore that he would stand by his friend his brother to the last drop of his blood and in a posture of offense drew his sword half way  i wish friend said i but could hardly contain myself that i were in your house instead of your being in mine  but if you would have your sword broken over your head draw it quite  he did with a vapor d  n him he said if he bore that my own house on such an insult as this should not be my protection and retreating he put himself into a posture of defense  now major now major said the wiked woman  her major also drew making wretched grimaces  i was dressed i knew not but the men were assassins i drew put by salmonets sword closed with him disarmed him and by the same effort laid him on the floor  ohara skipping about as if he watched for an opportunity to make a push with safety to himself lost his sword by the usual trick whereby a man anything skilled in his weapons knows how sometimes to disarm a less skilful adversary  the woman screamed and ran into the hall  i turned the two men first one then the other out of the room with a contempt that they deserved and frederick richard and jerry who by that time were got together in the hall a little too roughly perhaps turned them into the square  they limped into the coach they came in the woman in terror was already in it when they were also in it they cursed swore and threatened  the pretended captain putting his body halfway out of the coach bid my servants tell me that i was  that i was  and avoiding a worse name as it seemed no gentleman and that he would find an opportunity to make me repent the treatment i had given to men of honor and to a lady  the major in eagerness to say something by way of resentment and menace likewise  beginning with damning his blood  had his intended threatening cut short by meeting the captains head with his as he other in a rage withdrew it after his spech to the servant and each cursing the other one rubbing his forehead the other putting his hand to his head away drove the coach  they forgot to ask for their swords and one of them left his hat behind him  you cannot imagine my dear dr bartlett how much this idle affair has disturbed me i cannot forgive myself  to suffer myself to be provoked by two such men to violate the sanction of my own house yet they came no doubt to bully and provoke me or to lay a foundation for a demand that they knew if personally made must do it  my only excuse to myself is that there were two of them and that though i drew yet i had the command of myself so far as only to defend myself when i might have done any thing with them i have generally found that those who are the readiest to give offense are the unfittest when brought to the test to support their own insolence  but my emily my poor emily how must she be terrified  i will be with you very soon let not her know anything of this idle affair nor anybody but lord l  tuesday morning i have just parted with one blagrave an attorney who already had been ordered to proceed against me but out of regand to my character and having as he owned no great opinion of his clients he thought fit to come to me in person to acquaint me of it and to inform himself from me of the whole affair  the gentlemans civility entitled him to expect an account of it i gave it him  he told me that if i pleased to restore the swords and the hat by him and would promise not to stop the future quarterly payments of the  00 l a year about which they were very apprehensive he dared to say that after such an exertion of spirit as he called a choleric excess i should not hear any more of them for one while since he believed they had only been trying an experiment which had been carried farther he dared to say than they had designed it should  he hinted his opinion that the men were common men of the town and that they had never been honored with commissions in any service  the woman i know not by what name to call her since it is very probable that she has not a real title to that of ohara was taken out of the coach in violent hysterics as ohara told him who in consulting mr blagrave may be supposed to aggravate matters in order to lay a foundation for an action of damages  she accused the men of cowardice before mr blagrave and that in very opprobrious terms  they excused themselves as being loath to hurt me which they said they easily could have done especially before i drew  they both pretended to mr blagrave personal damages but i hope their hurts are magnified  i am however that be most hurt for i am not at all pleased with myself they possibly though they have no cause to be satisfied with their parts in the sray have been more accustomed to such scufles than i and are above or rather beneath all punctilio  mr blagrave took the swords and the hat with him in the coach that waited for him  if i thought it would not have looked like a compromise and encouraged their insolence i co ld freely have sent them more than what belonged to hem i am really greatly hurt by the part i acted to such men  as to the annuity i bid mr blagrave tell the woman that the payment of that depended upon her future good behavior and yet that i was not ure that she was entitled to it but as the widow of my friend  however i told this gentleman that no provocation should hinder me from doing strict justice though i were sure that they would go to law with the money i should cause to be paid to them quarterly you will therefore know sir added i that the fund which they have to depend upon to support a lawsuit should they commence one and think fit to employ in it so honest a man as you seem to be is  00 l a year it would be madness if not injustice to pay the other  00 l for such a purpose when it was left to my discretion to pay it or not with a view to discourage that litigious spirit which is one of an hundred of this poor womans bad qualities  and thus for the present stands this affair i look upon my trouble from this woman as over till some new scheme arises either among these people or from others whom she may consult or employ you and i when i have the happiness to attend you and my other friends will not renew the subject  i am etc charles grandison   letter xiv miss byron to miss selby colnebrooke wedn mar    sir charles arrived this morning just as we had assembled to breakfast for lady l is not an early riser the moment he entered sunshine broke out in the countenance of every one  he apologized to all but me for his long absence especially when they had such a guest were his words bowing to me and i thought he sighed and looked with tender regard upon me but i dared not ask miss grandison whether she saw any thing particular in his devoirs to me  it was owing to his politeness i presume that he did not include me in his apologies because that would have been to suppose that i had expected him indeed i was not displeased in the main that he did not compliment me as a third sister see lucy what little circumstances a doubtful mind will sometimes dwell upon  i was not pleased that he had been so long absent and had my thoughts to myself upon it inclining once to have gone back to london and perhaps should could i have sansied myself of importance enough to make him uneasy by it the sex the sex lucy will my uncle say but i pretend not to be above its little foibles but the moment i saw him all my disgusts were over after the anderson the danby the lord w affairs he appeared to me in a much more shining light than an hero would have done returning in a triumphal car covered with laurels and dragging captive princes at its wheels how much more glorious a character is that of the friend of mankind than that of the conqueror of nations  he told me that he paid his compliments yesterday to mr and mrs reeves he mentioned mr deanes visit to him and said very kind but just things in his praise i read not any thing in his eyes or manner that gave me uneasiness on the visit that other good man made him  my dear emily sat generously uneasy i saw for the trouble she had been the cause of giving to her best friend though she knew not of a visit that her mother and ohara and salmonet made her guardian on monday as the doctor had hinted to us without giving us particulars  sir charles thanked me for my goodness as he called it in getting the good girl so happily out of her mothers way as his emily would have been too much terrified to see her and he thanked lord l for his tenderness to his ward on that occasion  my lord gave him the letter which mrs jervois had left for her daughter sir charles presented it to the young lady without looking into it she instantly returned it to him in a very graceful manner we will read it together byandby my emily said he dr bartlett tells me there is tenderness in it  the doctor made apologies to him for having communicated to us some of his letters  whatever dr bartlett does said sir charles must be right but what say my sisters to my proposal of correspondence with them  we should be glad replied lady l to see all you write to dr bartlett but could not undertake to write you letter for letter  why so  miss byron said miss grandison has put us quite out of heart as to the talent of narrative letterwriting  i should be greatly honored with a sight of such letters of miss byron as you my lord have seen will miss byron applying to me favor one brother and exclude another  brother lucy i thought he was not at that time quite so handsome a man as when he first entered the room  i was silent and blushed i knew not what answer to make yet thought i should say something  may we sir charles said miss grandison hope for a perual of your letters to dr bartlett for the same number of weeks past letter for letter if we could prevail on miss byron to consent to the proposal  would miss byron consent upon that condition  what say you miss byron said my lord  i answered that i could not presume to think that the little chitchat which i wrote to please my partial friends in the country could appear tolerable in the eye of sir charles grandison  they all answered with high encomiums on my pen and sir charles in the most respectful manner insisting upon not being denied to see what lord l had perused and miss grandison having said that i had to oblige them been favored with the return of my letters from the country i thought it would look like a too meaning particularity if i refused to oblige him in the light though not a very agreeable one i own to you lucy of another brother i told him that i would show him very willingly and without condition all the letters i had written of the narrative kind from my first coming to london down to the dreadful masquerade affair and even sir hargraves barbarous treatment of me down to the deliverance he had so generously given me  how did he extol me for what he called my noble frankness of heart in that grace he said i excelled all the women he had ever conversed with he assured me that he would not wish to see a line that i was not willing he should see and that if he came to a word or passage that he could suppose would be of that nature it should have no place in his memory  miss grandison called out  but the condition sir charles   is only this replied i i am sure of your candor sir that you will correct me where i am wrong in any of my notions or sentiments i have been very pert and forward in some of my letters particularly in a dispute that was carried on in relation to learning and languages if i could not for improvement sake more heartily bespeak your correction than your approbation i should be afraid of your eye there  excellent miss byron beauty shall not bribe me on your side if i think you wrong in any point that you submit to my judgment and if i am beautyproof i am sure nothing on earth can biass me  miss grandison said she would number the letters according to their dates and then would give them to me that i might make such conditions with her brother on the loan as every one might be the btter for  breakfast being over miss grandison renewed the talk of the visit made here by mrs ohara on sunday last miss jervois very prettily expressed her grief for the trouble given her guardian by her unhappy mother he drew her to him as he fat with looks of tenderness and called her his dear emily and told her she was the child of his compassion you are called upon my dear said he young as you are to a glorious trial and hitherto you have shone in it i wish the poor woman would be but half as much the mother as you would be the child but let us read her letter  his goodness overwhelmed her he took her mothers letter out of his pocket she stood before him drying her eyes and endeavoring to suppress her emotion and when he had unfolded the letter he put his arm round her waist surely lucy he is the tenderest as well as bravest of men what would i give for a picture drawn but with half the life and love which shone out in his looks as he cast his eyes now on the letter and now up to his emily  poor woman said he two or three times as he read and when he had done you must read it my dear said he there is the mother in it we will acknowledge the mother wherever we can find her  why did not the dear girl throw her arms about his neck just then  she was ready to do so o my best of guardians said she and it was plain was but just restrained by virgin modesty from doing so her hands caught back as it were and resting for a moment on his shoulder and she looked as much abashed as if she had not checked herself  i took more notice of this her grateful motion than anybody else i was affected with the beautiful check and admired her for it  and must i sir would you have me read it i will retire to my chamber with it  he arose took her hand and coming with her to me put it into mine be so good madam to fortify this worthy childs heart by your prudence and judgment while she reads the mother in the only instance that i have ever known it visible in this unhappy woman  he bowed and gave me the letter i was proud of his compliment and emily and i withdrew into the next room and there the good girl read the letter but it was long in reading her tears often interrupting her and more than once as wanting a refuge she threw her arms about my neck in silent grief  i called her twenty tender names but i could not say much what could i the letter in some places affected me it was the letter of a mother who seemed extremely sensible of hardships her guardian had promised observations upon it i knew not then all the unhappy womans wickedness i knew not but the husband might be in some fault  what could i say i could not think of giving comfort to a daughter at the expense of even a bad mother  miss grandison came to us she kissed the sobbing girl and with tenderness calling us her two loves led us into the next room  sir charles it seems had owned in our absence that mr and mrs ohara and captain salmonet had made him a visit in town on their return from colnebrooke and expressed himself to be vexed at his own behavior to them  miss jervois gave the letter to her guardian and went behind his chair on the back of which she leaned while he looked into the letter and made observations upon what he read as nearly in the following words as i can remember  an unhappy mother whose fau ts have been barbarously aggravated  my emilys father was an indulgent husband he forgave this unhappy woman crimes which very few men would have forgiven she was the wife of his choice he doted on her his first forgiveness of an atrocious crime hardened her  when he could not live with her he removed from place to place to avoid her at last afraid of her private machinations which were of the blackest nature he went abroad in order to pursue that traffic in person which he managed to great advantage by his agents and factors having first however made an handsome provision for his wife  thither after some time passed in riot and extravagance she followed him  i became acquainted with him at florence i found him to be a sensible and honest man and every one whom he could serve or assist experienced his benevolence not a single soul who knew him but loved him this wife excepted  she at that time insisted upon his giving up to her management his beloved emily and solemnly promised reformation on his compliance she knew that the child would be a great fortune  i was with mr jervois on her first visit to him at leghorn and though i had heard her character to be very bad was inclined to befriend her she was specious i hoped that a mother whatever wife she made could not out be a mother and poor mr jervois had not been forward to say the worst of her but she did not long save appearances the whole english factory at leghorn were witnesses to her flagrant enormities she was addicted to an excess that left her no guard and made her a stranger to that grace which is the glory of a woman  i am told that she is less frequently intoxicated than heretofore i should be glad of the least shadow of reformation in her that odias vice led her int every other and hardened her to a sense of shame other vices perhaps at first wanted that to introduce them but the most flagitious have been long habitual to her  nothing but the justice due to the character of my departed friend could have induced me to say what i have said of this unhappy woman forgive me my emily but shall i not defend your father  i have not said the worst i could say of his wise  yet she writes that her faults have been barbarously aggravated in order to justify the ill usage of an husband who she says was not saultless ill usage of an husband wretched woman she knew i must see this letter how could she write thus she knows that i have authentic proofs in my custody of his unexceptionable goodness to her and confessions under her own hand of her guilt and ingratitude to him  but my emily  and he arose and took her hand her face over whelmed with tears you may rejoice in your fathers character he was a good man in every sense of the word with regard to her he had but one fault and that was his indulgence  shall i say that after repeated elopements after other men had cast her off he took her back when she had forfeited his love his pity operated in her favor and she was hardened enough to despise the man who could much more easily forgive than punish her i am grieved to be obliged to say this but repeat that the memory of my friend must not be unjustly loaded would to heaven that i could suggest the shadow of a plea that would extenuate any part of her vileness either respecting him or herself let whosesoever character suffer by it i would suggest it how often has this worthy husband wept to me for those faults of his wife for which she could not be sorry  i discourage not these tears my emily on what you have heard me say but let me now dry them up  he took her own handkerchief and tenderly wiped her cheeks it is unnecessary proceeded he to say anything farther at this time in defense of your fathers character we come now to other parts of the letter that will not i hope be so affecting to the heart of a good child  she insists upon your making her a visit or receiving one from her she longs she says to see you to lay you in her bosom she congratulates you on your improvements she very pathetically calls upon you not to despise her   my dear girl you shall receive her visit she shall name her place for it provided i am present i shall think it a sign of her amendment if she is really capable of rejoicing in your improvements i have always told you that you must distinguish between the crime and the mother the one is entitled to your pity the other calls for your abhorrence  do you choose my dear to see your mother  i hope you do let not even the faulty have cause to complain of unkindness from us there are faults that must be left to heaven to punish and against the consequences of which it behooves us only to guard for our own sakes i hope you are in a safe protection and have nothing to fear from her you are guarded therefore can my emily forget the terrors of the last interview and calmly in my presence kneel to her mother  whatever you command me to do i will do  i would have you answer this letter invite her to the house of your guardian  i think you should not go to her lodgings yet if you incline to see her there and she insists upon it i will attend you  but sir must i own her husband for my father  leave that to me my dear little things punctilios are not to be stood upon pride shall have no concern with us but i must first be satisfied that the man and she are actually married who knows if they are but his dependence on her annuity and the protection she may hope for from him may make it convenient to both to live in a more creditable manner than hitherto she has aimed to do if she save but appearances for the future it will be a point gained  i will in everything sir do as you would have me  one thing my dear i think i will advise if they are really married if there be any prospect of their living tolerably together you shall if you please your fortune is very large make them an handsome present and give hope that it will be an annual one if the man behave with civility to your mother she complains that she is made poor and dependent poor if she be it is her own fault she brought not  00 l to your father ungrateful woman he married her as i hinted for love with  00 l a year well paid she ought not to be poor but dependent she must be your father would have given her a larger annuity had he not known by experience that it was but strengthening her hands to do mischief and to enable her to be more riotous i found a declaration of this kind among his papers after his death this his intention if there could have been any hope of a good use to be made of it justifies my advice to you to enlarge her stipend i will put it in such a way that you my dear shall have the credit of it and i will take upon myself the advice of restraining it to good behavior for their own sakes and for yours  o sir how good you are you now give me courage to wish to see my poor mother in hopes that it will be in my power to do her good continue to your emily the blessing of your direction and i shall be an happy girl indeed o that my mother may be married that so she may be entitled to the best you shall advise me to do for her  i doubt her man is a man of the town added he but he may have lived long enough to see his follies she may be tired of the life she has led i have made several efforts to do her service but had no hope to reclaim her i wish she may now be a wife in earnest but this i think shall be my last effort  write my dear but nothing of your intention if she is not married things must remain as they are  she hastened upstairs and very soon returned with the following lines  madam i beseech you to believe that i am not wanting in duty to my mother you rejoice my heart when you tell me that you love me my guardian was so good before i could have time to ask him as to bid me write to you and to let you know that he will himself present me to you whenever you please to favor me with an opportunity to pay my duty to you at his house in st jamess square  let me hope my dear mamma that you will not be so angry with your poor girl as you was last time i saw you at mrs lanes and then i will see you with all the duty that a child owes to her mother for i am and will ever be  your dutiful daughter emilia jervois   sir charles generously scrupled the last paragraph we will not i think emily said he remind a mother who has written such a letter as that before us of a behavior that she should be glad to forget  miss grandison desired it might stand who knows says she but it may make her ashamed of her outrageous behavior at that time  she deserves not generous usage said lady l she cannot feel it  perhaps not replied sir charles but we should do proper things for our own sakes whether the persons are capable of feeling them as they ought or not what say you miss byron to this last paragraph  i was entirely in his way of thinking and for the reason he gave but the two ladies having given their opinion in a pretty earnest manner and my lord saying he thought it might pass i was afraid it would look like bespeaking his favor at their expense if i adopted his sentiments i therefore declined giving my opinion but being willing to keep emily in countenance who sat suspended in her judgment as one who feared she had done a wrong thing i said it was a very natural paragraph i thought from miss jervoiss pen as it was written i dared to say rather in apprehension of hard treatment from what she remembered of the last than in a spirit of recrimination or resentment  the good girl declared it was both ladies and my lord said i had distinguished well but sir charles though he said no more upon the subject looked upon each sister with meaning which i wondered they did not observe dr bartlett was withdrawn or i believe he would have had the honesty to speak out which i had not but the point was a point of delicacy and generosity and i thought i should not seem to imagine that i understood it better than they nor did i think that sir charles would have acquiesced with their opinion  miss jervois retired to transcribe her letter we all separated to dress and i having soon made an alteration in mine dropped in upon dr bartlett in his closet  i am stealing from this good man a little improvement in my geography i am delighted with my tutor and he professes to be pleased with his scholar but sometimes more interesting articles slide in but now he had just began to talk of miss jervois as if he would have led i thought to the proposal hinted at by miss grandison from the letter she had so clandestinely seen of my taking her under my care when sir charles entered the doctors apartment he would have withdrawn when he saw me but the doctor rising from his chair besought him to oblige us with his company  i was silly i did not expect to be caught there but why was i silly on being found with dr bartlett  but let me tell you that i thought sir charles himself at first addressing me seemed a little unprepared you invited me in doctor here i am but if you were upon a subject that you do not pursue i shall look upon myself as an intruder and will withdraw  we had just concluded one subject and were beginning another  i had just mentioned miss jervois  is not emily a good child miss byron said sir charles  indeed sir she is  we then had some general talk of the unhappy situation she is in from such a mother and i thought some hints would have been given of his desire that she should accompany me down to northamptonshire and my heart throbbed to think how it would be brought in and how i should behave upon it and the more as i was not to be supposed to have so much as heard of such a designed proposal what would it have done had i been prevailed upon to read the letter but not one word passed leading to that subject  i now begin to fear that he has changed his mind if that was his mind methinks i am more fond of having the good girl with us than i imagined it was possible i ever could have been what a different appearance have things to us when they are out of our power to what they had when we believed they were in it  but i see not that there is the least likelihood that anything on which you had all set your hearts can happen  i cannot help it  emily flattering girl told me she saw great signs of attachment to me in his eyes and behavior but i see no grounds for such a surmise his affections are certainly engaged god bless him whatever his engagements are  when he was absent encouraged by his sisters and lord l i thought pretty well of myself but now he is present i see so many excellencies shining out in his mind in his air and address that my humility gets the better of my ambition  ambition did i say yes ambition lucy is it not the nature of the passion we are so foolishly apt to call noble to exalt the object and to lower if not to debase ones self  you see how lord w depreciates me on the score of fortune i was loath to take notice of that before because i knew that were slenderness of fortune the only difficulty the partiality of all my friends for their harriet would put them upon making efforts that i would sooner die than suffer to be made  i forgot the manner in which lord ws objection was permitted to go off  but i remember sir charles made no attempt to answer it and yet he tells my lord that fortune is not a principal article with him and that he has an ample estate of his own no question but a mans duties will rise with his opportunities a man therefore may be as good with a less estate as with a larger and is not goodness the essential part of happiness be our station what it will have we any concern but humbly to acquiesce in it and fulfill our duties  but who for selfish considerations can wish to circumscribe the power of this good man the greater opportunities he has of doing good the higher must be his enjoyment  no lucy do not let us flatter ourselves  sir charles rejoices on sir hargraves having just now by letter suspended the appointment till next week of his dining with him at his house on the forest  letter xv miss byron in continuation i left sir charles with dr bartlett they would both have engaged me to stay longer but i thought the ladies would miss me and think it particular to find me with him in the doctors closet  my lord and the two sisters were together in the drawing room adjoining to the library on my entrance well harriet said miss grandison we will now endeavor to find out my brother you must be present to yourself and put in a word nowandthen we shall see if dr bartlett is right when he says that my brother is the most unreserved of men  just then came in dr bartlett  i think doctor said lady l we will take your advice and ask my brother all the questions in relation to his engagements abroad that come into our heads  she had not done speaking when sir charles entered and drew his chair next me and just then i thought myself he looked upon me with equal benignity and respect  miss grandison began with taking notice of the letter from which dr bartlett she said had read some passages of the happiness he had procured to lord w in ridding him of his woman she wished she told him that she knew who was the lady he had in his thoughts to commend to my lord for a wife  i will have a little talk with her before i name her even to you my lord and my sisters i am sure my sisters will approve of their aunt if she accept of my lord for a husband i shall pay my compliments to her in my return from grandisonhall  do you charlotte choose to accompany me thither i must i think be present at the opening of the church i dont ask you my lord nor you lady l so short as my stay will be there i purpose to go down on friday next and return the tuesday following  miss gr i think brother i should wish to be excused if indeed you would stay there a week or fortnight i could like to attend you and so i dare say would lord and lady l  sir cha i must be in town on wednesday next week but you must stay the time you mention you cannot pass it disagreeably in the neighborhood of the hall and there you will find your cousin grandison he will gallant you from one neighbor to another and if i judge by your freedoms with him you have a greater regard for him than perhaps you know you have  miss gr your servant sir bowing  but i will take my revenge  pray sir charles may i ask we are all brothers and sisters   sir chapter stop charlotte pleasantly if you are going to ask any questions by way of revenge i answer them not  miss gr revenge  not revenge neither  but when the lord w as by the passages dr bartlett was so good as to read to us proposed to you this lady for a wife and that lady your answers gave us apprehension that you are not inclined to marry   lady l you are very unceremonious charlotte   indeed lucy she made me tremble sure he can have no notion that i have seen the whole letter  seen myself named in it  miss gr what signifies ceremony among relations  sir chapter let charlotte have her way  miss gr why then sir i would ask  dont you intend one day to marry  sir chapter i do charlotte i shall not think myself happy till i can obtain the hand of a worthy woman  i was i am afraid lucy visibly affected i knew not how to stay yet it would have looked worse to go  miss gr very well sir  and pray have you not either abroad or at home seen the woman you could wish to call yours  dont think me impertinent brother  sir chapter you cannot be impertinent charlotte if you want to know anything of me it please me best when you come directly to the point  miss gr well then if i cannot be impertinent if you are best pleased when you are most freely treated and if you are inclined to marry pray why did you decline the prposals mentioned by lord w in behalf of lady francis n of lady anne s and i cannot tell how many more  sir chapter the friends of the firstnamed lady proceeded not generously with my father in that affair the whole family builds too much on the interest and title of her father i wanted not to depend upon any public man i chose as much as possible to fix my happiness within my own little circle i have strong passions i am not without ambition had i loosened the reins to the latter young man as i am my tranquillity would have been pinned to the feather in another mans cap does this satisfy you charlotte as to lady frances  miss gr why yes and the easier because there is a lady whom i could have preferred to lady frances  i should not thought i have been present at this conversation lord l looked at me lord l should not have looked at me the ladies did not  sir chapter who is she  miss gr lady anne s you know sir  pray may i ask why that could not be  sir chapter lady anne is i believe a deserving woman but her fortune must have been my principal inducement had i made my addresses to her i never yet went so low as to that alone for an inducement to see a lady three times  miss gr then sir you have made your addresses to ladies  abroad i suppose  sir chapter i thought charlotte your curiosity extended only to the ladies in england  miss gr yes sir it extends to ladies in england and out of england if any there be that have kept my brother a single man when such offers have been made him as we think would have been unexceptionable but you hint then sir that there are ladies abroad   sir chapter take care charlotte that you make as free a respondent when it comes to your turn as you are a questioner  miss gr by your answers to my questions sir teach me how i am to answer yours if you have any to make  sir chapter very well charlotte have i not answered satisfactorily your questions about the ladies you named  miss gr pretty well but sir have you not seen ladies abroad whom you like better than either of those i have named  answer me to that  sir chapter i have charlotte and at home too  miss gr i dont know what to say to you  but pray sir have you not seen ladies abroad whom you have liked better than any you ever saw at home  sir chapter no but tell me charlotte to what does all this tend  miss gr only brother that we long to have you happily married and we are afraid that your declining this proposal and that is owing to some previous attachment  and now all is out  lord l and now my dear brother all is out   lady l if our brother will gratify our curiosity   had i ever before lucy so great a call upon me as now for presence of mind  sir charles sighed he paused and at last said  you are very generous very kind in your wishes to see me married i have seen the lady with whom of all the women in the world i think i could be happy  a fine blush overspread his face and he looked down why sir charles did you blush why did you look down the happy thrice happy woman was not present was she  ah no no no   sir chapter and now charlotte what other questions have you to ask before it comes to your turn to answer some that i have to put to you  miss gr only one  is the lady a foreign lady  how everybody but i looked at him expecting his answer  he really hesitated at last i think charlotte you will excuse me if i say that this question gives me some pain  because it leads to another that if made i cannot at present myself answer but why so sir thought i and if not made it cannot be of any signification to speak to this  lord l we would not give you pain sir charles and yet   sir chapter what yet my dear lord l  lord l when i was at florence there was much talk   sir chapter of a lady of that city  olivia my lord  there was  she has fine qualities but unhappily blended with others less approveable  but i have nothing to wish for from olivia she has done me too much honor i should not so readily have named her now had she been more sollicitous to conceal the distinction she honored me with but your lordship i dare hope never heard even ill will open its mouth to her disreputation only that she descended too much in her regard for one object  lord l your character sir charles was as much to her reputation as   sir chapter interrupting o my lord how brotherly partial but this lady out of the question my peace has been broken in pieces by a tender fault in my constitution  and yet i would not be without it  the sweet emily arose and in tears went to the window a sob endeavored to be suppressed called our attention to her  sir charles went and took her hand why weeps my emily  because you who so well deserve to be happy seem not to be so  tender examples lucy are catching i had much ado to restrain my tears  he kindly consoled her my unhappiness my dear said he arises chiefly from that of other people i should but for that be happy in myself because i endeavor to accommodate my mind to bear inevitable evils and to make if possible a virtue of necessity but charlotte see how grave you have made us all and yet i must enter with you upon a subject that possibly may be thought as serious by you as that which at present i wish to quit  wish to quit the question gave him some pain because it led to another which he cannot himself at present answer    what lucy let me ask you before i follow him to his next subject can you gather from what passed in that already recited if he is himself at an uncertainty he may deserve to be pitied and not blamed but dont you think he might have answered whether the lady is a foreigner or not  how could he know what the next question would have been  i had the assurance to ask miss grandison afterward aside whether anything could be made out or guessed at by his eyes when he spoke of having seen the woman he could prefer to all others for he sat next me she over against him  i know not what to make of him said she but be the lady native or foreigner it is my humble opinion that my brother is in love he has all the symptoms of it that i can guess by  i am of charlottes opinion lucy such tender sentiments such sweetness of manners such gentleness of voice  love has certainly done all this for him and the lady to be sure is a foreigner it would be strange if such a man should not have engaged his heart in the seven or eight years past and those from eighteen to twentysix or seven the most susceptible of a mans life  but what means he by saying his peace has been broken to pieces by a tender fault in his constitution  compassion i suppose for some unhappy object  i will soon return to town and there prepare to throw myself into the arms of my dearest relations in northamptonshire i shall otherwise perhaps add to the number of those who have broken his peace  but it is strange methinks that he could not have answered whether the lady is a foreigner or not  dr bartlett you are mistaken sir charles grandison is not so very un reserved a man as you said he was  but oh my dear little flattering emily how could you tell me that you watched his eyes and saw them always kindly bent on me  yes perhaps when you thought so he was drawing comparisons to the advantage of his fair foreigner from my less agreeable features   but this olivia lucy i want to know something more of her nothing he says to wish for from olivia poor lady methinks i am very much inclined to pity her  well but i will proceed now to his next subject i wish i could find some faults in him it is a cruel thing to be under a kind of necessity to be angry with a man whom we cannot blame and yet in the next conversation you will see him angry dont you long lucy to see how sir charles grandison will behave when he is angry  letter xvi miss byron in continuation now charlotte said he as if he had fully answered the questions put to him  o these men let me ask you a question or two  i had a visit made me yesterday by lord g what my dear do you intend to do with regard to him  but perhaps you would choose to withdraw with me on this question  miss gr i wish i had made to you the same overture of withdrawing sir charles on the questions i put to you i should have had more satisfaction given me i fansy than i can boast of if i had  sir chapter i will withdraw with you if you please and hear any other questions you have to put to me  miss gr you can put no questions to me sir that i shall have any objection to answer before this company  sir chapter you know my question charlotte  miss gr what would you advise me to do in that affair brother  sir chapter i have only one piece of advice to give you  it is that you will either encourage or discourage his address if you know your own mind  miss gr i believe brother you want to get rid of me  sir chapter then you intend to encourage lord g  miss gr does that follow sir  sir chapter or you could not have suppsed that i wanted to part with you but come charlotte let us retire it is very difficult to get a direct answer to such questions as these from ladies before company though the company be ever so nearly related to them  miss gr i can answer before this company any questions that relate to lord g  sir chapter then you dont intend to encourage him  miss gr i dont see how that follows neither from what i said  sir chapter it does very clearly i am not an absolute stranger to the language of women charlotte  miss gr i thought my brother too polite to reflect upon the sex  sir chapter is it to reflect upon the sex to say that i am not an absolute stranger to their language  miss gr i protest i think so in the way you spoke it  sir chapter well then try if you cannot find a language to speak in that may not be capable of such an interpretation  miss gr i am afraid you are displeased with me brother i will answer more directly  sir chapter do my charlotte i have promised lord g to procure him an answer   miss gr is the question he puts sir a brief one  on or off  sir chapter trust me charlotte you may even with your punctilio  miss gr will you not advise me sir  sir chapter i will  to pursue your inclination  miss gr suppose if i knew yours that that would turn the scale  sir chapter is the balance even  miss gr i cannot say that neither  sir chapter then dismiss my lord g  miss gr indeed brother you are angry with me  sir chapter addressing himself to me i am sure miss byron that i shall find in such points as this a very different sister in you when i come to be favored with the perusal of your letters your cousin reeves once said that when you knew your own mind you never kept any one in suspense  miss gr but i cannot say that i know my mind absolutely  sir chapter that is another thing i am silent only when you do i shall take it for a favor if you will communicate it to me for your service  miss gr i am among my best friends  lord l what is your advice sir charles does not incline to give me his  sir chapter it is owing to my regard to your own inclinations and not to displeasure or petulance that i do not  lord l i have a very good opinion of lord g what is yours my dear to lady l  lady l i really think very well of my lord g what is yours miss byron  harriet i believe miss grandson must be the sole determiner on this occasion if she has no objection i presume to think that no one else can have any  miss gr explain explain harriet   sir chapter miss byron answers as she always does penetration and prudence with her never quit company if i have the honor to explain her sentiments in giving mine take both as follow my lord g is a good natured mild man he will make a woman happy who has some share of prudence though she has a still greater share of will charlotte is very lively she loves her jest almost as well as she loves her friend   miss gr how brother  sir chapter and lord g will not stand in competition with her in that respect there should not be a rivalry in particular qualities in marriage i have known a poet commence an hatred to his wife on her being complimented with making better verses than he let charlotte agree upon those qualities in which she will a low her husband to excel and he allow in her those she has a desire to monopolize and all may do well  miss gr then lord g must not be disputed with i presume were i to be his wife on the subject of moths and butterflies  sir chapter yet lord g may give them up when he has a more considerable trifle to amuse himself with pardon me charlotte  are you not as far as we have gone in this conversation a pretty trifler  miss gr bowing thank you brother the epithets pretty and young and little are great qualifiers of harsh words  sir chapter but do you like sir walter watkyns better than lord g  miss gr i think not he is not i believe so goodnatured a man as the other  sir chapter i am glad you make that distinction charlotte  miss gr you think it a necessary one in my case i suppose sir  sir chapter i have a letter of his to answer he is very urgent with me for my interest with you i am to answer it will you tell me my sister giving her the letter what shall i say  miss gr after perusing it why ay poor man he is very much in love but i should have some trouble to teach him to spell and yet they say he has both french and italian at his singers ends  she then began to pull in pieces the letter  sir chapter i will not permit that charlotte pray return me the letter no woman is entitled to ridicule a lover whom she does not intend to encourage if she has a good opinion of herself she will pity him whether she has or not if she wounds she should heal sir walter may address himself to an hundred women who for the sake of his gay appearance and good estate will forgive him his indifferent spelling  miss gr the sluttering season is approaching one wants now andthen a dangling fellow or two after one in public perhaps i have not seen enough of either of these to determine which to choose will you not allow one since neither of them have very striking merits to behold them in different lights in order to enable ones self to judge which is the most tolerable of the two or whether a still more tolerable wretch may not offer  she spoke this in her very archest manner serious as the subject was and seriously as her brother wished to know her inclinations  sir charles turned to lord l and gravely said i wonder how our cousin everard is amusing himself at this instant at the hall  she was sensible of the intended rebuke and asked him to forgive her  wit my lord continued he inattentive to the pardon she asked is a dangerous weapon but that species of it which cannot shine without a foil is not a wit to be proud of the lady before me what is her name and i have been both under a mistake i took her for my sister charlotte she took me for our cousin everard  every one felt the severity it seemed to pierce me as if directed to me so unusually severe from sir charles grandison and delivered with such serious unconcern in the manner i would not at that moment have been miss grandison for the world  she did not know which way to look lady l amiable woman felt it for her sister tears were in the eyes of both  at last miss grandison arose i will take away the impostor sir and when i can rectify my mistake and bring you back your sister i hope you will receive her with your usual goodness  my charlotte my sister taking her hand you must not be very angry with me i love to feel the finer edge of your wit but when i was bespeaking your attention upon a very serious subject a subject that concerned the happiness of your future life and if yours mine and you could be able to say something that became only the mouth of an unprincipled woman to say how could i forbear to wish that some other woman and not my sister had said it  times and occasions my dear charlotte  no more i beseech you sir i am sensible of my folly let me retire  i charlotte will retire dont you but take the comfort your friends are disposed to give you emily one word with you my dear she flew to him and they went out together  there said miss grandison has he taken the girl with him to warn her against falling into my folly  dr bartlett retired in silence  lady l expressed her concern for her sister but said indeed charlotte i was afraid you would carry the matter too far  lord l blamed her indeed sister he bore with you a great while and the affair was a serious one he had engaged very seriously and even from principle in it o miss byron he will be delighted with you when he comes to read your papers and fees your treatment of the humble servants you resolved not to encourage  yes yes harriet will shine at my expense but may she  since i have lost my brothers favor i pray to heaven that she may gain it but he shall never again have reason to say i take him for my cousin everard but was i very wicked harriet  deal fairly with me was i very wicked  i thought you wrong all the way i was afraid for you but for what you last said about encouraging men to dangle after you and seeming to aim at making new conquests i could have chidden you had you not had your brother to hear it will you forgive me whispering her they were the words of a very coquet and the air was so arch  indeed my charlotte you were very much out of the way  so everybody against me  i must have been wrong indeed   the time the occasion was wrong sister charlotte said lord l had the subject been of less weight your brother would have passed it off as pleasantly as he has always before done your vivacities  very happy replied she to have such a character that everybody must be in fault who differs from him or offends him  in the midst of his displeasure charlotte said lady l he forgot not the brother the subject he told you concerned the happiness of your future life and if yours his  one remark resumed lord l i must make to sir charless honor take it not amiss sister charlotte not the least hint did he give of your error relating to a certain affair and yet he must think of it so lately as he has extricated you from it his aim evidently is to amend not to wound  i think my lord retorted miss grandison with a glow in her cheeks you might have spared your remark if the one brother did not recriminate the other needed not to remind my lord you have not my thanks for your remark  this affected good lady l pray sister blame not my lord you will lose my pity if you do are not we four united in one cause surely charlotte we are to speak our whole hearts to each other  so i have brought man and wife upon me now please the lord i will be married in hopes to have somebody on my side but harriet say am i wrong again  i hope my dear miss grandison replied i that what you said to my lord was in pleasantry and if so the fault was that you spoke it with too grave an air  well well let me take hold of your hand my dear to help me out of this new difficulty i am dreadfully out of luck today i am sorry i spoke not my pleasantry with a pleasant air  yet were not you likewise guilty of the same fault lady l did not you correct me with too grave an air  i am very willing returned lady l it should pass so but my dear you must not by your petulance rob yourself of the sincerity of one of the best hearts in the world looking with complacency at her lord  he bowed to her with an affectionate air  happy couple  as i hope to live said miss grandison i thought you all pitied me when sir charles laid so heavy an hand upon me and so he seemed to think by what he said at going out how did you deceive me all of you by your eyes  i do assure you said my lord i did pity you but had i not thought my sister in fault i should not  your servant my lord you are a nice distinguisher  and a just one charlotte rejoined lady l  no doubt of it lady l and that was your motive too i beseech you let me not be deprived of your pity i have yours also harriet upon the same kind consideration  why now this archness becomes you charlotte said i i was willing it should pass so lucy this is pretty pleasantry  it is a pretty specimen of charlottes penitence said lady l  i was glad lady l spoke this with an air of good humor but miss grandison withdrew upon it not well pleased  we heard her at her harpsichord and we all joined her emily also was drawn to us by the music tell me my dear said miss grandison to her stopping have you not had all my faults laid before you for your caution  indeed madam my guardian said but one word about you and this was it i love my sister she has amiable qualities we are none of us right at all times you see emily that i in chiding her spoke with a little too much petulance  god for ever bless my brother said miss grandison in a kind of rapture but now his goodness makes my flippancy odious to myself  sit down my child and play your italian air  this brought in sir charles he entered with a look of serenity as if nothing had passed to disturb him  when emily had done playing and singing miss grandison began to make apologies but he said let us forget each others failings charlotte  notice being given of dinner lord l took my hand and sir charles complaisantly led his sister charlotte to her seat at the table lady l being gone into the dining parlour before  a most intolerable superiority  i wish he would do something wrong something cruel if he would but bear malice would but stiffen his air by resentment it would be something as a man cannot he be lordly and assuming and where he is so much regarded i may say feared nod his imperial significance to his vassals about him  cannot he be imperious to servants to show his displeasure with principals  no it is natural to him to be good and just his whole aim as my lord observed is to convince and amend and not to wound or hurt  after dinner miss grandison put into my hands the parcel of my letters which i had consented sir charles should see miss byron sir said she will oblige you with the perusal of some of her letters you will in them see another sort of woman than your charlotte may i amend and be but half as good  when you have read them you will say amen and if your prayer take place will be satisfied with your sister  he received them from me standing up bowing and kissed the papers with an air of gallantry that i thought greatly became him o the vanity of the girl methinks my uncle says at this place he put them in his pocket  without conditions harriet said miss grandison except those of candor yet correction answered i again he bowed to me  i dont know what to say to it lucy but i think sir charles looks highly pleased to hear me praised and the ladies and my lord miss no opportunity to say kind things of me but could he not have answered miss grandisons question whether his favorite was a foreigner or not  had any other question arisen afterward that he had not cared to answer he could but have declined answering it as he did that  what a great deal of writing does the reciting of half an hour or an hours conversation make when there are three or four speakers in company and one attempts to write what each says in the first person i am amazed at the quantity on looking back but it will be so in narrative letterwriting did not you lucy write as long letters when you went with your brother to paris  i forget only this i remember that i always was sorry when i came to the end of them i am afraid it is quite otherwise with mine  by the way i am concerned that lady d is angry with me yet methinks she shows by her anger that she had a value for me as to what you tell me of lord ds setting his heart on the proposed alliance i am not so much concerned at that because he never saw me and had the affair been in his own power it is likely he would not have been very solicitous about his success many a one lucy i believe has found an ardor when repulsed which they would never have known had they succeeded  lady betty and miss clements were so good as to make me a visit this afternoon in their way to windsor where they are to pass two or three days they lamented my long absence from town and lady betty kindly regretted for me the many fine entertainments i had lost both public and private by my country excursion at this unpropitious season of the year as she called it shrugging her shoulders as it in compassion for my rustic taste  good lady she knew not that i am in company that want not entertainments out of themselves they have no time to kill or to delude on the contrary our constant complaint is that time flies too fast and i am sure for my part i am forced to be a manager of it since between conversation and writing i have not a moment to spare and i never in my life devoted so sew hours to rest  i have often wished for miss clements to be with us and so i told her sir charles spoke very handsomely of her on occasion of miss grandisons saying she was a plain but good young woman she is not a beauty said he but she has qualities that are more admired than mere beauty  would she not asked lady l make a good wife for lord w there is said sir charles too great a disparity in years she has and must have too many hopes my lord ws wife will probably be confined six months out of twelve to a gouty mans chamber she must therefore be one who has outlived half her hopes she must have been acquainted with affliction and known disappointment she must consider her marriage with him though as an act of condescension yet partly as a preferment her tenderness will by this means be engaged yet her dignity supported and if she is not too much in years to bring my lord an heir he will then be the most grateful of men to her  my dear brother said miss grandison forgive me all my faults your actions your sentiments shall be the rule of mine  but who can come up to you the danbys  lord w   anybody may charlotte interrupted sir charles who will be guided by the wellknown rule of doing to others as you would they should do unto you were you in the situation of the danbys of lord w would you not wish to be done by as i have done and intend to do by them what must be those who with hungry eyes wait and wish for the death of a relation may they not be compared to savages on the seashore who look out impatiently for a wreck in order to plunder and prey upon the spoils of the miserable lord w has been long an unhappy man from want of principles i shall rojoice if i can be a means of convincing him by his own experience that he was in a wrong course and of making his latter days happy would i not in my decline wish for a nephew that had the same notions and can i expect such an one if i set not the example  pretty soon after supper sir charles left us and miss grandison seeing me in a resverie said i will lay my life harriet you fansy my brother is gone up to read your letters  nay you are in the right for he whispered as much to me before he withdrew but do not be apprehensive harriet for she saw me concerned you have nothing to fear i am sure  lady l said that her brothers notions and mine were exactly alike on every subject but yet lucy when one knows ones cause to be under actual examination one cannot but have some heartakes  yet why  if his favorite woman is a foreigner what signifies his opinion of my letters  and yet it does one would be willing to be well thought of by the worthy  letter xvii miss byron in continuation thursday mar    we sat down early to breakfast this morning miss grandison dismissed the attendants as soon as sir charles entered the room  he addressed himself to me the moment he saw me admirable miss byron said he what an entertainment have your letters given me down to a certain period  how at and after that have they distressed me for your sufferings from a savage  it is well for him and perhaps for me that i saw not sooner this latter part of your affecting story i have read through the whole parcel  he took it from his bosom and with a respectful air presented it to me  ten thousand thanks for the favor  i dare not hope for farther indulgence  yet not to say how desirous i am  but forgive me  think me not too great an incroacher   i took them  surely brother said miss grandison you cannot already have read the whole  i have  i could not leave them  i sat up late   and so thought i did your sister harriet sir  well brother said miss grandison and what are the faults  faults charlotte  such a noble heart such an amiable frankness no prudery no coquetry yet so much and so justly admired by as many as have had the happiness to approach her  then turning to me i adore madam the goodness the greatness of your heart woman is the glory of all created existence  but you madam are more than woman  how i blushed how i trembled how though so greatly flattered was i delighted  is miss byron in those letters all perfect all faultless all excellence sir charles asked miss grandison is there no  but i am sensible though you have raised my envy i assure you that miss byrons si another sort of heart than your poor charlottes  but i hope sir said i that you will correct   you called upon me yesterday interrupted he to attend to the debate between you and mr walden i think i have something to observe upon that subject i told you that beauty should not bribe me i have very few observations to make upon it  lady l will you give us brother your opinion in writing of what you have read this subject is spoken to hereafter by sir charles   sir chapter that would fill a volume and it would be almost all panegyric  how flattering  but this foreign lady lucy   lady l began another subject   pray brother said she let me revive one of the topics of yesterday  concerning lord g and sir walter watkyns  and i hope you charlotte will excuse me  miss gr if it can be revived without reviving the memory of my flippant folly  not else will i excuse you lady l and casting her eye bashfully round her dr bartlett withdrew but as if he had business to do  lady l then let me manage this article for my sister you said brother that you have engaged to give lord g either hope or otherwise   sir chapter lord g was very earnest with me for my interest with my sister i supposing that she is now absolutely disengaged did undertake to let him know what room he had for hope or if any but told him that i would not by any means endeavor to influence her  lady l charlotte is afraid that you would not of yourself from displeasure have revived the subject  not that she values   there she stopped  sir chapter i might at the time be a little petulant but i should have revived the subject because i had engaged myself to procure an answer for an absent person to a question that was of the highest importance to him but perhaps i should have entered into the subject with charlotte when we were alone  lady l she can have no objection i believe to let all of us who are present know her mind on this occasion  miss gr to be sure i have not  lady l what signifies mincing the matter i undertook at her desire to recall the subject because you had seemed to interest yourself in it  sir chapter i think i know as much of charlottes mind already from what you have hinted lady l as i ought to be inquisitive about  lady l how so brother what have i said  sir chapter what meant the words you stopped at  not that she values  now though i will not endeavor to lead her choice in behalf of a prince yet would i be earnest to oppose her marriage with a man for whom she declaredly has no value  lady l you are a little sudden upon me sir charles  sir chapter you must not think the words you stopped at lady l slight words principle and charlottes future happiness and that of a worthy man are concerned here but perhaps you mean no more than to give a little specimen of ladylike pride in those words it is a very hard matter for women on such occasions as these to be absolutely right  dear miss byron bowing to me excuse me  there is one lady in the world that ought not from what i have had the honor to see on her own account to take amiss my freedom with her sex though she perhaps will on that of those she loves but have i not some reason for what i say when even lady l speaking for her sister on this concerning subject cannot help throwing in a salvo for the pride of her sex  harriet i doubt not sir but lady l and miss grandison will explain themselves to your satisfaction  lady l then called upon her sister  miss gr why as to value  and all that  to be sure  lord g  is not a man that  and she looked round her on each person  that a woman  hem  that a woman  but brother i think you are a little too ready  to  to  a word and a blow as the saying is are two things  not that  and there she stopped  sir chapter smiling o my dear lord l what shall we say to these not that is were i my cousin everard i am not sure but i should suppose when ladies were suspending unnecessarily or with affectation the happiness of the man they resolve to marry that they were reflecting on themselves by an indirect acknowlegement of selfdenial   miss gr good god brother  i was angry at him in my mind how came this good man thought i by such thoughts as these of our sex what lucy could a woman do with such a man were he to apply to her in courtship whether she denied or accepted of him  sir chapter you will consider lady l that you and charlotte have brought this upon yourselves that i call female pride which distinguishes not either time company or occasion you will remember that lord g is not here we are all brothers and sisters and why charlotte do you approve of entering upon the subject in this company yet come with your exceptions as if lord g had his father present or pleading for him these not that she values and soforth are so like the dealings between petty chapmen and common buyers and sellers that i love properly observe that i say properly to discourage them among persons of sense and honor but come charlotte enter into your own cause you are an excellent pleader on occasion you know or at least you ought t know your own mind i never am for encouraging agency lady l excuse me  will you give up yours where principals can be present  lady l with all my heart i stumbled at the very threshold even charlotte be your own advocate the cause is on  miss gr why i dont know what to say  my brother will be so peremptory perhaps   sir chapter a good sign for somebody  dont you think so madam to me  but the snail will draw in its horns if the finger hastily touch it  come no good sign perhaps charlotte  i will not be peremptory you shall be indulged if you have not already been indulged enough in all the pretty circummabages customary on these occasions  miss gr this is charming  but pray sir what is your advice on this subject  sir chapter in our former conversation upon it i told you what i thought of my lords good humor what of your vivacity  can you charlotte were you the wife of lord g content yourself nowandthen to make him start by the lancetlike delicacy of your wit without going deeper than the skin without exposing him and yourself for doing so to the ridicule of others can you bear with his soibles if he can bear with yours and if the forbearance is greater on his side than on yours can you value him for it and for his good humor  miss gr finely run off upon my word  sir chapter i am afraid only that you will be able charlotte to do what you will with him i am sorry to have cause to say that i have seen very good women who have not known how to bear indulgence  waller was not absolutely wrong as to such when he said that women were born to be controuled if control is likely to be necessary it will be with women of such charming spirits as you know whose charlotte who will not confine to time and place their otherwise agreeable vivacities  miss gr well but sir if it should chance to be so and i were lord gs upper servant for control implies dominion what a fine advantage would he have in a brother who could direct him so well though he might still perhaps be a bechelor how to manage a wife so flippant  sir chapter bachelors charlotte are close observers it is not every married couple if they were sollicitous to have a bachelor marry that should admit him into a very close intimacy with themselves  miss gr archly pray lord l did we not once hear our cousin everard make an observation of this nature  sir chapter fairly retorted charlotte  but how came your cousin everard to make this observation i once heard you say that he was but a common observer every married pair is not lord and lady l  miss gr well well i believe married people must do as well as they can but may i ask you brother is it owing to such observations as those you have been making that you are now a single man  sir chapter a fair question from you charlotte i answer it is not  miss gr i should be glad with all my heart to know what is  sir chapter when the subject comes fairly on the carpet your curiosity may perhaps be gratified but tell me do you intend that the subject you had engaged lady l to introduce in relation to lord g and sir walter watkyns should be dismissed at present i mean not to be peremptory charlotte be not afraid to answer  miss gr why that is kind no i cannot say that i do and yet i frankly consess that i had much rather ask than answer questions you know sir that i have a wicked curiosity  sir chapter well charlotte you will find me wicked as you call it very ready at a proper time to gratify it to some things that you may want to know in relation to my situation you needed not now to have been a stranger had i had the pleasure of being more with you and had you yourself been as explicit as i would have wished you to be but the crisis is at hand when i am certain myself you shall not be in doubt i would not suppose that my happiness is a matter of indifference to my sisters and if it be not i should be ungrateful not to let them know everything i know that is likely to affect it  see lucy what can be gathered from all this but yet this speech has a noble sound with it dont you think it has it is i think worthy of sir charles grandison but by what clouds does this sun seem to be obscured he says however that the crisis is at hand  solemn words as they strike me ah lucy  but this is my prayer  may the crisis produce happiness to him let who will be unhappy  miss gr you are always good noble uniform  curiosity get thee behind me and lie still  and yet brother like a favored squirrel repulsed i am afraid it will be soon upon my shoulder if the crisis be suspended  crisis is at hand lucy  i cannot get over these words and yet they make my heart ache  sir chapter but now charlotte as to your two admirers   miss gr why sir methinks i would not be a petty if i could help it and yet what can i say  i dont think highly of either of the men  but pray now what  lady l affecting an audible whper will you ask a question for me   lady l what is it charlotte  miss gr whispering but still loud enough for every one to hear what sort of a man is beauchamp  lady l mad girl  you heard the question brother  miss gr no  you did not hear it sir if it will displease you the whispers in conversation are no more to be heard than the asides in a play  sir chapter both the one and the other are wrong charlotte whisperings in conversation are censurable to a proverb the asides as you call them and the soliloquies in a play however frequent are very poor because unnatural shifts of bungling authors to make their performances intelligible to the audience but am i to have heard your whisper charlotte or not  miss gr i think the man my brother so much esteems must be worth an hundred of such as those we have just now heard named  sir chapter well then i am supposed to be answered i presume as to the two gentlemen i will show you the letter when written that i shall send to sir walter watkyns i shall see lord g i suppose the moment he knows i am in town   miss gr the lord bless me brother  did you not say you would not be peremptory  lord l very right pray sir charles dont let my sister part with the two without being sure of a third  miss gr pray lord l do you be quiet your sister is in no hurry i do assure you  sir chapter the female drawback again lady l  not that she values  harriet well but sir charles may i without offense repeat miss grandisons question in relation to mr beauchamp  miss gr that is my dear creature  sir chapter it is impossible that miss byron can give offense  mr beauchamp is an excellent young man about fiveandtwenty not more he is brave learned sincere cheerful gentle in his manners agreeable in his person has my good miss byron any farther questions to ask your frankness of heart madam intitles you to equal frankness not a question you can ask but the answer shall be ready upon my lips  is the lady sir whom you could prefer to all others a foreign or an english lady  ah lucy and do you think i asked him this question  o no but i had a mind to startle you i could have asked it i can tell you and if it had been proper it would have been the first of questions with me yet had not the answer been such as i had liked perhaps i should not have been able to stay in company  i only bowed and i believe blushed with complacency at the kind manner in which he spoke to me every one by their eyes took notice of it with pleasure  lady l well brother and what think you of the purport of charlottes question charlotte says that she does not think highly of either of the other men  sir chapter that at present is all that concerns me to know i will write to sir walter i will let lord g know that there is a man in the clouds that charlotte waits for that ladies must not be easily won milton justifies you in his account of the behavior of your common grandmother on the first interview between her and the man for whom she was created charming copiers you miss byron are an exception you know nothing of affectation you   miss gr unseasonably interrupting him pray sir be pleased since we are such fine copiers of the old lady you mentioned to repeat the lines i have no remembrance of them  sir chapter  she heard me thus and though divinely brought he virtue and the conscience of her worth that would he wooed and not unsought be won wrough in her so that seeing me she turned i flowd her she what was honor knew and with obsequious majesty approved my pleaded reason  i have looked for the passage since lucy he missed several lines  now charlotte said sir charles though these lines are a palpable accommodation to the future practice of daughters of the old lady as you call her and perhaps intended for an instruction to them since it could not be a natural behavior in eve who was divinely brought to be the wife of adam and it being in the state of innocence could not be conscious of dishonor in receiving his address yet if you know what is meant by obsequious majesty you had as good try for it and as you are followed and should not follow approve of the pleaded reason of one or other of your admirers  miss gr after hearing the pleaded reason of both should you not say i have the choice of two that had not eve but hold i had like to have been drawn in to be flippant again and then you would have enquired after my cousin everard andsoforth and been angry  sir chapter not now charlotte we are now at play together i see there is constitution in your fault the subjects we are upon courtship and marriage cannot i find be talked seriously of by a lady before company shall i retire with you to solitude make a lovers camera obscura for you or could i place you upon the mosly bank of a purling stream gliding through an enamelled mead in such a scene a now despised lord g or a sir walter might find his account sighing at your feet no witnesses but the grazing herd lowing love around you the feathered songsters from an adjacent grove contributing to harmonize and fan the lambent flame   miss gr interrupting upon my word brother i knew you had traveled through greece but dreamt not that you had dwelt long in the fields of arcady  but one question let me ask you concerning your friend beauchamp  we women dont love to be slighted  whether do you think him too good or not good enough for your sister  sir chapter the friendship charlotte that has for some years subsisted and i hope will for ever subsist between mr beauchamp and me wants not the tie of relation to strengthen it  lord l happy beauchamp  sir chapter lord l himself is not dearer to me brother as i have the honor to call him than my beauchamp it is one of my pleasures my lord that i am assured you will love him and he you  lord l bowed delighted and if he did his good lady you may be sure partook of her lords delight they are an happy pair they want not sense they have both fine understandings but o my lucy they are not the striking dazzling qualities in men and women that make happy good sense and solid judgment a natural complacency of temper a desire of obliging and an easiness to be obliged procure the silent the serene happiness to which the fluttering tumultuous impetuous fervors of passion can never contribute nothing violent can be lasting  miss gr not that i value  there brother  you see i am a borrower of lady l   lady l upon m honor charlotte i believe you led me into those words so dont say you borrowed them  sir chapter far be it from me to endeavor to cure women of affectation on such subjects as that which lately was before us  i dont know what is become of it looking humourously round as if he had lost something which he wanted to recover but that permit me ladies to say may be an affectation in one company that is but a necessary reserve in another  charlotte has genius enough i am sure to vary her humor to the occasion and i she would give herself time for reflection to know when to be grave when to be airy  miss gr i dont know that brother but let me say for charlotte that i believe you sometimes think better of her as in the present case sometimes worse than she deserves charlotte has not much reflection she is apt to speak as the humor comes upon her without considering much about the fit or the unfit it is constitution you know brother and she cannot easily cure it but she will try  only sir be so good as to let me have an answer to my last question whether you think your friend too good or not good enough because the answer will let me know what my brother thinks of me and that let me tell you is of very high importance with me  sir chapter you have no reason charlotte to endeavor to come at this your end by indirect or comparative means your brother loves you   miss gr with all my faults sir   sir chapter with all your faults my dear and i had almost said for some of them i love you for the pretty playfulness on serious subjects with which you puzzle yourself and bewilder me you see i follow your lead as to the other part of your question for i would always answer directly when i can my friend beauchamp deserves the best of women you are excellent in my eyes but i have known two very worthy persons who taken separately have been admired by every one who knew them and who admired each other before marriage yet not happy in it  miss gr is it possible to what could their unhappiness be owing  both i suppose continuing good  sir chapter to an hundred almost nameless reasons  too little consideration on one side too much on the other diversions different too much abroad the man  too much at home will sometimes have the same effect acquaintance approved by the one  disapproved by the other one liking the town the other the country or either preferring town or country in different humors or at different times of the year human nature charlotte   miss gr no more no more i beseech you brother  why this human nature i believe is a very vile thing i think lady l i will not marry at all  sir chapter some such trifles as these i have enumerated will be likely to make you charlotte with all your excellencies not so happy as i wish you to be if you cannot have a man of whose understanding you have an higher opinion than of your own you should think of one who is likely to allow to yours a superiority if   miss grandison interrupted him again i wished she would not so often interrupt him i wanted to find out his notions of our sex i am afraid with all his politeness he thinks us poor creatures but why should not the character of a good a prudent woman be as great as that of a good a prudent man  miss gr well but sir i suppose the gentleman abroad has more understanding than i have  sir chapter a good deal will depend upon what you will think of that not what i or the world will judge  miss gr but the judgment of us women generally goes with the world  sir chapter not generally in matrimonial instances a wife in general may allow of a husbands superior judgment but in particular cases and as they fall out one by one the man may find it difficult to have at allowed in any one instance  miss gr i think you said sir that batchelors were close observers  sir chapter we may in the sister sometimes see the wife i admire you myself for your vivacity but i am not sure that a husband would not think himself hurt by it especially if it be true as you say that charlotte has not much reflection and is apt to speak as the humor comes upon her without troubling herself about the fit or the unfit  miss gr o sir what a memory you have i hope that the man who is to call me his that is the dialect int it will not have half your memory  sir chapter for his sake or your own do you hope this charlotte  miss gr let me see  why for both our sakes i believe  sir chapter you will tell the man in courtship i hope that all this liveliness is constitution and that you know not how to cure it  miss gr no by no means sir let him in the mistress as somebody else in the sister guess at the wife and take warning  sir chapter very well answered charlotte in the play we are at but i am willing to think highly of my sisters prudence and that she will be happy and make the man so to whom she may think fit to give her hand at the altar and now the question recurs what shall i say to lord g what to sir walter  miss gr why i think you must make my compliments to sir walter if you will be so good and after the example of my sister harriet to the men she sends a grazing very civilly tell him he may break his heart as soon as he pleases for that i cannot be his  sir chapter strange girl but i wish not to lower this lively spirit  you will put your determination into english  miss gr in plain english then i can by no means think of encouraging the address of sir walter watkyns  sir chapter well and what shall i say to lord g  miss gr why that is the thing  i was afraid it would come to this  why sir you must tell him i think  i profess i cannot tell what  but sir will you let me know what you would have me tell him  sir chapter i will follow your lead as far as i can  can you do you think love lord g  miss gr love him love lord g what a question is that  why no i verily believe that i cannot say that  sir chapter can you esteem him  miss gr esteem  why that is a quaint word though a female one i believe if i were to marry the honest man i could be civil to him if he would be very complaisant very observant and all that  pray brother dont however be angry with me  sir chapter i will not charlotte smiling it is constitution you say  but if yu cannot be more than civil and if he is to be very observant you will make it your agreement with him before you meet him at the altar that he shall subscribe to the womans part of the vow and that you shall answer to the mans  miss gr a good thought i believe i will consider of it if i find in courtship the man will bear it i may make the proposal  yet i dont know but it will be as well to suppose the vow changed without conditioning for it as other good women do and act accordingly one would not begin with a singularity for fear of putting the parson out i heard an excellent lady once advise a good wise who however very little wanted it to give the man a hearing and never do any thing that he would wish to be done except she chose to do it if the man loves quiet he will be glad to compound  harriet nay now miss grandison you are much more severe upon your sex and upon matrimony than sir charles  sir chapter have i been severe upon either my dear miss byron  harriet indeed i think so  sir chapter i am sorry for it i only intended to be just see charlotte what a censure from goodness itself you draw upon me  but i am to give encouragement am i to lord g  miss gr do as you please sir  sir chapter that is saying nothing is there a man in the world you prefer to lord g  miss gr in the world sir  a very wide place i profess  sir chapter you know what i mean by it  miss gr why no  yes  no  what can i say to such a question  sir chapter help me lady l you know better than i charlottes language help me to understand it  lady l i believe brother you may let lord g know that he will not be denied an audience if he come   sir chapter will not be denied an audience if he come and this to charlottes brother women women women  you miss byron i repeat with pleasure are an exception  in your letters and behavior we see what a woman is and what she ought to be  but i know as you once told sir rowland meredith that you have too much greatness of mind to accept of a compliment made you at the expense of your sex  but my heart does you justice  lord l see however brother grandison this excellence in the two sisters you say indeed but just things in praise of miss byron but they are more than women for they enjoy that praise and the acknowleged superiority of the only woman in britain to whom they can be inferior  do you think i did not thank them both for compliments so high i did  you did harriet  ah lucy i had a mind to surprise you again i did thank them but it was in downcast silence and by a glow in my cheeks that was even painful to me to feel  the sisters have since observed to me flattering ladies that their brothers eyes  but is it not strange lucy that they did not ask him in this long conversation whether his favorite of our sex is a foreigner or not if she be what signifies the eye of pleasure cast upon your harriet  but be this as it may you see lucy that the communicating of my letters to lord l and the two ladies and of some of them to their brother has rivetted the three first in my favor and done me honor with sir charles grandison  but what do you think was miss grandisons address to me on this agreeable occasion you my grandmamma will love her again i am sure though she so lately incurred your displeasure  sweet and everamiable harriet said she sister friend enjoy the just praises of two of the best of men  you can enjoy them with equal modesty and dignity and we can what say you lady l find our praise in the honor you do our sex and in being allowed to be seconds to you  and what do you think was the answer of lady l generous woman to this call of her sister  i can cheerfully said she subscribe to the visible superiority of my harriet as shown in all her letters as well as in her whole conduct but then you my lord and you my brother who in my eye are the first of men must not let me have cause to dread that your caroline is sunk in yours  i had hardly power to sit yet had less to retire as i had for a moment a thought to do i am glad i did not attempt it my return to company must have been awkward and made me look particular but lucy what is in my letters to deserve all these fine speeches  but my lord and his sisters are my true friends and zealous wellwishers no fear that i shall be too proud on this occasion it is humbling enough to reflect that the worthy three thought it all no more than necessary to establish me with somebody and yet after all if there be a foreign lady  what signify all these fine things  but how you will ask did the brother acknowledge these generous speeches of his sisters and lord l  how why as he ought to do he gave them for their generous goodness to their harriet in preference to themselves such due praises as more than restored them in my eye to the superiority they had so nobly given up  sir charles afterward addressed himself to me jointly with his sisters i see with great pleasure said he the happy understanding that there is between you three ladies it is a demonstration to me of surpassing goodness in you all to express myself in the words of an ingenious man to whose works your sex and if yours ours are more obliged than to those of any single man in the british world great souls by instinct to each other turn demand alliance and in friendship burn   the two sisters and your harriet bowed as they sat  encouraged by this happy understanding among you let me hope proceeded he that you miss byron will be so good as to inform your self and let me know what i may certainly depend upon to be our charlottes inclinations with respect to the two gentlemen who court her favor and whether there is any man that the can or does prefer to the most favored of either of them from you i shall not meet with the not that she values  the depreciating indifferences the affected slights the female circumambages if i may be allowed the words the coldlyexpressed consent to visits not deserving to be discouraged and perhaps not intended to be so that i have had to encounter with in the past conversation i have been exceedingly diverted with my sisters vivacity but as the affair is of a very serious nature as i would be extremely tender in my interposition having really no choice but hers and wanting only to know on whom that choice will fall or whether on any man at present on your noble frankness i can rely and charlotte will open her mind to you if not she has very little profited by the example you have set her in the letters you have permitted her to read  he arose bowed and withdrew miss grandison called after him brother brother brother  one word  dont leave us  but he only kissed his hand to us at the door and bowing with a smiling air left us looking at each other in a silence that held a few moments  letter xviii miss byron in continuation lord l broke the silence you are a delightful girl charlotte but your brother has had a great deal of patience with you  o my lord said she if we women play our cards right we shall be able to manage the best and wisest of you all as we please it is but persevering and you men if not out argued may be out teazed  but harriet  upon my word  the game seems to be all in your own hands  we want but my brother to be among us said lady l beauty would soon find its power and such a mind  and then they complimented me that their brother and i were born for each other  miss grandison told us all three her thoughts in relation to the alliance with lord g she said she was glad that her brother had proposed to know her mind from me something harriet said she may arise in the teteatete conversation that may let us into a little of his own  but shall i trust myself with him alone lucy indeed i am afraid of him of my self rather my own concerns so much in my head i wish i dont confound them with miss grandisons a fine piece of work shall i make of it if i do if i get it so happily over as not to be dissatisfied with my self for my part in it i shall think i have had a deliverance  but lucy if all these distinctions paid me in this conversation and all this confidence placed in me produce nothing  if  why what if in one word should this if be more than if  why then it will go the harder that is all with your harriet than if she had not been so much distinguished  at afternoontea the danbys being mentioned lord l asked sir charles what was the danger from which he relieved their uncle and we all joining in requesting particulars he gave the following which i will endeavor to repeat as near as possible in his own words my heart interested itself in the relation  mr danby said he was a merchant of equal eminence and integrity he was settled at cambray he had great dealings in the manufactures of cambricks and lace his brother john a very profligate man had demanded of him and took it ill that he denied him a thousand guineas for no better reason but because he had generously given that sum to each of the wicked mans children surely he pleaded he was as nearly related to his brother as were those his children no plea is too weak for folly and selfinterest to insist upon yet my mr danby had often given this brother large sums which he squandered away almost as soon as he received them  my father used to make remittances to mr danby for my use for his dealings in other branches of commerce extended to the south of france and italy this brought me acquainted with him  he took a great liking to me i saw him first at lions and he engaged me to visit him at cambray whenever i should go to paris or flanders  accompanying a friend soon after to paris i performed my promise  he had a villa in the cambresis at a small distance from the city which he sometimes called his cottage at others his dormitory it was a little lone house he valued it for its elegance thither after i had passed two days with him at his house in the city he carried me  his brother enraged at being refused the sum he had so unreasonably demanded formed a plot to get possession of his whole fortune my mr danby was a bachelor and it was known had to that time an aversion to the thought of making his will  the wretch in short hired three ruffians to murder him the attempt was to be made in this little house that the fact might have the appearance of being perpetrated by robbers and the cabinets in the bedchamber if there were time for it after the horrid fact was perpetrated were to be broken open and rifled in order to give credit to that appearance the villains were each to be rewarded with a thousand crowns payable on the wicked mans getting possession of his brothers fortune and they had fifty crowns apiece paid them in hand their unnatural employer waited the event at calais though he told them he should be at dunkirk  i had one servant with me who lay with a manservant of mr danby in a little room over the stable about an hundred yards from the house there were only conveniences in the house for mr danby and a friend besides two women servants in the upper part of it  about midnight i was alarmed by a noise as of violence used at the window of mr danbys room mine communicated with his the fastening of the door was a springlock the key of which was on my side  i slipped on my clothes in an instant and drawing my sword rushed into the next room just as one villain with a large knife in his hand had seized the throat of mr danby who till then was in a sound sleep the skin of his neck and one hand listed up to defend himself were slightly wounded before i ran the ruffian into the shoulder as i did with my sword and in the same moment disarmed him and threw him with violence from the bed against the door he roared out that he was a dead man  a second fellow had got up to the window and was half in he called out to a third below to hasten up after him on a ladder which was generally left in an outhouse near the little garden  i hastened to this second fellow who then fired a pistol but happily missed me and who feeling my swords point in his arm threw himself with a little of my help out of the window upon the third fellow who was mounting the ladder and knocked him off and then both made their escape by the way they came  the fellow within had fainted and lay weltering in his blood  by this time the two womenservants had let in our men who had been alarmed by the report of the pistol and by the report of the pistol and by the screams of the women from their window for they ventured not out of their chamber till they were called upon for entrance by their fellow servants from below  the two footmen by my direction bound up the ruffians shoulder they dragged him down into the hall he soon came to himself and offered to make an ample confession  poor mr danby had crept into my room and in a corner of it had fainted away we recovered him with difficulty  the fellow confessed before a magistrate the whole villainy and who set him at work the other two being disabled by their bruises from flying far were apprehended next day the vile brother was sent after to dunkirk according to the intelligence given of him by the fellows but he having informed himself of what had happened got over from calais to dover  the wounded man having lost much blood recovered not they were all three ordered to be executed but being interceded for the surviving villains were sent to the galleys  it seems they knew nothing of mr danbys having a guest with him if they had they owned they would have made their attempt another night  we were about to deliver our sentiments on this extraordinary event when sir charles turning to lady l let me ask you said he the servant being withdrawn has charlotte found out her own mind  yes yes sir i believe she has opened all her heart to miss byron  then i shall know more of it in ten minutes than charlotte would let me know in as many hours  stand by everybody said the humorous lady  let me get up and make my brother one of my best courtesies  sir charles was just then called out to a messenger who brought him letters from town he returned to us his complexion heightened and a little discomposed  i intended madam said he to me to have craved the honor of your company for half an hour in my lords library on the subject we were talking of but these letters require my immediate attention the messenger must return with my answer to two of them early in the morning you will have the goodness looking round him to dispense with my attendance on you at supper but perhaps madam to me you will be so good as in one word to say no or yes for charlotte  miss gr what sir to be given up without a preface  i beg your pardon less than ten words shall not do i assure you though from my sister harriet  sir chapter who given up charlotte yourself if so i have my answer  miss gr or lord g  i have not said which would you have my poor lord rejected by a slighting monosyllable only  lady l mad girl  miss gr why lady l dont you see that sir charles wants to take me by implication but my lord g is neither so soon lost nor charlotte so easily won harriet if you would give up yourself at a first question then i will excuse you if you give up me as easily but not else  harriet if sir charles thinks a conference upon the subject unnecessary  pray dont let us give him the trouble of holding one his time you see is very precious  can you guess lucy at the humor i was in when i said this  if you think it was a very good one you are mistaken yet i was sorry for it afterward foolish selfbetrayer why should i seem to wish for a conference with him but that was not all  to be petulant with such a one when his heart was distressed for so it proved but he was too polite too great shall i say to take notice of my petulance how little does it make me in my own eyes  had i said he ever so easily obtained a knowledge of my sisters mind i should not have known how to depend upon it were it not strengthened madam from your lips the conference therefore which you gave me hopes you would favor me with would have been absolutely necessary i hope miss byron will allow me to invite her to it tomorrow morning the intended subject of it is a very serious one with me my sisters happiness and that of a man not unworthy are concerned in it lightly as charlotte has hitherto treated it he bowed and was going  miss gr nay pray brother  you must not leave me in anger  sir chapter i do not charlotte i had rather bear with you than you should with me i see you cannot help it a lively heart is a great blessing indulge it now is your time  dear doctor said miss grandison when sir charles was gone out what can be the meaning of my brothers gravity it alarms me  dr b if goodness madam would make an heart lively sir charless would be as lively as your own but you might have perceived by his air when he entered that the letters brought him affected him too much to permit him to laugh off a light answer to a serious question  miss gr dear doctor  but i do now recollect that he entered with some little discomposure on his countenance how could i be so inattentive  harriet and i too i doubt was a little captious  dr b a very little pardon me madam  just then came in the excellent man  dr bartlett i could wish to ask you one question said he  miss gr you are angry with me brother  sir chapter no my dear  but i am afraid i withdrew with too grave an air i have been a thousand times pleased with you charlotte to one time displeased and when i have been the latter you have always known it i had something in my hand that ruffled me a little but how could patience be patience if it were not tried i wanted to say a few words to my good dr bartlett and to say truth being conscious that i had departed a little abruptly i could not be easy till i apologized in person for it therefore came to ask the favor of the doctors advice rather than request it by message  the doctor and he withdrew together  in these small instances said my lord are the characters of the heart displayed far more than in greater what excellence shines out in full luster on this unaffected and seemingly little occasion fear of offending of giving uneasiness solicitude to remove doubts patience recommended in one short sentence more forcibly than some would have done it in a long discourse as well as by example censuring himself not from a consciousness of being wrong but of being taken wrong ah my dear sister charlotte we should all edify by such an example  but i say no more  miss gr and have you nothing to say harriet  harriet very little since i have been much to blame myself yet let me remind my charlotte that her brother was displeased with her yesterday for treating too lightly a subject he had engaged in seriously and that he has been forced to refer to her friend rather than to herself to help him to the knowledge of her mind o charlotte regret you not the occasion given for the expedient and do you not yes i see you do blush for giving it yet to see him come voluntarily back when he had left us in a grave humor for fear the babies should think him angry with them o how great is he and how little are we  miss gr your servant sister harriet  you have made a dainty speech i think but great and good as my brother is we know how it comes to pass that your pretty imagination is always at work to aggrandize the man and to lower the babies  harriet i will not say another word on the subject you are not generous charlotte  she took my hand forgive me my dear  i touched too tender a string then turning to miss jervois and with the other hand taking hers why twinkles thus my girl  i charge you emily tell me all you think  i am thinking said she that my guardian is not happy to see him bear with everybody to have him keep all his troubles to himself because he would not afflict anybody and yet study to lighten and remove the troubles of everybody else  did he not say that he should be happy but for the unhappiness of other people  excellent young creature said miss grandison i love you every day better and better for the future my dear do not retire whatever subjects we talk of i see that we may confide in your discretion but well as you love your guardian say nothing to him of what women talk to women my lord l is an exception in this case he is one of us  harriet o miss grandison what a mixed character is yours how good you can be when you please and how naughty  miss gr well and you like me just now  that is the beauty of it to offend and make up at pleasure old terence was a shrewd man the falling out of lovers says he as lord l once quoted him is the renewal of love are we not now better friends than if we had never differed and do you think that i will not if i marry exercise my husbands patience nowandthen for this very purpose  let me alone harriet now a quarrel now a reconciliation i warrant i shall be happier than any of the yawning seesaws in the kingdom everlasting summers would be a grievance  harriet you may be right if you are exceeding discreet in your perversenesses charlotte and yet if you are you will not lay out for a quarrel i fansy the world or you will have better luck than your brother seems to have had will find you opportunities enough for exercising the tempers of both without your needing to study for occasions  miss gr study for them harriet i shant study for them neither they will come of course  harriet i was about to ask a question  but it is better let alone  miss gr i will have it what was your question dont you see what a goodnatured fool i am you may say anything to me i will not be angry  harriet i was going to ask you if you were ever concernd two hours together for any fault you ever committed in your life  miss gr yes yes yes and for twoandtwenty hours for sometimes the inconveniences that followed my errors were not presently over as in a certain case which i will be hanged if you have not in your head with that fly leer that shows the rogue in your heart but when i got rid of consequences no bird in spring was ever more blyth i carolled away every care at my harpsichord  but emily will think me mad  remember child that miss byron is the woman by whose mind you are to form yours never regard me when she is in company  but now and she whimsically arose and opened the door and saying begone shut it and coming to her place i have turned my folly out of door  friday morn seven oclock i have written for these two days passed at every opportunity and for the two nights hardly knowing what sleepiness was two hours each night have contetned me i wonder whether i shall be summoned byandby to the proposed conference but i am equally sorry and apprehensive on occasion of the letters which have given sir charles grandison so much anxiety foreign letters i doubt not  i wish this ugly word foreign were blotted out of my vocabulary out of my memory rather i never till of late was so narrowhearted  but that i have said before twenty times  i have written  how many sheets of paper  a monstrous letter  packet rather i will begin a new one with what shall offer this day adieu till by and by my lucy   letter xix miss byron in continuation friday march    the conference the impatiently expected conference my lucy is over and what is the result  take the account of it as it was brought on proceeded with and concluded miss grandison and her lovers were not our only subjects i will soon be with you my dear  but i will try to be as minute as i used to be notwithstanding  notwithstanding what   you shall hear lucy  sir charles gave us his company at breakfast he entered with a kind of benign solemnity in his countenance but the benignity increased and the solemnity went off after a little while  my lord said he was very sorry that he had met with anything to disturb him in the letters that were brought him yesterday emily joined by her eyes though not in speech her concern with his lordships miss grandison was sedately serious lady l had expectation in her fine face and dr bartlett sat like a man that was determined to be silent i had apprehension and hope i suppose struggling in mine as i knew not whether to wish for the expected conference or not my cheeks as i felt in a glow  let us think of nothing my lord in this company said he but what is agreeable  he enquired kindly of my health and last nights rest because of a slight cold that had affected my voice of emily why she was so sad of lady l and my lord when they went to town of miss grandison why she looked so meditatingly that was his word  dont you see miss byron said he that charlotte looks as if she had not quite settled the humor she intends to be in for the next halfhour  charlotte looks i believe sir replied she as if she were determined to take her humor for the next halfhour from yours whether grave or airy  then returned he i will not be grave because i will not have you so  may i hope madam byandby addressing himself to me for the honor of your hand to my lords library  sir i will  i will  attend you  hesitated the simpleton but she cannot tell how she looked  thus lucy was the matter brought on  he conducted me to my lords library  how did i struggle with myself for presence of mind what a mixture was there of tenderness and respect in his countenance and air  he seated me then took his place over against me i believe i looked down and conscious and silly but there was such a respectful modesty in his looks that one could not be uneasy at being now and then with an air of languor as i thought contemplated by him especially as whenever i reared my eyelids to cast a momentary look at him as he spoke i was always sure to see his eye withdrawn this gave more freedom to mine than it possibly otherwise could have had what a bold creature lucy ought she to be who prefers a bold man if she be not bold how silly must she look under his staring confident eye how must her want of courage add to his and of course to his selfconsequence  thus he began the subject we were to talk of  i will make no apology for requesting the favor of this conference with one of the most frank and openhearted young ladies in the world i shall have the honor perhaps of detaining your ear on more than one subject how my heart throbbed but that which i shall begin with relates to my lord g and our sister charlotte i observe from hints thrown out by herself as well as from what lady l said that she intends to encourage his addresses but it is easy to see that she thinks but slightly of him i am indeed apprehensive that she is rather induced to favor my lord from an opinion that he has my interest and good wishes than from her own inclination i have told her more than once that here is are and shall be mine but such is her vivacity that it is very difficult for me to know her real mind i take it for granted that she prefers my lord to sir walter  i believe sir  but why should i say believe when miss grandison has commissioned me to own that lord g is a man whom she greatly prefers to sir walter watkyns  does she can she do you think madam prefer lord g not only to sir walter but to all the men whom she at present knows in other words is there any man that you think she would prefer to lord g i am extremely sollicitous for my sisters happiness and the more because of her vivacity which i am afraid will be thought less to become the wife than the single woman  i dare say sir that if miss grandison thought of any other man in preference to lord g she would not encourage his addresses upon any account  i dont expect madam that a woman of charlottes spirit and vivacity who has been disappointed by a sailure of supposed merit in her first love if we may so call it should be deeply in love with a man that has not very striking qualities she can play with a flame now and not burn her fingers lord g is a worthy though not a very brilliant man ladies have eyes and the eye expects to be gratified hence men of appearance succeed often where men of intrinsic merit fail were charlotte to consult her happiness possibly she would have no objection to lord g she cannot in the same man have everything but if lord g consulted his i dont know whether he would wish for charlotte excuse me madam you have heard as well as she my opinion of both men sir walter you say has no part in the question lord g wants not understanding he is a man of probity he is a virtuous man a quality not to be despised in a young nobleman he is also a mild man he will bear a great deal but contempt or such a behavior as should look like contempt in a wife what husband can bear i should much more dread for her sake the exasperated spirit of a meek man than the sudden gusts of anger of a passionate one  miss grandison sir has authorized me to say that if you approve of lord gs addresses and will be so good as to take upon yourself the direction of everything relating to settlements she will be entirely governed by you miss grandison sir has known lord g some time his good character is well known and i dare answer that she will acquit herself with honor and prudence in every engagement but more especially in that which is the highest of all worldly ones  pray madam may i ask if you know what she could mean by the questions she put in relation to mr beauchamp i think she has never seen him does she suppose from his character that she could prefer him to lord g  i believe sir what she said in relation to that gentleman was purely the effect of her vivacity and which she never thought of before and probably never will again had she meant anything by it i dare say she would not have put the questions about him in the manner she did  i believe so i love my sister and i love my friend mr beauchamp has delicacy i could not bear for her sake that were she to behold him in the light hinted at he should imagine he had reason to think slightly of my sister for the correspondence she carried on in so private a manner with a man absolutely unworthy of her but i hope she meant nothing but to give way to that vein of raillery which when opened she knows not always how to stop  my spirits were not high i was forced to take out my handkerchief  o my dear miss grandison said i i was afraid she had forfeited partly at least what she holds most dear the good opinion of her brother  forgive me madam it is a generous pain that i have made you suffer i adore you for it but i think i can reveal all the secrets of my heart to you your noble frankness calls for equal frankness you would inspire it where it is not my sister as i told her more than once in your hearing has not lost any of my love i love her with all her faults but must not be blind to them shall not praise and dispraise be justly given i have faults great faults myself what should i think of the man who called them virtues how dangerous would it be to me in that case were my opinion of his judgment joined to selfpartiality to lead me to believe him and acquit my self  this sir is a manner of thinking worthy of sir charles grandison  it is worthy of every man my good miss byron  but sir it would be very hard that an indiscretion i must own it to be such should fasten reproach upon a woman who recovered herself so soon and whose virtue was never sullied or in danger  indeed it would and therefore it was in tenderness to her that i intimated that i never could think of promoting an alliance with a man of his nice notions were both to incline to it  i hope sir that my dear miss grandison will run no risque of being slighted by any other man from a step which has cost her so dear in her peace of mind  i hesitated and looked down  i know madam what you mean although i love my friend beauchamp above all men yet would i do lord g or any other man as much justice as i would do him i was so apprehensive of my sisters indifference to lord g and of the difference in their tempers though both good that i did my utmost to dissuade him from thinking of her and when i found that his love was fixed beyond the power of dissuasion i told him of the affair between her and captain anderson and how lately i had put an end to it he flattered himself that the indifference with which she had hitherto received his addresses was principally owing to the difficulty of her situation which being now so happily removed he had hopes of meeting with encouragement and doubted not if he did of making a merit with her by his affection and gratitude and now madam give me your opinion  do you think charlotte can be won i hope she can by indulgence by love let me caution her by you madam that it is fit she should still more restrain herself if she marry a man to whom she thinks she has superior talents than she need do if the difference were in his favor  permit me to add that if she should show herself capable of returning slight for tenderness of taking such liberties with a man who loves her after she had given him her vows as should depreciate him and of consequence herself in the eye of the world i should be apt to forget that i had more than one sister for in cases of right and wrong we ought not to know either relation or friend  does not this man lucy show us that goodness and greatness are synonymous words  i think sir replied i that if lord g prove the goodnatured man he seems to be if he dislike not that brilliancy of temper in his lady which he seems not to value himself upon though he may have qualities at least equally valuable i have no doubt but miss grandison will make him very happy for has she not great and good qualities is she not generous and perfectly good natured you know sir that she is and can it be supposed that her charming vivacity will ever carry her so far beyond the bounds of prudence and discretion as to make her forget what the nature of the obligation she will have entered into requires of her  well madam then i may rejoice the heart of lord g by telling him that he is at liberty to visit my sister at her coming to town or if she come not soon for he will be impatient to wait on her at colnebrooke  i dare say you may sir  as to articles and settlements i will undertake for all those things but be pleased to tell her that she is absolutely at her own liberty for me if she shall think when she sees farther of lord gs temper and behavior that she cannot esteem him as a wife ought to esteem her husband i shall not be concerned if she dismiss him provided that she keeps him not on in suspense after she knows her own mind but behaves to him according to the example set her by the best of women  i could not but know to whom he designed this compliment and had like to have bowed but was glad i did not  well madam and now i think this subject is concluded i have already written a letter to sir walter as at the request of my sister to put an end in the civillest terms to his hopes my lord g will be impatient for my return to town i shall go with the more pleasure because of the joy i shall be able to give him  you must be very happy sir since besides the pleasure you take in doing good for its own sake you are entitled to partake in a very high manner of the pleasures of every one you know  he was so nobly modest lucy that i could talk to him with more confidence than i believed at my entrance into my lords study would fall to my share and i had besides been led into a presence of mind by being made a person of some consequence in the lovecase of another but i was soon to have my whole attention engaged in a subject still nearer to my heart as you shall hear  indeed madam said he i am not very happy in myself is it not right then to endeavor by promoting the happiness of others to entitle myself to a share of theirs  if you are not happy sir  and i stopped i believe sighed i looked down i took out my handkerchief for fear i should want it  there seems said he to be a mixture of generous concern and kind curiosity in one of the loveliest and most intelligent faces in the world my sisters have in your presence expressed a great deal of the latter had i not been myself in a manner uncertain as to the event that must in some measure govern my future destiny i would have gratified it especially as my lord l has of late joined in it the crisis i told them however as perhaps you remember was at hand  i do remember you said so sir and indeed lucy it was more than perhaps i had not thought of any words half so often since he spoke them  the crisis madam is at hand and i had not intended to open my lips upon the subject till it was over except to dr bartlett who knows the whole affair and indeed every affair of my life but as i hinted before my heart is opened by the frankness of yours if you will be sogood as to indulge me i will briefly lay before you a few of the difficulties of my situation and leave it to you to communicate or not at your pleasure what i shall relate to my two sisters and lord l you four seem to be animated by one soul  i am extremely concerned sir  i am very much concerned  repeated the trembling simplton one cheek feeling to myself very cold the other glowingly warm by turns and now pale now crimson perhaps to the eye that anything should make you unhappy but sir i shall think myself favored by your confidence  i am interrupted in my recital of his affecting narration dont be impatient lucy i almost wih i had not myself heard it  letter xx miss byron in continuation i do not intend madam to trouble you with an history of all that part of my life which i was obliged to pass abroad from about the seventeenth to near the twentyfifth year of my age though perhaps it has been as busy a period as could well be in the life of a man so young and who never sought to trea in oblique or crooked paths after this enrance into it dr bartlett shall be at liberty to satisfy your curiosity in a more particular manner for he and i have corresponded for years with an intim cy that has few examples between a youth and a man in advanced life and here let me own the advantage i have received from his condescension for i found the following questions often occur to me and to be of the highest service in the conduct of my life  what account shall i give of this to dr bartlett how were i to give way to this temptation shall i report it to dr bartlett  or shall i be an hypocrite and only inform him of the best and meanly conceal from him the worst  thus madam was dr bartlett in the place of a second conscience to me and many a good thing did i do many a bad one avoid for having set up such a monitor over my conduct and it was the more necessary that i should as i am naturally passionate proud ambitious and as i had the honor of being early distinguished pardon madam the seeming vanity by a sex of which no man was ever a greater admirer and possibly the more distinguished as for my safetysake i was as studious to decline intimacy with the gay ones of it however dignified by rank or celebrated for beauty as most young men are to cultivate their favor  nor is it so much to be wondered at that i had advantages which everyone who travels has not residing for some time at the principal courts and often visiting the same places in the length of time i was abroad i was considered in a manner as a native at the same time that i was treated with the respect that is generally paid to travelers of figure as well in france as italy i was very genteelly supported i stood in high credit with my countrymen to whom i had many ways of being serviceable they made known to everybody my fathers affection for me his magnificent spirit the ancient families on both sides from which i was descended i kept the best company avoided intrigues made not myself obnoxious to serious or pious people though i scrupled not to avow when called upon my own principles from all these advantages i was respected beyond my degree  i should not madam have been thus lavish in my own praise but to account to you for the favor i stood in with several families of the first rank and to suggest an excuse for more than one of them which thought it no disgrace to wish me to be allied with them  lord l mentioned to you madam and my sisters a florentine lady by the name of olivia she is indeed a woman of high qualities nobly born gonerous amiable in her features genteel in her person and mistress of a great fortune in possession which is entirely at her own disposal having not father mother brother or other near relations the first time i saw her was at the opera an opportunity offered in her sight where a lady insulted by a lover made desperate by her just refusal of him claimed and received my protection what i did on the occasion was generally applauded olivia in particular spoke highly of it twice afterward i saw her in company where i was a visiter i had not the presumption to look up to her with hope but my countryman mr jervois gave me to understand that i might be master of my own fortune with lady olivia i pleaded difference of religion he believed he said that matter might be made easy  but could i be pleased with the change would she have made it when passion not conviction was likely to be the motive  there could be no objection to her person nobody questioned her virtue but she was violent and imperious in her temper i had never left mind out of my notions of love i could not have been happy with her had she been queen of the globe i had the mortification of being obliged to declare myself to the ladys face it was a mortification to me as much for her sake as my own i was obliged to leave florence upon it for some time having been apprized that the spirit of revenge had taken place of a gentler passion and that i was in danger fromit  how often did i lament the want of that refuge in a fathers arms and in my native country which subjected me to evils that were more than a match for my tender years and to all the inconveniences that can attend a banished man indeed i often considered myself in this light and as the inconveniences happened was ready to repine and the more ready as i could not afflict myself with the thought of having forfeited my fathers love on the contrary as the constant instances which i received of his paternal goodness made me still more earnest to acknowledge it at his feet  ought i to have forborne lucy showing a sensibility at my eyes on this affecting instance of filial gratitude if i ought i wish i had had more command of myself but consider my dear the affecting subject we were upon i was going to apologize for the trickling tear and to have said as i truly might your filial goodness sir affects me but with the consciousness that must have accompanied the words would not that to so nice a discerner have been to own that i thought the tender emotion wanted an apology these little tricks of ours lucy may satisfy our own punctilio and serve to keep us in countenance with ourselves and that indeed is doing something but to a penetrating eye they tend only to show that we imagined a cover a veil wanting and what is that veil but a veil of gauze  what makes me so much afraid of this mans discernment am i not an honest girl lucy  he proceeded  from this violent lady i had great trouble and to this day  but this part of my story i leave to dr bartlett to acquaint you with i mention it as a matter that yet gives me concern for her sake and as what i find has given some amusement to my sister charlottes curiosity  bu i hasten to the affair which of all others has most embarrassed me and which engaging my compassion though my honor is free gives torture to my very soul  i found myself not well  i thought i should have fainted  the apprehension of his taking it as i wished him not to take it for indeed lucy i dont think it was that made me worse had i been myself this faintishness might have come over my heart i am sure it was not that but it seized me at a very unlucky moment you will say  with a countenance full of tender concern he caught my hand and rang in ran his emily my dear miss jervois said i leaning upon her  excuse me sir  and i withdrew to the door and when there finding my faintishness going off i turned to him who attended me thither i am better sir already i will return instantly i must beg of you to proceed with your interesting story  i was well the moment i was out of the study it was kept too warm i believe and i sat too near the fire that was it to be sure and i said so on my return which was the moment i had drank a glass of cold water  how tender was his regard for me he did not abash me by causlesly laying my disorder on his story and by offering to discontinue or postpone it indeed lucy it was not owing to that i should easily have distinguished it if it had on the contrary as i am not generally so much affected at the moment when anything unhappy befalls me as i am upon reflection when i extend compare and weigh consequences i was quite brave in my heart anything thought i is better than suspense now will my fortitude have a call to exert itself and i warrant i bear as well as he an evil that is inevitable at this instant this trying instant however i found myself thus brave so my dear it was nothing but the too great warmth of the room which overcame me  i endeavored to assume all my courage and desired him to proceed but held by the arm of my chair to steady me lest my little tremblings should increase the faintness had left some little tremblings upon me lucy and one would not care you know to be thought affected by anything in his story he proceeded  at bologna and in the neighborhood of urbino are seated two branches of a noble family marquises and counts of porretta which boasts its pedigree from roman princes and has given to the church two cardinals one in the latter age the other in the beginning of this  the marchese della poretta who resides in bologna is a nobleman of great merit his lady is illustrious by descent and still more so for her goodness of heart sweetness of temper and prudence they have three sons and a daughter   ah that daughter thought i  the eldest of the sons is a general officers in the service of the king of the two sicilies a man of equal honor and bravery but passionate and haughty valuing himself on his descent the second is devoted to the church and is already a bishop the interest of his family and his own merits it is not doubted will one day if he lives give him a place in the sacred college the third signor jeronymo or as he is sometimes called the barone della porretta has a regiment in the service of the king of sardinia the sister is the favorite of them all she is lovely in her person gentle in her manners and has high but just notions of the nobility of her descent of the honor of her sex and of what is due to her own character she is pious charitable beneficent her three brothers preferred her interests to their own her father used to call her the pride of his life her mother her other self her own clementina  clementina  ah lucy what a pretty name is clementina  i became intimate with signor jeronymo at rome near two years before i had the honor to be known to the rest of his family except by his report which he made run very high in my favor he was master of many fine qualities but had contracted friendship with a set of dissolute young men of rank with whom he was very earnest to make me acquainted i allowed myself to be often in their company but as they were totally abandoned in their morals it was in hopes by degrees to draw him from them but a love of pleasure had got fast hold of him and his other companions prevailed over his goodnature he had courage but not enough to resist their libertine attacks upon his morals  such a friendship could not hold while each stood his ground and neither would advance to meet the other in short we parted nor held a correspondence in absence but afterward meeting by accident at padua and jeronymo having in the interim been led into inconveniences he avowed a change of principles and the friendship was renewed  it however held not many months a lady less celebrated for virtue than beauty obtained an influence over him against warning against promise  on being expostulated with and his promise claimed he resented the friendly freedom he was passionate and on this occasion less polite than it was natural for him to be he even defied his friend my dear jeronymo how generously has he acknowleged since the part his friend at that time acted but the result was they parted resolving never more to see each other  jeronymo pursued the adventure which had occasioned the difference and one of the ladys admirers envying him his supposed success hired brescian bravoes to assassinate him  the attempt was made in the cremonese they had got him into their toils in a little thicket at some distance from the road i attended by two servants happened to be passing when a frighted horse ran across the way his bridle broken and his saddle bloody this making me apprehend some mischief to the rider i drove down the opening he came from and soon beheld a man struggling on the ground with two ruffans one of whom was just stopping his mouth the other stabbing him i leapt out of the postchaise and drew my sword running toward them as fast as i could and calling to my servants to follow me indeed calling as if i had a number with me in order to alarm them on this they fled and i heard them say let us make off we have done his business incensed at the villainy i pursued and came up with one of them who turned upon me i beat down his trombone a kind of blunderbuss just as he presented it at me and had wounded and thrown him on the ground but seeing the other russian turning back to help his fellow and on a sudden two others appearing with their horses i thought it best to retreat though i would sain have secured one of them my servants then seeing my danger hastened shouting toward me the bravoes perhaps apprehending there were more than two seemed as glad to get off with their rescued companion as i was to retire i hastened then to the unhappy man but how much was i surprised when i found him to be the barone della porretta who in disguise had been actually pursuing his amor  he gave signs of life i instantly dispatched one of my servants to cremona for a surgeon i bound up mean time as well as i could two of his wounds one in his shoulder the other in his breast he had one in his hipjoint that disabled him from helping himself and which i found beyond my skill to do anything with only endeavoring with my handkerchief to stop its bleeding i helped him into my chaise stepped in with him and held him up in it till one of my men told me they had in another part of the thicket found his servant bound and wounded his horse lying dead by his side i then alighted and put the poor fellow into the chaise he being stiff with his hurts and unable to stand  i walked by the side of it and in this manner moved toward cremona in order to shorten the way of the expected surgeon  my servant soon returned with one jeronymo had sainted away the surgeon dressed him and proceeded with him to cremona then it was that opening his eyes he beheld and knew me and being told by the sugeon that he owed his preservation to me o grandison said he that i had followed your advice that i had kept my promise with you  how did i insult you  can my deliverer forgive me you shall be the director of my future life if it please god to restore me  his wounds proved not mortal but he never will be the man he was partly from his having been unskilfully treated by this his first surgeon and partly from his own impatience and the difficulty of curing the wound in his hipjoint excuse this particularity madam the subject requires it and signor jeronymo now deserves it and all your pity  i attended him at cremona till he was fit to remove he was visited there by his whole family from bologna there never was a family more affectionate to one another the suffering of one is the suffering of every one the barone was exceedingly beloved by his father mother sister for the sweetness of his manners his affectionate heart and a wit so delightfully gay and lively that his company was sought by everybody  you will easily believe madam from what i have said how acceptable to the whole family the service was which i had been so happy as to render their jeronymo they all joined to bless me and the more when they came to know that i was the person whom their jeronymo in the days of our intimacy had highly extolled in his letters to his sister and to both brothers and who now related to them by word of mouth the occasion of the coldness that had passed between us with circumstances as honorable for me as the contrary for himself such were his penitential confessions in the desperate condition to which he found himself reduced  he now as i attended by his bed or his couchside frequently called for a repetition of those arguments which he had till now derided he besought me to forgive him for treating them before with levity and me with disrespect next as he said to insult and he begged his family to consider me not only as the preserver of his life but as the restorer of his morals this gave the whole family the highest opinion of mine and still more to strengthen it the generous youth produced to them though as i may say at his own expense for his reformation was sincere a letter which i wrote to lie by him in hopes to enforce his temporary convictions for he had a noble nature and a lively sense of what was due to his character and to the love and piety of his parents the bishop and his sister though he was loath to think he could be wrong in those pursuits in which he was willing to indulge himself  never was there a more grateful family the noble father was uneasy because he know not how to acknowledge according to the largeness of his heart to a man in genteel circumstances the obligation laid upon them all the mother with a freedom more amiably great than the italian ladies are accustomed to express bid her clementina regard as her fourth brother the preserver of the third the barone declared that he should never rest nor recover till he had got me rewarded in such manner as all the world should think i had honor done me in it  when the barone was removed to bologna the whole family were studious to make occasions to get me among them the general made me promise when my relations as he was pleased to express himself at bologna could part with me to give him my company at naples the bishop who passed all the time he had to spare from his diocese at bologna and who is a learned man in compliment to his fourth brother would have me initiate him into the knowledge of the english tongue  our milton has deservedly a name among them the friendship that there was between him and a learned nobleman of their country endeared his memory to them milton therefore was a principal author with us our lectures were usually held in the chamber of the wounded brother in order to divert him he also became my scholar the father and mother were often present and at such times their clementina was seldom absent she also called me her tutor and though she was not half so often present at the lectures as they were made a greater proficiency than either of her brothers  do you doubt it lucy  the father as well as the bishop is learned the mother well read she had had the benefit of a french education being brought up by her uncle who resided many years at paris in a public character and her daughter had under her own eye advantages in her education which are hardly ever allowed or sought after by the italian ladies in such company you may believe madam that i who was kept abroad against my wishes passed my time very agreeably i was particularly honored with the confidence of the marchioness who opened her heart to me and consulted me on every material occurrence her lord who is one of the politest of men was never better pleased than when he found us together and not seldom though we were not engaged in lectures the fair clementina claimed a right to be where her mother was  about this time the young count of belvedere returned to parma in order to settle in his native country his father was a favorite in the court of the princess of parma and attended that lady to madrid on her marriage with the late king of spain where he held a very considerable post and lately died there immensely rich on a visit to this noble family the young lord saw and loved clementina  the count of belvedere is a handsome a gallant a sensible man his fortune is very great such an alliance was not to be slighted the marquis gave his countenance to it the marchioness favored me with several conversations upon the subject she was of opinion perhaps that it was necessary to know my thoughts on this occasion for the younger brother unknown to me declared that he thought there was no way of rewarding my merits to the family but by giving me a relation to it dr bartlett madam can show you from my letters to him some conversations which will convince you that in italy as well as in other countries there are persons of honor of goodness of generosity and who are above reserve vindictiveness jealousy and those other bad passions by which some persons mark indiscriminately a whole nation  for my own part it was impossible distinguished as i was by every individual of this noble family and lovely as is this daughter of it mistress of a thousand good qualities and myself absolutely disengaged in my affections that my vanity should not sometimes be awakened and a wish arise that there might be a possibility of obtaining such a prize but i checked the vanity the moment i could find it begin to play about and warm my heart to have attempted to recommend myself to the young ladys favor though but by looks by assiduities i should have thought an infamous breach of the trust and confidence they all reposed in me  the pride of a family so illustrious in its descent their fortunes unusually high for the country which by the goodness of their hearts they adorned the relation they bore to the church my foreign extraction and interest the ladys exalted merits which made her of consequence to the hearts of several illustrious youths before the count of belvedere made known his passion for her none of which the fond family thought worthy of their clementina nor any of whom could engage her heart but above all the difference in religion the young lady so remarkably steadfast in hers that it was with the utmost difficulty they could restrain her from assuming the veil and who once declared in anger on hearing me when called upon avow my principles that she grudged to an heretic the glory of having saved the barone della poretta all these considerations outweighed any hopes that might otherwise have arisen in a bosom so sensible of the favors they were continually heaping upon me  about the same time the troubles now so happily appeased broke out in scotland hardly any thing else was talked of in italy but the progress and supposed certainty of success of the young invader i was often obliged to stand the triumphs and exultations of persons of rank and figure being known to be warm in the interest of my country i had a good deal of this kind of spirit to contend with even in this more moderate italian family and this frequently brought on debates which i would gladly have avoided holding but it was impossible every new advice from england revived the disagreeable subject for the success of the rebels it was not doubted would be attended with the restoration of what they called the catholic religion and clementina particularly pleased herself that then her heretic tutor would take refuge in the bosom of his holy mother the church and she delighted to say things of this nature in the language i was teaching her and which by this time she spoke very intelligibly  i took a resolution hereupon to leave italy for a while and to retire to vienna or to some one of the german courts that was less interested than they were in italy in the success of the chevaliers undertaking and i was the more desirous to do so as the displeasure of olivia against me began to grow serious and to be talked of even by herself with less discretion than was consistent with her high spirit her noble birth and ample fortune  i communicated my intention to the marchioness first the noble lady expressed her concern at the thoughts of my quitting italy and engaged me to put off my departure for some weeks but at the same time hinted to me with an explicitness that is peculiar to her her apprehensions and her lords that i was in love with her clementina i convinced her of my honor in this particular and she so well satisfied the marquis in this respect that on their daughters absolute refusal of the count of belvedere they confided in me to talk to her in favor of that gentleman the young lady and i had a conference upon the subject dr bartlett can give you the particulars the father and mother unknown to us both had placed themselves in a closet adjoining to the room we were in and which communicated to another as well as to that they had no reason to be dissatisfied with what they heard me say to their daughter  the time of my departure from italy drawing near and the young lady repeatedly refusing the count of belvidere the younger brother still unknown to me for he doubted not but i should rejoice at the honor he hoped to prevail upon them to do me declared in my favor they objected the more obvious difficulties in relation to religion and my country he desired to be commissioned to talk to me on those subjects and to his sister on her motives for refusing the count of belvedere but they would not hear of his speaking to me on this subject the marchioness giving generous reasons on my behalf for her joining in the refusal and undertaking herself to talk to her daughter and to demand of her her reasons for rejecting every proposal that had been made her  she accordingly closetted her clementina she could get nothing from her but tears a silence without the least appearance of sullenness had for some days before shown that a deep melancholy had begun to lay hold of her heart she was however offended when love was attributed to her yet her mother told me that she could not but suspect that she was under the dominion of that passion without knowing it and the rather as she was never cheerful but when she was taking lessons for learning a tongue that never as the marchioness said was likely to be of use to her  as the marchioness said  ah my lucy  the melancholy increased her tutor as he was called was desired to talk to her he did it was a task put upon him that had its difficulties it was observed that she generally assumed a cheerful air while she was with him but said little yet seemed pleased with everything he said to her and the little she did answer though he spoke in italian or french was in her newlyacquired language but the moment he was gone her countenance fell and she was studious to find opportunities to get from company  what think you of my sortitude lucy was i not a good girl but my curiosity kept up my spirits when i come to reflect thought i i shall have it all upon my pillow  her parents were in the deepest affliction they consulted physicians who all pronounced her malady to be love she was taxed with it and all the indulgence promised her that her heart could wish as to the object but still she could not with patience bear the imputation once she asked her woman who told her that she was certainly in love would you have me hate myself  her mother talked to her of the passion in favorable terms and as laudable she heard her with attention but made no answer  the evening before the day i was to set out for germany the family made a sumptuous entertainment in honor of a guest on whom they had conferred so many favors they had brought themselves to approve of his departure the more readily as they were willing to see whether his absence would affect their clementina and if it did in what manner  they left it to her choice whether she would appear at table or not she chose to be there they all rejoiced at her recovered spirits she was exceeding cheerful she supported her part of the conversation during the whole evening with her usual vivacity and good sense insomuch that i wished to myself i had departed sooner yet it is surprising thought i that this young lady who seemed always to be pleased and even since these resveries have had power over her to be most cheerful in my company should rejoice in my departure should seem to owe her recovery to it a departure which every one else kindly regrets and yet there was nothing in her behavior or looks that appeared in the least affected when acknowlegements were made to me of the pleasure i had given to the whole family she joined in them when my health and happiness were wished she added her wishes by cheerful bows as she sat when they wished to see me again before i went to england she did the same so that my heart was dilated i was overjoyed to see such an happy alteration when i took leave of them she stood forward to receive my compliments with a polite french freedom i offered to pres her hand with my lips my brothers deliverer said she must not affect this distance and in manner offered her cheek adding god preserve my tutor wherever he set his foot and in english god convert you too chevalier may you never want such an agreeable friend as you have been to us  signor jeronymo was not able to be with us i went up to take leave of him o my grandison said he and flung his arms about my neck and will you go  blessings attend you  but what will become of a brother and sister when they have lost you  you will rejoice me replied i if you will favor me with a few lines by a servant whom i shall leave behind me for a few days and who will find me at inspruck to let me know how you all do and whether your sisters health continues  she must she shall be yours said he if i can manage it why why will you leave us  i was surprised to hear him say this he had never before been so particular  that cannot cannot be said i there are a thousand obstacles   all of which rejoined he that depend upon us i doubt not to overcome your heart is not with olivia  they all knew from that ladys indiscretion of the proposals that had been made me relating to her and of my declining them i assured him that my heart was free  we agreed upon a correspondence and i took leave of one of the most grateful of men  but how much was i afflicted when i received at inspruck the expected letter which acquainted me that this sunshine lasted no longer than the next day the young ladys malady returned with redoubled force shall i madam briefly relate to you the manner in which as her brother wrote it operated upon her  she shut herself up in her chamber not seeming to regard or know that her woman was in it nor did she answer to two or three questions that her woman asked her but setting her chair with its back toward her over against a closet in the room after a profound silence she bent forwards and in a low voice seemed to be communing with a person in the closet  and you say he is actually gone gone for ever no not for ever  who gone madam said her woman to whom do you direct your discourse  we were all obliged to him no doubt so bravely to rescue my brother and to pursue the bravoes and as my brother says to put him in his own chaise and walk on foot by the side of it  why as you say assassins might have murdered him the horses might have trampled him under their feet still looking as if she was speaking to somebody in the closet  her woman stepped to the closet and opened the door and left it open to take off her attention to the place and to turn the course of her ideas but still she bent forwards toward and talked calmly as if to somebody in it then breaking into a faint laugh in love  that is such a silly notion and yet i love everybody better than i love myself  her mother came into the room just then the young lady arose in haste and shut the closetdoor as if she had somebody hid there and throwing herself at her mothers feet my dear my everhonoured mama said she forgive me for all the trouble i have caused you  but i will i must you cannot deny me i will be gods child as well as yours i will go into a nunnery  it came out afterward that her confessor taking advantage of confessions extorted from her of regard for her tutor though only such as a sister might bear to a brother but which he had suspected might come to be of consequence had filled her tender mind with terrors that had thus affected her head she is as i have told you madam a young lady of exemplary piety  i will not dwell on a scene so melancholy how i afflict your tender heart my good miss byron  do you think lucy i did not weep  indeed i did  poor young lady  but my mind was fitted for the indulging of scenes so melancholy pray sir proceed said i what a heart must that be which bleeds not for such a distress pray sir proceed  be it dr bartletts task to give you further particulars i will be briefer  i will not indulge my own grief  all that medicine could do was tried but her confessor who however is an honest a worthy man kept up her fears and terrors he saw the favor her tutor was in with the whole family he knew that the younger brother had declared for rewarding him in a very high manner he had more than once put this favored man upon an avowal of his principles and betwixt her piety and her gratitude had raised such a conflict as her tender nature could not bear  at florence lives a family of high rank and honor the ladies of which have with them a friend noted for the excellency of her heart and her genius and who having been robbed of her fortune early in life by an uncle to whose care she was committed by her dying father was received both as a companion and a blessing by the ladies of the family she has now for many years lived with she is an english woman and a protestant but so very discreet that her being so though at first they hoped to proselyte her gives them not a less value for her and yet they are all zealous roman catholics these two ladies and this their companion were visiting one day at the marchese della porrettas and there the distressed mother told them the mournful tale the ladies who think nothing that is within the compass of human prudence impossible to their dear mrs beaumont wished that the young lady might be entrusted for a week to her care at their own house at florence  it was consented to as soon as proposed and lady clementina was as willing to go there having always been an intimacy between the families and she as everybody else having an high opinion of mrs beaumont they took her with them on the day they set out for florence  here again for shortening my story i will refer to dr bartlett mrs beaumont went to the bottom of the malady she gave her advice to the family upon it they were resolved signor jeronymo supporting her advice to be governed by it the young lady was told that she should be indulged in all her wishes she then acknowleged what those were and was the easier for the acknowlegement and for the advice of such a prudent friend and returned to bologna mrs beaumont accompanying her much more composed than when she left it the tutor was sent for by common consent for there had been a convention of the whole family the urbino branch as well as the general being present there the terms to be proposed to the supposed happy man were settled but they were not to be mentioned to him till after he had seen the lady a wrong policy surely  he was then at vienna signor jeronymo in his letter congratulated him in high terms as a man whom he had it now at last in his power to reward and he hinted in general that the conditions would be such as it was impossible but he must find his very great advantage in them as to fortune to be sure he meant  the friend so highly valued could not but be affected with the news yet knowing the lady and the family he was afraid that the articles of residence and religion would not be easily compromised between them he therefore summoned up all his prudence to keep his fears alive and his hope in suspense  he arrived at bologna he was permitted to pay his compliments to lady clementina in her mothers presence how agreeable how nobly frank was the reception from both mother and daughter how high ran the congratulations of jeronymo he called the supposed happy man brother the marquis was ready to recognize the fourth son in him a great fortune additional to an estate bequeathed her by her twograndfathers was proposed my father was to be invited over to grace the nuptials by his presence  but let me cut short the rest the terms could not be complied with for i was to make a formal renunciation of my religion and to settle in italy only once in two or three years was allowed if i pleased for two or three months to go to england and as a visit of curiosity once in her life if their daughter desired it to carry her thither for a time to be limited by them  what must be my grief to be obliged to disappoint such expectations as were raised by persons who had so sincere a value for me you cannot madam imagine my distress so little as could be expected to be allowed by them to the principles of a man whom they supposed to be in an error that would inevitably cast him into perdition but when the friendly brothe implored my compliance when the excellent mother in effect besought me to have pity on her heart and on her childs head and when the tender the amiable clementina putting herself out of the question urged me for my souls sake to embrace the doctrines of her holy mother the church  what madam  but how i grieve you  he stopped his handkerchief was of use to him as mine was to me  what a distress was here  and what and what sir sobbing was the result could you could you resist  satisfied in my own faith entirely satisfied having insuperable objections to that i was wished to embrace  a lover of my native country too  were not my god and my country to be the sacrifice if i complied but i labored i studied for a compromise i must have been unjust to clementinas merit and to my own character had she not been dear to me and indeed i beheld graces in her then that i had before resolved to shut my eyes against her rank next to princely her fortune high as her rank religion country all so many obstacles that had appeared to me insuperable removed by themselves and no apprehension left of a breach of the laws of hospitality which had ti l now made me struggle to behold one of the most amiable and nobleminded of women with indifference  i offered to live one year in italy one in england by turns if their dear clementina would live with me there if not i would content myself with passing only three months in every year in my native country i proposed to leave her entirely at her liberty in the article of religion and in case of children by the marriage the daughters to be educated by her the sons by me a condition to which his holiness himself it was presumed would not refuse his sanction as there were precedents for it this madam was a great sacrifice to compassion to love  what could i more  and would not sir would not clementina consent to this compromise  ah the unhappy lady it is this reflection that strengthens my grief she would have consented she was earnest to procure the consent of her friends upon these terms this her earnestness in my favor devoted as she was to her religion excites my compassion and calls for my gratitude  what scenes what distressful scenes followed  the noble father forgot his promised indulgence the mother indeed seemed in a manner neutral the youngest brother was still however firm in my cause but the marquis the general the bishop and the whole urbino branch of the family were not to be moved and the less as they considered the alliance as highly honorable to me a private an obscure man as now they began to call me as derogatory to their own honor in short i was allowed i was desired to depart from bologna and not suffered to take my leave of the unhappy clementina though on her knees she begged to be allowed a parting interview  and what was the consequence  dr bartlett must tell the rest  unhappy clementina  now they wish me to make them one more visit at bologna  unhappy clementina  to what purpose  i saw his noble heart was too much affected to answer questions had i had voice to ask any  but o my friends you see how it is can i be so unhappy as he is as his clementina is well might dr bartlett say that this excellent man is not happy well might he himself say that he has suffered greatly even from good women well might he complain of sleepless nights unhappy clementina let me repeat after him and not happy sir charles grandison  and who my dear is happy not i am sure  your harriet byron  letter xxi miss byron in continuation i was forced to lay down my pen i will begin a new letter i did not think of concluding my former where i did  sir charles saw me in grief and forgot his own to applaud my humanity as he called it and sooth me i have often said he referred you in my narrative to dr bartlett i will beg of him to let you see anything you shall wish to see in the free and unreserved correspondence we have held you that love to entertain your friends with your narrations will find something perhaps in a story like this to engage their curiosity on their honor and candor i am sure i may depend are they not your frien would to heaven it were in my power to contribu to their pleasure and yours  i only bowed i could only bow  i told you madam that my compassion was engaged but that any honor was free i think it  but when you have seen all that dr bartlett will show you you will be the better able to judge of me and for me i had rather be thought favorably of by miss byron than by any woman in the world  who sir said i knowing only so far as i know of the unhappy clementina but must wish her to be   ah lucy there i stopped  i had like to have been a false girl  and yet ought i not from my heart to have been able to say what i was going to say  i do aver lucy upon repeated experience that love is a narrower of the heart did i not use to be thought generous and benevolent and to be above all selfishness but am i so now  and now madam said he and he was going to take my hand but with an air as if he thought the freedmo would be too great  a tenderness so speaking in his eyes a respectfulness so solemn in his countenance he just touched it and withdrew his hand what shall i say  i cannot tell what i should say  but you i see can pity me  you can pity the noble clementina  honor forbids me  yet honor bids me  yet i cannot be unjust ungenerous  selfish   he arose from his seat  allow me madam to thank you for the favor of your ear  pardon me for the trouble i see i have given to an heart that is capable of a sympathy so tender   and bowing low he withdrew with precipitation as if he would not let me see his emotion he left me looking here looking there as if for my heart and then as giving it up for irrecoverable i became for a few moments motionless and a statue  a violent burst of tears recovered me to sense and motion and just then miss grandison who having heard her brother withdraw forbore for a few minutes to enter supposing he would return hearing me sob rushed in  o my harriet said she clasping her arms about me what is done  do i or do i not embrace my sister my real sister my sister grandison  ah my charlotte no slattering hope is now left me  no sister it must not it cannot be the lady is  but lead me lead me out of this room  i dont love it spreading one hand before my eyes my tears trickling between my fingers  tears that flowed not only for myself but for sir charles grandison and the unhappy clementina for gather you not from what he said that something disastrous has befallen the poor lady and then supporting myself with her arm i hurried out of lord ls study and up stairs into my own chamber she following me  leave me leave me here dear creature said i for six minutes i will attend you then in your own dressing room  she kindly retired i threw myself into a chair indulged my tears for a few moments and was the fitter to receive the two sisters who handinhand came into my room to comfort me  but i could not relate what had passed immediately with any connection i told them only that all was over that their brother was to be pitied not blamed and that if they would allow me to recollect some things that were most affecting i would attend them and they should have my narrative the more exact for the indulgence  they stayed no longer with me than to see me a little composed  sir charles and dr bartlett went out together in his chariot he enquired more than once of my health saying to his sister charlotte that he was afraid he had affected me too much by the melancholy tale he had been telling me  he excused himself from dining with us poor man what must be his distress  not able to see to sit with us  i would have excused myself also being not very fit to appear but was not permitted  i sat however but a very little while at table after dinner and how tedious did the dinnertime appear the servants eyes were irksome to me so were emilys dear girl glistening as they did though she knew not for what but sympathetically as i may say she supposing that all was not as she would have it  she came up soon after to me  one word my dearest madam the door in her hand and her head only within it tell me only that there is no misunderstanding between my guardian and you  tell me only that   none my dear  none none at all my emily  thank god clasping her hands together thank god  if there were i should not have known whose part to take  but i will not disturb you  and was going  stay stay my precious young friend stay my emily  i arose took her hand my sweet girl say will you live with me  god for ever bless you dearest madam  will i it is the wish next my heart  will you go down with me to northamptonshire my love  to the worlds end i will attend you madam i will be your handmaid and i will love you better than i love my guardian if possible  ah my dear but how will you live without seeing your guardian nowandthen  why he will live with us will not he  no no my dear  and you would choose then to live with him not with me would you not   indeed but i will not  indeed i will live and die with you if you will let me and i warrant his kind heart will often lead him to us but tell me why these tears madam why this grief  why do you speak so quick and short and why do you seem to be in such a hurry  do i speak quick and short do i seem to be in a hurry  thank you my love for your observation and now leave me i will profit by it  the amiable girl withdrew on tiptoe and i sat about composing myself  i was obliged to her for her observation it was really of use to me but you must think lucy that i must be fluttered  his manner of leaving me  was it not particular  to break from me so abruptly as i may say  and what he said with looks so earnest looks that seemed to carry more meaning than his words and withdrawing without conducting me out as he had led me in  and as if  i dont know how as if  but you will give me your opinion of all these things i cannot say but i think my suspense is over and in a way not very desirable  yet  but why should i puzzle myself what must be must  at afternoontea the gentlemen not being returned and emily undertaking the walters office i gave my lord and the two ladies though she was present some account of what had passed but briefly and i had just finished and was quitting the room as the two gentlemen entered the door  sir charles instantly addressed me with apologies for the concern he had given me his emotion was visible as he spoke to me he hesitated he trembled why did he hesitate why did he tremble  i told him i was not ashamed to own that i was very much affected by the melancholy story the poor lady said i is greatly to be pitied  but remember sir what you promised dr bartlett should do for me  i have been requesting the doctor to fulfill my engagements  and i am ready to obey said the good man my agreeable task shall soon be performed  as i was at the door going up stairs to my closet i courtesied and pursed my intention  he bowed said nothing and looked i thought as if he were disappointed that i did not return to company  no indeed  yet i pity him at my heart how odd is it then to be angry with him  so much goodness so much sensibility so much compassion whence all his woes i believe never met together in a heart so manly  tell me tell me my dear lucy  yet tell me nothing till i am favored with and you have read the account that will be given me by dr bartlett then i hope we shall have everything before us  saturday march    he yet why that disrespectful word  fie upon me for my narrowness of heart sir charles is setting out for town he cannot be happy himself he is therefore giving himself the pleasure of endeavoring to make his friend happy he can enjoy the happiness of his friends o the blessing of a benevolent heart let the world frown as it will upon such a one it cannot possibly bereave it of all happiness  fortune do thy worst if sir charles grandison cannot be happy with his clementina he will make himself a partaker of lord gs happiness and as that will secure if not her own fault the happiness of his sister he will not be destitute of selicity and let me after his example  ah lucy that i could  but in time i hope i shall deserve as well as be esteemed to be the girl of my grandmamma and aunt and then of course be worthy to be called my dear lucy  your harriet byron   saturday noon sir charles is gone and i have talked over the matter again with the ladies and lord l  what do you think  they all will have it  and it is a faithful account to the very best of my recollection  they all will have it that sir charless great struggle his great grief is owing  his great struggle i dont know what i write i think  but let it go is between his compassion for the unhappy clementina and his love  for  somebody else  but who my dear large as his heart is can be contented with half an heart compassion lucy  the compassion of such an heart  it must be love  and ought it not to be so to such a woman  tell me  dont you lucy with all yours pity the unhappy clementina who loves against the principles of her religion and in that respect against her inclination a man who cannot be here is but by a violation of his honor and conscience what a fatality in a love so circumstanced  to love against inclination what a sound has that but what an absurdity is this passion called love or rather of what absurd things does it make its votaries guilty let mine be evermore circumscribed by the laws of reason of duty and then my recollections my reflections will never give me lasting disturbance  dr bartlett has desired me to let him know what the particular passages are of which i more immediately wish to be informed for our better understanding the unhappy clementinas story and has promised to transcribe them i have given him a list in writing i have been half guilty of affectation i have asked for some particulars that sir charles referred to which are not so immediately interesting the history of olivia of mr beaumont the debates sir charles mentioned between himself and signor jeronymo but lucy the particulars i am most impatient for are these  his first conference with lady clementina on the subject of the count of belvedere which her father and mother overheard  the conference he was desired to hold with her on her being seized with melancholy  whether her particularly cheerful behavior on his departure from bologna is any where accounted for  by what means mrs beaumont prevailed on her to acknowledge a passion so studiously concealed from the tenderest of parents  sir charless reception on his return from vienra  what reception his proposals of compromise as to reli and residence met with as well from the family as from clementina  the most important of all lucy  the last distres  what made it necessary what happened at bologna afterward and what the poor clementinas situation now is  if the doctor is explicit with regard to this article we shall be able to account for their desiring him to revisit them at bologna after so long an absence and for his seeming to think it will be to no purpose to oblige them o lucy what a great deal depends upon the answer to this article as it may happen  but no more suspense i beseech you sir charles grandison no more suspense i pray you dr bartlett my heart sickens at the thought of farther suspense i cannot bear it  adieu lucy lengthening my letter would be only dwelling longer for i know not how to change my subject on weaknesses and follies that have already given you too much pain for  your harriet byron   letter xxii miss byron in continuation colnebrooke monday mar    dr bartlett seeing our impatience asked leave to take the assistance of his nephew in transcribing from sir charless letters the passages that will enable him to perform the task he had so kindly undertaken by this means he has already presented us with the following transcripts we have eagerly perused them when you have done so be pleased to hasten them up that my cousin reevess may have the same opportunity they are so good as to give cheerfully the preference to the venerable circle as my cousin who dined with us yesterday bid me tell you o my lucy what a glorious young man is sir charles grandison but he had the happiness of a dr bartlett as he is fond of owning to improve upon a foundation that was so nobly laid by the best and wisest of mothers  dr bartletts first letter my task my good miss byron will be easy by the assistance you have allowed me for what is it but to transcribe parts of sir charless letters adding a few lines here and there by way of connection and i am delighted with it as it will make known the heart of my beloved patron in all the lights which the most interesting circumstances can throw upon it to so many worthy persons as are permitted a share in this confidence  the first of your commands runs thus  i should imagine say you that the debates sir charles mentions between himself and signor jeronymo and his companions at their first acquaintance must be not only curious but edifying    they are my good miss byron but as i presume that you ladies are more intent upon being obeyed in the other articles see lucy i had better not have dissembled i will only at present transcribe for you with some short connexions two letters by which you will see how generously mr grandison sought to recover his friend to the paths of virtue and honor when he had formed schemes in conjunction with and by the instigation of other gay young men of rank to draw him in to be a partaker in their guilt and an abettor of their enterprises  you will judge from these letters madam without shocking you by the recital what were the commonplace pleas of those libertines despisers of marriage of the laws of society and of women but as they were subservient to their pleasures   to the barone della porretta will my jeronymo allow his friend his grandison the liberty he is going to take with him if the friendship he professes for him be such a one as a great mind can on reflection glory in he will and what is this liberty but such as constitutes the essence of true friendship allow me on this occasion to say that your grandison has seen more of the world than most men who have lived no longer in it have had an opportunity to see i was sent abroad for improvement under the care of a man who proved to be the most intriguing and profligate of those to whom a youth was ever entrusted i saw in him the inconvenience the odiousness of libertinism and by the assistance of an excellent monitor with whom i happily became acquainted and would it not be false shame and cowardice if i did not say by the divine assistance i escaped snares that were laid to corrupt my morals hence my dearest friend will the more readily allow me to impart to him some of the lessons that were of so much use to myself  i am the rather encouraged to take this liberty as i have often flattered myself that i have seen my jeronymo affected by the arguments urged in the course of the conversations that have been held in our select meetings at padua and at rome in which the cause of virtue and true honor has been discussed and pleaded  i have now no hopes of influencing any one of the noble youths whom at your request i have of late so often met but of you i still have hopes because you continue to declare that you prefer my friendship to theirs you think that i was disgusted at the ridicule with which they generally treated the arguments they could not answer but as far as i innocently could i followed them in their levity i returned raillery for ridicule and not always as you know unsuccessfully but still they renewed the charge and we had the same arguments one day to refute that the preceding were given up they could not convince me nor i them  i quit therefore yet not without regret the society i cannot meet with pleasure but let not my jeronymo renounce me in his opinion i had the honor to stand high before i was prevailed upon to be introduced to them we cultivated with mutual pleasure each others acquaintance independent of this association let us be to each other what we were for the first month of our intimacy you have noble qualities but are diffident and too often suffer yourself to be influenced by men of talents inferior to your own  the ridicule they have aimed at has weakened perhaps the force of the arguments that i wished to have a more than temporary effect on your heart permit me to remind you on paper of some of them and urge to you others the end i have in view is your good in hopes to confirm by the efficacy they may have on you my own principles nor think me too serious the occasion the call that true friendship makes upon you is weighty  you have showed me letters from your noble father from your mother from the pious prelate your brother and others from your uncle and still if possible more admirable ones from your sister  all filled with concern for your present and future welfare how dearly is my jeronymo beloved by his whole family and by such a family and how tenderly does he love them all  what ought to be the result jeronymo cannot be ungrateful he knows so well what belongs to the character of a dutiful son an affectionate brother that i will not attempt to enforce their arguments upon him  by the endeavors of my friend to find excuses for some of the liberties in which he allows himself i infer that if he thought them criminal he has too much honor to be guilty of them he cannot say with the mad medea  video meliora proboque deteriora sequor  no his judgment must be misled before he can allow himself in a deviation but let him beware for has not every saulty inclination something to plead in its own behalf  excuses my dear friend are more than tacit confessions and the health of the mind as of the body is impaired by almost imperceptible degrees  my jeronymo has pleaded and justly may he boast of a disposition to benevolence charity generosity  what pity that he cannot be still more perfect  that he resolves not against meditated injuries to others of his fellow creatures but remember my lord that true goodness is an uniform thing and will alike influence every part of a mans conduct and that true generosity will not be confined to obligations either written or verbal  besides who though in the least guilty instance and where some false virtue may offer colors to palliate an excess can promise himself to stop when once he has thrown the reins on the neck of lawless appetite and may i not add that my jeronymo is not in his own power he suffers himself to be a led man  o that he would choose his company anew and be a leader every virtue then that warms his heart would have a sistervirtue to encourage the noble flame instead of a vice to damp it  justly do you boast of the nobility of your descent of the excellence of every branch of your family bear with my question my lord are you determined to sit down satisfied with the honor of your ancestors your progenitors and every one of your family have given you reason to applaud their worthiness will you not give them cause to boast of yours  in answer to the earnest entreaties of all your friends that you will marry you have said that were women angels you would with joy enter into the state  but what ought the men to be who form upon women such expectations  can you my dear lord despise matrimony yet hold it to be a sacrament can you defying the maxims of your family and wishing to have the sister i have heard you mention with such high delight and admiration strengthen your familyinterest in the female line determine against adding to its strength in the male  you have suffered yourself to speak with contempt of the generality of the italian women for their illiterateness let not their misfortune be imputed to them my noble friend as their fault they have the same natural geniuss that used to distinguish the men and women of your happy climate let not the want of cultivation induce you a learned man to hold them cheap the cause of virtue and of the sex can hardly be separated  but o my friend my jeronymo have i not too much reason to fear that guilty attachments have been the cause of your slighting a legal one that you are studying pretenses to justify the way of life into which you have fallen  let us consider the objects of your pursuit  alas there have been more than one are they women seduced from the path of virtue by yourself  who otherwise perhaps would have married and made useful members of society  consider my friend what a capital crime is a seduction of this kind  can you glory in the virtue of a sister of your own and allow yourself in attempts upon the daughter the sister of another and let me ask how can that crime be thought pardonable in a man which renders a woman infamous  a good heart a delicate mind cannot associate with a corrupt one what tie can bind a woman who has parted with her honor what in such a guilty attachment must be a mans alternative but either to be the tyrant of a wretch who has given him reason to despise her or the dupe of one who despises him  it is the important lesson of life allow me to be serious on a subject so serious in this union of soul and body to restrain the unruly appetites of the latter and to improve the faculties of the former  can this end be attained by licentious indulgences and profligate associations  men in the pride of their hearts are apt to suppose that nature has designed them to be superior to women the highest proof that can be given of such superiority is in the protection afforded by the stronger to the weaker what can that man say for himself or for his proud pretension who employs all his arts to seduce betray and ruin the creature whom he should guide and protect  sedulous to save her perhaps from every so but the devil and himself  it is unworthy of a man of spirit to be sollicitous to keep himself within the boundaries of human laws on no other motive than to avoid the temporal inconveniences attending the breach of them the laws were not made so much for the direction of good men as to circumscribe the bad would a man of honor wish to be considered as one of the latter rather than as one of those who would have distinguished the fit from the unfit had they not been discriminated by human sanctions men are to approve themselves at an higher tribunal than at that of men  shall not public spirit virtue and a sense of duty have as much influence on a manly heart as a new face how contemptibly low is that commerce in which mind has no share  virtuous love my dear jeronymo looks beyond this temporary scene while guilty attachments usually find a much earlier period than that of human life inconstancy on one side or the other seldom fails to put a disgraceful end to them but were they to endure for life what can the reflections upon them do toward softening the agonies of the inevitable hour  remember my jeronymo that you are a man a rational and immortal agent and act up to the dignity of your nature can sensual pleasure be the great end of an immortal spirit in this life  that pleasure cannot be lasting and it must be followed by remorse which is obtained either by doing injustice to or degrading a fellow creature and does not a woman when she forfeits her honor degrade herself not only in the sight of the world but in the secret thoughts of even a profligate lover destroying her own consequence with him  build not my noble friend upon penances and absolutions i enter not into those subjects on which we differ as catholics and protestants but if we would be thought men of true greatness of mind let us endeavor so to act as not in essential articles and with our eyes open either to want absolution or incur penances surely my lord it is nobler not to offend than to be obliged to atone  are there not let me ask innocent delights enough to fill with joy every vacant hour believe me jeronymo there are let you and me seek for such and make them the cement of our friendship  religion out of the question consider what morals and good policy will oblige you to do as a man born to act a part in public life what were the examples set by you and your acquaintance to be generally followed would become of public order and decorum what of national honors how will a regular succession in families be kept up you my lord boast of your descent both by fathers and mothers side why will you deprive your children of a distinction in which you glory  good children what a blessing to their parents but what comfort can the parent have in children born into the world heirs of disgrace and who owing their very being to profligate principles have no family honor to support no fair example to imitate but must be warned by their father when bitter experience as convinced him of his errors to avoid the paths in which he has trod  how delightful the domestic connection to bring to the paternal and fraternal dwellings a sister a daughter that shall be received there with tender love to strengthen your own interest in the world by alliance with some noble and worthy family who shall rejoice to trust to the barone della porretta the darling of their hopes  this would to a generous heart like yours be the source of infinite delights but could you now think of introducing to the friends you revere the unhappy objects of a vagrant affection must not my jeronymo even estrange himself from his home to conceal from his father from his mother from his sister persons shut out by all the laws of honor from their society the persons so shut out must hate the family to whose interests theirs are so contrary what sincere union then what sameness of affection between jeronymo and the objects of his passion  but the present hour dances delightfully away and my friend will not look beyond it his gay companions applaud and compliment him on his triumphs in general perhaps he allows that the welfare and order of society ought to be maintained by submission to divine and human laws but his single exception for himself can be of no importance of what then is general practice made up if every one excepts himself and offends in the instance that best suits his inclination what a scene of horror will this world become affluence and a gay disposition tempt to licencious pleasures penury and a gloomy one to robbery revenge and murder not one enormity will be without its plea if once the boundaries of duty are thrown down but even in this universal depravity would not his crime be much worse who robbed me of my child from riot and licentiousness and under a guise of love and trust than his who despoiled me of my substance and had necessity to plead in extenuation of his guilt  i cannot doubt my dear friend but you will take at last kindly these expostulations though some of them are upon subjects on which our conversations have been hitherto ineffectual i submit them to your consideration i can have no interest in making them nor motive but what proceeds from that true friendship with which i desire to be thought  most affectionately yours   you have heard my good miss byron that the friendship between mr grandison and signor jeronymo was twice broken off once it was by the unkindlytaken freedom of the expostulatory letter jeronymo at that time of his life ill brooked opposition in any pursuit his heart was engaged in when pushed he was vehement and mr grandison could not be oversolicitous to keep up a friendship with a young man who was under the dominion of his dissolute companions and who would not allow of remonstrances in cases that concerned his morals  jeronymo having afterward been drawn into great inconveniences by his libertine friends broke with them and mr grandison and he meeting by accident at padua their friendship at the pressing instances of jeronymo was again renewed  jeronymo thought himself reformed mr grandison hoped he was but soon after a temptation fell in his way which he could not resist it was from a lady who was more noted for her birth beauty and fortune than for her virtue she had spread her snares for mr grandison before jeronymo became acquainted with her and revenge for her slighted advances taking possession of her heart she hoped an opportunity would be afforded her of wreaking it upon him  the occasion was given by the following letter which mr grandison thought himself obliged in honor to write to his friend on his attachment the one being then at padua the other at cremona  i am extremely concerned my dear jeronymo at your new engagement with a lady who though of family and fortune has shown but little regard to her character how frail are the resolutions of men how much in the power of women but i will not recriminate  yet i cannot but regret that i must lose your company in our projected visits to the german courts this however more for your sake than my own since to the principal of them i am no stranger you have excused yourself to me i wish you had a better motive but i write rather to warn than to upbraid you this lady is mistress of all the arts of woman she may glory in her conquest you ought not to be proud of yours you will not when you know her better i have had a singular opportunity of being acquainted with her character i never judged of characters of womens especially by report had the barone dellaporretta been the first for whom this lady spread her blandishments a man so amiable as he is might the more assuredly have depended on the love she professes for him she has two admirers men of violence who unknown to each other have equal reason to look upon her as their own you propose not to marry her i am silent on this subject would to heaven you were married to a woman of virtue why will you not oblige all your friends thus liable as you are  but neither do i expostulate well do i know the vehemence with which you are wont to pursue a new adventure yet i had hoped  but again i restrain myself only let me add that the man who shall boast of his success with this lady may have more to apprehend from the competition in which he will find himself engaged than he can be aware of be prudent my jeronymo in this pursuit for your own sake the heart that dictates this advice is wholly yours but alas it boasts no further interest in that of its jeronymo with infinite regret i subscribe to the latter part of the sentence the once betterregarded name of  grandison   and what was the consequence the unhappy youth by the instigation of the revengeful woman defied his friend in her behalf mr grandison with a noble disdain appealed to jeronymos cooler deliberation and told him that he never would meet as a foe the man he had ever been desirous to consider as his friend you know my lord said he that i am under a disadvantage in having once been obliged to assert myself in a country where i have no natural connexions and where you jeronymo have many if we meet again i do assure you it must be by accidnt  and if that happens we shall then find it time eough to discuss the occasion of our present misunderstanding  their next meeting was indeed by accident it was in the cremonese when mr grandison saved his life  and now madam let me give you in obedience to your second command the particulars of the conference which sir charles was put upon holding with clementina in savor of the count of belvedere and which her father and mother unknown to either of them overheard  you must suppose them seated a miltons paradise lost before them and that at this time mr grandison did not presume that the young lady had any particular regard for him  clementina you have taught the prelate and you have taught the soldier to be in love with your milton sir but i shall never admire him i doubt dont you reckon the language hard and crabbed  grandison i did not propose him to you madam your brother chose him we should not have made the proficiency we have had i not begun with you by easier authors but you have often heard me call him a sublime poet and your ambition it is a laudable one leads you to make him your own too soon has not your tutor taken the liberty to chide you for your impatience for your desire of being everything at once  clem you have and i own my fault  but to have done for the present with milton what shall i do to acquit myself of the addresses of this count of belvedere  gr why would you acquit yourself of the counts addresses  clem he is not the man i can like i have told my papa as much and he is angry with me  gr i think madam your papa may be a little displeased with you though he loves you too tenderly to be angry with you you reject the count without assigning a reason  clem is it not reason enough that i dont like him  gr give me leave to say that the count is an handsome man he is young gallant sensible of a family ancient and noble a grace to it he is learned goodnatured he adores you   clem and so let him if he will i never can like him  gr dear lady you must not be capricious you will give the most indulgent parents in the world apprehension that you have cast your thoughts on some other object young ladies except in a case of prepossession do not often reject a person who has so many great and good qualities as thine in this gentleman and where equality of degree and a fathers and mothers high approbation add to his merit  clem i suppose you have been spoken to to talk with me on this subject  it is a subject i dont like  gr you began it madam  clem i did so because it is uppermost with me i am grieved at my heart that i cannot see the count with my fathers eyes my father deserves from me every instance of duty and love and veneration but i cannot think of the count of belvedere for an husband  gr one reason madam one objection  clem he is a man that is not to my mind a fawning cringing man i think  and a spirit that can fawn and cringe and kneel will be a tyrant in power  gr dear madam to whom is he this obsequious man but to you  is there a man in the world that behaves with a more proper dignity to every one else nay to you the lover shines out in him but the man is not forgot is the tenderness of wellplaced love the veneration paid to a deservedly beloved object any derogation to the manly character far from it and shall you think the less of your lover for being the most ardent and i have no knowledge in man if he is not the most sincere of men  clem an excellent advocate  i am sure you have been spoken to  have you not tell me truly perhaps by the count of belvedere  gr i should not think and of consequence not speak so highly as i do of the count if he were capable of asking any man your father and brothers excepted to plead his cause with you  clem i cannot bear to be chidden chevalier now you are going to be angry with me too but has not my mamma spoken to you tell me  gr dear lady consider if she had what you owe to a mamma who deserving for her tenderness to her child the utmost observance and duty would condescend to put her authority into a mediation and yet let me declare that no person breathing should make me say what i do not think whether in favor or disfavour of any man  clem that is no answer i owe implicit yes i will say implicit duty to my mamma for her indulgence to me but what you have said is no direct answer  gr for the honor of that indulgence madam i own to you that your mamma and my lord too have wished that their clementina could or would give one substantial reason why she cannot like the count of belvedere that they might prepare themselves to acquiesce with it and the count be induced to submit to his evil destiny  clem and they have wished this to you sir and you have taken upon you to answer their wishes  i protest you are a man of prodigious consequence with us all and by your readiness to take up the cause of a man you have so lately known you seem to know it too well  gr i am sorry i have incurred your displeasure madam  clem you have i never was more angry with you than i now am  gr i hope you never was angry with me before i never gave you reason and if i have now i beg your pardon  i arose to go  clem very humble sir  and are for going before you have it now call me capricious again  gr i did not know that you could be so easily displeased madam  she wept  clem i am a very weak creature i believe i am wrong but i never knew what it was to give offense to anybody till within these few months i love my father i love my mother beyond my own life and to think that now when i wish most for the continuance of their goodness to me i am in danger of forfeiting it  i cannot bear it  do you forgive me however i believe i have been too petulant to you your behavior is noble frank disinterested it has been a happiness that we have known you you are everybodys friend but yet i think it is a little officious in you to plead so very warmly for a man of whom you know so little and when i told you more than once i could not like him  gr honored as i am by your whole family with the appellation of a fourth son a fourth brother dear madam was i to blame to act up to the character i know my own heart and if i have consequence given me i will act so as to deserve it at least my own heart shall give it to me  clem well sir you may be right i am sure you mean to be right but as it would be a diminution of the counts dignity to apply to you for a supposed interest in you which he cannot have it would be much more so to have you interfere where a father mother and other brothers you see sir i allow your claim of fourth brotherhood are supposed to have less weight so no more of the count of belvedere i beseech you from your mouth  gr one word more only  dont let the goodness of your father and mother be construed to the disadvantage of the parental character in them they have not been positive they have given their wishes rather then their commands their tenderness for you in a point so very tender has made them unable to tell their own wishes to you for fear they should not meet with yours yet would be perhaps glad to hear one solid objection to their proposal  and why that they might admit of it  impute therefore to my officiousness what you please and yet i would not wish to disoblige or offend you but let their indulgence they never will use their authority have its full merit with you  clem your servant sir i never yet had a slight notion of their indulgence and i hope i never shall if you will go go but sir next time i am favored with your lectures it shall be upon languages if you please and not upon lovers  i withdrew profoundly bowing but suely thought i the lovely clementina is capricious  thus far my patron  let me add that the marchioness having acquainted mr grandison that her lord and she had heard every word that had passed expressed her displeasure at her daughters petulance and thanking him in her lords name as well as for herself for the generous part he had taken told him that clementina should ask his pard on  he begged that for the sake of their own weight with her on the same subject she might not know that they had heard what had passed  i believe that is best chevalier answered the marchioness and i am apt to think that the poor girl will be more ready than perhaps one would wish to make up with you were she to find you offended with her in earnest as you have reason to be as a disinterested man  you see chevalier i know to whom i am speaking but both my lord and self hope to see her of another mind and that she will soon be countess of belvedere my lords heart is in this alliance so is that of my son giacomo  i come now madam to your third command which is to give you the conference which sir charles was put upon holding with the unhappy clementina on her being seized with melancholy    mr grandison still not presuming on any particular favor from clementina  the young lady was walking in one alley of the garden mr grandison and the marquis and marchioness in another she was attended by her woman who walked behind her and with whom she was displeased for endeavoring to divert her but who however seemed to be talking on though without being answered  the dear creature said the marquis tears in his eyes  see her there now walking slow now with quicker steps as if she would shake off her camilla she hates the poor woman for her love to her but who is it that she sees with pleasure did i think that i should ever behold the pride of my heart with the pain that i now feel for her yet she is lovely in my eye in all she does in all she says  but o my dear grandison we cannot now make her speak more than yes or no we cannot engage her in a conversation no not on the subject of her newlyacquired language see if you can on any subject  ay chevalier said the marchioness do you try to engage her we have told her that we will not talk of marriage to her at all till she is herself inclined to receive proposals her weeping eyes thank us for our indulgence she prays for us with liftedup hand she courtesies her thanks if she stands before us she bows in acknowleged gratitude for our goodness to her if she sits but she cares not to speak she is not easy while we are talking to her see she is stepping into the greek temple her poor woman unanswered talking to her she has not seen us by that winding walk we can unseen place ourselves in the myrtilgrove and hear what passes  the marchioness as we walked hinted that in their last visit to the general at naples there was a count marulli a young nobleman of merit but a soldier of fortune who would have clandestinely obtained the attention of their clementina they knew nothing of it till last night she said when herself and camilla puzzling to what to attribute the sudden melancholy turn of her daughter and camilla mentioning what was unlikely as well as likely told her that the count would have bribed her to deliver a letter to the young lady but that she repulsed him with indignation he besought her then to take no notice of his offer to the general on whom all his fortunes depended she did not for that reason to anybody but a few days since she heard her young lady talking of the gentleman she had seen at naples mention the young count favorably  now it is impossible there can be anything in it said the marchioness but do you however chevalier lead to the subject of love but at distance nor name marulli because she will think you have been talking with camilla the dear girl has pride she would not endure you if she thought you imagined her to be in love especially with a man of inferior degree or dependent fortunes but on your prudence we wholly rely mention it or not as matters fall in  there can be no room for this surmise my dear said the marquis and yet marulli was lately in bologna but clementinas spirit will not permit her to encourage a clandestine address  by this time we had got to the myrtlegrove behind the temple and overheard them talk as follows  camilla and why why must i leave you madam  from infancy you know how i have loved you you used to love to hold converse with your camilla how have i offended you i will not enter this temple till you give leave but indeed indeed i must not i cannot leave you  clem officious love  can there be a greater torment than an officious prating love  if you loved me you would wish to oblige me  came i will oblige you my dear young lady in every thing i can   clem then leave me camilla i am best when i am alone i am chearfullest when i am alone you haunt me camilla like a ghost you haunt me camilla indeed you are but the ghost of my once obliging camilla  came my dearest young lady let me beseech you   clem ay now you come with your beseeches again but if you love me camilla leave me am i not to be trusted with myself were i a vile young creature that was suspected to be running away with some baseborn man you could not be more watchful of my steps  camilla would have entered into farther talk with her but she absolutely forbad her  talk till dcomsday i will not say one word more to you camilla i will be silent i will stop my ears  they were both silent camilla seemed to weep  now my dear chevalier whispered the marquis put yourself in her sight engage her into talk about england or anything you will have an hour good before dinner i hope she will be cheerful at table she must be present our guests will enquire after her reports have gone out as if her head is hurt  i am afraid my lord that this is an unseasonable moment she seems to be out of humor and pardon me if i say that camilla good woman as she is and wellmeaning had better give way to her young ladys humor at such times  then said the marchioness will her malady get head then will it become habit but my lord and i will remain where we are for a few minutes and do you try to engage her in conversation i would have her be cheerful before the patriarch however he will expect to see her she is as much his delight as she is ours  i took a little turn and entering the walk which led to the temple appeared in her sight but bowed on seeing her sitting in it her woman stood silent with her handkerchief at her eyes at the entrance i quickened my steps as if i would not break into her retirement and passed by but by means of the winding walk could hear what she said  she arose and stepping forward looking after me he is gone said she learn camilla of the chevalier grandison   shall i call him back madam  no yes no let him go i will walk you may now leave me camilla there is somebody in the garden who will watch me or you may stay camilla i dont care which only dont talk to me when i wish you to be silent  she went into an alley that crossed the alley in which i was but took the walk that led from me when we came to the center of both and were very near each other i bowed she courtesied but not seeming to encourage my nearer approach i made a motion as if i would take another walk she stopped learn of the chevalier grandison camilla repeated she  may i presume madam do i not invade   camilla is a little officious today camilla has teazed me are the poets of your country as severe upon womens tongues as the poets of ours  poets madam of all countries boast the same inspiration poets write as other men speak to their feeling  so sir  you make a pretty compliment to us poor women  poets have finer imaginations madam than other men they therefore seel quicker but as they are not often entitled to boast of judgment for imagination and judgment seldom go together they may perhaps give the cause and then break out into satire upon the effects  dont i see before me in the orangegrove my father and mother i do i have not kneeled to them today dont go chevalier  she hastened toward them they stopped she bent her knee to each and received their tender blessings they led her toward me you seemed engaged in talk with the chevalier my dear said the marquis your mamma and i were walking in we leave you  they did  the best of parents said she o that i were a more worthy child  have you not seen them sir before to day  i have madam they think you the worthiest of daughters but they lament your thoughtful turn  they are very good i am grieved to give them trouble have they expressed their concern to you sir  i will not be so petulant as i was once before provided you keep clear of the same subject you are the confident of us all and your noble and disinterested behavior deservedly endears you to everybody  they have been this very morning lamenting the melancholy turn you seem to have taken with tears they have been lamenting it  camilla you may draw near you will hear your own cause supported the rather draw near and hear all the chevalier seems to be going to say because it may save you and me too a great deal of trouble  madam i have done said i  but you must not have done if you are commissioned sir by my father and mother i am i ought to be prepared to hear all you have to say  camilla came up  my dearest young lady said i what can i say my wishes for your happiness may make me appear importunate but what hope have i of obtaining your confidence when your mother fails  what sir is aimed at what is sought to be obtained i am not very well i used to be a very sprightly creature i used to talk to sing to dance to play to visit to receive visits and i dont like to do any of these things now i love to be alone i am contented with my own company other company is at times irksome to me and i cannot help it  but whence this sudden turn madam in a lady so young so blooming your father mother brothers cannot account for it and this disturbs them  i see it does and am sorry for it  no other favorite diversion takes place in your mind you are a young lady of exemplary piety you cannot pay a greater observance than you always paid to the duties of religion  you sir an englishman an heretic give me leave to call you for are you not so  do you talk of piety of religion  we will not enter into this subject madam what i meant   yes sir i know what you meant  and i will own that i am at times a very melancholy strange creature i know not whence the alteration but to it is and i am a greater trouble to myself than i can be to anybody else  but madam there must be some cause  and for you to answer the best and most indulgent of mothers with sighs and tears only yet no obstinacy no fullenness no petulance appearing all the same sweetness gentleness observance that she ever rejoiced to find in her clementina still shining out in her mind she cannot urge her silent daughter her tenderness will not permit her to urge her and how can you my sister allow of my claim madam how can you still silently withdraw from such a mother how can you at other times suffer her to withdraw her heart full her eyes running over unable to stay yet hardly knowing how to go because of the ineffectual report she must make to your sorrowing father yet the cause of this very great alteration which they dread is growing into an habit at a time of life when you were to crown all their hopes a secret fast locked up in your own heart  she wept and turned from me and leaned upon the arm of her camilla and then quitting her arm and joining me how you paint my obstinacy and my mammas goodness i only wish  with all my soul i wish  that i was added to the dust of my ancestors i who was their comfort i see now must be their torment  fie fie my sister  blame me not i am by no means satisfied with myself what a miserable thing must she be who is at variance with herself  i do not hope madam that you should place so much confidence in your fourth brother as to open your mind to him all i beg is that you will relieve the anxious the apprehensive heart of the best of mothers and by so doing enable her to relieve the equallyanxious heart of the best of fathers  she paused stood still turned away her face and wept as if half overcome  let your faithful camilla madam be commissioned to acquaint your mamma   but hold sir seeming to recollect herself not so fast  open my mind  what whether i have anything to reveal or not  insinuating man you had almost persuaded me to think i had a secret that lay heavy at my heart and when i began to look for it to oblige you i could not find it pray sir  she stopped  and pray madam taking her hand do not think of receding thus   you are too free sir yet she withdrew not her hand  for a brother madam too free for a brother and i quitted it  well and what farther would my brother  only to implore to beseech you to reveal to your mamma to your excellent your indulgent   stop sir i beseech you  what whether i have anything to reveal or not  pray sir tell me invent for me a secret that is fit for me to own and then perhaps if it will save the trouble of enquiries i may make at least my four brothers easy  i am pleased however madam with your agreeable raillery continue but in this temper and the secret is revealed enquiry will be at an end  camilla here is continually teazing me with her persuasions to be in love as she calls it that is the silly thing in our sex which gives importance to yours a young creature cannot be grave cannot indulge a contemplative humor but she must be in love i should hate myself were i to put it in the power of any man breathing to give me uneasiness i hope sir i hope that you my brother have not so poor so low so mean a thought of me  it is neither poor nor low it is not mean to be in love madam  what not with an improper object  madam  what have i said you want to  but what i have now said was to introduce what i am going to tell you that i saw your insinuation and what it tended to when you read to me those lines of your shakespeare which in your heart i suppose you had the goodness or what shall i call it to apply to me let me see if i can repeat them to you in their original english  with the accent of her country she very prettily repeated those lines   she never told her love but let concealment like a worm in the bud feed on her damask cheek she pined in thought and with a green and yellow melancholy she sat like patience on a monument smiling at grief  now chevalier if you had any design in your pointing to these very pretty lines i will only say you are mistaken and so are all those who affront and afflict me with attributing my malady to so great a weakness  i meant not at the time madam   nor now i hope sir   any such application of the lines how could i your refusal of many lovers your declining the proposals of a man of the count of belvederes consequence and merit though approved of by every one of your friends are convictions   see camilla interrupting me with quickness the chevalier is convinced  pray let me have no more of your affronting questions and conjectures on this subject i tell you camilla i would not be in love for the world and all its glory  but madam if you will be pleased to assign one cause to your mamma for the melancholy turn your lively temper has taken you will free yourself from a suspicion that gives you pain as well as displeasure perhaps you are grieved that you cannot comply with your fathers views  perhaps   assign one cause again interrupted she  assign one cause  why sir  i am not well  i am not pleased with myself  as i told you  if it were anything that lay upon your mind your conscience madam your confessor   would not make me easy he is a good but turning aside and speaking low a severe man camilla hears not what i say camilla dropped behind he is more afraid of me in some cases than he need to be and why because you have almost persuaded me to think charitably of people of different persuasions by your noble charity of all mankind which i think heretic as you are forgive me sir carries an appearance of true christian goodness in it though protestants it seems will persecute one another but you would not be one of those except you are one man in italy another in england  your mother madam will ask if you have honored me with any part of your confidence her communicative goodness makes her think everybody should be as unreserved as herself your father is so good as to allow you to explain yourself to me when he wishes that i could prevail upon you to open your mind to me in the character of a fourth brother my lord the bishop   yes yes sir interrupted she all our family worships you almost i have myself a very great regard for you as the fourth brother who has been the deliverer and preserver of my third but sir who can prevail upon you in any thing you are determined upon  had i any thing upon my heart i would not tell it to one who brought up in error shuts his eyes against conviction in an article in which his everlasting good is concerned let me call you a catholic sir and i will not keep a thought of my heart from you you shall indeed be my brother and i shall free one of the holiest of men from his apprehensions on my conversing with so determined an heretic as he thinks you then shall you as my brother command those secrets if any i have from that heart in which you think them locked up  why then madam will you not declare them to your mamma to your confessor to my lord bishop  did i not say if any i have  and is your reverend confessor uneasy at the favor of the family to me  how causeless  have i ever madam talked with you on the subject of religion  well but sir are you so obstinately determined in your errors that there is no hope of convincing you i really look upon you as my papa and mamma first bid me do as my fourth brother i should be glad that all my brothers were of one religion will you allow father marescotti and father geraldino to enter into a conference with you on this subject and if they answer all your objections will you act according to your convictions  i will not by any means madam enter upon this subject  i have long intended sir to propose this matter to you  you have often intimated as much madam though not so directly as now but the religion of my country is the religion of my choice i have a great deal to say for it it will not be heard with patience by such strict professors as either of those you have named were i to be questioned on this subject before the pope and the whole sacred college i would not prevaricate but good manners will make me show respect to the religion of the country i happen to be in were it the mohammedan or even the pagan and to venerate the good men of it but i never will enter into debate upon the subject as a traveller a sojourner that is a rule with me  well sir you are an obstinate man that is all i will say i pity you with all my soul i pity you you have great and good qualities as i have sat at table with you and heard you converse on subjects that every one has in silence admired you for i have often thought to myself surely this man was not designed for perdition  but begone chevalier leave me you are an obstinate man yours is the worst of obstinacy for you will not give yourself a chance for conviction  we have so far departed from the subject we began upon that it is proper to obey you madam i only beg that my sister   not so far departed from it perhaps as you imagine interrupted she and turned a blushing cheek from me  but what do you beg of your sister  that she will rejoice the most indulgent of parents and the most affectionate of brothers with a cheerful aspect at table especially before the patriarch do not madam in silence   you find sir i have been talkative enough with you  shall we go through your shakespeares hamlet tonight  farewell chevalier i will try to be cheerful at table but let not your eye if i am not reproach me  she took another walk  i was loath my dear dr bartlett to impute to myself the consequence with this amiable lady that might but naturally be inferred from the turn which the conversation took but i thought it no more than justice to the whole family to hasten my departure and when i hinted to clementina that i should soon take leave of them i was rejoiced to find her unconcerned  this my good miss byron is what i find in my patrons letters relating to this conference he takes notice that the young lady behaved herself at table as she was wished to do  mr grandison was prevailed upon by the entreaties of the whole family to suspend his departure for a few days  the young ladys melancholy to the inexpressible affliction of her friends increased yet she behaved with so much greatness of mind that neither her mother nor her camilla could persuade themselves that love was the cause they sometimes imagined that the earnestness with which they solicited the interest of the count of belvedere with her had hurried and affected her delicate spirits and therefore they were resolved to say little more on that subject till they should see her disposed to lend a more favorable ear to it and the count retired to his own palace in parma expecting and hoping for such a turn in his favor for he declared that it was impossible for him to think of any other woman for a wife  but signor jeronymo doubted not all this time of the cause and without letting anybody into his opinion not even mr grandison for fear a disappointment would affect him resolved to make use of every opportunity that should offer in favor of the man he loved from a principle of gratitude that reigned with exemplary force in the breast of every one of this noble family a principle which took the firmer root in their hearts as the prudence generosity magnanimity and other great and equallyamiable qualities of mr grandison appeared every day more and more conspicuous to them all  i will soon madam present you with farther extracts from the letters in my possession in pursuance of the articles you have given me in writing i am not a little proud of my task  continuation of miss byrons letter begun p      can you not lucy gather from the settingout of this story and the short account of it given by sir charles in the libraryconference that i shall soon pay my duty to you all in northamptonshire i shall indeed  is it not strange my dear that a father and mother and brothers so jealous as italians in general are said to be of their women and so proud as this bologna family is represented to be of their rank should all agree to give so fine a man as this is in mind person and address such free access to their daughter a young lady of eighteen  teach her english  very discreet in the father and mother surely and to commission him to talk with the poor girl in favor of a man whom they wished her to marry  indeed you will say perhaps that by the honorable expedient they fell upon unknown to either tutor or pupil of listening to all that was to pass in the conference they found a method to prove his integrity and that finding it proof they were justified to prudence in their future confidence  with all my heart lucy if you will excuse these parents you may but i say that any body though not of italy might have thought such a tutor as this was dangerous to a young lady and the more for being a man of honor and family in every case the teacher is the obliger he is called master you know and where there is a master a servant is implied who is it that seeks not out for a married man among the common tribe of tutors whether professing music dancing languages science of any kind but a tutor such a one as this   well but i will leave them to pay the price of their indiscretion  i am this moment come from the doctor i insinuated to him as artfully as i could some of the above observations he reminded me that the marchioness herself had her education at paris and says that the manners of the italians are very much altered of late years and that the french freedom begins to take place among the people of condition in a very visible manner of the italian reserve the women of the family of porretta particularly he says because of their learning freedom and conversableness have been called by their enemies frenchwomen  but you will see that honor and the laws of hospitality were mr grandisons guard and i believe a young flame may be easily kept under but it is a grateful thing lucy to all women to have a man in love whether with ourselves or not and the more grateful perhaps the less prudent yet ought it to be so sir charles grandison is used to do only what he ought dr bartlett once said that the life of a good man was a continual warfare with his passions  you will see in the second conference between mr grandison and the lady upon the melancholy way she was in how artfully yet i must own honorably he reminds her of the brotherly character which he passes under to her how officiously he sisters her  ah lucy your harriet is his sister too you know he has been used to this dialect and to check the passions of us forward girls and yet i have gone on confessing mine to the whole venerable circle and have almost gloried in it to them have not also his sisters detected me while the noble clementina as in that admirable passage cited by her   never told her love but let concealment like a worm in the bud feed on her damask cheek  how do i admire her for her silence but yet had she been circumstanced as your harriet was would clementina have been so very reserved  shall i run a parallel between our two cases clementinas relations were all solicitous for her marrying the count of belvedere a man of unexceptionable character of family of fortune and who is said to be a gallant and an handsome man and who adores her and is of her own faith and country harriets relations were all solicitous from the first for an alliance with their childs deliverer they never had encouraged any mans address nor had she and all his nearest and dearest friends were partial to her and soon grew ardent in her favor what difficulties had clementina to contend with it was great in her to endeavor to conquer a love that she could not either in duty or with her judgment and conscience acknowledge harriet not knowing of any engagement he had could have no difficulties to contend with except inferiority of fortune were one she had therefore no reason to endeavor to conquer a passion not ignobly founded and of which duty judgment and conscience approved no wonder then that so excellent a young lady suffered concealment like a worm in the bud to feed on her damask cheek suspense therefore only and not concealment since every one called upon harriet to acknowledge her love could feed on her cheek and is not suspense enough to make it pale though it has not yet given it a green and yellow cast o what tortures has suspense given me but certainty is now taking place  what a right method lucy did clementina so much in earnest in her own persuasion take in this second conference could she have succeeded in her solicitude for his change of religion  could that have been effected i dare say she would have been less reserved as to the cause of her melancholy especially as her friends were all as indulgent to her as mine are to me  but my pity for the noble clementina begins to take great hold of my heart i long to have the whole before me  adieu lucy if i write more it will be all a recapitulation of the doctors letter i can think of nothing else   letter xxiii miss byron in continuation tuesday mar    let me now give you a brief account of what we are doing here sir charles so much rejoiced the heart of lord g who waited on him the moment he knew he was in town that he could not defer his attendance on miss grandison till she left colnebrooke and got hither by our breakfasttime this morning  he met with a very kind reception from lord and lady l and a civil one from miss grandison but she is already beginning to play her tricks with him  o lucy where is the sense of parading it with a worthy man of whose affection we have no reason to doubt and whose visits we allow  silly men in love or pretending to be in love generally say hyperbolical things all in short that could be said to a creature of superior order to an angel because they know not how to say polite proper or sensible things in like manner from the same defects in understanding some of us women act as if we thought coyness and modesty the same thing and others as if they were sensible that if they were not insolent they must drop into the arms of a lover upon his first question  but miss grandison in her behavior to lord g is governed by motives of archness and i may say downright roguery of temper courtship is play to her she has a talent for raillery and in no instance is so successful yet so improper as on that subject she could not spare her brother upon it though she suffered by it  yet had she a respect for lord g she could not treat him ludicrously cannot a witty woman find her own consequence but by putting a fools coat on the back of a friend  sterling wit i imagine requires not a foil to set it off  she is indeed goodnatured and this is all lord g has to depend upon  saving a little reliance that he may make upon the influence her brother has over her i told her just now that were i lord g i would not wish to have her mine on any consideration she called me silly creature and asked me if it were not one of the truest signs of love when men were most fond of the women who were least fit for them and used them worst these men my dear said she are very sorry creatures and know no medium they will either spaniellike fawn at your feet or be ready to leap into your lap  she has charming spirits i wish i could borrow some of them but i tell her that i would not have a single dram of those overlively ones which i see she will play off upon lord g yet he will be pleased at present with any treatment from her though he wants not feeling as i can see already  dont charlotte said i to her within this halfhour let him find his own weight in your levity he admires your wit but dont let it wound him  but perhaps she is the sprightlier in order to give me and lord and lady l spirits they are very good to me and greatly apprehensive of the story which takes up in a manner my whole attention so is miss grandison and my sweet emily as often as she may comes up to me when i am alone and hangs upon my arm my shoulder and watches with looks of love every turn of my eyes  i have opened my whole heart to her for the better guarding of hers and this history of clementina affords an excellent lesson for the good girl she blesses me for the lectures i read her on this subject and says that she sees love is a very subtle thing and like water will work its way into the banks that are set up to confine it if it be not watched and damned out in time  she pities clementina and prettily asked my leave to do so i think said she my heart loves her but not so well as it does you i long to know what my guardian will do about her how good is it in her father and mother to love her so dearly her two elder brothers one cannot dislike but jeronymo is my favorite he is a man worth saving int he madam but i pity her father and mother as well as clementina  charming young creature what an excellent heart she has  sir charles is to dine with sir hargrave and his friends tomorrow on the forest in his way to grandisonhall the doctor says he expects to hear from him when there what will he go by this house and not call in  with all my heart  we are only sisters miss grandison says she will be hanged that is her word if he is not afraid of me afraid of me a sign if he is he knows not what a poor forward creature i am but as he seems to be preengagged  well but i shall soon know every thing as to that but sure he might call in as he went by  the doctor says he longs to know how he approves of the decorations of his church and of the alterations that are made and making by his direction at the hall it is a wonder methinks that he takes not dr bartlett with him upon my word i think he is a little unaccountable such sisters as he has should you like it lucy were he your brother i really think his sisters are too acquiescent  he has a great taste the doctor tells us yet not an expensive one for he studies situation and convenience and pretends not to level hills or to force and distort nature but to help it as he finds it without letting art be seen in his works where he can possibly avoid it for he says he would rather let a stranger be pleased with what he sees as if it were always so than to obtain comparative praise by informing him what it was in its former situation  as he is to be a suitor for lord w before he returns he will not perhaps be with us while i am here he may court for others he has had very little trouble of that sort for himself i find  a very disturbing thought is just come into my head sir charles being himself in suspense as to the catastrophe of this knotty affair did not intend to let us know it till all was over  as sure as you are alive lucy he had seen my regard for him through the thin veil that covered it and began to be apprehensive generously apprehensive for the heart of the poor fool and so has suffered dr bartlett to transcribe the particulars of the story that they may serve for a check to the overforward passion of your harriet  this thought excites my pride and that my contempt of myself near borderers lucy what a little creature does it make me in my own eyes  o dr bartlett your kindlyintended transcripts shall cure me indeed they shall  but now this subject is got uppermost again what lucy can i do with it  miss grandison says that i shall be with her every day when i go to town i can have no exception she says when her brother is absent  nor when he is present i begin now to think  lord help me my dear i must be so very careful of my ponctilio  no thought i in the true spirit of prudery i will not go to sir charless house for the world and why because he is a single man and because i think of something  that he perhaps has no notion of but now i may go and visit his sister without scruple may i not for he perhaps thinks only of his clementina  and is not this a charming difficulty got over lucy  but as i said i will soon be with you  i told miss grandison that i would just now  lovers said she are the weakest people in the world and people of punctilio the most un punctilious  you have not talked till now of going in such an hurry would you have it thought that you stayed in town for a particular reason and when that ceased valued nobody else she held up her finger  consider said she  there is something in this lucy yet what can i do  but dr bartlett says he shall soon give me another letter  farewell my dear letter xxiv miss byron in continuation wednesday mar    sir charles came hither this morning time enough to breakfast with us  lady l is not an early riser i am sure this brother of hers is so is miss grandison if i say i am my lucy i will not allow you to call it boasting because you will by so calling it acknowledge early rising to be a virtue and if you thought it such i am sure you would distinguish it by your practice forgive me my dear this is the only point in which you and i have differed  and why have i in the main so patiently suffered this difference and not tried to teaze you out of it because my lucy always so well employs her time when she is alive but would not one the more wish that wellemployed life to be made as long as possible  i endeavored to be very cheerful at breakfast but i believe my behavior was awkward and affected after sir charles was gone on my putting the question to the two sisters whether it was not so they acquitted me  yet my heart when in his company labored with a sense of constraint  my pride made me want to find out pity for me in his looks and behavior on purpose to quarrel with him in my mind for i could not get out of my head that degrading surmise that he had permitted dr bartlett to hasten to me the history of clementina in order generously to check any hopes that i might entertain before they had too strongly taken hold of my foolish heart  but nothing of this was discoverable respect tender respect appeared as the ladies afterward took notice in every word when he addressed himself to me in every look that he cast upon me  he studiously avoided speaking of the bologna family we were not indeed any of us fond of leading to the subject  i am sure i pitied him  pity my dear is a softer passion i dare say in the bosom of a woman than in that of a man there is there must be i should fancy more generosity more tenderness in the pity of the one than in that of the other in a mans pity i write in the first case from my own sensibilities in the other from my apprehensions there is too probably a mixture of insult or contempt unhappy indeed must the woman be who has drawn upon her the helpless pity of the man she loves  the ladies and lord l will have it that sir charless love however is not so much engaged for clementina as his compassion they are my sincere friends they see that i am pretty delicate in my notions of a first love and they generously endeavor to inculcate this distinction upon me but to what purpose when we evidently see from what we already know of this story that his engagements be the motive what it will are of such a nature that they cannot be dispensed with while this ladys destiny is undetermined  poor lady clementina from my heart i pity her and tenderness i am sure is the sole motive of my compassion for this fair unfortunate  sir charles set out immediately after breakfast for sir hargraves he will dine with him and intends to pass the evening with lord w we shall all go to town tomorrow  with this i send the doctors second packet o my dear what a noble young lady is clementina what a purity is there in her passion a letter of mrs beaumout mrs beaumont herself an excellent woman will show you that clementina deserves every good wish such a noble struggle did i never hear of between religion and love o lucy you will be delighted with clementina you will even for a while forget your harriet or if you are just will think of her but next after clementina never did a young lady do more honor to her sex than is done it by clementina a flame the most vehement suppressed from motives of piety till poor lady it has devoured her intellects  read the letter and be lost as i was for half an hour after i had read it in silent admiration of her fortitude o my dear she must be rewarded with a sir charles grandison my reason my justice compels from me my vote in her favor  my lord l and the two ladies admire her as much as i do they look at me with eyes of tender concern they say little what can they say  but they kindly applaud me for unfeigned admiration of this extraordinary young lady but where is my merit who can forbear admiring her  dr bartletts second letter your forth enquiry madam is  whether the particularly cheerful behavior of the young lady on the departure of mr grandison from bologna after a course of melancholy is anywhere accounted for  and your fifth is what were the particulars of mrs beaumonts management of the lady at florence by which she brought her to own her love after she had so long kept it a secret from her mother and all her family   what i shall transcribe in order to satisfy you madam with regard to the fifth article will include all that you can wish to be informed of respecting the fourth  but let me premise that mrs beaumont at the request of the marchioness undertook to give an account of the health of the young lady and what effect the change of air of place and her advice had upon her mind after she had been at florence for two or three days she on the fourth day of their being together wrote to that lady the desired particulars the following is a translation of her letter  your ladyship will excuse me for not writing till now when you are acquainted that it was not before last night that i could give you any tolerable satisfaction on the subject upon which i had engaged to do myself that honor  i have made myself mistress of the dear young ladys secret your ladyship guessed it perhaps too well love but a pure and laudable love is the malady that has robbed her of her tranquillity for so long a space and your splendid family of all comfort but such a magnanimity shown or endeavored at that she deserves to be equally pitied and admired what is it that the dear young lady has not suffered in a conflict between her duty her religion and her love  the discovery i am afraid will not give pleasure to your family yet certainty in what must be is better than suspense you will think me a managing person perhaps from the relation i have to give you but it was the task prescribed me and you commanded me to be very minute in the account of all my dealings with her that you might know how to conduct yourselves to her for the cure of the unhappy malady i obey  the first and second days after our return to florence were passed in endeavoring to divert her as our guest in all the ways we could think of but finding that company was irksome to her and that she only bore with it for politeness sake i told the ladies that i would take her entirely into my own care and devote my whole time to her service they acquiesced and when i told lady clementina of my intention she rejoiced at it and did me the honor to assure me that my conversation would be balm to her heart if she could enjoy it without mixed company  your ladyship will see however from what i have mentioned of her regard for me that i had made use of my time in the two pasts days to ingratiate myself into the favor of your clementina she will have me call her nothing but clementina excuse therefore madam the freedom of my style  she engaged me last night to give her a lesson as she called it in an english author i was surprised at her proficiency in my native tongue ah my dear said i what an admirable manner of teaching must your tutor have had if i am to judge by the great progress you have made in so short a time in the acquiring of a tongue that has not the sweetness of your own though it has a force and expressiveness that is more than equal i think to any of the modern languages  she blushed  do you think so said she  and i saw by the turn of her eye and her consciousness that i had no need to hint to her count marulli nor any other man  i took upon me without pushing her just then upon the supposed light dropped in from this little incident to mention the count of belvedere with distinction as the marquis had desired i would  she said she could not by any means think of him  i told her that as all her family approved highly of the count i thought they were entitled to know her objections and to judge of the reasonableness or unreasonableness of them indeed my dear said i you do not in this point treat your father and mother with the dutifulness that their indulgence deserves  she started that is severely said is it not madam  consider of it my dear and if you pronounce it so after an hours reflection i will call it so and ask your pardon  i am afraid said she i am in fault i have the best and most indulgent of parents there are some things some secrets that one cannot be forward to divulge one should perhaps be commanded out of them with a high hand  your acknowlegement my dear said i is more generous than the occasion given for it but if you will not think me impertinent   dont dont ask me too close questions madam interrupted she i am afraid i can deny nothing  i am persuaded my dear clementina that the mutual unbosoming of secrets is the cement of faithful friendship and true love whenever any new turn in ones affairs happens whenever any new lights open the friendly heart rests not till it has communicated to its fellowheart the new lights the interesting events and this communicativeness knits the true lovers knot still closer but what a solitariness what a gloom what a darkness must possess that mind that can trust no friend with its inmost thoughts the big secret when it is of an interesting nature will swell the heart till it is ready to burst deep melancholy must follow  i would not for the world have it so much as thought that i had not a soul large enough for friendship and is not the essence of friendship communication mingling of hearts and emptying our very soul into that of a true friend  why that is true but madam a young creature may be so circumstanced as not to have a true friend or if she has near her a person to whom she might communicate her whole mind without doubt of her fidelity yet there may be a forbiddingness in the person a difference in years in degree as in my camilla who is however a very good woman  we people of condition madam have more courtiers about us than friends but camillas fault is teazing and always harping upon one string and that by my friends commands it would be therefore more laudable to open my mind to my mother than to her as it would be the same thing  very true my dear and as you have a mother who is less of the mother than she would be of the sister the friend it is amazing to me that you have kept such a mother in the dark so long  what can i say  ah madam  there she stopped at last said but my mother is in the interest of the man i cannot love  the question recurs  are not your parents entitled to know your objections to the man whose interest they so warmly espouse  i have no particular objections the count of belvedere deserves a better wife than i can make him i should respect him very much had i a sister and he made his addresses to her  well then my dear clementina if i guess the reason why you cannot approve of the count of belvedere will you tell me with that candor with that friendship of the requisites of which we have been speaking whether i am right or not  she hesitated i was silent in expectation  she then spoke i am afraid of you madam  you have reason to be so if you think me unworthy of your friendship  what is your guess  that you are prejudiced in favor of some other man or you could not if you had a sister wish her an husband that you thought unworthy of yourself  i dont think the count of belvedere unworthy neither madam  then my conjecture has received additional strength  o mrs beaumont how you press upon me  if impertinently say so and i have done  no no not impertinently neither yet you distress me  that could not be if i were not right and if the person were not too unworthy of you to be acknowleged  o mrs beaumont how closely you urge me what can i say  if you have any confidence in me  if you think me capable of advising you   i have confidence your known prudence  and then she made me compliments that i could not deserve  come my dear clementina i will guess again  shall i  what would you guess  that there is a man of low degree  of low fortunes  of inferior sense   hold hold hold  and do you think that the clementina before you is sunk so low  if you do why dont you cast the abject creature from you  well then i will guess again  that there is a man of a royal house of superior understanding of whom you can have no hope  o mrs beaumont and cannot you guess that this prince is a mohammedan when your hand is in  then madam and from the hints your ladyship had given i had little doubt that clementina was in love and that religion was the apprehended difficulty zealous catholics think not better of protestants than of mahometans nor indeed are zealous protestants without their prejudices zeal will be zeal in persons of whatever denomination  i would not however madam like a sudden frost nip the opening bud  there is said i a young soldier of fortune who has breathed forth passionate wishes for clementina  a soldier of fortune madam with an air of disdain there cannot be such a man living that can have his wishes answered  well then to say nothing of him there is a roman nobleman  a younger brother  of the borghese house  permit me to suppose him the man  with all my heart madam  she was easy while i was at a distance  but if the chevalier grandison she colored at his name has done him ill offices   the chevalier grandison madam is incapable of doing any man ill offices  are you sure madam that the chevalier has not art  he has great abilities men of great abilities are not always to be trusted they dont strike till they are sure  he has no art madam he is above art he wants it not he is beloved wherever he goes he is equally noted for his prudence and freedom of heart he is above art repeated she with warmth  i own that he deserves everything from your family i dont wonder that he is caressed by you all but it is amazing to me that in contradiction to all the prudent maxims and cautions of your country such a young gentleman should have been admitted  i slopt  why now you dont imagine that i  that i  she stopped and hesitated  a prudent woman would not put it in any mans power to give her a prejudice to persons of unexceptionable honor and to manage   nay madam now has somebody prejudiced you against your countryman  he is the most disinterested of men  i have heard young ladies when he was here speak of him as an handsome man  an handsome man and is not mr grandison an handsome man where will you see a man so handsome  and do you think he is so very extraordinary a man as to sense as i have heard him reported to be i was twice in his company  i thought indeed he looked upon himself as a man of consequence  nay madam dont say he is not a modest man it is true he knows when to speak and when to be silent but he is not a confident man nor is he in the least conceited  was there so much bravery in his relieving your brother as some people attribute to him in that happy event two servants and himself well armed the chance of passengers on the same road the assassins that appeared but two their own guilt to encounter with   dear dear mrs beaumont with what prejudiced people have you conversed the scripture says a prophet has no honor in his own country but mr grandison has not much from his own countrywoman  well but did mr grandison ever speak to you of any one man as a man worthy of your favor  did he  yes of the count of belvedere he was more earnest in his favor   really  yes really  than i thought he ought to be  why so  why so  why because  because  why what was it to him  you know  i suppose he was put upon it   i believe so  or he would not   i believe if the truth were known you mrs beaumont hate mr grandison you are the only person that i ever in my life heard speak of him even with indifference  tell me my dear clementina what are you sincere thoughts of mr grandison person and mind  you may gather them from what i have said  that he is an handsome man a generous a prudent a brave a polite man  indeed i think him to be all you have said and i am not singular  but he is a mohammedan   a mohammedan madam  ah mrs beaumont  and ah my dear clementina  and do you think i have not found you out  had you never known mr grandison you would not have scrupled to have been countess of belvedere  and can you think madam   yes yes my dear young lady i can  my good mrs beaumont you dont know what i was going to say  be sincere my dear young lady cannot a lover talking to a second person be sincere  what madam a man of another religion a man obstinate in his errors a man who has never professed love to me a man of inferior degree a man who owns himself absolutely dependent upon his fathers bounty his father living to the height of his estate  forbid it pride dignity of birth duty religion   well then i may safely take up the praises of mr grandison you have imputed to me slight injustice prejudice against him let me now show you that the prophet has honor with his countrywoman let me collect his character from the mouth of every man who has spoken of him in my hearing or knowledge  his country has not in this age sent abroad a private man who has done it more credit he is a man of honor in every sense of the word if moral rectitude if practical religion your brother the barone testifies this on his own experience were lost in the rest of the world it would without glare or osentation be found in him he is courted by the best the wisest the most eminent men wherever he goes and he does good without distinction of religion sects or nation his own countrymen boast of him and apply to him for credentials to the best and most considerable men in their travels through more countries than one in france particularly he is as much respected as in italy he is descended from the best families in england both by father and mother and can be a senator of it whenever he pleases he is heir to a very considerable estate and is as i am informed courted to ally with some of the greatest families in it were he not born to a fortune he would make one you own him to be generous brave handsome   o my dear dear mrs beaumont all this is too much too much  yet all this i think him to be i can no longer resist you i own i own that i have no heart but for mr grandison and now as i dont doubt but my friends set you to find out the lovesick girl how shall i who cannot disown a secret you have so fairly and without condition come at ever look them in the face yet let them know i will enable you to tell them how all this came about and how much i have struggled against a passion so evidently improper to be encouraged by a daughter of their house  he was in the first place as well you know the preserver of a beloved brothers life and that brother afterward owned that had he followed his friendly advice he never would have fallen into the danger from which he rescued him  my father and mother presented him to me and bid me regard him as a fourth brother and it was not immediately that i found out that i could have but three brothers  my brothers deliverer proved to be the most amiable and humane and yet bravest of men  all my friends caressed him neither family forms nor national forms were stood upon he had free access to us all as one of us  my younger brother was continually hinting to me his wishes that i were his mr grandison was above all other reward and my brother considered me in a kind light as able to reward him  my confessor by his fears and invectives rather confirmed than lessened my esteem for a man whom i thought injured by them  his own respectful and disinterested behavior to me contributed to my attachment he always addressed me as his sister when he put on the familiar friend in the guise of a tutor i could not therefore arm against a man i had no reason to suspect  but still i knew not the strength of my passion for him till the count of belvedere was proposed to me with an earnestness that alarmed me then i considered the count as the interrupter of my hopes and yet i could not give the reason why i rejected him how could i when i had none to give but my prepossession in favor of another man a prepossession entirely hidden in my own heart  but still i thought i would sooner die than be the wife of a man of a religion contrary to my own i am a zealous catholic myself all my relations are zealous catholics how angry have i been at this obstinate heretic as i have often called him the first heretic my dear mrs beaumont for once i did not love you that my soul detested not for he is as tenacious a protestant as ever came out of england what had he to do in italy why did he not stay at home or why if he must come abroad did he stay so long among us yet hold his obstinacy as if in defiance of the people he was so well received by  these were the reproaches that my heart in silence often cast upon him  i was at first concerned only for his souls sake but afterward finding him essential to my earthly happiness and yet resolving never to think of him if he became not a catholic i was earnest for his conversion for my own sake hoping that my friends indulgence to me would make my wishes practicable for on his part i doubted not if that point were got over he would think an alliance with our family an honor to him  but when i found him invincible on this article i was resolved either to conquer my passion or die what did i not undergo in my endeavors to gain this victory over myself my confessor hurt me by terrors my woman teazed me my parents and two elder brothers and all my more distant relations urged me to determine in favor of the count of belvedere the count was importunate the chevalier was importunate in the counts behalf  good heaven what could i do  i was hurried as i may say i had not time given me to weigh ponder recollect how could i make my mother how could i make anybody my confident my judgment was at war with my passion and i hoped it would overcome i struggled yet every day the object appearing more worthy the struggle was too hard for me o that i had had a mrs beaumont to consult  well might melancholy seize me  silent melancholy  at last the chevalier was resolved to leave us what pain yet what pleasure did this his resolution give me most sincerely i hoped that his absence would restore my tranquillity  what a secret triumph did i gave myself on my behavior to him before all my friends on the parting evening  my whole deportment was uniform i was cheerful serene happy in myself and i made all my friends so i wished him happy wherever he set his foot and whatsoever he engaged in i thanked him with the rest of my friends for the benefits we had received from him and the pleasure he had given us in the time he had bestowed upon us and i wished that he might never want a friend so agreeand entertaining as he had been to us all  i was the more pleased with myself as i was not under a necessity of putting on stiffness or reserve to hide a heart too much affected i thought myself secure and stood out forwarder than he seemed to hope for and with more than my offered hand at the moment of his departure i thought i read in his eyes a concern for the first time that called for a pity which i imagined i myself wanted not yet i had a pang at parting  when the door shut out the agreeable man never again thought i to be opened to give him entrance i sighed at the reflection but who perceived it  i never could be insensible in a parting scene with less agreeable friends it was the easier for me to attribute to the gentleness of my heart the instant sensibility my father clasped me to his bosom my mother embraced me without mortifying me by saying for what my brother the bishop called me twenty fond names all my friends complimented me but only on my cheerfulness and said i was once more their own clementina i went to rest pleased that i had so happily acquitted myself and that possibly i contributed to the repose of dear friends whose repose i had been the cause of disturbing  but alas this conduct was too great for the poor clementina to maintain my soul was too high set  you know the rest and i am lost to the joys of this life for i never never will be the wife of a man if i might who by his religion is an enemy to the faith i never wavered in nor would ever change were an earthly crown on the head of the man i love to be the reward and a painful death in the prime of my life the contrary  a flood of tears prevented farther speech she hid her face in my bosom she sighed  dear lady how she sighed  this madam is the account i have to give of what has passed between your beloved clementina and me never was there a more noble struggle between duty and affection though her heart was too tender and in short the mans merits too dazzling to allow it to be effectual she is unwilling that i should send you the particulars she shall be ashamed she says to look her father her mother in the face and she dreads still more if possible her confessors being made acquainted with the state of her heart and the cause of her disorder but i tell her it is absolutely necessary for her mother to know everything that i know in order to attempt a cure  this cure madam i am afraid will never be effected but by giving her in marriage to the happy man i must think him so who will be entitled by general consent to so great a blessing  you madam will act in this affair as you judge proper but if you can at bologna at urbino and naples get over your family objections you will perhaps find yourselves obliged such are the young ladys own scruples on the score of religion to take pains to persuade her to pursue her inclination and accept mr grandison for an husband  be this as it may i would humbly recommend a gentle and soothing treatment of her she never knew yet what the contrary was and were she to experience that contrary now upon an occasion so very delicate and in which her judgment and her love are as she hints at variance i verily think she would not be able to bear it  that god direct you for the best whom you and yours have always served with signal devotion  i will only add that since the secret which had so long preyed upon her fine spirits is revealed she appears to be much more easy than before but yet she dreads the reception she shall meet with on her return to bologna she begs of me when that return shall be ordered to accompany her in order to enable her as she says to support her spirits she is very desirous to enter into a nunnery she says she never can be the wife of any other man and she thinks she ought not to be his on whom her heart is fixed  a word of comfort on paper from your honored hand i know madam would do a great deal toward healing her wounded heart  i am madam with the greatest veneration and respect  your ladyships most faithful humble servant hortensia beaumont let me add my good miss byron that the marchioness sent an answer to this letter expressing the highest obligation and gratitude to mrs beaumont and enclosed a letter to her daughter filled with tender and trulymotherly consolation inviting her back to bologna out of hand and her amiable friend with her promising in the name of her father and brothers a most indulgent welcome and assuring her that everything should be done that could be done to make her happy in her own way    letter xxv miss byron to miss selby wedn night mar    i enclose my lucy the doctors third packet from its contents you will pity sir charles as well as clementina and if you enter impartially into the situation of the family and allow as much to their zeal for a religion they are satisfied with as you will do for sir charless steadiness in his you will also pity them they are all good they are all considerate a great deal is to be said for them though much more for sir charles who insisted not upon that change of religion in the lady which they demanded from him  how great does he appear in my eyes a confessor though not a martyr one may call him for his religion and country  how deep was his distress a mind so delicate as his and wishing for the sake of the sex and the lady and family as he did rather to be repulsed by them than to be obliged himself to decline their intended favor  you will admire the lady in her sweetlymodest behavior on his first visit before her mother but more for the noble spirit she endeavored to resume in her conversation with him in the garden  but how great will he appear in your eyes in the eyes of my grandmother and aunt selby for that noble apostrophe  but o my religion and my country i cannot cannot renounce you what can this short life promise what can it give to warrant such a sacrifice  yet her conduct you will find is not inferior to his firmly persuaded as she is of the truth of her religion and loving him with an ardor that he had from the first restrained in himself from hopelessness  but to admire her as she deserves i should transcribe all she says and his account of her whole behavior  o my dear who could have acted as clementina acted  not i fear  your harriet byron   dr bartletts third letter your sixth command madam is to give you the particulars of mr grandisons reception from the marchioness and her clementina on his return to bologna from vienna at the invitation of signor jeronymo    mr grandison was received at his arrival with great tokens of esteem and friendship by the marquis himself and by the bishop  signor jeronymo who still kept his chamber the introducer being withdrawn embraced him and now said he is the affair that i have had so long in view determined upon o chevalier you will be a happy man clementina will be yours you will be clementinas and now indeed do i embrace my brother  but i detain you not go to the happy girl she is with her mother and both are ready to receive and welcome you allow for the gentle spirit she will not be able to say half she thinks  camilla then appeared to conduct me says mr grandison to her ladies in the marchionesss drawing room she whispered me in the passage welcome thrice welcome best of men now will you be rewarded for all your goodness  i found the marchioness sitting at her toilette richly dressed as in ceremony but without attendants even camilla retired as soon as she had opened the door for me  the lovely clementina stood at the back of her mothers chair she was elegantly dressed but her natural modesty heightened by a glowing consciousness that seemed to arise from the occasion gave her advantages that her richest jewels could not have given her  the marchioness stood up i kissed her hand  you are welcome chevalier said she the only man on earth that i could thus welcome or is fit to be so welcomed  clementina my dear  turning round and taking her hand  the young lady had shrunk back her complexion varying now glowing now pale  excuse her voice said the condescending mother her heart bids you welcome  judge for me my dear dr bartlett how i must be affected at this gracious reception i who knew not the terms that were to be prescribed to me spare me dear lady thought i spare me my conscience and take all the worlds wealth and glory to yourselves i shall be rich enough with clementina  the marchioness seated her in her own chair i approached her but how could i with that grateful ardor that but for my doubts would have sprung to my lips modest love however was attributed to me and i had the praise wholly for that which was but partly due to it  i drew a chair for the marchioness and at her command another for myself the mother took one hand of her bashful daughter i presumed to take the other the amiable lady held down her blushing face and reproved me not as she did once before on the like freedom for being too free her mother asked me questions of an indifferent nature as of my journey of the courts i had visited since i left them when i heard from england after my father my sisters the latter questions in a kind way as if she were asking after relations that were to be her own  what a mixture of pain had i with the favor shown me and for the favor shown me for i questioned not but a change of religion would be proposed and insisted on and i had no doubt in my mind about my own  after a short conversation the amiable daughter arose courtesied low to her mother with dignity to me and withdrew  ah chevalier said the marchioness as soon as she was gone little did i think when you let us that we should so soon see you again and on the account we see you but you know how to receive your good fortune with gratitude your modesty keeps in countenance our forwardness  i bowed  what could i say  i shall leave so will my lord particular subjects to be talked of between the bishop and you you will if it be not your own fault have a treasure in clementina and a treasure with her we shall do the same things for her as if she had married the man we wished her to have when we thought her affections disengaged you may believe we love our daughter  else   i applauded their indulgent goodness  i can have no doubt mr grandison that you love clementina above all women  i had never seen the woman dr bartlett that i could have loved so well had i not restrained myself at first from the high notion i knew they had of their quality and rank from considerations of the difference in religion of the trust and confidence the family placed in me and by the resolution i had made as a guard to myself from the time of my entering upon my travels of never aiming to marry a foreigner  i assured the marchioness that i was absolutely disengaged in my affections that not having presumed to encourage hopes of the good fortune that seemed to await me i could hardly yet flatter myself that so great an happiness was reserved for me  she answered that i deserved it all that i knew the value they had for me that clementinas regard was founded in virtue that my character was my happiness that however what the world would say had been no small point with them but that was as good as got over and she doubted not but all that depended upon me would as well from generosity as gratitude be complied with  here thought i is couched the expectation and if so would to heaven i had never seen italy  the marquis joined his lady and me soon after his features had a melancholy cast this dear girl said he has fastened upon me part of her malady parents chevalier who are blessed with even hopeful children are not always happy this girl  but no more she is a good child in the general economy of providence none of the sons of men are unhappy but some others are the happier for it our son the bishop will talk to you upon terms  i have hinted to the chevalier my lord said the marchioness the happiness that waits him  how does the poor girl  bashful enough i suppose  indeed my lord she cannot look up answered the lady  poor thing i supposed it would be so  why why thought i was i suffered to see this mother this daughter before their conditions were proposed to me  but what indulgent parents are these dr bartlett what an excellent daughter yet not to be happy but how much more unhappily circumstanced did i think myself  i who had rather have been rejected with disdain by twenty women in turn than to be obliged to decline the honor intended me by a family i reverenced  thus far mr grandison this madam will answer your question as to the vith article but i believe a few more particulars will be acceptable  the marquis led me proceeds mr grandison into the chamber of signor jeronymo your good fortune chevalier said he as we entered it is owing to jeronymo who owes his life to you i bless god we are a family that know not what ingratitude means  i made my acknowlegements both to father and son  the marquis then went into public affairs and soon after left us together  i was considering whether i had best tell that sincere friend my apprehensions in relation to the articles of religion and residence for he had with an air of humor congratulated me on the philosophical manner in which i bore my good fortune when camilla entered and whispered me of her own head as she said that her young lady was just gone into the garden  i dare say it was of her own head for camilla has a great deal of goodnature and is constantly desirous of obliging where she thinks she shall not offend anybody  follow her then said jeronymo who heard what camilla said clementina perhaps expects you  camilla waited for me at the entrance into the garden one word sir if you please i am afraid of the return of my young ladys thoughtfulness she says she is ashamed of the poor figure she made before her mother she is sure she must look mean in your eyes a man to be sent for camilla said she in compliment to my weakness why did not my too indulgent father bid me conquer my folly or die o that i had not owned my attachment naughty mrs beaumont said she had it not been for you my own bosom had contained the secret till shame and indignation against myself had burst my heart she is resolved she says to resume a spirit becoming her birth and quality and i am afraid of her elevations her great apprehensions are that with all this condescension of her parents obstacles will arise on your part if so she says she shall not be able to beat her own reflections nor look her friends in the face  my dear dr bartlett how have i who have hitherto so happily escaped the snares by which the feet of unreflectiong youth are often entangled by women of light same been embarrassed by perverse accidents that have arisen from my friendships with the worthy of the sex was there ever a more excellent family than this  every individual of it is excellent and is not then worthiness and even their piety the cause to which our mutual difficulties are owing  but o my religion and my country i cannot cannon renounce you what can this short life give what can it promise to warrant such a sacrifice  i said nothing to camilla you may believe of what i could or could not do yet she saw my distress she took notice of it being firmly persuaded of the excellency of her own religion she wondered that a man of reflection and reading could be of a contrary one her heart she said as well as the heart of her young lady boded an unhappy issue to ou loves heaven avert it said the honest woman but what m y we not fear by way of judgment where a young lady  forgive me sir  presers a man she thinks she ought not to prefer and where a gentleman will not be convinced of errors which the church condemns  she again begged i would forgive her i praised her good intention and sincere dealing and leaving her went into the garden  i sound the young lady in the orangegrove you have been in that ga den dr bartlett  she turned her face toward me as i drew near her and seeing who it was stopped  clementina armed with conscious worthiness as if she had resumed the same spirit which had animated her on the eve of my departure from bologna condescended to advance two or three paces toward me  lovely woman thought i encourage the true dignity that shines in that noble aspect  who knows what may be our destiny  i bowed veneration esteem and concern from the thought of what that might be all joined to make my obeisance profound  i was going to speak she prevented me her air and manner were great  you are welcome sir said she my mamma bid me say welcome i could not then speak and she was so good to you as to answer for my heart my voice is now found but tell me  do i see the same generous the same noble grandison that i have heretofore seen  or do i see a man inclined to slight the creature whom her indulgent parents are determined to oblige even to the sacrifice of all their views  you see madam the same grandison his heart only oppressed with the honor done him and with the fear that the happiness designed for him may yet be frustrated if it should how shall i be able to support myself  what a difficult situation my dear dr bartlett was mine  equally afraid to urge my suit with ardor or to be imagined capable of being indifferent to her favor  what do you fear sir  you have grounds in your own heart perhaps for your fear if you have let me know them i am not afraid to know them let me tell you that i opposed the step taken i doclared that i would sooner die than it should be taken it was to you they said and you would know how to receive as you ought the distinction paid you i have a soul sir not unworthy of the spirit of my ancestors tell me what you fear  i only fear one thing and that is that i should be thought to be more in your power than in my own  noble lady and think you that while my happiness is not yet absolutely resolved upon i have not reason to fear  you will always madam be in your own power you will be most so when in mine my gratitude will ever prompt me to acknowledge your goodness to me as a condescension  but say tell me sir did you not at first receiving the invitation despise in absence the clementina that now perhaps in presence you have the goodness to pity  o that the highsould clementina would not think so contemptibly of the man before her as she must think when she puts a question that would entitle him to infamy could he presume to think an answer to it necessary  well sir i shall see how far the advances made an the wrong side will be justified or rather countenanced by the advances or shall i say i will if you please condescensions to be made on yours  what a petulance thought i but can the generous the noble clementina knowing that terms will be proposed with which in honor and conscience i cannot comply put my regard for her on such a test as this  i will not suppose that she is capable of mingling art with her magnanimity  is this madam said i a generous anticipation forgive me but when your friends are so good as to think me incapable of returning ingratitude for obligation i hope i shall not be classed by their beloved daughter among the lowest of mankind  excuse me sir the woman who has been once wrong has reason to be always afraid of herself if you do not think meanly of me i will endeavor to think well of myself and then sir i shall think better of you if better i can think for after all did i not more mistrust myself than i do you i should not perhaps be so capricious as i am afraid i sometimes am  the marquis has hinted to me madam that your brother the bishop is to discourse with me on the subject now the nearest to my heart of all others may i presume to address myself to their beloved daughter upon it without being thought capable of endeavoring to prepossess her in my favor before my lord and i meet  i will answer you frankly sir there are preliminaries to be settled and till they are i that know there are do not think myself at liberty to hear you upon any subject that may tend to prepossession  i acquiesce madam i would not for the world be thought to wish for the honor of your attention while it is improper for you to favor me with it  i did not know dr bartlett but upon a supposition of a mutual interest between us as i had hoped she would allow clementina might wish that i would lead to some particular discourse though modesty becomes ours as well as the other sex yet it would be an indelicacy not to prevent a lady in some certain cases but thus discouraged perhaps madam said i the attendance i do myself the honor to pay you here may not be agreeable to the marquis  then sir you will choose perhaps to withdraw but dont  yes do  i respectfully withdrew but she taking a winding alley which led into that in which i slowly walked we met again i am afraid said she i have been a little petulant indeed sir i am not satisfied with myself i wish  and there she stopped  what madam do you wish favor me with your wishes if it be in my power   it is not interrupted she i wish i had not been at florence the lady i was with is a good woman but she was too hard for me perhaps and she sighed had i not been with her i had been at rest and happy before now but if i had not there is a pleasure as well as pain in melancholy but now i am so fretful  if i hated the bitterest enemy i have as much as at times i hate myself i should be a very bad creature  this was spoken with an air so melancholy as greatly disturbed me god grant thought i that the articles of religion and residence may be agreed upon between the bishop and me  here my good miss byron i close this letter sir charles has told you briefly the event of the conference between the bishop and him and i hasten to obey you in your next article   letter xxvi miss byron to miss selby thursday morn mar  0 i send you now enclosed the doctors fourth letter i believe i must desire my grandmamma and my aunt selby to send for me down  we shall all be in london this evening  would to heaven i had never come to it  what of pleasure have i had in it  this abominable sir hargrave pollexfen  but for him i had been easy and happy since but for him i had never wanted the relief of sir charles grandison never had known him fame might perhaps have brought to my ears in general conversation as other persons of distinction are talked of some of his benevolent actions and he would have attracted my admiration without costing me one sigh and yet had it been so i should then have known none of those lively sensibilities that have mingled pleasure with my pain on the pride i have had in being distinguished as a sister to the sisters of so extraordinary a man o that i had kept my foolish heart free i should then have had enough to boast of for my whole life enough to talk of to every one and when i had been asked by my companions and intimates what diversions what entertainments i had been at i should have said i have been in company and conversed with sir charles grandison and been favored and distinguished by all his family and i should have passed many a happy winter evening when my companions came to work and read with me at selbyhouse in answering their questions about all these and sir charles would have been known among us principally by the name of the fine gentleman and my young friends would have come about me and asked me to tell them something more of the excellent man  but now my ambition has overthrown me aiming wishing to be everything i am nothing if i am asked about him or his sisters i shall seek to evade the subject and yet what other subject can i talk of for what have i seen what have i known since i left northamptonshire but him and them and what must lead to him and them and what indeed but him and them since i have known this family have i wished to see and to know  on reviewing the above how have i as i see suffered my childish fancies to delude me into a short forgetfulness of his of every bodys distresses  but o my lucy my heart is torn in pieces and i verily think more for the unhappy clementinas sake than for my own how severely do i pay for my curiosity yet it was necessary that i should know the worst so sir charles seems to have thought by the permission he has given to dr bartlett to oblige me and through me his sisters and all you my own friends  your pity will be more raised on reading the letter i enclose not only for clementina and sir charles but for the whole family none of whom though all unhappy are to be blamed you will dearly love the noble jeronymo and be pleased with the young ladys faithful camilla but my dear there is so much tenderness in sir charless woe  it must be love  but he ought to love clementina she is a glorious thounhappy young creature i must not have one spark of generosity left in my heart i must be lost wholly in self if i did not equally admire and love her  dr bartletts fourth letter as i remember madam sir charles mentions to you in a very pathetic manner the distress he was in when the terms and conditions on which he was to be allowed to call the noble clementina his were proposed to him as they were by the bishop he has briefly told you the terms and his grief to be obliged to disappoint the expectation of persons so deservedly dear to him but you will not i believe be displeased if i dwell a little more on these particulars though they are not commanded from me  the bishop when he had acquainted mr grandison with the terms said you are silent my dear grandison you hesitate what sir is a proposal of a daughter of one of the noblest families in ialy that daughter a clementina to be slighted by a an of a private family a foreigner of dependent fortunes her dowry not unworthy of a princes acceptance do you hesitate upon such a proposal as this sir  my lord i am grieved rather than surprised at the proposal i was apprehensive it would be made my joy at receiving the condescending invitation and at the honors done me on my arrival otherwise would have been immoderate  a debate then followed upon some articles in which the church of rome and the protestant churches differ mr grandison would fain have avoided it but the bishop supposing he should have some advantages in the argument which he met not with would not permit him he was very warm with mr grandison more than once which did not help his cause  the particulars of this debate i will not at this time give you they would carry me into great length and i have much to transcribe that i believe from what sir charles has let me see of your manner of writing to your friends you would prefer to that i will proceed after a passage or two which will show you how that debate about the difference in religion went off  you will call to mind chevalier said the bishop that your church allows of a possibility of salvation out of its pale  ours does not  my lord our church allows not of its members indulging themselves in capital errors against conviction but i hope that no more need to be said on this subject  i think replied the bishop we will quit it i did not expect that you were so firmly rooted in error as i find you but to the point on which we began i should think it an extraordinary misfortune were we to find ourselves reduced to the necessity of reasoning a private man into the acceptance of our sister clementina let me tell you sir that were she to know that you but hesitate  he spoke with earnestness and reddened  pardon an interruption my lord you are disposed to be warm i will not so much as offer to defend myself from any imputations that may in displeasure be cast upon me as if i were capable of slighting the honor intended me of a lady who is worthy of a prince i am persuaded that your lordship cannot think such a desence necessary i am indeed a private man but not inconsiderable if the being able to enumerate a long race of ancestors whom hitherto i have not disgraced will give me consideration but what my lord is ancestry i live to my own heart my principles were known before i had the condescending invitation your lordship would not persuade me to change them when i cannot think them wrong and since as you have heard i have something to offer when called upon in support of them  you will consider this matter my dear chevalier it is you i think that are disposed to be warm but you are a valuable man we as well as our sister wish to have you among us our church would wish it such a proselyte will justify us to every other consideration and to all our friends consider of it grandison but let it not be known to the principals of our family that you think consideration necessary the dear clementina particularly must not know it your person chevalier is not so dear to the excellent creature as your soul hence it is that we are all willing to encourage in her a flame so pure and so bright  my distress my lord is beyond the power of words to describe i revere i honor and will to my last hour the marquis and marchioness of porretta and on better motives than for their grandeur or nobility their sons  you know not my lord the pride i have always had to be distinguished even by a nominal relation to them and give me your clementina without the hard conditions you prescribe and i shall be happy beyond my highest wish i desire not dowry with her i have a father on whose generosity and affection i can rely but i must repeat my lord that my principles are so well known that i hoped a compromise would be accepted  i would not for the world compel your sister the same liberty that i crave i would allow  and will you not take time sir to consider are you absolutely determined  if your lordship know the pain it gives me to say that i am you would pity me  well sir i am sorry for it let us go in to signor jeronymo he has been your advocate ever since he knew you jeronymo has gratitude but you chevalier have no affections  i thank god said i that your lordship does not do me justice  he led me into his brothers apartment  there what did i not suffer from the friendship from the love of that brother and from the urgency of the bishop but what was the result  the bishop asked me if he were to conduct me to his father to his mother to his sister or to allow me to depart without seeing them  this was the alternative my compliance or noncompliance was to be thus indicated i respectfully bowed i recommended myself to the favor of the two brothers and through them to that of the three trulyrespectable persons they had named and withdrew to my lodgings with a heart sorely distressed  i was unable to stir out for the remainder of the day the same chair into which i threw myself upon my first coming in held me for hours  in the evening camilla in disguise made me a visit on my servants withdrawing revealing herself o sir said she what a distracted family have i left they know not of my coming hither but i could not forbear this officiousness i cannot stay but let me just tell you how unhappy we are and your own generosity will suggest to you what is best to be done  as soon as you were gone my lord bishop acquainted my lady marchioness with what had passed between you o sir you have an affectionate friend in signor jeronymo he endeavored to soften every thing my lady marchioness acquainted my lord with the bishops report i never saw that good nobleman in such a passion it is not necessary to tell you what he said   in a passion with me camilla  yes he thought the whole family dishonored sir  the marquis della porretta is the worthiest of men camilla said i i honor him  but proceed  the marchioness in the tenderest manner broke the matter to my young lady i was present she apprehended that there might be occasion for my attendance and commanded me to stay  before she could speak all she had to say my young lady threw herself on her knees to her mamma and blessing her for her goodness to her begged her to spare the rest i see said she that i a daughter of the porretta family your daughter madam am refused palliate not i beseech you the indignity you need not it is enough that i am refused surely madam your clementina is not so base in spirit as to need your maternal consolation on such a contempt as this i feel for my papa for you madam and for my brothers i feel the indignity blessings follow the man wherever he goes it would be mean to be angry with him he is his own master and now he has made me my own mistress never fear madam but this affair now will sit as light upon me as it ought his humility will allow him to be satisfied with a meaner wife you madam my papa my brothers shall not find me mean  the marchioness embraced with tears of joy her beloved daughter she brought my lord to her and reported what her daughter had said he also tenderly embraced the dear young lady and rejoiced in her assurances that now the cure was effected  but unseasonably as the event showed father marescotti being talked with was earnest to be allowed to visit her then he said was the proper time the very crisis to urge her to accept of the count of belvedere  i was bid to tell her that his reverence desired to attend her  o let me go said she to florence to my dear mrs beaumont  tomorrow morning let me go and not see father marescotti till i can see him as i wish to see him  but the good father prevailed he meant the best  he was with her half an hour he left her in a melancholy way when her mamma went to her she sound her spiritless her eyes fixed and as gloomy as ever she was silent to two or three of her mothers questions and when she did speak it was with wildness but declaring without being solicited in the count of belvederes favor against marrying him or any man in the world  her mother told her she should go to florence as soon as she pleased but then the humor was off would to heaven she had gone before she saw his reverence so they all now wish  camilla said she to me when we were alone was it necessary to load the chevalier grandison was it necessary to inveigh against him it was ungenerous to do so was the man obliged to have the creature whose forwardness had rendered her contemptible in his eyes i could not bear to hear him inveighed against but never never let me hear his named mentioned but camilla i cannot bear being despised neither  she arose from her seat and from that moment her humor took a different turn she now talks she raves she starts she neither sits nor stands with quietness  she walks up and down her room at other times with passion and hurry yet weeps not though she makes everybody else weep she speaks to herself and answers herself and as i guess repeats part of the talk that passed between father marescotti and her but still to be despised are the words she oftenest repeats  jesu once said she  to be despised  and by an english protestant who can bear that  in this way sir is lady clementina the sweetest creature i see i see you have compassion sir you never wanted humanity generosity is a part of your nature i am sure you love her  i see you love her  i pain your noble heart indeed indeed sir lady clementinas love extended beyond the limits of this world she hoped to be yours to all eternity  well might camilla the sensible the faithful the affectionate camilla the attendant from insant years of her beloved clementina thus run on without interruption i could not speak and had i been able to what purpose should i have pleaded to camilla the superior attachement which occasioned an anguish that words cannot describe  what can i say but thank you my good camilla for your intention i hope you have eased your own heart but you have loaded mine  nevertheless i thank you would to heaven that your ladys own wishes had been complied with that she had been encouraged to go to the excellent mrs beaumont the first natural impulses of the distressed heart often point out the best alleviation would to heaven they had been pursued i have great dependence on the generous friendship of signor jeronymo all that is in my power to do i will do i honor i venerate every one of the trulynoble family i never can deserve their favor on all occasions camilla let them know my devotion to them  i beg of god said me to put it into your hear o restore the tranquillity of a family that was till lately the happiest in bologna it may not be yet too late i beg you to excuse my officiousness pray take no notice that i have waited on you i shall be wanted  she was hastening away good camilia said i taking a ring of some value from my finger and forcing it upon hers she is above accepting of pecuniary presents and struggled against this accept this as a remembrance not acknowlegement i may be forbid the palace of the marquis della porretta and so have no opportunity again to see the equally faithful and obliging camilla  what other conditions could have been prescribed dr bartlett that i should have refused to comply with how was i anew distressed at the account camilla gave me but my great consolation in the whole transaction is that my own heart on the maturest deliberation acquits me and the rather as it is impossible for me to practice a greater piece of selfdenial for can there be on earth a nobler lady than clementina  the next morning early mr grandison received the following letter from his friend signor jeronymo i translated it my good miss byron at the time i received it i will send you the translation only  my dear chevalier shall i blame you  i cannot shall i blame my father my mother  they blame themselves for the free access you were allowed to have to their clementina yet they own that you acted nobly but they had forgot that clementina had eyes yet who knew not her discernment who knew not her regard for merit wherever she found it can i therefore blame my sister  indeed no has she a brother whom i can blame  no but ought i not to blame myself the dear creature owned it seems to mrs beaumont that my declaration in your favor which was made long before you knew it was one of her influences must i therefore accuse myself  if i regard my intention gratitude for a life preserved by you and for a sense of my social duties soul as well as body indebted to you though a protestant yourself will not suffer it is there then nobody whom we can blame for the calamity befallen us  how strangely is that calamity circumstanced  but is there so irreconcilable a difference between the two religious  there is the bishop says there is clementina thinks there is my father my mother think there is  but does your father think so will you put the whole matter on that issue chevalier  o no you will not you are as determined as we are yet surely with less reason  but i debate not the matter with you i know you are a master of the question  but what is to be done shall clementina perish will not the gallant youth who ventured his life so successfully to save a brother exert himself to preserve a sister  come and see the way she is in  yet they will not admit you into her presence while she is in that way  the sense she has of her dignity debased and the perpetual expostulations and apprehensions of her zealous confessor  can the good man think it his duty to wound and tear in pieces a mind tenacious of its honor and of that of the sex at last you see i have found somebody to accuse  but i come to my motive of giving you this trouble  it is to request you to make me a visit breakfast with me my dear chevalier this morning you will perhaps see nobody else  camilla has told me and only me that she attended you last night she tells me how greatly you are grieved i should renounce your friendship were you not at my soul i pity you because i knew long since your firm attachment to your religion and because you love clementina  i wish i were able to attend you i would save you the pain of this visit for i know it must pain you but come nevertheless  you hinted to my brother that you thought as your principles were so well known a compromise would be accepted  explain yourself to me upon this compromise if i can smooth the way between you  yet i despair that anything will do but your conversion they love your soul they think they love it better than you do yourself is there not a merit in them which you cannot boast in return  the general i hear came to town last night we have not seen him yet he had business with the gonfalionere i think you must not meet he is warm he adores clementina he knew not till last night that the bishop broke it to him at that magistrates our unhappy situation what a disappointment one of the principal views he had in coming was to do you honor and and to give his sister pleasure ah sir he came to be present at two solemn acts the one your nuptials in consequence of the other  you must not meet it would go to my heart to have offense given you by any of my family especially in our own hou e  come however i long to see you and to comfort you whether your hard heart i did not use to think it a hard one will allow you or not to give comfort to  your everaffectionate and faithful friend jeronymo della porretta   i accepted of the invitation my heart was in this family i longed before this letter came to see and to hear from it the face of the meanest servant belonging to it would have been more than welcome to me what however were my hopes yet do you think dr bartlett that i had not pain in going a pain that took more than its turn with the desire i had once more to enter doors that used to be opened to me with so much pleasure on both sides   dr bartletts fifth letter mr grandison thus proceeds i was introduced to signor jeronymo he sat expecting me he bowed more stiffly than usual in return to my freer compliment  i see said i that i have lost my friend  impossible said he it cannot be  then speaking of his sister dear creature said he a very bad night my poor mother has been up with her ever since three oclock nobody else has any influence with her these talking fits are worse than her silent ones  what could i say my soul was vexed my friend saw it and was grieved for me he talked of indifferent things i could not follow him in them  he then entered upon the subject that would not long allow of any other i expect the general said he i will not i think have you see each other i have ordered notice to be given me before any one of the family is admitted while you are with me if you choose not to see the general or my father or mother should they step in to make their morning compliments you can walk down the backstairs into the garden or into the next chamber  i am not the least sufferer in this distress replied i you have invited me if on your own account you would have me withdraw i will but else i cannot conceal myself  this is like you it is you yourself o grandison that we could be real brothers  in soul we are so but what is the compromise you hinted at  i then told him that i would reside one year in italy another in england by turns if the dear clementina would accompany me if not but three months in england in every year as to religion she should keep her own her confessor only to be a man of known discretion  he shook his head i will propose it as from yourself if you would have me do so chevalier it would do with me but will not with anybody else i have undertaken for more than that already but it will not be heard of would to god chevalier that you for my sake for all our sakes  but i know you have a great deal to say on this subject as you told my brother new converts added he may be zealous but you old protestants protestants by descent as i may say it is strange you should be so very steadfast you have not many young gentlemen i believe who would be so very tenacious such offers such advantages  and surely you must love my sister all our family you surely love i will presume to say they deserve your love and they give the strongest proofs that can be given of their regard for you  signor jeronymo expected not an argumentative answer to what he said my stedfastness was best expressed and surely it was sufficiently expressed the circumstances of the case so interesting by silence  just then came in camilla the marchioness sir knows you are here she desires you will not go till she sees you she will attend you here i believe  she is persuading lady clementina to be blooded she has an aversion to that operation she begs it may not be done she has been hitherto on that account bled by leaches the marquis and the bishop are both gone out they could not bear her solicitations to them to save her as she called it  the marchioness soon after entered care melancholy yet trenderness was in her aspect grief for her daughters malady seemed fixed in the lines of her fine face keep your seat chevalier she sat down sighed wept but would not have had her tears seen  had i not been so deeply concerned in the cause of her grief i could have endeavored to comfort her but what could i say i turned my head aside i would also have concealed my emotion but signor jeronymo took notice of it  the poor chevalier kindly said he with an accent of compassion   i dont doubt it answered she as kindly though he spoke not out what he had to say he may be obdurate but not ungrateful  excellent woman how was i affected by her generosity this was taking the direct road to my heart you know that heart dr bartlett and what a task it had  jeronymo enquired after his sisters health i was afraid to enquire  not worse i hope but so talkative poor thing she burst into tears  i presumed to take her hand  o madam will no compromise will no   it ought not chevalier i cannot urge it we know your power too well we know your power over the dear creature she will not be long a catholic if she be yours and you know what we then should think of her precious soul  better to part with her for ever  yet how can a mother  her tears spoke what her lips could not utter  recovering her voice i have left her said she contending with the doctors against being let blood she was so earnest with me to prevent it that i could no stay it is over by this time  she rang  at that moment to the astonishment of all three in ran the dear clementina herself  a happy escape thank god said she  her arm bound up  she had felt the lancet but did not bleed more than two or three drops  o my mamma and you would have run away from me too would you  you dont use to be cruel and to leave me with these doctors  see see and she held out her lovely arm a little boody regarding nobody but her mother who as well as w was speechless with surprise  they did attempt to wound but they could not obtain their cruel ends  and i ran for shelter to my mammas arms throwing hers about her neck dearest dearest madam dont let me be sacrificed what has your poor child done to be thus treated   o my clementina  and o my mamma too have i not suffered enough   the door opened she cast her fearful eye to it clinging faster to her mother  they are come to take me begone camilla it was she begone when i bid you they shant take me  my mamma will save me from them  will not you my mamma clasping more servently her arms about her neck and hiding her face in her bosom then lifting up her face begone i tell you camilla they shant have mecamilla withdrew  brother my dear brother you will protect me will not you  i arose i was unable to bear this affecting scene  she saw me  good god said she  then in english breaking out into that line of hamlet which she had taken great notice of when we read that play together  angels and ministers of grace defend us she left her mother and stepped gently toward me looking earnestly with her face held out as if she were doubtful whether it were i or not  i snatched her hand and pressed it with my lips  o madam  dearest lady  i could say no more  it is he it is he indeed madam turning her head to her mother one hand held up as in surprise as i detained the other  the sons arms supported the almost fainting mother his tears mingling with hers  for gods sake for my sake dear grandison said he and stopped  i quitted clementinas hand jeronymos unhealed wounds had weakened him and i hastened to support the marchioness  o chevalier spare your concern for me said she my childs head is of more consequence to me than my own heart  what was it of distress that i did not at that moment feel  the young lady turning to us  well sir said she here is sad work sad work to be sure somebody is wrong i will not say who  but you will not let these doctors use me ill  will you  see here showing her bound up arm to me  what they would have done  see they did get a drop or two but no more and i sprung from them and ran for it  her mother then taking her attention my dearest mamma how do you   o my child and she clasped her arms about her clementina  camilla came in she added by her grief to the distressful scene she threw her arms kneeling about the marchioness o my dearest lady said she  the marchioness feeling for her salts and taking them out of her pocket and smelling to them unclasp me camilla said she i am better are the doctors gone  no madam whispered camilla but they say it is highly proper and they talk of blistering   not her head i hope  the dear creature when she used to value herself upon anything took pride as well she might in her hair  now you are whispering my mamma  and this impertinent camilla is come  camilla they shall not have me i tell you  see barbarous wretches what they have done to me already  again holding up her arm and then with indignation tearing off the fillet  her brother begged of her to submit to the operation her mother joined her gentle command  well i will not love you brother said she you are in the plot against me  but here is one who will protect me laying her hand upon my arm and looking earnestly in my face with such a mixture of woe and tenderness in her eye as pierced my very soul  persuade her chevalier said the marchioness  my good young lady will you not obey your mamma you are not well will you not be well see how you distress your noble brother  she stroked her brothers cheek it was wet with his tears with a motion inimitably tender her voice as inimitably soothing  poor jeronymo my dearest brother and have you not suffered enough from vile assassins poor dear brother  and again stroked his cheek  how was i affected  a fresh gush of tears broke from his eyes  ah grandison said he  o why why said i did i accept of your kind invitation this distress could not have been so deep had not i been present  see see chevalier holding out her spread hand to me jeronymo weeps  he weeps for his sister i believe  these  look my hand is wet with them are the tears of my dear jeronymo my hand  see is wet with a brothers tears  and you madam are affected too turning to her mother it is a grievous thing to see men weep what ail they  yet i cannot weep  have they softer hearts than mine  dont weep chevalier  see jeronymo has done  i would stroke your cheek too if it would stop your tears  but what is all this for  it is because of these doctors i believe  but camilla bid them begone they shant have me  dearest madam said i submit to your mammas advice your mamma wishes you to suffer them to breathe a veinit is no more  your jeronymo also beseeches you to permit them  and do you wish it too chevalier  do you wish to see me wounded  to see my heart bleeding at my arm i warrant say can you be so hardhearted  let me join with your mamma with your brother to entreat it for your fathers sake for   for your sake chevalier  well will it do you good to see me bleed  i withdrew to the window i could not stand this question put with an air of tenderness for me and in an accent equally tender  the irresistible lady o what eloquence in her disorder followed me and laying her hand on my arm looking earnestly after my averted face as if she would not suffer me to hide it from her  will it will it comfort you to see me bleed  come then be comforted i will bleed but you shall not leave me you shall see that these doctors shall not kill me quite  o dr bartlett how did this address to me torture my very soul  camilla proceeded she i will bleed madam to her mother will it please you to have me bleed will it please you my jeronymo turning to him  and sir sir stepping to me with quickness will it please you  why then camilla bid the doctors come in  what would i not do to please such kind friends you grudge not your tears and as i cannot give you tears for tears from my eyes shall not my arm weep  but do you stand by me chevalier while it is done you will will not you  seeking again with her eye my averted face  o that my life thought i would be an effectual offering for the restoring the peace of mind of this dear lady and her family and that it might be taken by any hand but my own  but my conscience  prepossessed as i am in favor of my own religion and in disfavour of that i am wished to embrace how thought i can i make a sacrifice of my conscience  the dear lady was then as earnest for the operation as before she had been averse to it but she did and said everything in an hurry  the marchioness and my friend were comforted in hopes that some relief would follow it the doctors were invited in  do you stand by me sir said she to me  come make haste but it shant be the same arm  camilla see i can bare my own arm  it will bleed at this arm i warrant  i will bid it flow  come make haste  are you always so tedious  the preparation in all these things i believe is worse than the act  pray pray make haste  they did though she thought they did not  turn your face another way madam said the doctor  now methinks i am iphigenia chevalier going to be offered  looking at me and from the doctors  and is this all  the puncture being made and she bleeding freely  the doctors were not satisfied with a small quantity she fainted however before they had taken quite so much as they intended and her women carried her out of her brothers apartment into her own in the chair she sat in  dear clementina  my compassion and my best wishes followed her  you see your power over the dear girl grandison said her brother  the marchioness sighed and looking at me with kind and earnest meaning withdrew to attend her daughters recovery   letter xxvii miss byron in continuation receive my lucy the doctors sixth letter the fifth has almost broken the hearts of us all  dr bartletts sixth letter a scene of another nature took place of this proceeds mr grandison  camilla stepped in and said the general was come and was at that moment lamenting with the marchioness the disordered state of mind of his beloved sister who had again fainted away but was quiet when camilla came in  the general will be here presently said jeronymo do you choose to see him  as perhaps he has been told i am here it would look too particular to depart instantly if he comes not in soon i will take my leave of you  i had hardly done speaking when the general entered drying his eyes  your servant mr grandison said he brother how do you not the better i dare say for the present affliction who the devil would have thought the girl had been so deeply affected  well sir you have a glorious triumph  clementinas heart is not a vulgar one her family   my lord i hope i do not deserve this address  triumph my lord  not a heart in this family can be more distressed than mine  and is religion is conscience really of such force chevalier  let me ask that question my lord of your own heart let me ask it of your brother the bishop of the other principles of your noble family and the answer given will be an answer for me  he seemed displeased explain yourself chevalier  if my lord said i you think there is so great so essential a difference in the two religions that you cannot consent that i should keep my own what must i be who think as highly of my own as you can of yours to give it up though on the highest temporal consideration make the case your own my lord  i can and were i in your situation such a woman as my sister such a family as ours such a splendid fortune as she will have i believe i should not make the scruples you do my brother the bishop indeed might not have given the same answer he might be more tenacious  the bishop cannot be better satisfied with his religion than i am with mine but i hope my lord from what you have said that i may claim the honor of your friendship in this great article it is proposed to me that i renounce my religion i make no such proposal to your family on the contrary i consent that lady clementina should keep hers and i am ready to allow a very handsome provision for a discreet man her confessor to attend her in order to secure her in it as to residence i will consent to reside one year in italy one in england and even if she choose not to go to england at all i will acquiesce and visit england myself but for three months in every year  as to the children mr grandison said signor jeronymo desirous of promoting the compromise  i will consent that daughters shall be the mothers care the education of sons must be left to me  what will the poor daughters have done chevalier sneeringly spoke the general that they should be left to perdition  your lordship without my entering into the opinion of the professors of both religions on this subject will consider my proposal as a compromise i would not have began an address upon these terms with a princess i do assure you that mere fortune has no bias with me prescribe not to me in the article of religion and i will with all my soul give up every ducat of your sisters fortune  then what will you have to support   my lord leave that to your sister and me i will deal honorably with her if she renounce me on that article you will have reason to congratulate yourselves  your fortune sir by marriage will be much more considerable than it can be by patrimony if clementina be yours why then should you not look forward to your posterity as italians and in that case   he stopped there  it was easy to guess at his inference  i would no more renounce my country than my religion i would leave posterity free but would not deprive them of an attachment that i value myself upon nor yet my country of a family that never gave it cause to be ashamed of it  the general took snuff and looked on me and off me with an air too supercilious i could not but be sensible of it  i have no small difficulty my lord said i to bear the hardships of my situation added to the distress which that situation gives me to be looked upon in this family as a delinquent without having done anything to reproach myself with either in thought word or deed  my lord it is extremely hard  it is my lord said signor jeronymo the great misfortune in the case before us is that the chevalier grandison has merit superior to that of most men and that our sister who was not to be attached by common merit could not be insensible to his  whatever were my sisters attachments signor jeronymo we know yours and generous ones they are but we all know how handsome men may attach young ladies without needing to say a single word the poison once taken in at the eye it will soon diffuse itself through the whole mass  my honor yet my lord was never called in question either by man or woman  your character is well known chevalier  had it not been unexceptionable we should not have entered into treaty with you on this subject i do assure you and it piques us not a little to have a daughter of our house refused you dont know the consequence i can tell you of such an indignity offered in this country  refused my lord  to endeavor to obviate this charge would be to put an affront upon your lordships justice as well as an indignity offered to your truly noble house  he arose in anger and swore that he would not be treated with contempt  i stood up too and if i am my lord with indiguity it is not what i have been used to bear  signor jeronymo was disturbed he said he was against our seeing each other he knew his brothers warmth and i he said from the scenes that had before passed ought perhaps to have shown more pity than resentment  it was owing to my regard for the delicacy of you sister signor jeronymo said i for whom i have the tenderest sentiments as well as to do justice to my own conduct toward her that i could not help showing myself affected by the word refused  affected by the word refused sir said the general  yes you have soft words for hard meanings but i who have not your choice of words make use of those that are explained by actions  i was in hopes my lord that i might rather have been favored with your weight in the proposed compromise than to have met with your displeasure  consider chevalier coolly consider this matter how shall we answer it to our country we are public people sir to the church to which we stand related to our own character to marry a daughter of our house to a protestant you say you are concerned for her honor what must we what can we say in her behalf when she is reflected upon as a lovesick girl who though steadfast in her religion could refuse men of the first consideration all of her own religion and country and let a foreigner an englishman carry her off   preserving nevertheless by stipulation you will remember my lord her religion  if you shall have so much to answer for to the world with such a stipulation in the ladys favor what shall i be thought of who though i am not nor wish to be a public man am not of a low or inconsiderable family if i against my conscience renounce my religion and my country for a consideration that though the highest in private life is a partial and selfish consideration  no more no more sir  if you can despise worldly grandeur if you can set light by riches honors love my sister has this to be said in her praise that she is the first woman that ever i heard of who fll in love with a philosopher and she must i think take the consequence of such a peculiarity her example will not have many followers  yes my lord it will said jeronymo if mr grandison be the philosopher if women were to be regimented he would carry an army into the field without beat of drum  i was vexed to find an affair that had penetrated my heart go off so lightly but the levity shown by the general was followed by jeronymo in order to make the past warmth between us forgotten  i left the brothers together as i passed through the salon i had the pleasure of hearing by a whisper from camilla that her young lady was somewhat more composed for the operation she had yielded to  in the afternoon the general made me a visit at my lodgings he told me he had taken amiss some things that had fallen from my mouth  i owned that i was at one time warm but excused myself by his example  i urged him to promote my interest as to the proposed compromise he gave me no encouragement but took down my proposals in writing  he asked me if my father were as tenacious in the article of religion as i was  i told him that i had forborne to write anything of the affair to my father  that he said was surprising he had always apprehended that a man who pretended to be strict in religion be it what religion it would should be uniform he who could dispense with one duty might with another  i answered that having no view to address lady clementina i had only given my father general accounts of the favor i had met with from a family so considerable that it was but very lately that i had entertained any hopes at all as he must know that those hopes were allayed by my fears that the articles of religion and residence would be an insuperable obstacle but that it was my resolution in the same hour that i could have any prospect of succeeding to lay all before him and i was sure of his approbation and consent to an alliance so answerable to the magnisicence of his own spirit  the general at parting with an haughty air said i take my leave chevalier i suppose you will not be in haste to leave bologna i am extremely sensible of the indignity you have cast upon us all i am and swore  we shall not disgrace our sister and ourselves by courting your acceptance of her i understand that olivia is in love with you too these contentions for you may give you consequence with yourself but olivia is not a clementina you are in a country jealous of familyhonour ours is a first family in it you know not what you have done sir  what you have said my lord i have not deserved of you it can not be answered at least by me i shall not leave bologna till i apprize you of it and till i have the misfortune to be assured that i cannot have any hope of the honor once designed me i will only add that my principles were well known before i was written to at vienna  and do you reproach us with that step it was a base one it had not my concurrence he went from me in a passion  i had enough at my heart dr bartlett had i been spared this insult from a brother of clementina it went very hard with me to be threatened but i thank god i do not deserve the treatment   letter xxviii miss byron in continuation london friday morning mar    here my lucy once more i am we arrived yesterday in the afternoon  lady betty williams and miss clements have been already to welcome me on my return my cousin says they are inseparable i am glad of it for lady bettys sake  dr bartlett is extremely obliging one would think that he and his kinsman give up all their time in transcribing for us i send you now his seventh eight and ninth letters in reading the two latter we were struck for the two sisters and my lord were with us with the nobleness of clementina her motive through her whole dilirium is so apparently owing to her concern for the soul of the man she loved entirely regardless of any interest of her own that we all forgot what had been so long our wishes and joined in giving a preference to her  dr bartletts seventh letter i had another visit paid me proceeds mr grandison two hours after the general left me by the kindhearted camilla disguised as before  i come now chevalier said she with the marchionesss connivance and i may say by her command and at the same time by the command of signor jeronymo who knows of my last attendance upon you though no one else does not even the marchioness he gave me this letter for you  but how does the noblest young lady in italy camilla how does lady clementina  more composed than we could have hoped for from the height of her dilirum it was high for she has but a very faint idea of having seen you this morning  the marchioness had bid her say that although i had now given her despair instead of hope yet that she owed it to my merit and to the sense she had of the benefits they had actually received at my hands to let me know that it was but too likely that resentments might be carried to an unhappy length and that therefore she wished i would leave bologna for the present if happier prospects presented she would be the first to congratulate me upon them  i opened the letter of my kind jeronymo these were the contents  i am infinitely concerned my dear grandison to find a man equally generous and brave as my brothor is hurried away by passion you may have acted with your usual magnaminity in preferring your religion to your love and to your glory i for my part think you to be a distressed man if you are not you must be very insensible to the merits of an excellent woman and very ungrateful to the distinction she honors you with i must write in this style and think she does honor by it even to my grandison but should the consequences of this affair be unhappy for either of you if in particular for my brother what cause of regret would our family have that a younger brother was saved by the hand which deprived them of a more worthy elder if for you how deplorable would be the reflection that you saved one brother and perished by the hand of another would to god that his passion and your spirit were more moderate but let me request this favor of you that you retire to florence for a few days at least  how unhappy am i that i am disabled from taking part in a more active mediation  yet the general admires you but how can we blame in him a zeal for the honor of this family in which he would be glad at his soul to include a zeal for yours  for gods sake quit bologna for a few days only clementina is more sedate i have carried it that her confessor shall not at present visit her yet he is an honest and a pious man  what a fatality every one to mean well yet every one to be miserable and can religion be the cause of so much unhappiness i cannot act i can only reflect my dear friend let me know by a line that you will depart from bologna tomorrow and you will then a little lighten the heart of your  jeronymo   i sent my grateful compliments to the marchioness by camilla i besought her to believe that my conduct on this occasion should be such as should merit her approbation i expressed my grief for the apprehended resentments i was sure that a man so noble so generous so brave as was the man from whom the resentments might be supposed to arise would better consider of every thing but it was impossible for me i bid camilla say to be far distant from bologna because i still presumed to hope for a happy turn in my favor  i wrote to signor jeronymo to the same effect i assured him of my high regard for his gallant brother i deplored the occasion which had subjected me to the generals displeasure bid him depend upon my moderation i referred to my known resolution of long standing to avoid a meditated rencounter with any man urging that he might for that reason the more securely rely upon my care to shun any acts of offense either to or from a son of the marquis della porretta a brother of my dear friend jeronymo and of the most excellent and beloved of sisters  neither the marchioness nor jeronymo were satisfied with the answers i returned but what could i do i had promised the general that i would not leave bologna till i had apprized him of my intention to do so and i still was willing as i bid camilla tell the marchioness to indulge my hopes of some happy turn  the marquis the bishop and general went to urbino and there as i learnt from my jeronymo it was determined in full assembly that grandison as well from difference in religion as from inferiority in degree and fortune was unworthy of their alliance and it was hinted to the general that he was equally unworthy of his resentment  while the father and two brothers were at urbino lady clementina gave hopes of a sedate mind she desired her mother to allow her to see me but the marchioness believing there were no hopes of my complying with their terms and being afraid of the consequences and of incurring blame from the rest of her family now especially that they were absent and consulting together on what was proper to be done desired she would not think of it  this refusal made clementina the more earnest for an interview signor jeronymo gave his advice in favor of it the misfortune he had met with had added to his weight with the family it is a family of harmony and love they were hardly more particularly fond of clementina than they were of one another throughout the several branches of it this harmony among them added greatly to the familyconsequence as well in public as private till the attempt that was made upon their jeronymo they had not known calamity  but the confessor strengthening the marchionesss apprehensions of what the consequence of indulging the young lady might be all jeronymos weight would have failed to carry this point had it not been for an enterprise of clementina which extremely alarmed them and made them give into her wishes  camilla has enabled me to give the following melancholy account of it to the only man on earth to whom i could communicate particulars the very recollection of which tears my heart in pieces  the young ladys malady after some favorable symptoms which went off returned in another shape her talkativeness continued but the hurry with which she spoke and acted gave place to a sedateness that she seemed very fond of they did not suffer her to go out of her chamber which she took not well but camilla being absent about an hour on her return missed her and alarmed the whole house upon it every part of it and of the garden was searched from an apprehension that they dared not so much as whisper to one another they dreaded to find her whom they so carefully sought after  at last camilla seeing as she supposed one of the maidservants coming downstairs with remarkable tranquillity as she thought in her air and manner wretch said she how composed do you seem to be in a storm that agitates everybody else  dont be angry with me camilla returned the supposed servant  o my lady my very lady clementina in lauras clothes whither are you going madam  but let the marchioness know said she to one of the womenservants who then appeared in sight that we have found my young lady  what dear madam is the meaning of this  go martina to another womanservant go this instant to my lady  dear lady clementina what concern have you given us  and thus she went on asking questions of her young lady and giving orders almost in the same breath till the marchioness came to them in a joyful hurry from one of the pavilions in the garden into which she had thrown herself tortured by her fears and dreading the approach of every servant with fatal tidings  the young lady stood still but with great composure i will go camilla said she indeed i will you disturb me by your frantic ways camilla i wish you would be as sedate and calm as i am what is the matter with the woman  her mother folding her arms about her  o my sweet girl said she how could you terrify us thus what is the meaning of this disguise whither were you going  why madam i was going on gods errand not on my own  what is come to camilla the poor creature is beside herself  o my dear said her mother taking her hand and leading her into her own apartment camilla following weeping with joy for having found her tell me said she tell me has laura furnished you with this dress  why no madam i will tell you the whole truth i went and hid myself in lauras room while she changed her clothes i saw where she put those she took off and when she had left her room i put them on  and for what for what my dear tell me what you designed  i am neither afraid nor ashamed to tell it was gods errand i was going upon  what was the errand  dont weep them my dear mamma and i will tell you do let me kiss away these tears  and she tenderly embraced her mother  why i have a great mind to talk to the chevalier grandison i had many fine thoughts upon my pillow and i believed i could say a great deal to the purpose to him and you told me i must not see him so i thought i would not but then i had other notions came into my head and i believed if i could talk freely to him i should convince him of his errors now thought i i know he will mind what i say to him more than perhaps he will my brother the bishop or father marescotti i am a simple girl and can have no interest in his conversion for he has refused me you know so there is an end of all matters between him and me i never was refused before was i my mamma i never will be twice refused yet i owe him no ill will and if one can save a soul you know madam there is no harm in that so it is gods errand i go upon and not my own and shall i not go yes i shall i know you will give me leave  she courtesied silence is permission thank you madam  and seemed to be going  well might her mother be silent she could not speak but rising went after her to the door and taking her hand sobbed over it her denial as camilla described it and brought her back and motioned to her to sit down   she whispered camilla what ails my mamma can you tell  but see how calm how composed i am this world camilla what a vain thing is this world and she looked up and so i shall tell the chevalier i shall tell him not to refuse heaven though he has refused a simple girl that was no enemy to him and might have been a faithful guide to him thither for what he knew now all these things i wanted to say to him and a vast deal more and when i have told him my mind i shall be easy  will my precious girl be easy broke out into speech her weeping mother when you have told the chevalier your mind you shall tell him your mind my dear and god restore my child to peace and to me  well now my mamma this is a good sign  for if i have moved you to oblige me why may i not move him to oblige himself  that is all i have in view he has been my tutor and i want methinks to return the favor and be his tutress and so you will let me go  will not you  no my dear we will send for him  well that may do as well provided you will let us be alone together for these proud men may be ashamed before company to own themselves convinced by a simple girl  but my dearest love whither would you have gone do you know where the chevaliers lodgings are  she paused  she does not surely camilla  camilla repeated the question that the young lady might herself answer it  she looked as if considering  then why no truly said she i did not think of that but everybody in bologna knows where the chevalier grandison lives  dont you think so  but when shall he come that will be better much better  you shall go camilla disguised as before probably he has not quitted bologna yet and let him know to a tittle all that has passed on this attempt of the dear soul  if he can bring his mind to comply with our terms it may not yet be too late though it will be so after my lord and my two sons return from urbino but small are my hopes from him if the interview makes my poor child easy that will be a blessed event we shall all rejoice in that mean time come with me my dear  but first resume your own dress  and then we will tell jeronymo what we have determined upon he will be pleased with it i know  you tell me my good miss byron that i cannot be two particular yet the melancholy tale i see affects you too sersibly as it also does my lord and lady l and miss grandison no wonder when the transcribing of them has the same effect upon me as thereading had at my first being favored with the letters that give the moving particulars   dr bartletts eighth letter i proceed now to give an account of mr grandisons interview with lady clementina  he had no sooner heard the preceding particulars than he hastened to her though with a tortured heart  he was introduced to the marchioness and signor jeronymo in the apartment of the latter  i suppose said the marchioness after first civilities camilla has told you the way we are now in the dear creature has a great desire to talk with you who knows but she may he easier after she has been humoured  she is more composed than she was since she knows she may expect to see you poor thing she has hopes of converting you  would to heaven said jeronymo that compassion for her disordered mind may have that effect upon my grandison which argument has not had  poor grandison i can pity you at my heart these are hard trials to your humanity your destress is written in your countenance  it is deeper written in my heart said i  indeed dr bartlett it was  the marchioness rang camilla came in see said she if clementina is disposed now to admit of the chevaliers visit and ask her if she will have her mamma introduce him to her  by all means was the answer returned  clementina at our entrance was sitting at the window a book in her hand she stood up a great but solemn composure appeared in her air and aspect  the marchioness went to the window holding her handkerchief at her eyes i approached with profound respect her clementina but my heart was too full to speak first  she could speak she did without hesitation   you are nothing to me now chevalier you have refused me you know and i thank you you are in the right i believe i am a very proud creature and you saw what trouble i gave to the best of parents and friends you are certainly in the right she that can give so much concern to them must make any man afraid of her but religion it seems is your pretense now i am sorry that you are an obstinate mn you know better chevalier i think you should know better but you have been my tutor shall i be yours  i shall attend to every instruction that you will honor me with  but let me sir comfort my mamma  she went to her and kneeled why weeps my mamma taking a hand in each of hers and kissing first one then the other be comforted my mamma you see i am quite well you see i am sedate  bless your clementina  god bless my child  she arose from her knees and stepping toward me  you are very silent sir and very sad  but i dont want you to be sad  silent i will allow you to be because the tutored should be all ear so i used to be to you  she then turned her face from me putting her hand to her forehead  i had a great deal to say to you but i have forgot it all  why do you look so melancholy chevalier you know your own mind and you did what you thought just and fit  did you not tell me sir  then turning to her weeping mother  the poor chevalier cannot speak madam  yet had nobody to bid him do this or bid him do that  he is sorry to be sure  well but sir turning to me dont be sorry  and yet the man who once refused me  ah chevalier i thought that was very cruel of you but i soon got over it you see how sedate i am now cannot you be as sedate as i am  what could i say i could not sooth her she boasted of her sedateness i could not argue with her could i have been hers could my compromise have been allowed of i could have been unreserved in my declarations was ever man so unhappily circumstanced  why did not the family forbid me to come near them why did not my jeronymo renounce friendship with me why did this excellent mother bind me to her by the sweet ties of kindness and esteem engaging all my reverence and gratitude  but let me ask you chevalier how could you be so unreasonable as to expect that i should change my religion when you were so very tenacious of yours were you not very unreasonable to expect this  upon my word i believe you men think it is no matter for us women to have any consciences so as we do but study your wills and do our duty by you men look upon themselves as gods of the earth and on us women but as their ministering servants  but i did not expect that you would be so unreasonable you used to speak highly of our sex good women you used to say were angels and many a time have you made me proud that i was a woman how could you chevalier be so unreasonable  may i madam to her mother acquaint her with the proposals i made  she seems to think that i insisted upon her change of religion  it was not designed she should think so but i remember now that she would not let me tell all i had to say when i was making my report to her of what had passed between the bishop and you it was enough she said that she had been refused she besought me to spare the rest and since that she has not been in such a way that we could talk to her on that part of the subject we took it for granted that she knew it all because we did could we have yielded to your proposals we should have enforced them upon her  if you acquaint her with what you had proposed it may make her think she has not been despised as she calls it the notion of which changed her temper from overthoughtful to overlively  no need of speaking low to each other said the young lady after your slight sir you may let me hear anything  madam you see how sedate i am i have quite overcome myself dont be afraid of saying anything before me  slight my dearest lady clementina heaven is my witness your honored mamma is my witness that i have not slighted you  the conditions i had proposed could they have been complied with would have made me the happiest of men  yes and me the unhappiest of women why you refused me did you not and putting both her hands spread before her face dont let it be told abroad that a daughter of that best of mothers was refused by any man less than a prince  fie upon that daughter to be able to stand before the proud refuser she walked from me i am ashamed of myself  o mrs beaumont but for you  my secret had been buried here putting one hand on her bosom holding still the other before her face  but sir sir coming toward me dont speak let me have all my talk out  and then  everlasting silence be my portion  how her mother wept how was i affected  i had a great deal to say to you i thought i wanted to convince you of your errors i wanted no favor of you sir mine was a pure disinterested esteem a voice from heaven i thought bid me convert you i was setting out to convert you i should have been enabled to do it i doubt not out of the mouth of babes and sucklings do you remember that text sir  could i have gone when i would have gone  i had it all in my head then  but now i have lost it  o that impertinent camilla  she must question me  the woman addressed me in a quite frantic way she was vexed to see me so sedate  i was going to speak  hush hush when i bid you and she put her hand before my mouth with both my hands i held it there for a moment and kissed it  ah chevalier said she not withdrawing it i believe you are a flattering man how can you to a poor despised girl   let me now speak madam  use not a word that i cannot repeat after you let me beg of you to hear the proposals i made   i mentioned them and added heaven only knows the anguish of my soul  hush said she interrupting and turning to her mother  i know nothing of these men madam do you think my mamma i may believe him  he looks as if one might  do you think i may believe him  her mother was silent through grief  ah sir my mamma though she is not your enemy cannot vouch for you  but i will have you bound by your own hand she stepped to her closet in a hurry and brought out pen ink and paper  come sir you must not play tricks with me give me under your hand what you have now said  but i will write it and you shall sign it  she wrote in an instant as follows  the chevalier grandison solemnly declares that he did in the most earnest manner of his own accord propose that he would allow a certain young creature if she might be allowed to be his wife the free use of her religion and to have a discreet man at her choice for her confessor and that he would never oblige her to go to england with him and that he would live in italy with her every other year  will you sign this sir  most willingly  do then  i did  and you did propose this  did he madam  my dear he did and i would have told you so but that you were affected at his supposed refusal  why to be sure madam interrupted she it was a shocking thing to be refused  would you have wished us my dear to comply with these terms would you have chosen to marry a protestant a daughter of the house of porretta and of the house i sprung from to marry an english protestant  clementina took her mother aside but spoke loud enough to be heard  to be sure madam that would have been wrong but i am glad i was not refused with contempt that my tutor and the preserver of my jeronymo did not despise me to say truth i was afraid he liked olivia and so made a pretense  dont you think my dear that you would have run too great a hazard of your own says had you complied with the chevaliers proposals  why no surely madam  might i not have had as great a chance of converting him as he could have had of perverting me i glory in my religion madam  so does he my love in his  that is his fault madam chevalier stepping toward me i think you a very obstinate man i hope you have not heard our discourse  yes my dear he has and i desire not but he should  would to god madam said i to the marchioness that i had yours and my lords interest from what the dear lady clementina has hinted i might presume   but sir you are mistaken perhaps said the young lady though i answer for answerings sake and to show that i have no doubt of my stedfastness in an article in which my soul is concerned yet that is no proof of my attachment to an obstinate  i know what  heretic was no doubt in her head  i took her mother aside for gods sake madam encourage my presumptuous hopes do you not observe already an alteration in the dear ladys mind is she not more unaffectedly sedate than she was before is not her mind quieter now she knows that every thing was yielded up that honor and conscience would permit to be yielded up see that sweet serenity almost restored to those eyes that within these few moments had a wilder turn  ah chevalier this depends not on me and if it did i cannot allow of my daughters marrying a man so bigoted to his errors excuse me sir but if you were more indifferent in your religion i should have more hopes of you and less objection  if madam i could be indifferent in my religion the temptation would have been too great to be resisted lady clementina and an alliance with such a family   ah chevalier i can give you no hope  look at the sweet lady madam behold her as now perhaps balancing in my favor think of what she was the joy of every heart and what she may be which whatever becomes of me heaven avert  and shall not the noble clementina have her mother for her advocate god is my witness that your clementinas happiness is more than my own the object of my vows once more for your clementinas sake what alas is my sake to that on my knee let me request your interest that joined to my jeronymos and if the dear lady recede not if she blast not these budding hopes will i doubt not succeed  the young lady ran to me and offering to help me up with both her hands rise chevalier shall i raise the chevalier madam  i dont love to see him kneel poor chevalier  see his tears  what is the matter with everybody why do you weep  my mamma weeps too  what ails everybody  rise chevalier said the marchioness o this sweet prattler she will burst my heart asunder  you cannot sir prevail i cannot wish that you should but upon our own terms and will not this sweet soul move you  hardhearted grandison  what a fate is mine rising with a soul penetrated by the disorder of this most excellent of women and by the distress given by it to a family every single person of which i both love and reverence to be called hardhearted what is it i desire but that i may not renounce a religion in which my conscience is satisfied and be obliged to embrace for it one that though i can love and honor every worthy member of it i have scruples more than scruples about that my heart can justify and my reason defend you have not madam yourself with a heart all mother and friend a deeper affliction than mine  clementina all this time looked with great earnestness now on me now on her weeping mother  and at last breaking silence her mother could not speak and taking her hand and kissing it i dont said she comprehend the reason of all this this house is not the house it was who but i is the same person in it my father is not the some my brothers neither my mamma never has a dry eye i think but i dont weep i am to be the comforter of you all and i will  dont weep why now you weep the more for my comfortings  o my mamma what would you say to your girl if she refused comfort then kneeling down and kissing her hand with eagerness i beseech you my dear mamma i beseech you be comforted or lend me some of your tears  what ails me that i cannot weep for you  but turning to me see the chevalier weeps too  then rising and coming to me her hand pressing my arm  dont weep chevalier my tutor my friend my brothers preserver what ails you  be comforted  then taking her handkerchief out of her pocket with one hand still pressing my arm with the other and putting it to her eyes and looking upon it  no  i thought i could have wept for you  but why is all this  you see what an example i a silly girl can set you  affecting a still sedater countenance  o chevalier said the weeping mother and do you say your heart is penetrated  sweet creature wrapping her arms about her my own mentina would to heaven it were given me to restore my child  o chevalier if complying with your terms would do it  but you are immovable  how can that be said madam when i have made concessions that a princely family should not on a beginning address have brought me to make may i repeat before lady clementina   what would he repeat to me interrupted she do madam let him say all he has a mind to say if it will make his poor heart easy why let him say all he would say  chevalier speak can i be any comfort to you i would make you all happy if i could  this madam said i to her mother is too much excellent young lady  who can bear such transendent goodness of heart shining through intellects so disturbed and think you madam that on earth there can be a man more unhappily circumstanced than i am  o my clementian said her mother dear child of my heart and could you consent to be the wife of a man of a contrary religion to your own a man of another country you see chevalier i will put your questions to her a man that is an enemy to the faith of his own ancestors as well as to your faith  why no madam  i hope he does not expect that i would  may i presume madam to put the question in my own way  but yet i think it may distress the dear lady and not answer the desirable end if i may not have hope of your interest in my favor and of the acquiescence of the marquis and your sons with my proposals  they will never comply  let me then be made to appear insolent unreasonable and even ungrateful in the eyes of your clementina if her mind can be made the easier by such a representation if i have no hopes of your favor madam i must indeed despair  had i any hope of carrying your cause i know not what might be done but i must not separate myself from my family in this great article  my dear to clementina you said you should be easier in your mind if you were to talk to the chevalier alone this is the only time you can have for it your father and brothers will be here tomorrow  and then chevalier all will be over  why madam i did think i had a great deal to say to him and as i thought i had no interest in what i had to say   would you wish my dear to be left alone with the chevalier can you recollect any thing that you had intended to say to him had you made him the visit you had designed to make him  i dont know  then i will withdraw shall i my dear  ought i sir you have been my tutor and many excellent lessons have you taught me  though i dont know what is become of them  ought i to wish my mamma to withdraw ought i to have anything to say to you that i could not say before her  i think not  the marchioness was retiring i beg of you madam said i to slip unobserved into that closet you must hear all that passes the occasion may be critical let me have the opportunity of being either approved or censured as i shall appear to deserve in the conversation that may pass between the dear lady and me if you do withdraw  o chevalier you are equally prudent and generous why will not you be one of us why will not you be a catholic  she went out at the door clementina courtesied to her i led her eye from the door and the marchioness reentered and slipped into the closet  i conducted the young lady to a chair which i placed with its back to the closetdoor that her mother might hear all that passed  she sat down and bid me sit by her  i was wiling she should lead the subject that the marchioness might observe i intended not to prepossess her  we were silent for a few moments she seemed perplexed looked up looked down then on one side then on the other  at last o chevalier said she they were happy times when i was your pupil and you were teaching me english  they were indeed happy times madam  mrs beaumont was too hard for me chevalier  do you know mrs beaumont  i do she is one of the best of women  why so i think but she turned and winded me about most strangely i think i was in a great fault  how so madam  how so why to let her get out of me a secret that i had kept from my mother and yet there never was a more indulgent mother  now you look chevalier but i shant tell you what the secret was  i do not ask you madam  if you did i would not tell you  well but i had a great deal to say to you i thought i wish that frantic camilla had not stopped me when i was going to you i had a great deal to say to you  cannot you recollect madam any part of it  let me consider  why in the first place i thought you despised me i was not sorry for that i do assure you that did me good at first it vexed me  you cannot think how much i have a great deal of pride sir  but well i got over that and i grew sedate  you see how sedate i am yet this poor man thought i whether he thinks so or not i will tell you all my thoughts sir but dont be grieved  you see how sedate i am yet i am a silly girl you are thought to be a wise man dont disgrace your wisdom fie a wise man to be weaker than a simple girl  dont let it be said  what was i saying  yet this poor man whether he thinks so or not you said madam  true  has a soul to be saved he has taken great pains with me to teach me the language of england shall i not take some with him to teach him the language of heaven  no heretic can learn that sir  and i had collected abundance of fine thoughts in my mind and many pertinent things from the fathers and they were all in my head  but that impertinent camilla  and so they are all gone  but this one thing i have to say  i designed to say something like it at the conclusion of my discourse with you  so it is premeditated you will say and so it is but let me whisper it  no i will not neither  but trn your face another way  i find my blushes come already  but and she put her spread hand before her face as if to hide her blushes dont look at me i tell you  look at the window i did why chevalier i did intend to say  but stay  i have wrote it down somewhere she pulled out her pocketbook here it is look another way when i bid you  she read  let me beseech you sir i was very earnest you see to hate to despise to detest now dont look this way the unhappy clementina with all my heart but for the sake of your immortal soul let me conjure you to be reconciled to our holy mother church   will you sir  following my indeed averted face with her sweet face for i could not look toward her say you will i heard you once called an angel of a man and is it not better to be an angel in heaven  tenderhearted man i always thought you had sensibility  say you will  not for my sake  i told you that i would content myself to be still despised it shall not be said that you did this for a wife  no sir your conscience shall have all the merit of it  and i will tell you what i will lay me down in peace  she stood up with a dignity that was augmented by her piety and i will say now do thou o beckoning angel for an angel will be on the other side of the river  the river shall be death sir  now do thou reach out thy divine hand o minister of peace i will wade through these separating waters and i will bespeak a place for the man who many many years hence may fill it  and i will sit next you for ever and ever  and this sir shall satisfy the poor clementina who will then be richer than the richest so you see sir as i told my mother i was setting out on gods errand not on my own  for hours might the dear lady have talked on without interruption from me  my dear dr bartlett what did i not suffer  the marchioness was too near for herself she could not bear this speech of her pious generous noble daughter she sobbed she groaned  clementina started  she looked at me she looked round her whence came these groans did you groan sir  you are not a hardhearted man though they say you are but will you be a catholic sir say you will i will not be denied and i will tell you what  if i dont resign to my destiny in a few a very few weeks why then i will go into a nunnery and then i shall be gods child you know even in this life  what could i say to the dear lady her mind was raised above an earthly love circumstanced as we were how could i express the tenderness for her which overflowed my heart compassion is a motive that a woman of spirit will reject and how could love be here pleaded when the parties believed it to be in my own power to exert it could i endeavor to replace myself in her affection when i refused to comply with their terms and they with mine to have argued against her religion and in defense of my own her mind so disturbed could not be done and ought i in generosity in justice to her family to have attempted to unsettle her in a faith in which she and all her family were so well satisfied  i could only when i could speak applaud her piety and pronounce her an angel of a woman an ornament of her sex and an honor to her religion and endeavor to wave the subject  ah chevalier said she after a silence of some minutes  you are an obstinate man indeed you are  yet i think you do not despise me  but what says your paper  she took it out of her bosom and read it she seemed affected by it as if she had not before considered it and you really proposed these terms sir and would you have allowed me the full exercise of my religion and should i have had my confessor and would you have allowed me to convert you if i could and would you have treated my confessor kindly and would you have been dutiful to my papa and mamma and would you have loved my two other brothers as well as you do jeronymo  and would you have let me live at bologna you dont say yes  but do you say no  to these terms madam most willingly would i have subscribed and if my dearest lady they could have had the wishedfor effect how happy had i been  well  she then paused and resuming what shall we say to all these things  i thought her mother would take it well to have an opportunity given her to quit the closet now her clementina had changed her subject to one so concerning to the whole family i favored her doing so she slipped out her face bathed in tears and soon after came in at the drawing room door  ah madam said clementina paying obeisance to her i have been arguing and pleading with the chevalier  then speaking low i believe he may in time be convinced he has a tender heart but hush putting her finger to her mouth and then speaking louder i have been reading this paper again   she was going on too favorably for me as it was evident the marchioness apprehended the first time that i had reason to think she was disinclined to the alliance for she stopped her my love said she you and i will talk of this matter by ourselves  she rang camilla came in she made a motion for camilla to attend her daughter and withdrew inviting me out with her  when we were in another room ah chevalier said she how was it possible that you could withstand such an heavenly pleader you cannot love her as she deserves to be loved you cannot but act nobly generously but indeed you are an invincible man  not love her madam your ladyship adds distress to my very great distress  am i in your opinion an ungrateful man  but must i lose your favor your interest on that and on my dear jeronymos did i build my hopes and all my hopes  i know your terms can never be accepted chevalier and i have now no hopes of you after this last conversation between you and the dear girl i can have no hopes of you poor soul she began to waver o how she loves you i see you are not to be united it is impossiple and i did not care to permit a daughter of mine arther to expose herself as it must have been to no manner of purpose  you are concerned  i should pity you sir if you had it not in your power to make yourself happy and us and ours too  little did i expect such a turn in my disfavour from the marchioness  may i mada be permitted to take leave of the dear lady o whose piety and admirable heart i am so much indebted  i believe it may as well be deferred chevalier  deferred madam  the marquis and the general come and my heart tells me that i may never be allowed to see her again  at this time it had better be deferred sir  if it must i submit  god for ever bless you madam for all your goodness god restore to you your clementina may you all be happy  time may do much for me time and my own not disapproving conscience may  but a more unhappy man never passed your gates  i took the liberty to kiss her hand and withdrew with great emotion  camilla hastened after me chevalier says she my lady asks if you will not visit signor jeronymo  blessings attend my evervalued friend i cannot see him i shall complain to him my heart will burst before him commend me to that true friend blessings attend every one of this excellent family camilla obliging camilla adieu  o dr bartlett  but the mother was right she was to account for her conduct in the absence of her lord she knew the determination of the family and her clementina was on the point of showing more favor to me than as things were circumstanced it was proper she should show me yet they hand found out that clementina in the way she was in was not easily diverted from any thing she took strongly into her head and they never had accustomed her to contradiction  well lucy now you have read this letter do you not own that this man and this woman can only deserve each other  your harriet my dear is not worthy to be the handmaid of either this is not an affectation of humility you will be all of the same opinion i am sure and this letter will convince you that more than his compassion that his love for clementina was engaged and so it ought and what is the inference but this  that your harriet were this great difficulty to be vincible could pretend to hope but for half a heart there cannot be that fervor my dear in a second love that was in a first do you think there can   dr bartletts ninth letter the young lady proceeds mr grandison after i had left her went to her brother jeronymo there i should have found her and i as her mother motioned by camilla visited my friend but when i found he was likely to stand alone in his favor to me when the marchioness had so unexpectedly declared herself against the compromise i was afraid of disturbing his worthy heart by the grief which at the instant overwhelmed mine  the following particulars jeronymo sent me within three hours after i left their palace  his sister making camilla retire showed him the paper which she had written and made me sign and asked him what he knew of the contents  he knew not what had passed between his mother and me nor did clementina  he told her that i had actually made those proposals he assured her that i loved her above all women he acquainted her with my mistress  she pitied me she thought she said that i had not made any overtures any concessions that i despised her and sensibly asked why the chevalier was sent for from vienna we all knew his mind as to religion said she  then after a pause he never could have perverted me proceeded she he would have allowed me a confestor would he not  he would answered jeronymo  and he would have left me among my friends in italy  he would replied he  well brother and i should have been glad perhaps to have seen england once and he would perhaps have brought over his sisters and his father to visit us and he praises them highly you know and if i were their sister i could have gone over with them you know do you think if i had loved them they would not have loved me i am not an illnatured creature you know and they must be courteous are they not his sisters and dont you think his father would love me i should have brought no dishonor into his family you know  well but i will tell you what jeronymo he is really a tenderhearted man i talked to him of his soul and upon my honor i believe i could have prevailed in time father marescotti is a severe man you know and he has been always so much consulted and dont love the chevalier i believe so that i fancy if i were to have a venerable sweettempered man for my confessor between my love and my confessors prudence we should gain a soul  dont you think so jeronymo  and that should cover a great many sins and all his family might be converted too you know  he encouraged her in this way of thinking she believed she said that i was not yet gone he is so tenderhearted brother that is my dependence and you say he loves me are you sure of that  but i have reason to think he does he shed tears as i talked to him more than once while my eyes were as dry as they are now i did not shed one tear well i will go to him and talk with him  she went to the door but came back on tiptoe and in a whispering accent  my mamma is coming hush jeronymo let hush be the word   the door opened  here madam is your girl  but it is not my mamma the impertinent camilla she follows me as my shadow  my lady desires to see you lady clementina in her dressing room  i obey but where is the chevalier  gone madam gone some time  ah brother said she and her countenance fell  what gone said jeronymo without seeing me unkind grandison he did not use to be so unkind  this was the substance of the advices sent me by my friend jeronymo  i acquainted him in return by pen and ink with all that had passed between the marchioness and me that he might not by his friendship for me involve himself in difficulties  in the morning i had a visit from camilla by her ladys command with excuses for refusing to allow me to take leave of clementina she hoped i was not displeased with her on that account it was the effect of prudence and not disrespect she should ever regard me even in a tender manner as if the desired relation could have taken place her lord and his brother the conte della porretta as he is called with the general and the bishop arrived the night before accompanied by the counts eldest son signor sebastiano she had been much blamed for permitting the interview but regretted it the less as her beloved daughter was more composed than before and gave sedate answers to all the questions put to her but nevertheless she wished that i would retire from bologna for clementinas sake as well as for my own  camilla added from signor jeronymo that he wished to hear from me from the trentine or venice and as from herself and in confidence that her young lady was greatly concerned that i did not wait on her again before i went away that she fell into a silent fit upon it and that her mamma on her not answering to her questions for the first time chid her that this gave her great distress but produced what they had so much wished for a flood of tears and that now she frequently wept and lamented to her what should she do her mamma did not love her and her mamma talked against the chevalier she wished to be allowed to see him nobody now would love her but the chevalier and jeronymo it would be better for her to be in england or anywhere that to be in the sweetest country in the world and hated  camilla told me that the marquis the count his brother and the general had indeed blamed the marchioness for permitting the interview but were pleased that i was refused taking leave of the young lady when she seemed disposed to dwell on the contents of the note she had made me sign they seemed now all of a mind she said that were i to comply with their terms the alliance would not by any means be a proper one their rank their degree their alliances were dwelt upon i found that their advantages in all these respects were heightened my degree my consequence lowered in order to make the difference greater and the difficulties insuperable  clementinas uncle and his eldest son both men of sense and honor who used to be high in her esteem had talked to her but could get nothing from her but no and yes her father had talked to her alone but they melted each other and nothing resulted of comfort to either her mother joined him but she threw herself at her mothers feet besought her to forgive her and not to chide her again they had intended to discourage her from thinking of me upon any terms the general and the bishop were to talk to her that morning they had expressed displeasure at signor jeronymo for his continued warmth in my favor father marescotti was now consulted as an oracle and i found that by an indelicacy of thinking he imagined that the husband would set all right and was for encouraging the count of belvedere and getting me at distance  camilla obligingly offered to acquaint me from time to time with what occurred but i thought it was not right to accept of a servants intelligence out of the family she belonged to unless some one of it authorized her to give it me yet you must believe i wanted not anxious curiosity on a subject so interesting i thanked her but said that it might if discovered lay her under inconveniences which would grieve me for her sake she had the good sense to approve of my declining her offer  in the morning of the same day i had a visit made me which i little expected it was from father marescotti it is a common thing to load an enemy especially if he be in holy orders and comes to us in the guise of friendship with the charge of hypocrisy but partiality may be at the bottom of the accusation father marescotti is a zealous roman catholic i could not hope either for his interest or affection he could not but wish to frustrate my hopes as a man in earnest in his own principles and who knew how steadfast i was in mine it was his duty to oppose this alliance he is perhaps the honest man for knowing but little of human nature and of the tender passions as to that of love he seemed to have drawn his conclusions from general observations he knew not how to allow for particular constitutions nor to account for the delicacy of such a heart as clementinas he thought that love was always a poor blind boy led in a string either by folly or fancy and that once the impetus got over and the lady settled into the common offices of life she would domesticate herself and be as happy with a count of belvedere especially as he is a very worthy man as if she had married the man once most favored on this presumption it was a condescension in such a man to come to me and to declare himself my friend and advise me what to do for promoting the peace of a family which i professed to venerate and hear that his condescension was owing to a real greatness of mind  i was from the moment of his entrance very open very frank more so than he expected as he owned he told me that he was afraid i had conceived prejudices against him the kinder then in him i said that he condescended to make me so friendly a visit i assured him that i regarded him as a good man i had indeed sometimes thought him severe but that convinced me that he was very much in earnest in his religion i was sensible i said that we ought always to look to the intention to put ourselves in the situation of the persons of whose actions we presumed to judge and even to think well of austerities which had their foundation in virtue in whatever manner they affected us  he applauded me and said that i wanted so little to be a catholic that it was a thousand pities i was not one and he was persuaded that i should one day be a proselyte  this fathers business was to convince me of the unfitness of an alliance between families so very opposite in their religious sentiments he went into history upon it you may believe that the unhappy consequences which follow the marriage between our charles i and the princess henrietta of france were not forgotten he expatiated upon them but i observed to him that the monarch was the sufferer by the zeal of the queen for her religion and not the queen any otherwise than as she was involved in the consequences of those sufferings which she had brought upon him in short father said i we protestants some of us have zeal but let us alone and it is not a persecuting one your doctrine of merits makes the zeal of your devotees altogether active and perhaps the more flaming in proportion as the person is more honest and worthy  i lamented that i was sent for from vienna upon hopes though my principles were well known that otherwise i had never presumed to entertain  he owned that that was a wrong step and valued himself that he had not been consulted upon it and that when he knew it had been taken he inveighed against it  and i am afraid father said i   he interrupted me  why i believe so  you have made such generous distinctions in favor of the duty of a man acting in my function that i must own i have not been an idle observer on this occasion  he advised me to quit bologna he was profuse in his offers of service in any other affair and i dare say was in earnest  i told him that i chose not to leave it precipitately and as if i had done something blameworthy i had some hopes of being recalled to my fathers arms i should set out when i left bologna directly for paris to be in the way of such a longwished for call and then said i adieu to traveling adieu to italy for ever i should have been happy had i never seen it but in the way for which i have been accustomed to censure the generality of my countrymen  his behavior at parting was such as will make me for ever revere him and will enlarge a charity for all good men of his religion which yet before was not a narrow one for begging my excuse he kneeled down at the door of my antechamber and offered up in a very servent manner a prayer for my conversion he could not have given me any other way so high an opinion of him no not had he offered me his interest with clementina and her family i embraced him as he did me tears were in his eyes i thanked him for the favor of this visit and recommending myself to his frequent prayers told him that he might be assured of all the respectful services he should put it in my power to render him i longed dr bartlett to make him a present worthy of his acceptance had i known what would have been acceptable and had i not been afraid of affronting him i accompanied him to the outward door i never said he saw a protestant that i loved before your mind is still more amiable than your person lady clementina i see might have been happy with you but it was not fit on our side he snatched my hand before i was aware and honored it with his lips and hastened from me leaving me at a loss and looking after him and for him when he was out of sight my mind laboring as under a high sense of obligation to his goodness  religion and love dr bartlett which heighten our relish for the things of both worlds what pity is it that they should ever run the human heart either into enthusiasm or superstition and thereby debase the minds they are both so well fitted to exalt  i am equally surprised and affected by the contents of the following letter directed to me it was put within the door nobody saw by whom the daughter of the lady at whose house i lodge found it and gave it to one of my servants for me  dont be surprised chevalier dont think amiss of me for my forwardness i heard some words drop so did camilla but she cannot go out to tell you of them as if somebodys life was in danger this distracts me i am not treated as i was accustomed to be treated they dont love me now  they dont love their poor clementina very true chevalier you who were always telling me how dearly they all loved me will hardly believe it i suppose nothing now is said but you shall clementina  from those who used to call me sister and dear sister at every word  they said i was well and quite well and ought to be treated with a high hand  i know from whom they have that from myself i said so to mrs beaumont but she need not to have told them i will not go to her again for that they say i shall god help me i dont know where to go for a quiet mind a high hand will not do chevalier i wish i knew what would i would tell it to them i once thought it would else i had not said it to mrs beaumont but let them go on with their high hand with all my heart that heart will not hold always it had been gone before now had not mrs beaumont got out of me  something  i will not tell you what  and then they sent for somebody  and somebody came  and what then  they need not threaten me so  somebody is not so much to blame as they will have it he is and that somebody did make proposals  did you not chevalier  i had like to have betrayed myself  i stopped just in time  but chevalier i will tell you a secret  dont speak of it to anybody  may i depend upon you  i know i may why camilla tells me that the count of belvedere is to come again  are you not sorry for your poor pupil but i will tell you another secret  and that is what i intend to say to him  look you here my lord you are a very good sort of a man and you have great estates you are very rich you are in short a very good sort of man but there is however a man in the world with whom i had rather live in the poorest hermitage in a wilderness than with you in the richest palace in the world after this if he be not the creeping mean man you said he was not he will be answered  everything you said to me in former happy times i rememher you always said things to me that were sit to be remembered yet i dont tell you who my hermit is that i had rather live with perhaps there is no such man but this you know will be a sufficient answer to the count of belvedere dont you think so  here i have been tormented again  would you think it i have been pleading for somebody boldly confidently i said i could depend upon his honor ah chevalier dont you think i might  i am to be locked up and i cannot tell what  they will not let me see somebody  they will not let me see my poor jeronymo  you and i and jeronymo are all put together  i dont care as i tell camilla i dont care they will quite harden me  but just now my mamma o she is the best of mothers  my mamma tells me she will not persuade me if i will be patient if i will be good my dear mamma as i told her i will be patient and good but dont let them inveigh against the chevalier then what harm has he done  was he not  ah sir now i blush  was he not sent for  and did he not weep over me  yet none of your bold men who look as proudly as if they were sure of your approbation  well but what do you think my mamma said  ah clementina said she would to god the chevalier for his own sake yes she said for his own sake and that made a great impression upon me it was so good you know of my mamma that the chevalier was in england or a thousand miles off so sir this is my advice  pray take it for i and camilla heard some words and camilla as well as i is much troubled about them  get away to england as soon as you can  be sure do  and some months hence bring your two sisters over with you and by that time all our feuds will be over you know and you shall take a house and then i can go and visit your sisters you know and your sisters will visit us you will come sometimes with them will not you well and i will tell you how we will pass part of our time they shall perfect me in my english i will perfect them in italian they know as much of that i suppose at least as i do of english and we will visit every court and every city so god bless you sir and get away as soon as you can i put no name for fear this should miscarry and i should be found out  ah sir they are very severe with me pity me but i know you will for you have a tender heart it is all for you  these last five words were intended to be scratched out and are but just legible  how the contents of this letter afflict me words cannot express what i feel i see evidently that they are taking wrong measures with the tenderest heart in the world a heart that never once has swerved from its duty and which is filled with reverence and love for all that boast a relation to it harsh treatment and which is besides new to it is not the method to be taken with such a heart shall i thought i when i had perused it ask for an audience of a mother so indulgent and give her my disinterested advice upon it once i could have done so and even in confidence have shown her this very letter but now she is one with the angry part of her family and i dare not do it for clementinas sake talk of locking her up talk of bringing a lover to her  threatening her with going to mrs beaumont when they should court her to go thither not suffer her to see her beloved jeronymo  he in disgrace too  how hard how wrong is all this conduct i could have written to jeronymo thought i and advised gentle measures were he not out of their con ultations  as to the threatened resentments they are as nothing to me clementinas sufferings are everything my soul disdains the thought of fastening myself upon a proud family that now looks upon me in a mean light a proud heart undervalued will swell it will be put upon over valuing itself you know dr bartlett that i have a very proud heart but when i am trampled upon or despised then is it most proud i would call myself a man to a prince who should unjustly hold me in contempt and let him know that i looked upon him to be no more my pride is raised yet against whom not clementina she has all my pity she has seen and i have found that her unhappy delirium though not caused by me i bless god for that has made me tender as a chidden infant and can i think of quitting bologna and not see if it be possible for me to gratify myself and serve them in her restoration setting quite out of the question the generals causeless resentments and the engagement i have laid myself under not to leave it without apprizing him of my intention  upon the whole i resolved to wait the issue of the new measures they have fallen upon the dear lady has declared herself in my favor such a frank declaration must soon be followed by important consequences  the third day after the arrival of her father and brothers from urbino i received the following billet from the marquis himself  chevalier grandison we are in the utmost distress we cannot take upon us to forbid your stay at bologna but shall be obliged to you if you will enable us to acquaint our daughter that you are gone to england or some far distant part wishing you happy i am sir  your most obedient humble servant   to this i wrote as follows  my lord i am excessively grieved for your distress i make no hesitation to obey you but as i am not conscious of having in word or deed offended you or any one of a family to whom i owe infinite obligations let me hope that i may be allowed a farewell visit to your lordship to your lady and to your three sons that my departure may not appear like that of a criminal instead of the parting that from the knowledge i have of my own heart as well as of your experienced goodness may be claimed by your lordships  ever obliged and affectionate humble servant grandison   this request i understood occasioned warm debates it was said to be a very bold one but my dear jeronymo insisted that it was worthy of his friend his deliverer as he called me and of an innocent man  the result was that i should be invited in form to visit and take leave of the family and two days were taken that some others of the urbino family might be present to see a man for the last time and some of them for the first who was thought by his request to have shown a very extraordinary degree of intrepidity and who though a protestant was honored with so great an interest in the heart of their clementina  the day before i was to make this formal visit for such it was to be i received the following letter from my friend jeronymo  my dearest grandison take the particulars of the situation we are in here that you may know what to expect and how to act and comport yourself tomorrow evening  your reception will be i am afraid cold but civil  you will be looked upon by the urbino family who have heard more of you than they have seen as a curiosity but with more wonder than affection  of them will be present the count my fathers brother and his sons sebastiano and juliano my aunt signora juliana de storza a widow lady as you know and her daughter signora laurana a young woman of my sisters age between whom and my sister used to be as you have heard the strictest friendship and correspondence and who insisted on being present on this occasion they are all goodnatured people but love not either your country or religion  father marescotti will be present he is become your very great admirer  my father thinks to make you his compliments but if he withdraws the moment he has made them you must not be surprised  my mother says that as it is the last time that she may ever see you and as she really greatly respects you she shall not be able to leave you while you stay  the general i hope will behave with politeness  the bishop loves you but will not however perhaps be in high good humor with you  your jeronymo will be wheeled into the same room if he be more silent than usual on the solemn occasion you will not do him injustice perhaps if you attribute it to his prudence but much more to his grief  and now let me tell you as briefly as i can the situation of the dear creature who must not appear but who is more interested in the occasion of the congress than any person who will be present at it  what passed between you and her at the last interview has greatly impressed her in your favor the bishop the general and my father soon after their return from urbino made her a visit in her dressingroom they talked to her of the excellency of her own religion and of the errors of the pretended reformed which they called and i suppose are damnable they found her steady in her abhorrence of the one and adherence to the other they were delighted with her rational answers and composed behavior they all three retired in raptures to congratulate each other upon it and returned with pleasure to enter into farther talk with her but when they mentioned you to her she led by their affectionate behavior to her on their return said it had given her great pleasure and ease of mind to find that she was not despised by a man whom every one of the family regarded for his merit and great qualities the general had hardly patience he walked to the farther end of the room my father was in tears the bishop soothed her in order to induce her to speak her whole mind  he praised you she seemed pleased he led her to believe that the whole family were willing to oblige her if she would declare herself and asked her questions the answers to which must either be an avowal or a denial of her love and then she owned that she preferred the chevalier grandison to all the men in the world she would not against the opinion of her friends wish to be his but never would be the wife of any other man  what said the general though he continue an heretic  he might be converted she said and he was a sweettempered and compassionate man and a man of sense as he was must see his errors  would she run the risque of her own salvation  she was sure she should never give up her faith  it was tempting god to abandon her to her own perverseness  her reliance on his goodness to enable her to be steadfast was humble and not presumptuous and with a pious view to gain a proselyte and god would not forsake a person so well intending was she not to be allowed her confessor her confessor should be appointed by themselves she did not doubt but the chevalier would consent to that  the bishop you know can he cool when he pleases he bore to talk farther with her  my father was still in tears  the general had no farther patience he withdrew and came to me and vented on me his displeasure it is true grandison when it was proposed to send for you from vienna i sanguine in my hopes had expressed myself as void of all doubt but you would become a catholic  your love your compassion your honor as i thought engaged by such a step taken on our side  i had no notion that on such a surprise with such motives to urge your compliance a young man like myself and with a heart so sensible could have been so firm but these thoughts are all over  this however exposes me to the more reproaches  we were high and my mother and uncle came in to mediate between us  i would not i could not renounce my friend the friend of my soul as in our first acquaintance and the preserver of my life  miserable as that has been the preserver of it at a time when i was engaged in an unlawful pursuit in which i had perished what might i have now been and where  i ventured to give my opinion in favor of my sisters marriage with you as the only method that could be taken to restore her who i said loved you because you were a virtuous man and that her love was not only founded in virtue but was virtue itself  my brother told me that i was as much beside myself with my notions of gratitude as my sister was with a passion less excusable  i bid him forbear wounding a wounded man  thus high ran words between u  the bishop mean time went on with a true church subtlety to get out of the innocent girl her whole mind  he boasted afterward of his art but what was there in it to boast of a mind so pure and so simple as clementinas ever was and which only the pride of her sex and motives of religion had perhaps hindered her from declaring to all the world  he asked her if she was willing to leave her father mother brothers and country to go to a strange land to live among a hated people  no she said you would not wish her to go out of italy you would live nine months out of twelve in italy  he told her that she must when married do as her husband would have her  she could trust to your honor  would she consent that her children should be trained up heretics  she was silent to this question he repeated it  well my lord if i must not be allowed to choose for myself only let me not hear the chevalier spoken of disrespectfully he does not deserve it he has acted by me with as much honor as he did by my brother he is an uniformly good man and as generous as good  and dont let me have other proposals made me and i will be contented i had never so much distinguished him if everybody had not as well as i  he was pleased to find her answers so rational he pronounced her quite well and gave it as his opinion that you should be desired to quit bologna and your absence and a little time he was sure would secure her health of mind  but when her aunt sforza and her cousin laurana talked with her next morning they found her on putting questions about you absolutely determined in your favor  she answered the objections they made against you with equal warmth and clearness she seemed sensible of the unhappy way she had been in and would have it that the last interview she had with you had helped to calm and restore her and she hoped that she should be better every day she praised your behavior to her she expatiated upon and pitied your distress of mind  they let her run on till they too had obtained from her a confirmation of all that the bishop had reported and upon repeating the conversation would have it upon experience that soothing such a passion was not the way to be taken but that a high hand was to be used and that she was to be shamed out of a love so improper so irreligious so scandalous to be encouraged in a daughter of their house with an heretic and who had shown himself to be a determined one  they accordingly entered upon their new measures they forbad her to think of you they told her that she should not upon any terms be yours not now even if you would change your religion for her they depreciated your family your fortune and even your understanding and brought to prove what they said against the latter your obstinate adherence to your mushroom religion so they called it a religion that was founded in the wickedness of your viiith henry in the superstition of a child his successor and in the arts of a vile woman who had martyred a sister queen a better woman than herself they insisted upon her encouraging the count of belvederes addresses as a mark of her obedience  they condemned in terms wounding to her modesty her passion for a foreigner an enemy to her says and on her earnest request to see her father he was prevailed upon to refuse her that favor  lady juliana sforza and her daughter laurana the companion of her better hours never see her but they inveigh against you as an artful an interested man  her uncle treats her with authority signor sebastiano with a pity bordering on contempt  my mother shuns her and indeed avoids me but as she has been blamed for permitting the interview which they suppose the wrongest step that could have been taken she declares herself neutral and resigns to whatever will be done by her lord by his brother her two sons and ludy juliana de sforza but i am sure in her heart that she approves not of the new measures and which also as i have reminded the bishop so contrary to the advice of the worthy mrs beaumont to whom they began to think of once more sending my sister or of prevailing on her to come hither but clementina seems not to be desirous of going again to her we know not why since she used to speak of her with the highest respect  the dear soul rusned in to me yesterday ah my jeronymo said she they will drive me into despair they hate me jeronymo but i have written to somebody  hush for your life hush  she was immediately followed in by her aunt sforza and her cousin laurana and the general who however heard not what she said but insisted on her returning to her own apartment  what said she must i not speak to jeronymo ah jeronymo  i had a great deal to say to you  i raved but they hurried her out and have forbid her to visit me they however have had the civility to desire my excuse they are sure they say they are in the right way and if i will have patience with them for a week they will change their measures if they find their new ones ineffectual but my sister will be lost irrecoverably lost i foresee that  ah grandison and can you still  but now they will not accept of your change of religion poor clementina unhappy jeronymo unhappy grandison i will say if you are not so you cannot deserve the affection of a clementina  but are you the somebody to whom she has written has she written to you perhaps you will find some opportunity to morrow to let me know whether she has or not camilla is forbidden to stir out of the house or to write  the general told me just now that my gratitude to you showed neither more or less then the high value i put upon my own life  i answered that his observation convinced me that he put a much less upon mine than i in the same case should have upon his  he reconciled himself to me by an endearment he embraced me dont say convinced jeronymo i love not myself better than i love my jeronymo  what can one do with such a man he does love me  my mother as i said is resolved to be neutral but it seems she is always in tears  my mother stepped in just now  to my question after my sisters health ah jeronymo said she all is wrong the dear creature has been bad ever since yesterday they are all wrong  but patience and silence child you and i have nothing to answer for  yet my clementina said she  oh and left me  i have not heart to write on you will see from the above the way we are in o my grandison what will you do among us  i wish you would not come yet what hope if you do not shall i ever have of seeing again my beloved friend who has behaved so unexceptionably in a case so critical  you must not think of the dear creature her head is ruined for your own sake you must not we are all unworthy of you yet not all all however but clementina and if true friendship will justify my claim to another exception  your afflicted jeronymo    letter xxix miss byron to miss selby o my lucy what think you  but it is easy to guess what you must think i will without saying one word more enclose  dr bartletts tenth letter the next day proceeds my patron i went to make my visit to the family i had nothing to reproach myself with and therefore had no other concern upon me but what arose from the unhappiness of the noble clementina that indeed was enough i thought i should have some difficulty to manage my own spirit if i were to find myself insulted especially by the general soldiers are so apt to value themselves on their knowledge of what after all one may call but their trade that a private gentleman is often thought too slightly of by them insolence in a great man a rich man or a soldier is a call upon a man of spirit to exert himself but i hope thought i i shall not have this call from any one of a family i so greatly respect  i was received by the bishop who politely after i had paid my compliments to the marquis and his lady presented me to those of the urbino family to whom i was a stranger every one of those named by signor jeronymo in his last letter was present  the marquis after he had returned my compliment looked another way to hide his emetion the marchioness put her handkerchief to her eyes and looked upon me with tenderness and i read in them her concern for her clementina  i paid my respects to the general with an air of freedom yet of regard to my jeronymo with the tenderness due to our friendship and congratulated him on seeing him out of his chamber his kind eyes glistened with pleasure yet it was easy to read a mixture of pain in them which grew stronger as the first emotions at seeing me enter gave way to reflection  the conte della porretta seemed to measure me with his eye  i addressed myself to father marescotti and made my particular acknowlegements to him for the favor of his visit and what had passed in it he looked upon me with pleasure probably with the more as this was a farewell visit  the two ladies whispered and looked upon me and seemed to bespeak each others attention to what passed  signor sebastiano placed himself next to jeronymo and often whispered him and as often cast his eye upon me he was partial to me i believe because my generous friend seemed pleased with what he said  his brother signor juliano sat on the other hand of me they are agreeable and polite young gentlemen  a profound silence succeeded the general compliments  i addressed myself to the marquis your lordship and you madam turning to the marchioness i hope will excuse me for having requested of you the honor of being once more admitted to your presence and to that of three brothers for whom i shall ever retain the highest veneration and respect i could not think of leaving a city where one of the first families in it has done me the highest honor without taking such a leave as might show my gratitude  accept my lords bowing to each accept madam more profoundly bowing to the marchioness my respectful thanks for all your goodness to me i shall to the end of my life number most of the days that i have passed at bologna among its happiest even were the remainder to be as happy as man ever knew  the marquis said we wish you chevalier very happy happier than  he sighed and was silent  his lady only bowed her face spoke distress her voice was lost in sighs though she struggled to suppress them  chevalier said the bishop with an air of solemnity you have given us many happy hours for them we thank you jeronymo for himself will say more he is the most grateful of men we thank you also for what you have done for him  i cannot said jeronymo express suitably my gratitude my prayers my vows shall follow you whithersoever you go best of friends and best of men  the general with an air and a smile that might have been dispensed with oddly said high pleasure and high pain are very near neighbors they are often guilty of excesses and then are apt to mistake each others house i am one of those who think our whole house obliged to the chevalier for the seasonable assistance he gave to our jeronymo but   dear general said juliana bear with an interruption the intent of this meeting is amicable the chevalier is a man of honor things may have fallen out unhappily yet nobody to blame  as to blame or otherwise said the conte della porretta that is not now to be talked of else i know where it lies in short among ourselves the chevalier acted greatly by signor jeronymo we were all obliged to him but to let such a man as this have free admission to our daughter  she ought to have had no eyes  pray my lord pray brother said the marquis are we not enough sufferers  the chevalier said the general cannot but be gratified by so high a compliment and smiled indignantly  my lord replied i to the general you know very little of the man before you if you dont believe him to be the most afflicted man present  impossible said the marquis with a sigh  the marchioness arose from her seat motioning to go and turning round to the two ladies and the count i have resigned my will to the will of you all my dearest friends and shall be permitted to withdraw this testimony however before i go i cannot but bear wherever the fault lay it lay not with the chevalier he has from the first to the last acted with the nicest honor he is entitled to our respect the unhappiness lies nowhere but in the difference of religion  well and that now is absolutely out of the question said the general it is indeed chevalier  i hope my lord from a descendant of a family so illustrious to find an equal exemption from wounding words and wounding looks and that sir as well from your generosity as from your justice  my looks give you offense chevalier  do they  i attended to the marchioness she came toward me i arose and respectfully took her hand  chevalier said she i could not withdraw without bearing the testimony i have borne to your merits i wish you happy  god protect you whithersoever you go adieu  she wept i bowed on her hand with profound respect she retired with precipitation it was with difficulty that i suppressed the rising tear i took my seat  i made no answer to the generals last question though it was spoken in such a way i saw by their eyes as took every other persons notice  lady sforza when her sister was retired hinted that the last interview between the young lady and me was an unadvised permission though intended for the best  i then took upon me to defend that step lady clementina said i had declared that if she were allowed to speak her whole mind to me she should be easy i had for some time given myself up to absolute despair the marchioness intended not favor to me in allowing of the interview it was the most affecting one to me i had ever known but let me say that far from having bad effects on the young ladys mind it had good ones i hardly knew how to talk upon a subject so very interesting to every one present but not more so to any one than to myself i thought of avoiding it and have been led into it but did not lead and since it is before us let me recommend as the most effectual way to restore every one to peace and happiness gentle treatment the most generous of human minds the most meek the most dutiful requires not harsh methods   how do you know sir said the general and looked at jeronymo the methods now taken   and are they then harsh my lord said i  he was offended  i had heard proceeded i that a change of measures was resolved on i knew thatthe treatment before had been all gentle condescending indulgent i received but yesterday letters from my father signifying his intention of speedily recalling me to my native country i shall set out very soon for paris where i hope to meet with his more direct commands for this longdesired end what may be my destiny i know not but i shall carry with me a heart burdened with the woes of this family and distressed for the beloved daughter of it but let me bespeak you all for your own sakes mine is out of the question i presume not upon any hope on my own account that you will treat this angelicminded lady with tenderness i pretend to say that i know that harsh or severe methods will not do  the general arose from his seat and with a countenance of fervor next to fierceness  let me tell you grandison said he   i arose from mine and going to lady sforza who sat next him he stopped supposing me going to him and seemed surprised and attentive to my motions but disregarding him i addressed myself to that lady you madam are the aunt of lady clementina the tender the indulgent mother is absent and has declared that she resigns her will to the will of her friends present  allow me to supplicate that former measures may not be changed with her great dawnings of returning reason did i discover in our last interview her delicacy never was there a more delicate mind wanted but to be satisfied it was satisfied and she began to be easy were her mind but once composed the sense she has of her duty and what she owes to her religion would restore her to your wishes but if she should be treated harshly though i am sure if she should it would be with the best intention clementina will be lost  the general sat down they all looked upon one another the two ladies dried their eyes the starting tear would accompany my fervor and then stepping to jeronymo who was extremely affected my dear jeronymo said i my friend my beloved friend cherish in your noble heart the memory of your grandison would to god i could attend you to england we have baths there of sovereign efficacy the balm of a friendly and grateful heart would promote the cure i have urged it before consider of it  my grandison my dear grandison my friend my preserver you are not going   i am my jeronymo and embraced him love me in absence as i shall you  chevalier said the bishop you dont go we hope for your company at a small collation  we must not part with you yet  i cannot my lord accept the favor although i had given myself up to despair of obtaining the happiness to which i once aspired yet i was not willing to quit a city that this family had made dear to me with the precipitation of a man conscious of misbehaviour i thank you for the permission i had to attend you all in full assembly may god prosper you my lord and may you be invested with the first honors of that church which must be adorned by so worthy a heart it will be my glory when i am in my native place or wherever i am to remember that i was once thought not unworthy of a rank in a family so respectable let me my lord be entitled to your kind remembrance  he pulled out his handkerchief my lord said he to his father my lord to the general grandison must not go  and sat down with emotion  lady sforza wept laurana seemed moved the two young lords sebastino and juliano were greatly affected  i then addressed myself to the marquis who sat undetermined as to speech my venerable lord forgive me that my address was not first paid here my heart overflows with gratitude for your goodness in permitting me to throw myself at your feet before i took a last farewell of a city favored with your residence best of fathers of friends of men let me entreat the continuance of your paternal indulgence to the child nearest and deserving to be nearest to your heart she is all you and her mother restore her to yourself and to her by your indulgence that alone and a blessing on your prayers can restore her adieu my good lord repeated thanks for all your hospitable goodness to a man that will ever retain a grateful sense of your favor  you will not yet go was all he said  he seemed in agitation he could not say more  i then turning to the count his brother who sat next him said i have had not the honor to be fully known to your lordship some prejudices from differences in opinion may have been conceived but if you ever hear anything of the man befoore you unworthy of his name and of the favor once designed him then my lord blame as well as wonder at the condescension of your noble brother and sister in my favor  who i who i said that lord in some hurry  i think very well of you i never saw a man in my life that i liked so well  your lordship does me honor i say this the rather as i may on this solemn occasion taking leave of such honorable friends charge my future life with resolutions to behave worthy of the favor i have met with in this family  i passed from him to the general  forgive my lord said i the seeming formality of my behavior in this parting scene it is a very solemn one to me you have expressed yourself of me and to me my lord with more passion forgive me i mean not to offend you than perhaps you will approve in yourself when i am far removed from italy for have you not a noble mind and are you not a son of the marquis della porretta permit me to observe that passion will make a man exalt himself and degrade another and the just medium will be then forgot i am afraid i have been thought more lightly of than i ought to be either in justice or for the honor of a person who is dear to every one present my country was once mentioned with disdain think not my vanity so much concerned in what i am going to say as my honor i am proud to be thought an englishman yet i think as highly of every worthy man of every nation under the sun as i do of the worthy men of my own i am not of a contemptible race in my own country my father lives in it with the magnificence of a prince he loves his son yet i presume to add that that son deems his good name his riches his integrity his grandeur princes though they are entitled by their rank to respect are princes to him only as they act  a few words more my lord  i have been of the hearing not of the speaking side of the question in the two last conferences i had the honor to hold with your lordship once you unkindly mentioned the word triumph the word at the time went to my heart when i can subdue the natural warmth of my temper then and then only i have a triumph i should not have remembered this had i not now my lord on this solemn occasion been received by you with an indignant eye i respect your lordship too mh not to take notice of this angry reception  silence upon it perhaps would look like subribing before this illustrious company to the justice of your contempt yet i mean no other notic than this and this to demonstrate that i was not in my own opinion at least absolutely unworth of the favor i met with from the father the mother the bthers you so justly honor and which i wished to stand in with you  and now my lord allow me the honor of your hand and as i have given no cause for displeasure say that you will remember me with kindness as i shall honor you and your whole family to the last day of my life  the general heard me out but it was with great emotion he accepted not my hand he returned not any answer the bishop arose and taking him aside endeavored to calm him  i addressed myself to the two young lords and said that if ever their curiosity led them to visit england where i hoped to be in a few months i should be extremely glad of cultivating their esteem and favor by the best offices i could do them  they received my civility with politeness  i addressed myself next to lady laurana  may you madam the friend the intimate the chosen companion of lady clementina never know the hundredth part of the woe that fills the breast of the man before you for the calamity that has befallen your admirable cousin and because of that a whole excellent family let me recommend to you that tender and soothing treatment to her which her tender heart would show to you in any calamity that should befall you i am not a bad man madam though of a different communion from yours think but half so charitably of me as i do of every one of your religion who lives up to his professions and i shall be happy in your favorable thoughts when you hear me spoken of  it is easy to imagine dr bartlett that i addressed myself in this manner to this lady whom i had never before seen that she might not think the harder of her cousins prepossessions in favor of a protestant  i recommended myself to the favor of father marescotti he assured me of his esteem in very warm terms  and just as i was again applying to my jeronymo the general came to me you cannot think sir said he nor did you design it i suppose that i should be pleased with your address to me i have only this question to ask when do you quit bologna  let me ask your lordship said i when do you return to naples  why that question sir haughtily  i will answer you frankly your lordship at the first of my acquaintance with you invited me to napes i promised to pay my respects to you there if you think of being there in a week i will attend you at your own palace in that city and there my lord i hope no cause to the contrary having arisen from me to be received by you with the same kindness and favor that you showed when you gave me the invitation i think to leave bologna tomorrow  o brother said the bishop are you not now overcome  and are you in earnest said the general  i am my lord i have many valuable friends at different courts and cities in italy to take leave of i never intend to see it again i would look upon your lordship as one of those friends but you seem still displeased with me you accepted not my offered hand before once more i tender it a man of spirit cannot be offended at a man of spirit without lessening himself i call upon your dignity my lord  he held out his hand just as i was withdrawing mine i have pride you know dr bartlett and i was conscious of a superiority in this instance i took his hand however at his offer yet pitied him that his motion was made at all as it wanted that grace which generally accompanies all he does and says  the bishop embraced me  your moderation thus exerted said he must ever make you triumph o grandison you are a prince of the almightys creation  the noble jeronymo dried his eyes and held out his arms to embrace me  the general said i shall certainly be at naples in a week i am too much affected by the woes of my family to behave as perhaps i ought on this occasion indeed grandison it is difficult for sufferers to act with spirit and temper at the same time  it is my lord i have found it so my hopes raised as once they were now sunk and absolute despair having taken place of them  would to god i had never returned to italy  but i reproach not anybody  yet said jeronymo you have some reason  to be sent for as you were  he was going on  pray brother said the general  and turning to me i may expect you sir at naples  you may my lord but one favor i have to beg of you mean time it is that you will not treat harshly your dear clementina would to heaven i might have had the honor to say my clementina and permit me to make one other request on my own account and that is that you will tell her that i took my leave of your whole family by their kind permission and that at my departure i wished her from my soul all the happiness that the best and tenderest of her friends can wish her i make this request to you my lord rather than to signor jeronymo because the tenderness which he has for me might induce him to mention me to her in a manner which might at this time affect her too sensibly for her peace  be pleased my dear signor jeronymo to make my devotion known to the marchioness wou to heaven  but adieu and once more adieu my jeronymo i shall hear from you when i get to naples if not before  god restore your sister and heal you  i bowed to the marquis to the ladies to the general to the bishop particularly to the rest in general and was obliged in order to conceal my emotion to hurry out of the door the servants had planted themselves in a row not for selfish motives as in england they bowed to the ground and blessed me as i went through them i had ready a purse of ducats one hand and another declined it i dropped it in their sight god be with you my honest friends said i and departed  o dr bartlett with a heart how much distressed  and now my good miss byron have i not reason from the deep concern which you take in the woes of lady clementina to regret the task you have put me upon and do you my good lord and lady l and miss grandison now wonder that your brother has not been forward to give you the particulars of this melancholy tale yet you all say i must proceed  see lucy the greatness of this mans behavior what a presumption was it in your harriet ever to aspire to call such a one hers   letter xxx miss byron to miss selby this lady olivia lucy what can she pretend to  but i will not puzzle myself about her yet she pretend to give disturbance to such a man you will find her mentioned in dr bartletts next letter or she would not have been named by me  dr bartletts eleventh letter mr grandison on hi return to his lodgings found there in disguise lady olivia he wanted not any new disturbance but i will not mix the stories  the next morning he received a letter from signor jeronymo the following is a translation of it  my dearest grandison how do you  everamiable friend what triumphs did your behavior of last night obtain for you not a soul here bu admires you  even laurana declared that were you a catholic it would be a merit to love you yet she reluctantly praised you and once said what but splendid sins are the virtues of an hereic  our two cousins with the goodnature of youth lamented that you cud not be ours in the way you wisn my father wept like a child when you were gone and seemed to enjoy the praises given you by every one the count said he never saw a nobler behavior in man your free your manly your polite air and address and your calmness and intrepidity were applauded by every one  what joy did this give to your jeronymo i thought i wanted neither crutches helps nor wheeled chair and several times forgot that i ailed anything  i begin to love father marescotti he was with the foremost in praising you  the general owned that he was resolved once to quarrel with you but will he do you think jeronymo said he make me a visit at naples  you may depend upon it he will answered i  i will be be there to receive him replied he  they admired you particularly for your address to my sister by the general rather than by me and lady sforza said it was a thousand pities that you and clementina could not be one they applauded all of them what they had not any of them the power to imitate that largeness of heart which makes you think so well and speak so tenderly of those of communions different from your own so much steadiness in your own religion yet so much prudence in a man so young they said was astonishing no wonder that your character ran so high in every court you had visited  my mother came in soon after you had left us she was equally surprised and grieved to find you gone she thought she was sure of your staying supper and not satisfied with the slight leave she had taken she had been strengthening her mind to pass an hour in your company in order to take a more solemn one  my father asked her after her daughter  poor soul said she she has heard that the chevalier was to be here to take leave of us  by whom by whom said my father  i cannot tell but the poor creature is halfraving to be admitted among us she has dressed herself in one of her best suits and i found her sitting in a kind of form expecting to be called down indeed lady sforza the method we are in does not do  so the chevalier said replied that lady well let us change it with all my heart it is no pleasure to treat the dear girl harshly  o sister this is a most extraordinary man  that moment in bolted camilla  lady clementina is just at the door i could not prevail upon her   we all looked upon one another  three soft taps at the door and a hem let us know she was there  let her come in dear girl let her come in said the count the chevalier is not here  laurana arose and ran to the door and led her in by the hand  dear creature how wild she looked  tears ran down my cheeks i had not seen her for two days before o how earnestly did she look round her withdrawing her hand from her cousin who would have led her to a chair and standing quite still  come and sit by me my sweet love said her weeping mother  she stepped toward her  sit down my dear girl  no you beat me remember  who beat you my dear  sure nobody would beat my child  who beat you clementina  i dont know  still looking round her as wanting somebody  again her mother courted her to sit down  no madam you dont love me  indeed my dear i do  so you say  her father held out his open arms to her tears ran down his cheeks he could not speak  ah my father said she stepping toward him  he caught her in his arms  dont dont sir faintly struggling with averted face  you love me not  you refused to see your child when she wanted to claim your protection  i was used cruelly  by whom my dear by whom  by everybody i complained to one and to another but all were in a tone and so i thought i would be contented my mamma too  but it is no matter i saw it was to be so and i did not care  by my soul said i this is not the way with her lady sforza the chevalier is in the right you see how sensible she is of harsh treatment  well well said the general let us change our measures  still the dear girl looked out earnestly as for somebody  she loosed herself from the arms of her sorrowing father  let us in silence said the count observe her motions  she went to him on tiptoe and looking in his face over his shoulder as he sat with his back toward her passed him then to the general then to signor sebastiano and to every one round till she came to me looking at each over his shoulder in the same manner then folding her fingers her hands open and her arm hanging down to their full extent she held up her face meditating with such a significant woe that i thought my heart would have burst  not a soul in the company had a dry eye  lady sforza arose took her two bands the fingers still clasped and would have spoken to her but could not and hastily retired to her seat  tears at last began to trickle down her cheeks as she stood fixedly looking up she started looked about her and hastening to her mother threw her arms about her neck and hiding her face in her bosom broke out into a stood of tears mingled with sobs that penetrated every heart  the first words she said were love me my mamma love your child your poor child your clementina then raising her head and again laying it in her mothers bosom  if ever you loved me love me now my mamma  i have need of your love  my father was forced to withdraw he was led out by his two sons  your poor jeronymo was unable to help himself he wanted as much comfort as his father what were the wounds of his body at that time to those of his mind  my two brothers returned this dear girl said the bishop will break all our hearts  her tears had seemed to relieve her she held up her head my mothers bosom seemed wet with her childs tears and her own still she looked round her  suppose said i somebody were to name the man she seems to look for it may divert this wildness  did she come down said laurana to camilla with the expectation of seeing him  she did  let me said the bishop speak to her he arose and taking her hand walked with her about the room you look pretty my clementina your ornaments are charmingly fansied what made you dress yourself so prettily  she looked earnestly at him in silence he repeated his question  i speak said she all my heart and then i suffer for it everybody is against me  you shall not suffer for it everybody is for you  i confessed to mrs beaumont i confessed to you brother but what did i get by it  let go my hand i dont love you i believe  i am sorry for it i love you clementina as i love my own soul  yet you never chide your own soul  he turned his sace from her to us she must not be treated harshly said he he soothed her in a truly brotherly manner  tell me added he to his foothings did you expect anybody here that you find not  did i yes i did  camilla come hither  let go my hand brother  he did she took camilla under the arm  dont you know camilla said she what you heard said of somebodys threatening somebody  dont let anybody hear us drawing her to one end of the room  i want to take a walk with you into the garden camilla  it is dark night madam  no matter if you are afraid i will go by myself  seem to humor her in talk camilla said the count but dont go out of the room with her  be pleased to tell me madam what we are to walk in the garden for  why camilla i had a horrid dream last night and i cannot be easy till i go into the garden  what madam was your dream  in the orangegrove i thought i stumbled over the body of a deadman  and who was it madam  dont you know who was threatened and was not somebody here to night and was not somebody to sup here and is he here  the general then went to her my dearest clementina my beloved sister set your heart at rest somebody is safe shall be safe  she took first one of his hands then the other and looking in the palms of them they are not bloody said she  what have you done with him then where is he  where is who   you know whom i ask after but you want something against me  then stepping quick up to me my jeronymo  did i see you before and stroaked my cheek  now tell me jeronymo  dont come near me camilla pray sir to the general do you sit down she leaned her arm upon my shoulder i dont hurt you jeronymo do i  no my dearest clementina  that is my best brother  cruel assassins  but the brave man came just in time to save you  but do you know what is become of him  he is safe my dear he could not stay  did anybody affront him  no my love  are you sure nobody did  very sure father marescotti said she turning to him who wept from the time she entered you dont love him but you are a good man and will tell me truth where is he did nobody affront him  no madam  because said she he never did any thing but good to any one  father marescotti said i admires him as much as anybody  admire him father marescotti admire him  but he does not love him and i never heard him say one word against father marescotti in my life  well but jeronymo what made him go away then was he not to stay supper  he was desired to stay but would not  jeronymo let me whisper you  did he toll you that i wrote him a letter  i guessed you did whispered i  you are a strange guesser but you cannot guess how i sent it to him  but hush jeronymo  well but jeronymo did he say nothing of me when he went away  he left his compliments for you with the general  with the general the general will not tell me  yes he will  brother pray tell my sister what the chevalier said to you at parting  he repeated exactly what you had desired him to say to her  why would they not let me see him said she am i never to see him more  i hope you will replied the bishop  if resumed she we could have done anything that might have looked like a return to his goodness to us and to you my jeronymo in particular i believe i should have been easy  and so you say he is gone  and gone for ever lifting up her hand from her wrist as it lay over my shoulder poor chevalier  but hush hush pray hush jeronymo  she went from me to her aunt and cousin laurana love me again madam said she to the former you loved me once  i never loved you better than now my dear  did you laurana see the chevalier grandison  i did  and did he go away safe and unhurt  indeed he did  a man who had preserved the life of our dear jeronymo said she to have been hurt by us would have been dreadful you know i wanted to say a few words to him i was astonished to find him not here and then my dream came into my head it was a sad dream indeed but cousin be good to me pray do you did not use to be cruel you used to say you loved me i am in calamity my dear i know i am miserable at times i know i am and then i am grieved at my heart and think how happy every one is but me but then again i ail nothing and am well but do love me laurana i am in calamity my dear i would love you if you were in calamity indeed i would  ah laurana what is become of all your fine promises but then everybody loved me and i was happy  yet you tell me it is all for my good naughty laurana  to wound my heart by your crossness and then say it is for my good  do you think i should have served you so  laurana blushed and wept her aunt promised her that everybody would love her and comfort her and not be angry with her if she would make her heart easy  i am very particular my dear grandison i know you love i should be so from this minuteness you will judge of the workings of her mind they are resolved to take your advice it was very seasonable and treat her with indulgence the count is earnest to have it so  camilla has just left me she says that her young lady had a tolerable night she thinks it owing in a great measure to her being indulged in asking the servants who saw you depart how you looked and being satisfied that you went away unhurt and unaffronted  adieu my dearest my best friend let me hear from you as often as you can  i just now understand from camilla that the dear girl has made an earnest request to my father mother and aunt and been refused she came back from them deeply afflicted and as camilla fears is going into one of her gloomy fits again i hope to write again if you depart not from bologna before tomorrow but i must for my own sake write shorter letters yet how can i since however melancholy the subject when i am writing to you i am conversing with you my dear grandison once more  adieu  o lucy my dear whence come all the tears this melancholy story has cost me i cannot dwell upon the scenes  begone all those wishes that would interfere with the interest of that sweet distressed saint at bologna  how impolitic lucy was it in them not to gratify her impatience to see him she would most probably have been quieted in her mind if she had been obliged by one other interview  what a delicacy my dear what a generosity is there in her love  sir charles in lord ls study said to me that his compassion was engaged but his honor was free and so it seems to be but a generosity in return for her generosity must bind such a mind as his   letter xxxi miss byron to miss selby in the doctors next letter enclosed you will find mention made of sir charless literary journal i fancy my dear it must be a charming thing i wish we could have before us every line he wrote while he was in italy once the presumptuous harriet had hopes that she might have been entitled  but no more of these hopes  it cannot be helped lucy  dr bartletts twelfth letter mr grandison proceeds thus  the next morning i employed myself in visiting and taking leave of several worthy members of the university with whom i had passed many very agreeable and improving hours during my residence in this noble city in my literary journal you have an account of those worthy persons and of some of our conversations i paid my duty to the cardinal legate and the gonfaloniere and to three of his counselors by whom you know i had been likewise greatly honored my mind was not free enough to enjoy their conversation such a weight upon my heart how could it but the debt of gratitude and civility was not to be left unpaid  on my return to my lodgings which was not till the evening i found the general had been there to enquire after me  i sent one of my servants to the palace of porretta with my compliments to the general to the bishop and jeronymo and with particular enquiries after the health of the ladies and the marquis but had only a general answer that they were much as i left them  the two young lords sebastiano and juliano made me a visit of ceremony they talked of visiting england in a year or two i assured them of my best services and urged them to go thither i asked them after the healths of the marquis the marchioness and their beloved cousin clementina signor sebastiano shook his head very very indifferent were his words we parted with great civilities  i will now turn my thoughts to florence and to the affairs there that have lain upon me from the death of my good friend mr jervois and from my wardship i told you in their course the steps i took in those affairs and how happy i had been in some parts of management there i hope soon to see you my dear dr bartlett from the levant to whose care i can so safely consign my precious trust while i go to paris and attend the wishedfor call of my father to my native country from which i have been for so many years an exile  there also i hope to have some opportunities of conversing with my good mrs beaumont resolving to make another effort to get so valuable a person to restore herself to her beloved england  thus my dear dr bartlett do i endeavor to console myself in order to lighten that load of grief which i labor under on the distresses of the dear clementina if i can leave her happy i shall be sooner so than i could have been in the same circumstances had i from the first of my acquaintance with the family to the breach of all the laws of hospitality indulged a passion for her  yet is the unhappy olivia a damp upon my endeavors after consolation when she made her unseasonable visit to me at bologna she refused to return to florence without me till i assured her that as my affairs would soon call me thither i would visit her at her own palace as often as those affairs would permit her pretense for coming to bologna was to induce me to place emily with her till i had settled everything for my carrying the child to england she had wrought so with emily as to induce her to be an earnest petitioner to me to permit her to live with lady olivia whose equipages and the glare in which she lives had dazzled the eyes of the young lady  i was impatient to hear again from jeronymo and just as i was setting out for florence in despair of that savor it being the second day after my farewell visit i had the following letter from him  i have not been well my dear grandison i am afraid the wound in my shoulder must be laid open again god give me patience but my life is a burden to me  we are driving here at a strange rate they promised to keep measures with the dear creature but she has heard that you are leaving bologna and raves to see you  poor soul she endeavored to prevail upon her father mother aunt to permit her to see you but for five minutes that was the petition which was denied her as i mentioned in my last  camilla was afraid that she would go into a gloomy fit upon it as i told you  she did but it lasted not long for she made an effort soon after to go out of the house by way of the garden the gardener refused his key and brought camilla to her whom she had by an innocent piece of art but just before sent to bring her something from her toilette  the general went with camilla to her they found her just setting a ladder against the wall she heard them and screamed and leaving the ladder ran to avoid them till she came in sight of the great cascade into which had she not by a cross alley been intercepted by the general it is feared she would have thrown herself  this has terrified us all she begs but for one interview one parting interview and she promises to make herself easy but it is not thought advisable yet father marescotti himself thought it best to indulge her had my mother been earnest i believe it had been granted but she is so much concerned at the blame she met with on permitting the last interview that she will not contend though she has let them know that she did not oppose the request  the unhappy girl ran into my chamber this morning  jeronymo he will be gone said she i know he will all i want is but to see him to wish him happy and to know if he will remember me when he is gone as i shall him  have you no interest jeronymo cannot i once see him not once  the bishop before i could answer came in quest of her followed by laurana from whom she had forcibly disengaged herself to come to me  let me have but one parting interview my lord said she looking to him and clinging about my neck he will be gone gone for ever is there so in being allowed to say farewell and be happy grandison and excuse all the trouble i have given you  what has my brothers preserver done what have i done that i must not see him nor he me for one quarter of an hour only  indeed my lord said i she should be complied with indeed she should  my father thinks otherwise said the bishop the count thinks otherwise i think otherwise were the chevalier a common man she might but she dwells upon what passed in the last interview and his behavior to her that it is plain did her harm  the next may drive the thoughts of that out of her head returned i  dear jeronymo replied he a little peevishly you will always think differently from everybody else mrs beaumont comes tomorrow  what do i care for mrs beaumont said she  i dont love her she tells everything i say  come my dear love said laurana you afflict your brother jeronymo let us go up to your own chamber  i afflict everybody and everybody afflicts me and you are all cruel why he will be gone i tell you that makes me so impatient and i have something to say to him my father will not see me my mother renounces me i have been looking for her and she hides herself from me  and i am a prisoner and watched and used ill  here comes my mother said laurana you now must go up to your chamber cousin clementina  so she does said she now i must go indeed  ah jeronymo now there is no saying nay  but it is hard very hard  and she burst into tears i will not speak though said she to my aunt remember i will be silent madam  then whispering me my aunt brother is not the aunt she used to be to me  but hush i dont complain you know  by this i saw that lady sforza was severe with her  she addressed herself to her aunt you are not my mamma are you madam  no child  no child indeed i know that too well but my brother giacomo is as cruel to me as anybody but hush jeronymo  dont you betray me  now my aunt is come i must go  i wish i could run away from you all  she was yesterday detected writing a letter to you my mother was shown what she had written and wept over it my aunt took it out of my sisters bosom where she had trust it on her coming in this she resented highly  when she was led into her own chamber she refused to speak but in great hurry went to her closet and taking down her bible turned over one leaf and another very quick lady sforza had a book in her hand and sat over against the closetdoor to observe her motions she came to a place  pretty said she  the bishop had formerly given her a smattering of latin  she took pen and ink and wrote you will see chevalier the very great purity of her thoughts by what she omitted and what she chose from the canticles velut unguentum diffunditur nomen tuum etc  in the english translation thus thy name is as ointment poured forth therefore do the virgins love thee draw me we will run after thee the upright love thee  look not upon me because i am black because the sun has looked upon me my mothers children were angry with me they made me the keeper of the vineyards but mine own vineyard have i not kept  tell me o thou whom my soul loves where thou feedest where thou make thy flock to rest at noon for why should i be as one that turns aside by the flocks of thy companions    she laid down her pen and was thoughtful her elbow resting on the escritoire she wrote upon her hand supporting her head  may i look over you my dear said her aunt stepping to her and taking up the paper read it and took it out of the closet with her unopposed her gentle bosom only heaving with sighs  i will write no more so minutely on this affecting subject my grandison  they are all of opinion that she will be easy when she knows that you have actually left bologna and they strengthen their opinion by these words of hers above recited why he will be gone i tell you and this makes me so impatient  at least they are resolved to try the experiment and so my dear grandison you must be permitted to leave us  god be your director and comforter as well as ours prays  your ever affectionate jeronymo   mr grandison having no hopes of being allowed to see the unhappy lady set out with a heavy heart for florence he gave orders there and at leghorn that the clerks and agents of his late friend mr jervois should prepare every thing for his inspection against his return from naples and then he set out for that city to attend the general  he had other friends to whom he had endeared himself at sienna ancona and particularly at rome as he had also some at naples of whom he intended to take leave before he set out for paris and therefore went to attend the general with the greater pleasure  within the appointed time he arrived at naples  the general received me says mr grandison with greater tokens of politeness than affection you are the happiest man in the world chevalier said he after the first compliments in escaping dangers by braving them i do assure you that i had great difficulties to deny myself the favor of paying you a visit in my own way at bologna i had indeed resolved to do it till you proposed this visit to me here  i should have been very sorry replied i to have seen a brother of lady clementina in any way that should not have made me consider him as her brother but before i say another word let me ask after her health how does the most excellent of women  you have not heard then  i have not my lord but it is not for want of solicitude i have sent three several messengers but can hear nothing to my satisfaction  nor can you hear any thing from me that will give you any  i am grieved at my soul that i cannot how my lord do the marquis and marchioness  dont ask they are extremely unhappy  i hear that my dear friend signor jeronymo has undergone   a dreadful operation innterrupted the general  he has poor jeronymo he could not write to you god preserve my brother but chevalier you did not save half a life though we thank you for that when you restored him to our arms  i had no reason to boast my lord of the accident i never made a merit of it it was a mere accident and cost me nothing the service was greatly overrated  would to god chevalier it had been rendered by any other man in the world  as it has proved i am sure my lord i have reason to join in the wish  he showed me his pictures statues and cabinet of curiosities while dinner was preparing but rather for the ostentation of his magnificence and taste than to do me pleasure i even observed an increasing coldness in his behavior and his eye was too often cast upon me with a fierceness that showed resentment and not with the hospitable frankness that became him to a visiter and guest who had undertaken a journey of above two hundred miles principally to attend him and to show him the confidence he had in his honor this as it was more to his dishonor than mine i pitied him for but what most of all disturbed me was that i could not obtain from him any particular intelligence relating to the health of one person whose distresses lay heavy upon my heart  there were several persons of distinction at dinner the discourse could therefore be only general he paid me great respect at his table but it was a solemn one i was the more uneasy at it as i apprehended that the situation of the bologna family was more unhappy than when i left that city  he retired with me into his garden you stay with me at least the week out chevalier  no my lord i have affairs of a deceased friend at florence and at leghorn to settle tomorrow as early as i can i shall set out for rome in my way to tuscany  i am surprised chevalier you take something amiss in my behavior  i cannot say that your lordships countenance i am a very free speaker has that benignity in it that complacency which i have had the pleasure to see in it  by g chevalier i could have loved you better than any man in the world next to the men of my own family but i own i see you not here with so much love as admiration  the word admiration my lord may require explanation you may admire at my confidence but i thank you for the manly freedom of your acknowlegement in general  by admiration i mean all that may do you honor your bravery in coming hither particularly and your greatness of mind on your taking leave of us all but did you not then mean to insult me  i meant to observe to you then as i now do in your own palace that you had not treated me as my heart told me i deserved to be treated but when i thought your warmth was rising to the uneasiness of your assembled friends instead of answering your question about my stay at bologna as you seemed to mean it i invited myself to an attendance upon you here at naples in such a manner as surely could not be construed an insult  i own grandison you disconcerted me i had intended to save you that journey  was that your lordships meaning when in my absence you called at my lodgings the day after the farewelvisit  not absolutely i was uneasy with myself i intended to talk to you what that talk might have produced i know not but had i invited you out if i had found you at home would you have answered my demands  according as you had put them  will you answer them now if i attend you as far as rome on your return to florence  if they are demands fit to be answered  do you expect i will make any that are not fit to be answered  my lord i will explain myself you had conceived causeless prejudices against me you seemed inclined to impute to me a misfortune that was not could not be greater to you than it was to me i knew my own innocence i knew that i was rather an injured man in having hopes given me in which i was disappointed not by my own fault whom shall an innocent and an injured man fear  had i feared my fear might have been my destruction for was i not in the midst of your friends a foreigner if i would have avoided you could i had you been determined to seek me  i would choose to meet even an enemy as a man of honor rather than to avoid him as a malefactor in my country the law supposes flight a confession of guilt had you made demands upon me that i had not chosen to answer i would have expostulated with you i could perhaps have done so as calmly as i now speak if you would not have been expostulated with i would have stood upon my defense but for the world i would not have hurt a brother of clementina and jeronymo a son of the marquis and marchioness of porretta could i have avoided it had your passion given me any advantage over you and i had obtained your sword a pistol had the choice been left to me i had refused for both our sakes i would have presented both swords to you and bared my breast it was before penetrated by the distresses of the dear clementina and of all your family  perhaps i should only have said if your lordship thinks i have injured you take your revenge  and now that i am at naples let me say that if you are determined contrary to all my hopes to accompany me to rome or elsewhere on my return with an unfriendly purpose such and no other shall be my behavior to you if the power be given me to show it i will rely on my own innocence and hope by generosity to overcome a generous man let the guilty secure themselves by violence and murder  superlative pride angrily said he and stood still measuring me with his eye and could you hope for such an advantage  while i my lord was calm and determined only upon selfdefence while you were passionate and perhaps rash as aggressors generally are i did not doubt it but could i have avoided drawing and preserved your good opinion i would not have drawn your lordship cannot but know my principles  grandison i do know them and also the general report in your favor for skill and courage do you think i would have heard with patience of the once proposed alliance had not your character  and then he was pleased to say many things in my favor from the report of persons who had weight with him some of whom he named  but still grandison said he this poor girl  she could not have been so deeply affected had not some loverlike arts   let me my lord interrupt you  i cannot bear an imputation of this kind had such arts been used the lady could not have been so much affected cannot you think of your noble sister as a daughter of the two houses from which you sprang cannot you see her as by mrs beaumonts means we now so lately have been able to see her struggling nobly with her own heart why am i put upon this tender subject because of her duty and her religion and resolved to die rather than encourage a wish that was not warranted by both  i cannot my lord urge this subject but there never was a passion so nobly contended with there never was a man more disinterested and so circumstanced remember only my voluntary departure from bologna against persuasion and the great behavior of your sister on that occasion great as it came out to be when mrs beaumont brought her to acknowledge what would have been my glory to have kown could it have been encouraged but is now made my heaviest concern  indeed grandison she ever was a noble girl we are too apt perhaps to govern ourselves by events without looking into causes but the access you had to her such a man and who became known to us from circumstances so much in his favor both as a man of principle and bravery   this my lord interrupted i is still judging from events you have seen mrs beaumonts letter surely you cannot have a nobler monument of magnanimity in woman and to that i refer for a proof of my own integrity  i have that letter jeronymo gave it me at my taking leave of him and with these words grandison will certainly visit you at naples i am afraid of your warmth his spirit is well known all my dependence is upon his principles he will not draw but in his own defense cherish the noble visiter surely brother i may depend upon your hospitable temper read over again this letter before you see him  i have not yet read it proceeded the general but i will and that if you will allow me now  he took it out of his pocket walked from me and read it and then came to me and took my hand  i am half ashamed of myself my dear grandison i own i wanted magnanimity all the distresses of our family on this unhappy grirls account were before my eyes and i received you i behaved to you as the author of them i was contriving to be dissatisfied with you forgive me and command my best services i will let our jeronymo know how greatly you subdued me before i had recourse to the letter but that i have since read that part of it which accounts for my sisters passion and wish i had read it with equal attention before i acquit you i am proud of my sister yet i observe from this very letter that jeronymos gratitude has contributed to the evil we deplore but  let us not say one word more of the unhappy girl it is painful to me to talk of her  not ask a question my lord   dont grandison dont  jeronymo and clementina are my souls woe  but they are not worse than might be apprehended you go to court with me tomorrow i will present you to the king  i have had that honor formerly i must depart tomorrow morning early i have already taken leave of several of my friends here i have some to make my compliments to at rome which i reserved for my return  you stay with me tonight  i intend it my lord  well we will return to company imust make my excuses to my friends your departure tomorrow must be one they all admire you they are acquainted with your character they will join with me to engage you if possible to stay longer  we returned to the company   letter xxxii miss byron to miss selby receive now my dear the doctors thirteenth letter and the last he intends to favor us with till he entertains us with the histories of mrs beaumont and lady olivia  dr bartletts thirteenth letter mr grandison set out next morning the generals behavior to him at his departure was much more open and free than it was at receiving him  mr grandison on his return to florence entered into the affairs of his late friend mr jervois with the spirit and yet with the temper for which he is noted when he engages in any business he put every thing in a happy train in fewer days than it would have cost some other persons months for he was present himself on every occasion and in every business where his presence would accelerate it yet he had embarrassments from olivia  he found before he set out for naples that mrs beaumont at the earnest request of the marchioness was gone to bologna at his return not hearing anything from signor jeronymo he wrote to mrs beaumont requesting her to inform him of the state of things in that family as far as she thought proper and particularly of the health of that dear friend on whose silence to three letters he had written he had the most melancholy apprehensions he let that lady know that he should set out in a very few days for paris if he had no probability of being of service to the family she favored with her company  to this letter mrs beaumont returned the following answer  sir i have the favor of yours we are very miserable here the servants are forbidden to answer any enquiries but generally and that not truly  your friend signor jeronymo has gone through a severe operation he has been given over but hopes are now entertained not of his absolute recovery but that he will be no worse than he was before the necessity for the operation arose poor man he forgot not however his sister and you when he was out of the power of the opiates that were adminstred to him  on my coming hither i found lady clementina in a deplorable way sometimes raving sometimes gloomy and in bonds  twice had she given them apprehensions of fatal attempts they therefore confined her hands  they have been excessively wrong in their management of her now soothing now severe observing no method  she was extremely earnest to see you before you lest bologna on her knees repeatedly she besought this favor and promised to be easy if they would comply but they imagined that their compliance would aggravate the symptoms  i very freely blamed them for not complying at the time when she was so desirous of seeing you i told them that soothing her would probably then have done good  when they knew you were actually gone from bologna they told her so camilla shocked me with the description of her rage and despair on the communication this was followed by fits of silence and the deepest melancholy  they had hopes on my arrival that my company would have been of service to her but for two days together she regarded me not nor anything i could say to her on the third of my arrival finding her confinement extremely uneasy to her i prevailed but with great difficulty to have her restored to the use of her hands and to be allowed to walk with me in the garden they had hinted to me their apprehensions about a piece of water  her woman being near us if there had been occasion for assistance i insensibly led that way she sat down on a seat over against the great cascade but she made no motion that gave me apprehensions from this time she has been fonder of me than before the day i obtained this liberty for her she often clasped her arms about me and laid her face in my bosom and i could plainly see it was in gratitude for restoring to her the use of her arms but she cared not to speak  indeed she generally affects deep silence yet at times i see her very soul is fretted she moves to one place is tired of that shifts to another and another all round the room  i am grieved at my heart for her i never knew a more excellent young creature  she is very attentive at her devotions and as constant in them as she used to be every good habit she preserves yet at other times rambles much  she is often for writing letters to you but when what she writes is privately taken from her she makes no enquiry about it but takes a new sheet and begins again  sometimes she draws but her subjects are generally angels and saints she often meditates in a map of the british dominions and nowandthen wishes she were in england  lady juliana de sforza is earnest to have her with her at urbino or at milan where she has also a noble palace but i hope it will not be granted that lady professes to love her but she cannot be persuaded out of her notion of harch methods which will never do with clementina  i shall not be able to stay long with her the discomposure of so excellent a young creature affects me deeply could i do her either good her pleasure i should be willing to deny myself the society of my dear friends at florence but i am persuaded and have hinted as much that one interview with you would do more to settle her mind than all the methods they have taken  i hope sir to see you before you leave italy it must be at florence not at bologna i believe it is generous of you to propose the latter  i have now been here a week without hope the doctors they have consulted are all for severe methods and low diet the first i think is in compliment to some of the family she is so loath to take nourishment and when she does is so very abstemious that the regimen is hardly necessary she never or but very seldom used to drink anything but water  she took it into her poor head several times this day and perhaps it will hold to sit in particular places to put on attentive looks as if she were listening to somebody she sometimes smiled and seemed pleased looked up as if to somebody and spoke english i have no doubt though i was not present when she assumed these airs and talked english but her disordered imagination brought before her her tutor instructing her in that tongue  you desired me sir to be very particular i have been so but at the expense of my eyes and i shall not wonder if your humane heart should be affected by my sad tale  god preserve you and prosper you in whatsoever you undertake  hortensia beaumont   mrs beaumont staid at bologna twelve days and then left the unhappy young lady  at taking leave she asked her what commands she had for her  love me said she and pity me that is one another is whispering her you will see the chevalier perhaps though i must not  tell him that his poor friend clementina is sometimes very unhappy  tell him that she shall rejoice to sit next him in heaven  tell him that i say he cannot go thither good man as he is while he shuts his eyes to the truth  tell him that i shall take it very kindly of him if he will not think of marrying till he acquaints me with it and can give me assurance that the lady will love him as well as somebody else would have done  o mrs beaumont should the chevalier grandison marry a woman unworthy of him what a disgrace would that be to me  mr grandison by this time had prepared everything for his journey to paris the friend he honored with his love was arrived from the levant and the archipelago thither at his patrons request he had accompanied mr beauchamp the amiable friend of both and at parting engaged to continue by letter what had been the subject of their daily conversations and transmit to him as many particulars as he could obtain of mr grandisons sentiments and behavior on every occasion mr beauchamp proposing him as a pattern to himself that he might be worthy of the credential letters he had furnished him with to every one whom he had thought deserving of his own acquaintance when he was in the parts which mr beauchamp intended to visit  to the care of the person so much honored by his confidence mr grandison left his agreeable ward miss jervois requesting the assistance of mrs beaumont who kindly promised her inspection and with the goodness for which she is so eminently noted performed her promise in his absence  he then made an offer to the bishop to visit bologna once more but that not being accepted he set out for paris  it was not long before his fathers death called him to england and when he had been there a few weeks he sent for his ward and his friend  but my good miss byron you will say that i have not yet fully answered your last enquiry relating to the present situation of the unhappy clementina  i will briefly inform you of it  when it was known for certain that mr grandison had actually left italy the family at bologna began to wish that they had permitted the interview so much desired by the poor lady and when they afterward understood that he was sent for to england to take possession of his paternal estate that farther distance the notion likewise of the seas between them appearing formidable added to their regrets  the poor lady was kept in traveling motion to quiet her mind for still an interview with mr grandison having never been granted it was her first wish  they carried her to urbino to rome to naples then back to florence then to milan to turin  whether they made her hope that it was to meet with mr grandison i know not but it is certain she herself expected to see him at the end of every journey and while she was moving was easier and more composed perhaps in that hope  the marchioness was sometimes of the party the air and exercise were thought proper for her health as well as for that of her daughter her cousin laurana was always with her in these excursions and sometimes lady sforza and their escorte was generally signors sebastiano and juliano  but within these four months past these journeyings have been discontinued the young lady accuses them of deluding her with vain hopes she is impatient and has made two attempts to escape from them  she is for this reason closely confined and watched  they put her once into a nunnery at the motion of lady sforza as for a trial only she was not uneasy in it but this being done unknown to the general when he was apprised of it he for reasons i cannot comprehend was displeased and had her taken out directly  her head runs more than ever upon seeing her tutor her friend her chevalier once more they have certainly been to blame if they have let her travel with such hopes because they have thereby kept up her ardor for an interview could she but once more see him she says and let him know the cruelty she has been treated with she should be satisfied he would pity her she is sure though nobody else will  the bishop has written to beg that sir charles would pay them one more visit at bologna  i will refer to my patron himself the communicating to you ladies his resolution on this subject i had but a moments sight of the letters which so greatly affected him  it is but within these few days past that this new request has been made to him in a direct manner the question was before put if such a request should be made would he comply and once camilla wrote as having heard sir charless presence wished for  meantime the poor lady is hastening they are afraid into a consumptive malady the count of belvedere however still adores her the disorder in her mind being imputed chiefly to religious melancholy and some of her particular flights not being generally known he who is a pious man himself pities her and declares that he would run all risques of her recovery would the family give her to him and yet he knows that she would choose to be the wife of the chevalier grandison rather than that of any other man were the article of religion to be
