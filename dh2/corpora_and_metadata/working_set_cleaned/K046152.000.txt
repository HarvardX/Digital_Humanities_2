nicholas nipclose  nipclosehall nov       advertisement it may be depended upon that the following piece appeals more to facts than fancy however strong the coloring may appear unattachd judgment will pronounce it not exaggerated the author has particularly dwelt on sordid management as that is the polluted source of all theatrical dullness and deficiency mr garrick is exceedingly blameable and therefore particularly noticed about the time he got a share in drury lane patent our present laureat wrote him a letter vide  d volume of dodsleys collection of poems in which among other passages we find thalia speaking thus no more the poor polluted scene shall teem with births of harlequin or vindicated stage shall feel the insults of the dancers heel such idle trash well kindly spare to opras now they will want them there afterward addressing mr garrick the poet says consult your own good sense in all be deaf to fashions fickle call nor ever descend to reasons laws to court what you command applause   how far roscius has fulfilled the prophecy or consulted his own disinterested good sense experience sadly tells some hireling newspaper friends say if the public will follow such trash the managers are right to furnish it but will common sense allow that those public purveyors should like common prostitutes be allowed to pick young and unwary pockets by false glaring colors public complaint has been loud yet the tide of avarice and folly most audaciously flows on  the theaters have been likened to taverns where if you dont like the provision or wines you may stay away or go to another true but there are many taverns only two theaters a third of the latter would make essential difference allow a small anecdote queen elizabeth having received remarkable instances of ardent loyalty from a small country town said if they would ask any reasonable grant in her power they should be indulged license for an alehouse was the demand surprised me asked the reason because said they we have but one and they give us such wretched trash we cannot drink it if there was another emulation would produce us something worth money the application is obvious  one half the money that either installation has cost nightly extra expenses included would have genteely paid mr mossop who is intrinsically worth a thousand such christmasholliday productions  as to the performers we know they like a nest of disturbed hornets will buzz and whet their stings it will be called cruelty to attack bread how absurd an assertion if a shoemaker or tailor executes what he is paid for badly have not customers a right to complain nothing is more true than the following lines of churchill with which we shall conclude the stage i choose  a subject fair and free it is yours  it is mine  it

illiberal strife did not delane mr delane an actor of great merit and a valuable member of society had two peculiarities on the stage which mr garrick took off and rendered him so ridiculous that he

grateful sense of such a generous age whose favors flowed upon thee in a tide unknown before to swell thy purse and pride to trick the public and become supreme were the sole objects of thy selfish scheme barry was banished when his powers could shine now taken to sneer at in his sad decline or what is worse upon the verge of life viewed as a mere appendage to his wife mossop this excellent performer was originally refused by mr garrick as unfit for the stage and immediately after brought out by that ready encourager of merit mr sheridan  too great a favorite of the town like the turks brothers stood too near the crown therefore avaunt  you knew the man has pride and through that foible stabbed his weakest side on selfdestructions wings he fled the field and must we fear through adverse fortune yield yet be advised nor cruel terms impose lest friends of merit should become thy foes have thou ever given young genius due reward have thou not rather pinched and gripped it hard powell and holland these two performers were brought out under the most avaricious terms and according to their stations did not receive half of what their performance and the receipts of the theater entitled them to both for seasons felt the poor penurious pittance which you dealt you taught the latter and by teaching spoiled you traveled and the first grew natures child from his own source his stock of merit drew and earned just praise by not resembling you this is not meant to depreciate mr garricks indisputable original merit but the sad adulterated imitations of it of which mr holland who had superior requisites to mr powell was a stiff and painful instance  what balances the mischiefs you have done giving us cautherly and brereton illustrious pair  inimitably fine who with an equal share of dimness shine  hold let us own amidst satyric rage you have improved the lighting taking away the candle rings and lighting from behind  the only advantage we have discovered from mr

the literary smuggler of this isle whose works from genuine genius claim a smile not of applause for dullness self must own that modest arthur shares her gloomy throne and has by various labors fairly won the glorious title of her eldest son stand clear ye critics at due distance stand while we produce great doctor cumberland the witty son of a right reverend sire touched with such glow of true parnassian fire that he has given three pieces summers tale brothers and westindian to which applauded incongruities we refer for proof of the changes brought against this author who as we hear teems with many more of the same kind dreadful idea to our stage the pride the joy the wonder of the age let probability such authors bind as pour productions from a narrow mind let those who wish to merit

never seeks for more let him go on amidst the public praise and proudly gild his neverblooming bays let him proceed with most relentless heart till nature and the stage for ever part stiff as the stays we do not by mention of mr kellys original profession mean an illiberal reflection as it is our candid opinion that a good staymaker may be deemed a more respectable member of society than a middling author though it must be confessed he cannot so soon commence esquire which once his needle made  what strange transactions chance from trade to trade how wonderful the various turns of men who now a bodkin wield and now a pen stiff as the whalebone which he once admired behold hugh kelly with the muse inspired vending in dialogue sermonic scenes thalia knows not what such preaching means and grieves to walk abroad in such disguise as that dull word projected for the wise though mr kellys comedy of a word to the wise was treated in a most illiberal manner yet certain it is that the riot did him great service since without opposition the piece would have had a speedy natural death without the advantage of a subscription for such a phlegmatic affair was never composed before and we hope never may again  kelly between the sister muses steers too grave for laughter and too light for tears if clementina claims thee for her sire to pastrycooks consign her or the fire nor dare to play the double dealers part in sentiments so foreign from thy heart several impotent attempts at patriotic strokes were made in this impotent tragedy which if derived from the ledger essayist must be double dealing with a witness  wherefore  oh hugh  with belly fair and round with city luxury and dullness crowned will thou aspire to hold an authors name if thou art bent on literary fame forego the citys father that brilliant sensible polite knight sir robert ladbroke at whose instance it is asserted mr kelly writes left his head should thicken thine with sympathetic lead observe examples  they instruct the wise observe those maxims  none but fools despise breathe freer air  resign a civic crown even wilkes is made much duller by his gown the morning after mr wilkes was chosen alderman a gentleman in the somerset coffeehouse who had read his address of thanks to the livery remarked that it was the dullest production he had ever seen from the new magistrates pen to which a person in the same box not unaptly replied do you wonder at that sir consider he was made an alderman yesterday  johnson that huge leviathan of wit made once a turgid tasteless tragic hit told a soft tale in such laborious strains as damned the fair irene for his pains a literary warehouse well supplied with learnings lore and not a little pride who in his own opinion sits supreme whatever style he takes whatever theme who never yet his own applause has missed poet philosopher philologist johnson who once beneath a virtuous face gave venal pensioners to vile disgrace johnson who since more prudent grown and old obeys the touch of allconverting gold of a court scribbler takes the paltry sphere and damns his fame  for what  three hundred pounds a year johnson thrice happy in a newcoind word reigns in full state most pompously absurd in a sad fit of dotage takes up arms and crams the public with his false alarms what pity that a man who knows nothing of practical life who is a mere bookworm should expose himself floundering like an unskillful swimmer in the unfathomable depths of policy for the sake of a pension which while he had power to enjoy life he did without and for which when obtained he had very little if any occasion  defends a ministry in whose defense he murders virtue liberty and sense garrick the friend of doctors right or wrong most aptly here adorns satyric song garrick who titles loves almost as life and nearly well as his beloved wife garrick by multitudes so much adored like sir john english worships every lord we have heard a circumstance of mr garrick which if not strictly true is so like him that we venture to set it down being indisposed he asked his servant what enquiries after his health some complimentary cards were presented he looked over them and finding they were only from some esquires and a baronet or two he cried what has no lord sent john  no sir then throw these paltry compliments into the fire the nobility must all be sick too or they could not have neglected me  were all indeed like hagleys lord lyttleton learned peer taste would herself become their worshipper but drurys lord on greatness only set head or no head

brows no laurel ever can bloom they both forswore me in my mothers womb goldsmith who teems with sentiments refined speaks in his works a pregnant liberal mind and showed though we condemn his general plan strong tints of life in his good natured man yet dont we wish to meet him on the stage twill spoil the foremost poet of our age nor would we view him in historic path his politics may rouse up patriot wrath no writer can in many points excel we prize not writing much but writing well then doctor stick to what we call thy own and sport in fields of poesy alone come hoole thou gentlest of the tragic tribe thou modest temperate unaffecting scribe in metastasio all thy genius lies where nature fails to borrow wit is wise cyrus timanthes pretty little tales outweighd by gossamore in judgments

beyond dispute as sensible discerning and acute but so engrossed with mathematic notion his thoughts all center in perpetual motion this author has been long riding a chimerical hobby horse which we fear will at last throw him  without a question born to live by rule he never can shine in a poetic school and with the drama still must be at strife unless he greatly mends his widowed wife a comedy

royal fabulist this adventurous bard about five years ago produced a volume of fables for the prince of wales in this his policy and poetry keep equal pace if it would not seem a national reflection we might call it a palpable blunder to carry verse and some truth to a court where neither was ever welcome  might thou not hope more prudently to thrive by clinking songs on wilkes and fortyfive thou more than russian alludes to a sleepy tragedy with some good lines barbarously murdered at the haymarket and afterward printed for the use of pastrycooks etc conqueror  whose pen  o may we never meet

feelings and possesses sense yet to an authors fame shows small pretense much better must he write who hopes to rise than spanish ladies or perplexeties two very lukewarm pieces by mr hull  to turn a period or to clink a rhyme with little wit and less of the sublime may be called writing yet is waste of time with much collegiate buckram stiff and prim franklin who knows not the reverend translator

dullness bred which never can credit yield to heart or head a twist of thoughts contortion of the brain that gives to decent taste unequalled pain may hemp of all such poets be the prize even midas

been ever remarkably fond of teaching we wonder he does not equip every male performer with clothes of his own size they would mostly fit as well as his manner  he found the stage with good actors how

word all rules for speaking actors deem absurd none but a pedant would attempt to teach by grammar ties or paltry parts of speech this garrick knows and only plies with tricks commonly called stage business often essential but oftener used as a take in to those who have more eyes than understanding  but leaves the meaning for themselves to fix or fond of something critical and new a meaning

some weeks since without even the requisites of a grownup schoolboy  as one wellformd to mount the tragic throne a first appearance smoothed the thorny way yet candid judgment damned his wild essay the shade of congreve felt each jarring strain and fled ere osmyn could appear again davis a singsong man of little worth the critic muse relentingly brings forth such feeble objects should her lash

or france  clairon a mad french actress of whose excellence mr garrick not only chose to prophecy but put his infallible opinion at the bottom of an ostentatious print  though it is an undoubted fact that there never was a natural french actor or actress herself must at her prophet sneer to see his age and size in youthful sphere and policy we freely own should find somewhat that is fatly similar of kind for if like rabbits coupled fat and lean defects of figure would be quickly seen hence to those tastes which are not very nice pope may in cherry please and beatrice we grant that clive when past meridian life too often waged with fit appearance strife but nature could forgive her size and face for apt expression and wellsuited grace let us not recall the sad remembrance past that losing her we have lost her murdered cast having thus said when hopkins comes in sight that bane of laughter poison of delight we grieve and wonder that a lump so dull should ever rise beyond the colliers colliers wife recruiting officer trull should murder ladies  nay sometimes a queen till even goodnature falls into the spleen whoever prompts this word we use because the ladys husband is prompter and as we are informed the lord bute of drury lane theater her to attempts so wild must think the public easily beguiled reddish without a relish we produce as profitless for pleasure as for use worse than a cipher  why because we find she moves a figure of obnoxious kind mere water gruel made most simply small of which one taste sufficiently will pall love has some merit yet of little strength she never should rise above a single length a length in the language of a theater is as we are told two sides manuscript of a quarter of a sheet of paper  and bradshaw likewise was by nature meant to stand within the same predicament though we confess her audrey is a store of comic humor makes us wish for more ambrose and egerton a dismal pair not worth the critics or the poets care young who set out it was rather a breach of female delicacy and diffidence for this lady to make a first appearance in this character as few will do again and boldly breeches seized in imogen wants not good powers for kindled love or rage yet can she not in either much engage in action stiff often dissonant in tone her requisites ungraciously are shown yet as our theaters at present stand a post of honor she may well command she too was banished by a pittance small till listening to hibernias friendly call that kindly soil to dawning merit true improved returned her to the public view garrick awaked who pining gave her more than his pinched soul denied to her before barry has long a pleasing favorite reigned and warm applause by sterling merit gained so much in serious scenes she gives delight we wish to see her each returning night mark her enraptured tread the enlivened stage weep with her grief and shudder with her rage in all her various passions sympathize and even gaze with transport on her eyes the author of thespis because mrs barry is nearsighted and has rather a peculiarity of look was cruelly rude enough to call her a walleyd idiot  here let us pause  to breathe a wish sincere that she may keep within her proper sphere nor venture comedy of lighter kind with laughter she can never touch the mind her tragic walk is striking rich and wide enough to gratify even female pride why then intrude on spirited compeers is it not enough to shine the queen of tears come at our call whom all with joy must see the gay theatrical euphrosyne whose every movement shows peculiar grace whose arch expression cheers the dullest face whose elegance and spirit aptly joined pour matchless pleasure on each critic mind ask you her name  who has not viewed the sun such only should be told  it is abington and yet this foremost merit of our time merit which churchill scarce could paint in rhyme merit with general approbation crowned treads but a narrow a penurious round clarinda beatrice and townly claim the enlivening honor of her favorite name with many more yet vainly plead their cause for managers will make the absurdest laws but let them blunder  though we seldom view yet abington must charm us when we do of drurys long et cetera we say that some much better in their stations play than plumecrownd heroes of superior rank and such for their endeavors we must thank yet being placed too low for public same twould be but superfluity to name the view of covent garden theater bad has begun and worse remains behind  view colman in the lap of mother shiptonl a better subject satire never whipped on   to covent garden reader turn thy eyes with painful feelings and increased surprise for who would think the stage could yet produce on public favor still more rank abuse than what we have shown yet oh sad truth to tell drury midst wretchedness yet bears the belle shines over her sister though with feeble light and though deplorable is still more bright see curious colman negligent of merit of tragic energy and comic spirit palm on his servile partners and the town abject and vile dependants of his own let him of friends and mistresses have store we kindly wish he had as many more but why should he like some amongst the great make whores and favorites pensioners of state or why should we obedient to his whim glibly take down whatever pleases him taste is indeed reduced to dismal pass beneath control of this assuming ass for ass he is who so mistakes his station as to affront the indulgence of a nation the time may come nor can be distant far when judgment must commence successful war when genius will revive from second birth and crush this pigmy tyrant into earth the lowest muse must suffer pain to stoop to such a motley indigested group where lights are all so faint and shades so strong where right so seldom takes the place of wrong where ignorance prevails with boundless pride and talents which might please are misapplied where each man thinks he amply does his duty and every woman thinks herself a beauty it is a hard task to paint them as we ought almost beyond the stretch of words or thought and if we should perchance make dullness feel it is breaking butterflies upon a wheel ross whom we cannot take him all in all with poignant churchill a misfortune call wants but the spur of diligence to please blessed with uncommon harmony and ease sometimes we own his words confess a dose and kindly call an audience to repose sometimes on green boxes he turns his eyes when some affecting passion ought to rise faults we admit of aggravated kind to sensibility of eyes and mind yet when from dronish indolence he breaks and to the meaning of his author wakes we must applaud though still we may regret a gem of nature negligently set bad as he is we shall not stop to own at covent he should mount the roscian throne for still more excellence we boldly deem found in his sleep than others waking dream oh savigny poor savigny alas and oh who could a creature of thy fabric show made of such dross that not a ray of soul no spark promethean animates the whole why at the full meridian of thy days did thou so vainly seek for public praise why as an actor at such point of age attempt to strut thy hour upon the stage why madly make so terrible a choice of judgment void  of figure  features  voice why to contempt spur on with matchless speed a fool at forty is a fool indeed could not the tempring honest steel suffice let surgeons instruments sustain thy rise for spouting  insignificant as thine  will never make thy fame or pocket shine if by impartial audiences disdained though by a selfish manager retained shake off the monkeys mean designing claw nor catlike furnish a convenient paw it is pitiful whatever george may say to march a colonel with an ensigns pay this we are told is mr savignys case  what shade of merit comes  so void of pith it is simpring spirited and squalling smith perched on the utmost summit of his voice uttrance proclaims monotony his choice richard castalio are but change of name we find him everlastingly the same smoothsounding singsong issues from his throat  regard not emphasis observe the note seek ye oh cruel auditors for sense a shrilltond voice makes ample recompense no actor sure was ever more vilely classd none ever so faulty with such fortune passed if thou have modesty smith never presume to step beyond the path of captain plume for scenes genteel give up all tragic rage a gentleman both on and off the stage bensley  good heavens what language shall we find to paint this strangest creature of his kind this old this new this rumble jumble playr this prince of strides and monarch of wild stare this awkward thing which neither chaunts nor says but by a kind of blundring instinct plays mark how his peevish features strain and strive in vain to keep his characters alive see long ungraceful wide expanded arms with a large catalogue of equal charms joined to a voice  oh wonderful alliance that music sets and meaning at defiance most in a wide diversity will show some gleams of merit if they cannot glow but this strange actor for we strange must call one who shows like deficiency in all was formed by nature on peculiar plan or rather by some bungling journeyman yet he is a favorite and as such must pass thus colman makes each auditor an ass whom should the muse in due succession mark it is that same tolerable thirdrate clarke oh may he never rise to higher place who wants fit feelings and essential grace in medium style where naught affectings meant we think him capable to give content and warmly wish an honest truth to tell the flimzy leaders filled their posts as well patience is shocked and reason rendered dull yield them some succor modest feeling hull it is true thy powers by nature are but slight yet welldisposd they often give delight thou do not mouth nor rant nor strut nor stare natures thy guide  each authors sense thy care yet sad necessity sometimes we find imposes tasks of prejudicial kind from walking gentlemen keep ever free nor sigh soft plaints of love in tragedy gain parts which to the verge of nature last paternal feelings are thy proper cast possessed of such it will complete thy plan and match the actor with the worthy man wroughton what soil gave this same strippling birth we know not nor will call it fertile earth for such a weed theatrical never grew unless where dullness sheds her heavy dew they must have keener optics who can trace one gleam of meaning in his vacant face than we can boast of and his voice we own to us marks insipidity of tone wretched indeed we think that authors doom whose sense in his conception finds a tomb yet he like bensley meets from george colman esquire support thus blockheads make their way at every court we never have seen and happly never may a more correct or chaste performer play than yates who in his proper style a cynic of some laughter must beguile without one gleam of paltry trickful art by nature led he glides upon the heart traces the path where judgment strikes a line and justly scorns by low finesse to shine dispassionate applause rewards his toils and reason titles him the king of smiles for approbation why does shuter soar is all his aim to hear the gallries roar it is pitiful ambition  worthless fame  though all st giless echoes with his same it is true each man enjoys peculiar taste nor males nor females can be always chaste yet every sphere of life should take for guide a decent quantum of becoming pride goodnatured ned with public favor drunk never frowns upon a gambler or a punk in public and in private speaks his jokes laughs at the sun and thinks them witty strokes let friendship lay this truth before his eyes he that is so merry is but seldom wise and tell him of a swiftapproaching age when lost to action he must quit the stage what pain to think that mirth and pleasure past life should convert to tragedy at last avert the storm in time lay by some pence they will yield thee comfort and proclaim thy sense stick by thee when the host of midnight friends who laugh and follow but for private ends stand far aloof and follies past condemn lest thy necessities should call on them excuse this freedom on these truths depend they are the language of a zealous friend old dogtrot dunstall keeps the beaten way and very seldom mends or mars a play quick rises with advantage to our view better than most even now surpassed by few some cultivation through some seasons more his talents will command the jocund roar unless his worth the manager should trace and for his merit doom him to disgrace kniveton presumptively should never bring his talents in comparison with king yet he has merit in the comic strain though all attempts in tragedy are vain in dialogue a dismal wretched thing dubellamy should never speak but sing the notes of music bear him through with ease in these alone he may expect to please dyer was never any thing to boast a sufferable coxcomb at the most now sinking fast into the vale of years the remnant of a remnant he appears gardner may safely walk the middle way a greater compliment we cannot pay stiff in his figure bounded in his voice seconds or firsts should never be his choice younger who is that a prompter just broke loose to lisp forth characters  what strange abuse that one by nature happily designed to guide the business of the stage behind should stalk a spectacle in solemn scenes while half the audience knows not what he means for shame keep pride within the bounds of sense nor let such acting madness give offense mattocks has little or to praise or blame if any he can boast but lukewarm fame unmoved we hear him either sing or say his powers can never make us grave or gay come cheerful hal whom time with gentle hand has kindly strokd conclude the comic band lively descriptive graceful woodward come with merit that may strike even malice dumb churchill  the best absurdities advance  when he beheld thee viewed with eyes askaunce else had he judged impartially thy cause he must have honored thee with warm applause for sure in fops and parts of outre kind all thy competitors fall far behind all must acknowledge thy superior glee in the gay cast of laughing comedy yet let us own and take it as a friend we cannot seabred ironsides commend too strained in attitude too stiff in speech the plain rough tar you cannot justly reach and we acknowledge with reluctant will through all his scenes we trace thy bobadil thy studied grace is a laborious plan and shows too often the picture of a man yet we behold with pleasure and admire thy sportful countenance thy youthful fire while some reflections on george colman mr woodward was most ignorantly and illiberally excluded by the quarrel between the managers now restored not very cordially we believe by their reconciliation which also obtained mr macklin the opportunity of five nights performance cease for making thee an article of peace macklin now got beyond her youthful bloom why was the stage she never liked her doom exerts her stinted powers with some applause though fettered with a fathers rigid laws we cannot mechanizd instructions love nature so trammelld cannot freely move hence dull correctness active genius binds and rests insipidly on critic minds bulkley and baker pretty women both to speak against them gallantry is loath but howsoeer goodnature may condole to praise their beauty is to praise the whole next come a pair with constant pleasure seen though plain of persons pit we show and green they move they speak they mark the authors thought and prove their merit is from nature caught by much the best as far as they engage of any females now on either stage what shall we say of lessingham the fair she has of managers been long the care oh that regard would make her all their own and snatch a tasteless milksop from the town one who for parts eternally would fight without the sense or talents to be right kniveton a bauble fit for childish view who scarce to gipsey beau stratagem could afford her due kniveton as bad as possible to think irksome to hear as dead small beer to drink vincent whose age cries loudly for the fund the provision for superannuated performers planned and humanely promoted as we have been told by mr hull  by every eye of nice distinction shunned abhorred by every tenderfeeling ear is yet brought forward in a youthful sphere would she displayed such worth in public life as she has shown in mother friend and wife applauding multitudes might then contend who should stand foremost her assisting friend miller by favor more than nature blessed of foremost characters we see possessed what madness guides what partial planet reigns when insignificance such influence gains judgment with calmest patience joined must frown when one hand mounts to let the other down when grief or declamation drooping flags and screechowl screams tear passion into rags give us a sample gods of better store or let us never see an actress more once in footes pieces gardner gave us joy but bawls repeated all her powers destroy no doubt she thinks herself monstrous fine and yet is billingsgate in every line mattocks to grant what she may claim as due stands in a favorable point of view spirit expression and some pleasing tones for comic archness or for tragic moans a figure happily disposed though small striking in naught  agreeable in all sometimes too earnest in desire to please she steps beyond the boundaries of ease forces her features into painful state and rather sinks  attempting to be great yet few for general use can rivals stand or such applause in various lights command perhaps not one  then let our cordial lays give what they joy to give impartial praise when public favor warmly stamps regard to criticize is perilous and hard the loudmouthed multitude rush sweeping by and houndlike follow as the leaders cry yet their mad favor even from wilkes to bute we often find a paltry prostitute so in the mimic state it is fashions laws not merit calls forth for popular applause thus justice from her equilibrium swerves hence yates enjoys more than she deserves puffed with importance and a sweeping train behold she comes  insufferably vain observe her countenance uplifted high pride on her brow and fury in her eye mildness or love she cannot represent on haughtier subjects are her feelings bent in rage we freely grant she can excel who plays a tragic termagant so well when grief she struggles for it is harsh and coarse indelicately swelled with needless force her clockwork action painful study shows in speech or movement nature never glows it is true that placed among the bad she shines as feeble lamps may light the womb of mines but should a gleam of sunshine strike the sight such pallid fires would sink in endless night thus ends our painful task  a task indeed  enough to make goodnatured bosoms bleed why should we caesar domitian remarkable for flykilling like anatomize and seem to triumph in dissecting flies the answers plain in such a patient age it is just to rouse and vindicate the stage finis
