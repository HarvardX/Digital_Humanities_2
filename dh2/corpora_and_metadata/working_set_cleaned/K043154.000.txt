public the subject of the following farce is taken from the second part of durseys don quixote three scenes only of the original have been retained and even these it was found necessary to materially alter and enrich with additions to give them a modern a novel complexion  impressed with every veneration for the genius of cervantes the present writer has adhered to him as closely as the nature of dramatic writing would admit and should the same of that celebrated wit protect sancho on the stage the author of barataria need not wrsh to be more successful  dramatis personae men don quixote mr

barataria act i scene an apartment in duke ricardos palace enter manuel and pedro manuel this is truly a curious whim of the dukes to make sancho a governor   pedro i like the fancy of all things and can anticipate in idea laughter without end from it sudden elevation too often makes the wise man forget himself and become ridiculous now i shall be glad to see what effect it will have upon a fool   manuel the best of the joke is old rodriguez her graces woman takes every thing seriously and is enraged to see a fellow like sancho panca dignified with the title of governor whilst nothing is done for her after so many years attendance on the duchess   pedro arnt you to be continually about his person   manuel yes but the duke has not yet given me my instrustions in full i wish you had overheard don quixote this morning admonishing sancho for degrading his rank by scuffling with one of the grooms over the gridiron about a brown crust and a rasher of bacon he looked as fierce as the knight of the burning sword or the knight of the burning pestle whilst the chopfallen governor hung his head as if he expected every minute to be cut into mincemeat or pounded to a jelly in pity to poor sancho at last i interposed and rescued his excellency from a ribroasting   pedro as i am known to have picked up a smattering of latin whilst attending the duke at salamanca i have been appointed state physician to his governorship   manuel the worst character you could have assumed to appear gracious in sanchos eye he has a mortal aversion to physicians and lawyers since his beloved dapple had like to have been killed by the quackery of a horsedoctor and he himself ruined by the knavery of a pettyfogging attorney i should not be surprised if he commence his government by issuing a proclamation for the extinction of both professions sentencing the members of each to hang up and poison one another   pedro history says the cackling of a goose saved a whole nation in ancient times and may again in modern for ought we can tell to the contrary   manuel these trumpets announce our new governor receiving his commission in form for heaven sake let us see the ceremony   pedro

than never he who is obstinate soon wears his coat threadbare folly may hinder a man of many a good turn i beseech you sir to pardon my proverbs and thank the duke there for his noble favor which i do now resolve to deserve by filling my place as well as i can   duke have the chief citizens and leading men of the island notice of their new governors approach   attendant they have my lord   duke it is well is there ought else our muchbeloved sancho in which myself or the duchess there can honor thee   duchess any thing in my power  the noble governor is sure he may command unless it be to give him leave to salute my woman rodriguez before he departs for his government   rodriguez salute me  i would see his governorship hanged first   duke come good words rodriguez there is a vast distinction now between you and sancho but to prevent that envy and that insult his sudden elevation may excite be it known that henceforward the commands of the noble don sancho be absolute as my own throughout all my dominions   duch be it your care rodriguez to see the squire is nobly treated   san thank your noblenesses  then pray mistress since i find you have nothing to do will you be so kind just to step yonder into the courtyard and you will find a dapple gray ass  do so much as see they tend him as well as my masters horse for it is a loving creature i cannot tend him myself by reason you see i have affairs here to mind   rod why how now jackanapes know you whom you talk to  take that  strikes him for your ill manners if you were fifty times a governor   san a guard a guard and bear her away to prison i will have the witch burnt alive for striking a governor   duke hold great governor  we feel the indignity shown to your person in as lively a manner as if it had been offered to our own   duch and be assured this disrespect to us shall not go unpunished   duke yet in consideration of the offending partys sex    san her sex i wish your grace had felt her fist  body of me you would have had your doubts about her sex do but look at it its shaped like a shoulder of mutton and comes down like a mallet   duke i say in consideration of her sex and that it is her first offense we will not punish rodriguez with that death which she so justly merits but it is our high degree that you instantly make proper concession to wipe off the baseaffront with which you have marked his countenance   sancho no more wipes or marks i beseech your grace from that lady in the countenance however lest your grace should think me an illnatured fellow in consideration of rodriguezs great age we forgive her   rodriguez i despise your forgiveness sirrah upon any such terms my great age my great age truly   sancho what ever doubts the hardness of her fist made me entertain of her sex are entirely removed  now i am sure she is a woman since she had rather die than acknowledge herself an old one   duke but come friend sancho its time you depart to take possession of your government your subjects by this time expect you    don quixote then by all means sancho begone that governor who would live happily himself  must first study the happiness of his people   sancho i tell you what master of mine the best governor that ever wore hair upon his chin wont sometimes be able to please his people but i will do the best i can every man was nt born with a silver spoon in his mouth but if after all nothing will do why i will even leave them to themselves and wash my hands of the government   duke there are few governors friend sancho when they retire from power whose hands do not require a little cleaning so wishing thee all health and tranquillity in thy island most noble governor adieu  exeunt duke duchess and attendants trumpets flourish manent sancho and quixote don quixote i yet must be a minute with my friend i will follow your grace instantly at lenght my faithful squire i behold fortune reward thy long services yet ere i leave thee attend to my admonitions and i will be thy north star to pilot thy bark and steer it into the harbor safety and honor first my sancho   sancho i beseech you sir to speak slowly  that i may keep pace with you you know my understanding was always more for the trot than the gollop  and i am but a chicken of a governor yet you know   don quixote if thou would make thyself a proper governor be careful of thy morals  to have or to be thought to have morality is extremely useful for a governor if it were nothing but to be a skreen that people might not pry too curiously into his conduct and proceedings  not but that his actions ought to be such as will bear the strictest scrutiny  yet if he be once reputed a moral man let him be a turk in opinion or religion it is not threehalfpence matter  secondly my sancho   sancho that firstly is a special good law   don quixote secondly i say a governor ought to have a nice and tender conscience so very susceptible a fly cannot buz near it without making him shrink   sancho it ought to sit tight and close to him like a thimble upon the duchesss finger not as i have heard it sits sometimes like a jockeys boot that he can stretch which way he pleases   don quixote next be sue not to forget thy original nor blush to own thou come of a mean extraction for for when thou art not ashamed of it thyself nobody will seek to make thee so   sancho but then there will be no occasion to tell the people i was once a hogdriver  besides when i have got the government and am grown rich nobody will trouble themselves about what i was daub yourself over with honey and you will never want flies what a man has so much he is sure of    don quixote sancho you must be cautious not to overlaid thy discourse with those cursed proverbs when properly and judiciously used they enrich and embellish conversation but thou bringst em in so by the head and shoulders that the purpose is defeated   sancho ecod i believe sir my mother longed for them its a disease that heaven alone can cure me of i have proverbs enough to fill a large sack and when i talk they crowd so thick to my mouth that they quarrel which shall get out first   don quixote the next thing sancho is to be cautious in your choice of officers of trust remember you are but guardian of the peoples treasure and must be careful to choose honest men   sancho yes master but how am i to know them after the steeds stolen it is too late to shut the stable door i intend to act with certainty in this case  and as i am sure my people will not produce any man that is honester than their governor i will instantly appoint myself first lord of the treasury of barataria   don quixote in that case sancho i fear thy people will think thou have not so much disinterestedness as thou ought prudently examine what thy income may amount to in a year then if thou can afford fourscore servants keep but half and what would maintain the others give to the poor that their blessings may accompany thee wherever thou appearst in the execution of justice act with strict impartiality avoid corruption or the taking of bribes which is so tempting and withal so crying a sin there is not one governor in forty can forbear damning himself by it   sancho why then lord have mercy upon my soul too for to deal plainly i am afraid my fingers as well as the rest will itch most cursedly to be handling the money but sir i hope you will allow there are perquisites which its fair a man should receive in all places if it was not for the fees some places would not be worth the having like the sauce to certain meats which sometimes exceeds the dish itself   don quixote i would not have thee sancho when appointed a protector turn out a scourge and a tyrant he flatters himself in vain with hopes of enjoying happiness in the possession of immense wealth when obtained at the price of blood and the tears and sufferings of impoverished provinces it is true he may silence his accusers by rich presents and thus escape the sword of earthborn justice but guilt and remorse will poison all his pleasures and tell him there is no blinding the eyes or staying the sword of divine vengeance   sancho dont you think sir you have made this bribery business rather a little too long  i am afraid i shall forget the best part of it   don quixote i could be somewhat satirical upon thy parts now but that i love thee sancho and therefore will desist besides to do thee justice thou art not the first who has had a government he was not beholden to his deserts for   sancho no nor shall not be last sir for desert is governed by fortune you know and in a double manner for if some were to have their true deserts they would be princes and governors presently and if others again were to have theirs oons what an army of them would be hanged up in one summer   don quixote well dear sancho for that saying thou deservest not only to govern an island but an empire walk with gravity and speak with deliberation  drink moderately for drunkeness neither observes a promise nor keeps a secret eat little at dinner and less at supper sancho starts for the stomach is the storehouse whence health is to be imparted to the whole body if thou observest these rules thy days will be long and prosperious thou shall live beloved by all  thy government shall be peaceable and when the time of thy departure from this world arrives  thy children and grand children shall with duteous steps lamenting follow thee to the silent tomb sancho yawns violently i perceive my sancho thou art weary of my good advice and i shall lose time in bestowing more rules for thy well doing therefore lastly    sanch lastly i am glad of that with all my heart unless your lastly should be as long as master perez our curates whose lastly is longer than all the rest of his discourse   don quixote lastly i say be vigilant avoid that horrid drowsiness to which thou art accustomed you have been long addicted to much sleep now you are a man who must be ever watchful for the good of your people   sancho i dont see any great occasion for that your kings and princes must sleep as well as other men  and then see master what a pleasure i shall lose next to eating the greatest the blessing of his heart light on him who first invented this same sleep it covers a man over like a cloak there is but one thing makes me dislike sleep it resembles death too much there is little difference between a man in his first and a man in his last sleep   don quixote this is all the advice i shall deliver to you at present if thou take care to let me hear from thee hereafter i shall give thee more   sancho i see very well that all you have told me is mighty good and pat to the purpose but what am i the better if i cannot keep it in my head  by tomorrow i shall no more remember all this than the shape of last weeks clouds therefore pray let me have it in black and white for though i cannot write i will get one of my people to hammer it into m noddle and as for the disgrace of not writing i can pretend my hand is lame and so get my secretary to sign for me for there is a remedy for all things but death   don quixote i now shall leave you sancho i have done my duty in giving thee good and wholesome advice if thou do not do the part of a good governor thine will be the fault though the shame and discredit will be mine his highness has sent for your wise and daughter mary prepare yourself to meet them and wait at the towns end the arrival of your people  adieu   sancho good bye

have you any thing to say to me   recorder reads the speech most high and mighty don sancho descended from that most ancient and revered stock the pancas of la mancha a family not more distinguished for the antiquity of its origin than for the iliultrious characters with which it has adorned the world  for more than three hundred years your ancestors have been leaders of armies and counselors to princes   sancho hold hold friend  many words fill not a busnel  tell truth and shame the devil  a liar should have a good memory and to my certain knowledge either you or i am confoundedly mistaken what my family was three hundred years ago is neither here nor there but i can assure you not one of them who came within my knowledge ever led any armies except it was an army of turkies and geese which i myself indeed have valliantly drove to market then as to counselling princes i never saw one in my life except the duke your lord and mine who has made me a governor so now go on but if you

friend let us go to dinner   recorder we first solicit your excellencys gracious answer   sancho my answer to what question   recorder we mean your lordships answer to our dutiful and loyal address  it is usual for the governor on these occasions to express his approbation of our attachment and loyalty to him in a speech and promise at the same time to take every step within the compass of his abilities conducive to our interest and welfare   sancho i understand you that is you scratch my back and i will claw your elbow what signifies making fine promises before hand it is very easy to make them to get into place and easier still to break them when secure in the saddle no no on both sides the proof of the pudding shall be in the eating of it i will approve of your loyalty if i like the entertainment you have provided for me good governors always like good eating and good citizens always take care to provide such   recorder a sumptuous banquet is prepared for your excellencys table

sentence   smuggler will your lordship hear me   sancho i dont know whether i will or not but come what have you say   smuggler why my lord you must know that i am owner of a small coasting vessel in which i carry goods to different parts of your lordships island for sale now as it happens that i am sometimes obliged to put to sea in very dark nights for fear of losing the wind i have more than once neglected paying the duty for the commodities i have shipped   sancho and what do you call this but smuggling you dog  eh what have you to say for yourself now   smuggler truly very little my lord but there are a few friends in this canvass bag that will convince your lordship i had no dishonest intentions  giving sancho a bag of money sancho eh why upon my word there is some weight in this last argument   smuggler i have kept a regular account of every shilling i was indebted to the revenue for these three years back which finding it amount to five hundred crowns i put it in that bag and i have now honestly paid your lordship  and discharged my conscience    officer dont believe a syllable he utters my lord for to my knowledge he has been a smuggler these twenty years    sancho then what is the reason you never informed against him before   smuggler bccause my lord i used to pay him all my arrears and he informs against me now only because i did not think the contents of that bag so safe in his hands as in your lordships    sancho i believe it  every word you speak carries conviction with it i never met a man who used stronger arguments handling the bag why should not a smuggler have credit as well as other tradesmen and you mr customhouse officer take notice we dismiss you from our employ and mr smuggler you shall have his place there is nothing like the old proverb set a thief to catcb a thief  exeunt smuggler and cust offi tailor and gardener brought forward sancho what is your complaint now short  short    tailor why and please your honor my name is

vilolent hands on the poor bird  slaid it took it home to his wife roasted it and had i not come just in the nick and hindered them they would have eaten it this day for dinner   sancho umph what say you to this radish   tailor he can say nothing  for to prove it  i have brought the pheasant here poor fool just as i snatched it out of the dish from them puts the pheasant on the table so now your worship has proof before you   sancho by my faith the case is plain  what can you say to this radish is this your conscience to come into a neighbors house and steal away his goods and chattles for his pheasant in this case is a chattle  and a delicate one it is touching it and liking his fingers oons with a little good sause to it  this were a dish fit for a governor  tears a leg off and begins to eat it gardener but hear me my lord this is the trick on it i and snip used often at each others houses jestingly to take thing and the other day having a choice flask of florence sent a present to my wife from her rich godmother i gave this snip and his wife a taste   sancho friendly go on  speaks with his mouth full gardener but not contented with that he took the opportunity of my absence to make free with the rest  so i thought i had no better way of being even with him than by stealing his wifes pheasant   tailor why how now you old rusty pruning knife you maggot in a peascod you

things fitting for tailors and gardeners  fat pheasants and rich wines  and you knaves both since you have made a practice by your own confessions of stealing from one another  it is plain each of you
