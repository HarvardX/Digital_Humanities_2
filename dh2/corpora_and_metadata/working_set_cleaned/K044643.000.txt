a sermon preached before the honorable trustees for establishing the colony of georgia in america and the associates of the late rev dr bray at their anniversary meeting march         0 in the parish church of st margaret westminster  by thomas francklin m a fellow of trinity college cambridge  published at the desire of the trustees and associates  london printed for r francklin in russel street covent garden mdccl  gal vi ix let us not be weary in welldoing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not as the chief purport and design of the holy apostle thoughout his epistle to the galatians was to exhort his fellow laborers in the vineyard of christ to a continuance in welldoing to a steady zeal and perseverance in the great and important business assigned to their care he takes occasion in the conclusion of it to put them in mind of that grand point on which their success must in a great measure depend to enforce the necessity of a firm and unalterable resolution and at the same time to intimate to them the advantages which would naturally flow from such a conduct  let us not says he be weary in welldoing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not  st paul who was no stranger to human nature and all its infirmities who knew how men are for the most part guided by their hopes and fears who knew how arduous a task they had engaged in who probably knew also that they had been persecuted and oppressed and were perhaps greatly dispirited and cast down endeavors to comfort and support them by a promise of better success and a strong assurance of future reward we shall reap says he in due season if we faint not  as the mind of man is ever fluctuating and inconstant fond of novelty and impatient of confinement as good intents and dispositions come upon us as it were but by starts and sallies and even in the best of us are seldom of long duration no caution can be more necessary than that given in the text nor any stronger motive to induce us to a compliance with it than that which is there annexed  it is with great truth observed of all human pleasures that the satisfaction lies more in the pursuit than in the enjoyment of them the sport is in the chase and not the game and thus it is in most of our actions whilst we have novelty to delight us we feel neither fatigue nor satiety but when we have got up the hill and viewed the whole prospect our eyes begin to wander after fresh objects desire grows languid and something else is wanting to revive and set it at work again how many noble and excellent designs calculated to promote the welfare of society have been thrown aside merely through listlessness and want of perseverance it is much easier to begin than to continue in any good and praiseworthy undertaking nothing does in reality so much destroy the credit of morality as indolence and wavering nothing does so much promote and honor it as steadiness and resolution but i know not how it is vice and folly have gained over industry to their party and all the endeavors of reason and religion to render virtue habitual are ineffectual how soon do men faint in the race of true glory how indefatigable are they in the pursuit of false how seldom weary of doing ill how languid in actions of goodness or beneficence the feet of the malicious and revengeful are slow to serve the wretched but swift to shed blood evil doers are resolute active vigilant while the followers of good want perpetual monitors to awaken and stimulate them there is always a lion in the path to obstruct them every obstacle alarms every disappointment checks every danger throws them into doubt diffidence and despair how disgraceful is it to the cause of truth that the advocates for falsehood should so far exceed them in zeal and alacrity and that the resolution and firmness which would throw so great a luster on virtue and religion should be listed in the service of vice and debauchery shall we never be persuaded to make that which is our interest and duty our pleasure also and our happiness shall not all those who are already engaged resolve to continue in welldoing let us rest assured we shall meet with a recompense of reward that we shall certainly reap if we faint not let this then inspire us with fresh vigor and reanimate us in the noble struggle for victory  doubtless the best and most effectual method of carrying on great and laudable undertakings is by the union and cement of society by various lines all tending to one great center held together by charity the bond of all virtues nothing can bestow truer satisfaction on a benevolent mind than to reflect on the many pious and useful designs which have of late years been promoted by collective pdies of men amongst us and greater things we trst may yet be done few indeed in these our day are the wise and good and yet small and inconsiderable as is their number were they once heartily to unite in the cause of piety and virtue righteousness and peace might once more kiss each other and the triumph over vice and irreligion be an easy and a glorious conquest  to prepare the way for this triumph we are here on this day assembled to exhort one another in the continuance of welldoing to return our hearty and unfeigned thanks to god for the good success we have already met with and to call down a blessing on our endeavors an annual solemnity established by and very consonant with the piety and goodness of men engaged in so noble and useful an undertaking a solemnity which it were to be wished might be observed by all who shall at any time enter into pursuits of the like nature  the foundation of colonies is perhaps of all charities the most noble and extensive as it promotes both public welfare and private utility and whilst it brings honor and plenty to the whole body secures at the same time the peace safety and happiness of the individual it is not narrow and circumscribed but embraces the whole range of social duties and takes in our duty to god to our country and to our kind  what the psalmist says of children may i think with great propriety be applied to these establishments they are like the arrows in the hand of the giant happy is that king who has his quiver full of them they give delight to his friends and terror to his enemies and serve like burnished armor to the warrior both to adorn and to defend  such as promote and encourage these glorious undertakings are true christians far better christians than all the modern pretenders to inspiration and apostleship which have sprung up amongst us these deeds and these men will be remembered when the zeal of fools and the bigotry of enthusiasts shall be forgotten these are the true patriots and lovers of their country who are thus anxious for her glory thus active for her interest who send forth her fame unto all lands and her words unto the ends of the world  amongst these true christians and true patriots the establishers of georgia claim our highest veneration esteem and gratitude a colony which was for a long time cherished and encouraged with most amazing warmth and alacrity but though the legislature does continue to encourage it by constant supplies and though those supplies are fairly and justly appropriated by the trustees to the uses for which they are granted yet whether it be that public charity has since emptied itself into other channels whether as i before observed the love of novelty has diverted it whether a false notion may have prevailed that it does not stand in need of any farther assistance to which ever cause we must attribute it certain it is it does not at present so much engross the public care and concern as it once did or as it deserves  it is to be hoped we are not grown weary in welldoing it has suffered from us and should be comforted it has merited from and should be rewarded by us  on it is trade and commerce on it is ports and havens the wealth and safety of a nation situated as ours is must principally depend how useful georgia has already been in all these respects how much more so it may still be rendered has already been made sufficiently evident  undeniable it is and must be that every argument which has been at any time alleged in favor of this colony will at this time recur to us with double force whether we consider it in a civil or in a religious light  when we reflect on the miserable state of servitude and dependence in which so many amongst us are involved the penury of some the afflictions of others and at the same time call to mind that there is a haven of rest open to them a place where they may be assured of maintenance and support where those talents and accomplishments which might perhaps here lie undiscovered or undistinguished would be highly valued and esteemed when we consider that it is thus in the power of men to exchange want and sorrow for ease and affluence infamy for reputation and slavery for freedom is it not matter of astonishment they should yet prefer misery to happiness and be in love with ruin poverty and destruction but there are thousands amongst us of the low and illiterate especially who had rather beg and starve here than flourish any where else wretches who talk with fear and trembling of the misery of quitting friends and home when at the same time it may be they have neither home nor friends to leave  prejudices against places things or persons without reason or judgment to countenance them are among the most pernicious weaknesses of our nature they show a foolish cowardly diffidence of ourselves a blameable not to say an impious distrust of our creator as if his bounty could not supply our wants in every climate his right hand guide and defend us in every situation and circumstance of life  but the idle who are here and will not go over have another reason also and that is that the idle who were there before did not like it and if the dissolute and slothful have left the province as many of them have so much the better the idle in a colony like cowards in an army are but a dead weight and an encumbrance the business is much better carried on without them if the members be rotten and corrupt it is better they should be severed from the body lest they infect and mortify it  such as remain there will in all probability be more industrious and serviceable their fidelity and perseverance stand in a stronger point of light and seem in a more particular manner to demand your gratitude toward them  but let us consider georgia in a religious light consider it as a shelter from the tyranny of bigots and enthusiasts and as a door of knowledge to the unenlightend barbarian as well in regard to those who fly from a false religion as those who are ignorant of the true thanks be to god we are not persecuted we are under no fear of axes faggots and an inquisition and all our easy task is to love mercy and walk humbly with our god if we do love mercy then here we may show it if we ourselves would walk humbly with our god let us give others an opportunity of doing so too persecution has already driven many thither who deserved a better fate it is remarked to the honor of the saltzburghers that they live together in the utmost harmony and happiness an amiable copy of the first ages of the world in godly love and mutual charity one toward another in that simplicity of life and manners so rarely to be met with in any age so very seldom in our own this is furely a state which kings might envy them they have reason to bless the hand which persecuted them and to look on their enemies who drove them to such an asylum as their best friends and benefactors  but what shall we say to the great advantages which may arise from spreading the gospeldoctrine among the neighboring indians can there be an employment worthier a good man an employment capable of imparting more pleasure and satisfaction to a right mind than that of cultivating and improving the human soul to soften and refine the manners to tame by gentle methods the wildness of the savage and humanize him into a social and benevolent being to be instruments in the hands of god of saving many souls from death to be the means of propagating our holy religion among those who have no knowledge of her laws that we may all become one flock under one shepherd this is surely a most noble and most desirable employment to this purpose some are set apart and to this every one as far as in him lies will it is hoped gladly contribute and if they are rightly taught and instructed by us if we sow unto them spiritual things we shall reap their temporal things they will think no labor too great no toil too irksome to reward those who have thus opened their minds and brought them from the darkness of paganism and idolatry to the knowledge of god and of his son jesus christ  surely if there were no other inducement this would be sufficient to prevent our growing weary the industry of rome in making proselytes has long been a reproach to us their warmth and resolution make our cold remissness still more inexcusable  it is too common among the potentates of the earth to establish colonies by force and violence to send out men with orders to seize on the first convenient spot and take possession of it after putting to death all the wretched inhabitants this we know has been done but georgia was not thus established no property was invaded no blood spilt we did not ravage or destroy for it the same methods which were made use of in the acquisition were also followed when we were settled in it and it was originally designed that there should be no such thing as slavery in georgia  to this end a general equality was proposed and acquiesced in every mans estate was limited and no one suffered by means of exorbitant power or greater extent of possessions to lord it over or insult his fellow laborers and brothers of the community  it was not therefore without great concern that the trustees found themselves under the necessity of introducing negroslaves into the colony but in this particular as in all others they have at the same time acted with the utmost prudence and humanity such regulations are already made as will greatly tend to promote the glory of god and the good of our country care has been taken to check the insolence of power to prevent all severe treatment all acts of violence or oppression that if these unhappy beings must eat the bread of slavery they shall at least eat it in peace and quiet that their chains may not gall them that their yoke may be easy and their burden light and that their masters shall as st paul says give unto their servants that which is just and equal knowing that they also have a master in heaven  to treat our fellow creatures those who partake of the same nature with us sons of one common lord and father as aliens and illegitimate to take advantage of any casual superiority either of bodily or mental powers to triumph over and insult them is surely unworthy of us as men and a disgrace to us as christians whilst on the other hand toenlarge and refine their souls to call them from a state of anarchy and confusion to order and harmony to the benefits of mutual converse and all the protected joys of society and above all to make them partakers with us of the joyful hope of another and better world this is an ambition worthy of us this has been your ambition may it be crowned with success  the negroes in georgia by your late orders will be made useful not dangerous subjects servants but not slaves dependent but not miserable beings and it is hoped an example so truly noble and praiseworthy will be followed by the rest of our colonies that they also will act with humanity and tenderness to all those who are in subjection under them that if we call them in to give us their labor we shall not grudge them in return knowledge and instruction that if they are forced to live among christians care will be taken that they may themselves in time become so that if we use their bodies for our support and happiness their souls may be refreshed and that for their service here to us we may bestow on them by our instructions the glorious opportunity of securing to themselves eternal happiness hereafter  let us not then be weary in welldoing  there is doubtless now more encouragement for all that are willing and ready to go there than there ever yet could be the way is become smooth and passable and every obstacle removed which could alarm the timid or terrify the bold the country rendered more healthful and more fertile friends ready to embrace and assist all who will visit them  whatever disappointment the colony may have met with whatever discouragements may have prejudiced it those to whose care it was committed are entirely blameless the honorable trustees have acted always with integrity and uprightness with the utmost care and assiduity and have done all that men could to support and encourage this good work and have the testimony withal of a good conscience to inform them that in this as in all other things when they have done what they can they have done what they ought but after all national undertakings a nation must support to the public therefore we must appeal for succor if we stand in need of it  now that god as the psalmist says has made peace within our borders and filled us with the flower of wheat now that the plougher plougheth in hope now that the harvest is ready to be gathered in now let the sun of beneficence shine forth upon it we have sowed in tears but we shall reap in joy we have as the apostle says been troubled on every side though perplexed we need not be in despair we have been persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed  we may say with the children of dan we have seen the land and behold it is very good be not slothful therefore to go and poss  unto a place that is secure wh  of any thing that is in the earth  georgia need not now be appren  frequent inroads of her spanish enemies  with redoubled ardour and industry pur  work the mulberrytree will flourish under  hand and the vine yield her fruits of increa and there shall be no noise and complaining in her streets nothing but a supply of able hands is wanting to establish a manufacture there which would be of the highest service to great britain as the produce is affirmed to be of at least equal value and goodness with that of any other country why should we be obliged to any of them or pay an exorbitant price for what we may so easily draw from ourselves unless we have indeed more riches than we know what to do with which i fear at present is not the case  let us not then faint for in due season we shall reap look upon the people now there i beseech you as young and tender plants whom ye took from a soil to them barren and desert and transplanted to a fairer and more fertile spot let them not after all your toil for want of moisture and nourishment at last wither and decay let us not like prodigals and spendthrifts lay the foundation only of so noble and magnificent a  goodly edifice and then  it for others to inhabit or  ourage our industry but let it not  miss or lull us into a fatal security  lot because we may not stand so much in  of georgia as a barrier neglect it as a pro but rather in peace be ready for war raise proper forts and bulwarks and while the waves are still and the sky serene prepare against a storm  let us hope that no jealousy or animosity of the neighboring colonies will hurt us but rather trust they will by kind offices repay that succor which they have received from this and in return for the support and defense which georgia has afforded them assist and patronize her to her their own safety and success has been greatly owing let us hope they will not be ungrateful  put not away therefore your confidence god my brethren will doubtless raise up friends to this as he does to every great and good work all that are friends to england to liberty and to virtue are our friends and georgia can have no enemies but the enemies of public spirit the foes of religion and of mankind may her manufactures and her subjects increase may her own works as the wise man says praise her in the gate may this truly great and glorious undertaking  day with fresh encouragement may  suggestions  it no coldness or  obstruct its succ may this infant  such it still is prove a pious an obedient  useful offspring and england be always  what it always has been a kind a tender  an indulgent parent may those to whose car is so greatly indebted be thanked for their bene and reap such reward of their integrity rghtness and truly christian zeal then hey dserve the praise of all good men here the recompense of a gracious and merciful god hereafter  may not only our own nation but all our friends reap the advantage of it may the whole world be benefitted by the progress of our mo holy religion which the establishment of  colony will we trust greatly promote man blessed spirit of that pious man now with  whose associates ye are look down with plea on your endeavors to render his glorious design effectual that the earth may be full of the knowledge of the lord that the religion of christ may be as extensive as was his goodness as is and ev will be his beneficence  thee lastly then o gracious and almighty god the source of all happiness the only giver of god  ee let us humbly address and beg  our labors grant us o lord thy  support thy arm  thy right  guide and direct us satisfy us with thy  and that soon give peace and joy and  these our days comfort us again after the  that thou have plagued us and for the years erein we have suffered adversity show these thy servants thy work and their children thy glor  the glorious majesty of the lord our god us prosper thou the work of our hands o  thou our handy work  now to god the father etc finis lately published in one volume
