an account of the ancient division of the english nation into hundreds and tithings the happy effects of that excellent institution  that it would be equally beneficial to all other nations and countries as well under monarchical as republican establishments  and that to the english nation in particular it would afford an effectual means of reforming the corruption of parliaments by rendering the representation of the people perfectly equal in exact numerical proportion to the total number of householders throughout the whole realm  intended as an appendix to several tracts on national defense etc  by granville sharp  london printed by galabin and baker ingramcourt fenchurchstreet mdcclxxxiv  the first division of this kingdom into hundreds and tithings was ordained by the virtuous and patriotic king alfred see mr lambards explication of words prefixed to his archaionomia on the word centuria who is expressly said to have therein followed the prudent council given by jethro to moses the  st establishment of this prudent advice of jethro i have examined more at large in my tract on the law of nature and principles of action in man p     to     wherein i have shown the right of the people to elect judges and officers civil as well as military religious officers and ministers excepted from the colonel or captain of a thousand who was also a justiciary down to the sergeant decurio or tithingman deuteronomy i     all which officers were elected and nominated by the people before they were invested with authority by moses this right of the people to elect judges and officers is clearly confirmed by a parallel text in the same book chap xvi     judges and officers shall thou make thee in all thy gates which the lord thy god gives thee throughout thy tribes and they shall judge the people with just judgment when this is rendered literally according to the original the popular right of election appears still more manifest  judges and officers shall thou give to thyself  which could no otherwise be than by a free election in all their gates i e the gates of their cities where the public courts were anciently held for the judges and officers to each tribe respectively  let us be truly thankful to god for the justice of his laws and let us pray that we may have grace to adopt them as far as the nature of our political establishments will legally permit let us for the honor of human nature imitate the glorious state of political liberty with which god was pleased to bless his people israel and in which he would most certainly have maintained them if they had persevered in the right faith and in due obedience to his laws but when men forsake god they unavoidably lose their liberty let no man conceive that the rights of election which i have proved by scripture were the rights only of a single nation the people of israel on the contrary let us remember that as all nations under the christian dispensation or rather all nations that are really christians are said to be engrafted on the israelitish olive tree and are thereby entitled to the name of israel so they are undoubtedly entitled likewise to all the immunities and privileges of redeemed israel for the only people perhaps that are judicially excluded from those national rights are the branches which were broken off from that good olive tree for their unbelief i e the jews themselves who are broken off indeed for a time a long time alas it has now been and are dispersed or strewed like dead branches separated from their proper root amongst all the nations of the earth thus universally exhibiting as it were a monumental proof of the scripture testimonies against that peculiar nation  but under the christian dispensation there is not only the same reason for claiming to the people the israelitish privilege of electing all temporal judges and officers but there are also unquestionable proofs that the elective rights of christian people are enlarged still farther to the choice of all their spiritual officers and ministers whereas even in israel all spiritual functions were hereditary and not elective  thus are the elective rights of christian people exceedingly enlarged and all persons who withhold or oppose these just rights ought to beware lest they be found at last amongst the enemies of the king of righteousness for it is remarkable that the great apostasy so long foretold in the christian church could not manifest itself in power until the unwearied encroachments and usurpations of popes emperors and kings had withdrawn from the church i e the congregation of clergy and people in each country or district that most essential right of all others the ancient usage of electing their own bishops see a long note on this subject beginning at p     of my tract on the law of retribution   for the more commodious government of the israelitish commonwealth it being indeed an institution thoroughly consistent with the most perfect state of liberty that human nature is capable of enjoying and yet competent nevertheless to fulfill all the necessary purposes of mutual defense the due execution of all just and equal laws and the sure maintenance of the public peace wonderful fruits of utility would this one council of alfred or rather of jethro produce to the commonwealth says the loyal mr lambard if we would no longer use the shadow but hold the substantial form of the true tithing mirabiles illud unum aluredi vel potius jethronis concilium allaturum reipublicae utilitatis fructus si verae decuriae solidam teneremus imaginem nec amplius

and si quando possent eum recuperare adducerent ad justitiam aut justitiae dicerent ubi esset   the chief and greatest security by which all men are sustained in the firmest state viz that every one unusquisque should establish himself under the security of a covenant or suretyship which the english call freoborhges i e free pledges but the yorkshiremen alone call tienmannatela which expressed in the latin tongue is december hominum numerum the number of  0 men this security was constituted in the following manner viz that all persons universi of all the towns of the whole kingdom ought to be under a decenal suretyship so that if one of the ten should forfeit viz forfeit his freepledge  i e his credit in that little community as an honest and legal member of it probus et legalis see magna charta by which estimation alone his neighbors could so far confide in him as to admit him into their tithing and had a right to expect from him a return of mutual security the nine should have him to trial of right or indict him but if he should abscond a term in law of    days should be allowed him being sought in the mean while and found he should be brought to the kings judgment i e to judgment or justice in the kings courts and there out of his own property should make good whatever damage he had done and if to this he had forfeited or failed justice should be done of his body but if within the aforesaid term he could not be found the chief or head for in every freeborough or tithing there was one chief whom they called freeborough head freoborges heofod i e headborough or tithingman should take   of the better sort of people of his freeborough and also out of the   nearest freeboroughs he should take of each one chief and   of the better sort of people if he can have them and so the    being convened he shall clear himself and his freeborough if he can do it of the forfeiture and slight of the aforesaid malefactor which if he could not do he with his freeborough should restore the loss out of the property of the malefactor as long as any should remain failing which he should complete the restitution out of his own and that of his freeborough and should satisfy justice according to what should be to them lawfully adjudged etc thus all the honest inhabitants of every vicinage being answerable in their own private fortunes and property for all the damages and depredations of robbers housebreakers and other lawless sons of violence committed within their own respective districts would of course be stimulated by the urgent spur of private interest to yield up a small portion of their leisure to the necessary exercise of arms and training for their mutual defense against every act of violence and injustice and on this ancient provision of the common law was apparently founded the legality of levying taxes on the inhabitants of london and middlesex to make good the damages occasioned by the alarming riots in the year    0 we ought therefore by no means to repine at the late judgment of the courts whereby the riottax to make good the damages was deemed legal even before the act was made for levying it but on the contrary to promote as much as possible a still more effectual and complete revival of that most excellent institution of the common law that it may be constantly and regularly enforced even in less and more ordinary cases of robbery housebreaking etc for the immediate recovery of all damages and losses by any act of violence whatsoever the value of the damages should be levied on ten housekeepers that are the nearest inhabitants to the spot where the violence or robbery was committed and if the  0 nearest housekeepers should not be able to made good the damage then  0 times  0 of the nearest housekeepers or the hundred ought to be assessed and so on if necessary to the whole county for such was the ancient usage by the common law for the damage whereby all housekeepers would be prompted by their own private interest to associate in arms with their respective neighbors to suppress every act of unjust violence and to maintain the public peace  in the variousaccounts of these ancient freeboroughs or tithings they are sometimes mentioned as consisting only of ten men at other times as consisting of ten men and their families  they be commonly named tithings because they contain as i told you the number of ten men with their families lambards duties of constables p   this frankpledge says lord coke consisted most commonly of ten households etc   inst p     and therefore as all males from    to  0 years of age are required by law to have arms and to be duly exercised therein which in a former tract i have already proved the number of males in a tithing of the latter description would amount to about thirty the proper number for a platoon if the average rate of   males to a family might be supposed a just estimation including sons lodgers apprentices journeymen porters and servants though this must vary in different neighbourhoods according to the nature of the trades and occupations carried on therein as some employ many hands and others but very few  archbishops bishops earls barons and other great men having their own proper officers sergeants esquires butlers confectioners bakers etc see the    law of king edward were supposed to have each a freeborough within their own households and were therefore not included in the ordinary tithings  because they were a sufficient assurance for themselves and for their menial servants no less than the ten were one for another in the ordinary dozeins  see cowells interpreter on the word friburgh this due exemption of the great men from the obligation of entering into the ordinary decenaries i wish to be particularly noticed because it may prevent the opposition of some highminded persons who would think themselves degraded perhaps by an universal establishment of the tithings on the quotation last made from dr cowell it is necessary to remark that the word dozeins is manifestly used for decenns or decenna and so also very frequently by other law writers but i cannot find that these legal societies or associations of neighbors ever consisted of dozeins or dozens in the ordinary sense of that term though they are so very frequently called dozeins merely i presume by corruption of speech so that the etymology of the english word dozen is not from duodecim as one would naturally suppose from the modern application of the word but from decenna and dizaine the latin and french appellations of the tithings which were regularly decenaries consisting of ten men or rather ten men and their families as i have before remarked but in the revival of decenaries which i wish to promote the number of persons in each freeborough or decenary whether it shall consist of ten housekeepers with their families and servants or only of ten men must be determined by the votes of the inhabitants themselves in every neighborhood at their several general meetings folkmotes or wardmotes because the service must be perfectly voluntary for though the arrangement of the people into decenary companies was actually ordained by the ancient laws of this realm and was and i trust still is required by the common law for the whole kingdom yet one of the most eminent common law writers of his time mr wm lambard mentions the formation of these decenary companies as being the free act of the people themselves in every neighborhood for according to him the ancient usage was that all free borne men should cast themselves into several companies by ten in each company etc duties of constables etc p   and our ancestors could not have had any more urgent inducement to render this service voluntary than what the present generation actually feels viz the necessity of selfdefence against rioters thieves robbers and housebreakers for mr lambard informs us just before in the same page that it was ordained for the more sure keeping of the peace and for the better repressing of thieves and robbers that all freeborn men should cast themselves into several companies etc so that the reason of this law on which the force of it should depend does not only still subsist but is certainly as forcible and urgent as ever it was and though this excellent custom was become almost obsolete through neglect and disuse so long ago as the reign of queen elizabeth yet even then it was still considered as a legal institution required by the common law and the renewal of it was recommended as easy and most efficacious for the maintenance of the public peace whereof says the learned lambard speaking of the ancient office of borsholders tithingmen etc there is yet some show or remnant in our leets or law days but if the very substance thereof were thoroughly performed as i know no let says that learned man and surely no let has since been ordained but that by law it may then should the peace of the land be much better maintained duties of constables etc p   there is no doubt but the effects would be as happy and beneficial as when the tithings were first established by alfred for all the old historians agree that an entire stop to all robbery and violence was immediately effected by this regulation  in the chronicon of john brompton we are informed that although laws in times of war are silent yet king alfred in the midst of the clashing of arms made laws and instituted the centuries which they call hundreds and the decenaries which they call trithings he should have said tithings maintained peace amongst his own subjects and chastized robbers in such sort that he commanded golden bracelets to be hung up in the roads divided into   ways which might brave the avidity of passengers whilst there was none who durst snatch them away see twisdens hist anglicanae scriptores antiqui p      et licet inter arma leges sileant ipse tamen aluredus rex inter fremitus armorum leges tulit et centurias quas hundredas dicunt et decurias quas trithingas plainly an error for tithingas vocant instituit pacem inter suos custodivit et latrones in tantum castigavit quod in semitis quae per quadrivium finduntur armillas aureas jussit suspendi quae viantium aviditatem arriderent dum non essent qui eas arriperent   and speed also tells us from william of malmsbury that his kingdom he alfred likewise divided into shires hundreds and tithings for the better ordering and administering of justice and for the abandoning of thieves which had formerly increased by the means the very cause which at present exists of long wars whereby notwithstanding the multitude of soldiers continually employed it is reported that a virgin might travail alone in his days through all his dominions without any violence offered and that bracelets of gold were hanged in the high ways and no man so hardy as to take them away p      the ten householders or masters of families from whose precise number of ten the numerical appellations of decenaries tithings and dozeins are manifestly derived were themselves also individually distinguished by the title of deciners from the youths journeymen lodgers and servants that were included and respectively pledged by the householders in the several decenaries  a right understanding and due application of the term deciner being necessary as i conceive toward the promotion of a great national object at present the necessary reformation of popular representation in parliament i hope my readers will not think it too tedious to attend a little to the investigation of the word that we may clear it from the indiscriminate use which some lawwriters have made of it the circuit thereof says dr cowel in his interpreter speaking of frankpledge was called decenna because it commonly consisted of ten households and every particular person thus mutually bound for himself and his neighbors was called decennier more commonly i believe decener and afterward by corruption dozener because he was of one decenna or other  but this reason is not sufficiently accurate  the youths servants etc were all of one decenna or other yet were they not decenners though they were also mutually bound by oath for their good behavior in their respective decenaries but those men only were properly deciners who were more immediately responsible for all the rest by being the masters of the several families viz only the ten householders in every tithing who paid scot and lot and were answerable for the payment of all national as well as provincial and parochial burdens these only were the men who had a judicial capacity and were called altogether by the chief freeborg or headborough on all occasions to consult and determine on every question or extraordinary business within the extent of their division all the individuals of the division indeed were suitors in the tithing court and might there be present as all courts were open and amenable thereto for offenses for the decenna or tithing courts however insignificant so confined a jurisdiction as a tithing may appear were of admirable use in promoting justice and deciding differences and quarrels amongst neighbors the learned author of the notes on fortescue folio edit in      p  0  speaking of the court of the freeborough or tithing adds wherein says he the tithingman or headborough was the judge and indeed they are entitled in the laws of the confessor justiciarii justices for such was their jurisdiction and office within their tithing it is necessary however for the proper understanding of the chapter wherein this is mentioned to be previously informed that the latin noun friborgus of the masculine gender does not properly signify a freeborough tithing or association of ten men but rather one individual freeborgess of that society but when the society or association itself is to be collectively understood the word is generally though not always as there is an example at the latter end of this very law in question wherein friborgos in all the copies is expressed instead of the accusative plural of the neuter noun friborga though the subject manifestly relates to three friburgs or societies and not to three individual freeburgesses expressed in the neuter gender  friborgum  as dr cowel rightly expresses in his interpreter on the word froborgh alias fridburgh etc  it is also manifest by the explanation of titles given by the learned lambard that nine persons of the tithing were entitled freoborh atque hinc novem illi quidem freoborh id est ingenui fidejussores dicebantur nos in titulis curiarum francos plegios appellamus decimus ille teothungmon id est decurio dictus est quo nomine hac nostra est tempestate occidentalibus anglis notissimus eum alii tienheofod alii freoborhesheofod id est vadem primarium et praecipuum nuncupabant lambard on the word centuria that is freesureties whom we says mr lambard call frank pledges and that the tenth man was called teothungmon that is decurio or tithingman and that  others called him tienheofod head of ten and others again freoborhes heofod freeburgesshead or chiefpledge a comparison of these terms with the terms mentioned in the old laws of st edward no  0 and    and the relation these terms bear respectively to each other will clearly demonstrate that the justitiarios super quosque december friborgos therein mentioned were no other than tithingmen the heads or chiefs of each decenary who in latin were called decani or deans  and that the decemfriborgos   d law of st edward de centurionibus et capitalibus friborgis  cum autem contingeret quod quidam stulti et improbi gratis et nimis consuete erga vicinos suos forisfacerent caeperunt sapientes ad invicem super hoc habere consilium et statuerunt justiciarios super quosque december friborgos quos decanos possumus appellare anglice vero tienheofod dicti sunt   decemvir caput de december etc   mentioned in that sentence do not signify  ten tithings or boroughs in their collective capacity which would amount to a hundredcourt but only ten individuals the ten householders or deceners of the tithing each of whom mr lambard calls freoborh or freeburgess this being understood we may safely proceed to speak of the authority of the tithingmen in their respective divisions  these a continuation of the   d law of  st edward beginning from the end of the last quotation of it  isti inter villas and vicinos causas tractabant and secundum forisfacturas emendationes capiebant and concordationes faciebant videlicet de pascuis pratis messibus and de litigationibus inter vicinos and innumerabilibus huiusmodi decertationibus que humanam fragilitatem infestant and eam incessanter oppugnant cum autem causae majores erumpebant referebantur ad superiores eorum justiciarios quos supradicti sapientes super eos constituerant scilicet super december decanos quos possumus dicere centuriones vel centenarios eo quod super centum friborgos judicabunt according to the saxon laws collected by king edward the confessor tried causes among the villages and neighbors and according to conviction or forfeiture on trial took satisfaction or damages and settled agreements concerning pastures meadows harvests as also litigations between neighbors and innumerable such like disputes which infest the weakness of human nature and continually annoy it but when causes of more consequence occurred they were referred to their superior justiciaries whom the wise men or national council had appointed over them that is over ten deans or chiefs of tens whom we may call  centurions or centenarii hundreders because they had jurisdiction over an hundred friborgs i e an hundred freeburgesses or deciners  thus it is manifest that the hundreders or high constables were also justiciaries so that every hundred householders throughout the kingdom had a complete establishment of civil officers i e a high constable and ten constables all of whom were justiciaries within their respective jurisdictions to preserve the peace and settle differences amongst themselves and their respective families and though each or all of these officers sat as judges or precidents in their respective courts yet their power was duly limited by the opinion and determination of the householders or deciners from whom the juries the real judges of the causes were regularly chosen and still are to this day in most cities and trading towns as in london without regard to any other qualification than that of their being housekeepers of the vicinage indifferent to the parties of unblameable character and sufficient substance not to be suspected of undue bias or as it is expressed in an old form  such as be next neighbors most sufficient and least suspicious and in the act of    edward i there is an express clause reserving the ancient rights of juries to cities and burghs and mr hawkins on mentioning this and another statute   west remarks thereupon  that neither by common law nor by these statutes there was any necessity in proceedings before justices in air etc that petit jurors should be freeholders and if so says he it seems probable that there is no greater necessity that grand jurors making an enquiry before them should be freeholders and if a grand juror before such justices need not be a freeholder why should there be a greater necessity that a grand juror before other justices should be a freeholder etc pleas of the crown  d book chap    p     and he repeats this doctrine in chap    sect    that at the common law there was no necessity that jurors should have any freehold as to inquests before justices in air or in cities or burghs etc whereby the judicial capacity of the housekeepers or deciners without any qualification as landholders is i trust sufficiently established we are misled also in the sense of the word deciner when it is applied as by the learned cowell in a peculiar manner to the chief or head of a tithing  it signifies says he in the ancient monuments of the law such as were wont to have the oversight and check of ten fribourgs for the maintenance of the kings peace but the chief of the ten as i have already shown had his proper titles of headborough and tithingman and though each chief was always a deciner as being himself one of the ten incorporated householders yet he had no peculiar title of deciner any otherwise than being the chief of the deciners in his division the youths and others that were not householders were pledged by the deciners as appears by briton cap     volons nous que trestous ceux de xiv ans desouthe nous facent le serement etc  et velons que toutz soient en dizeyne et pleuys par descyners sauve gentz de religion clers et chevaliers et leur fitz eynes et femes  we will that all those which are fourteen years old shall make oath to us etc and that all shall be in tithings and pledged by deciners etc the law could not mean that all should be pledged by the respective headboroughs alone but certainly by the ten householders of each decenary and dr cowell himself also in the latter part of that article says  that decennier is not now used for the chief man of a dozen but for him that is sworn to the kings peace neither in this is he sufficiently accurate for the being sworn to the kings peace did not constitute a decener in the proper sense of the word though it included the person sworn in the jurisdiction of a decenary  the title of deciner could not properly belong to any but the ten householders themselves from whose number his division was formerly called tienmantale id est says mr lambard decemvirale collegium  a society of ten men nine of these as mr lambard declares were called freoborh free burgess i e free pledges and the tenth was called teothungmon tithingman i e decurio now it seems the office and title of decurio was used in britain long before the saxon kings by the romans as well in their civil as their military establishments and the learned author of the notes on the folio edition of fortescues excellent tract de laudibus legum angliae observes in p     that the romans had their laws in such parts of this land as they had their most civil government in i mean says he in colonies hither deduced for every colony was but an image of the mother city with like holy rites like courts laws etc and for the most part with duumviri instead of consuls and aediles and decuriones in lieu of a senate and it is clear says he that diverse colonies from rome were in britain as at camelodunum now malden in essex etc  the consideration of this circumstance enables us to propose a much more probable etymology of the english word denizen than what is generally assigned lord coke supposes it from deins nee born within and also from donaison because the freedom is given by the king but a learned writer davies asserts that denizen is a british law term which the saxons and angles found here and retained it could not therefore be derived from the french tongue before that modern language was known or even formed  neither is the welsh etymology of it at all satisfactory because it seems very uncouth and not sufficiently similar in sound to the word but if we derive the word immediately from the latin it will appear most natural and easy both in sound and sense for the word deni being derived a december pro deceni is a proper adjective expressive of its relation to the number of ten persons in a decenary and as the romans had their decuriones and consequently decenaries also a proper latin verb to express the initiation or introduction of a person to the privileges and franchises of a decenary is very naturally formed from the word deni viz denizo which verb and its derivatives are frequently used by our lawwriters when they speak of the admission of aliens to the franchises of the native inhabitants and the said franchises being maintained in ancient times by mutual frankpledge in the several decenaries it is obvious that the participle denizatus which frequently occurs and the derived nounsubstantive denizatio are applied in such cases in their proper latin sense though the lawwriters who used them have overlooked that most obvious etymology which is confirmed by the sound as well as the true latin sense of those terms  lord coke says denizen is taken for an alien born that is infranchised or denizated by letters patent whereby the king does grant unto him that in all things he should be reputed esteemed held and governed as our liege subject sprung up from his ancestors within our said kingdom of england and not otherwise nor in any other manner and he cites dier in the same page   inst lib   p     respecting this ligeance of denizens ligentia domino regi debita etc data est aut per denizationem aut per naturalizationem  when foreigners therefore were admitted to the privileges and franchises of englishmen they became the kings liege subjects  esse ad fidem regi angliae and were of course denizated or admitted to be members of some decenary and would be sworn to their ligeance in common with other subjects in the court of frankpledge and if the denizated stranger rented a house and paid scot and lot and other rates he became a frioborh or freeburgess having a right to vote for representatives in the national council so that lord coke was certainly right in using the terms infranchised and denizatus as synonymous for the renting of a house at a certain rent by the year is the ancient legal description of burgage tenure it is called burgh says sir edward coke because it sends burgesses to parliament and though this is not the proper derivation of the word it is certainly the usage of borough and as well as the right of all burgesses  they that have tenements says littleton within the borough or burgh hold of the king their tenements and every tenant for his tenement ought to pay to the king a certain rent by the year    inst lib   c  0 sect     the next section declares the same doctrine concerning those who rent of any other lord and the same manner is where another lord spiritual or temporal is lord of such a borough and the tenants of the tenements in such a borough hold of their lord to pay each of them yearly an annual rent sect     and it is called tenure in burgage says littleton for that the tenements within the borough be holden of the lord of the borough by certain rent etc and it is to wit that the ancient towns called burroughes be the most ancient towns that be in england for the towns that now be cities or counties in old time were boroughes and called boroughes for of such old towns called boroughes came the burgesses of the parliament when the king has summoned his parliament sect      now this description of paying an annual rent or holding tenements by certain rent by the year is the proper distinction of a tenant in burgage from a tenant at will because the latter has no certain nor sure estate says littleton for the lessor may put him out at what time it pleases him lib   c viii    but very different is the case of tenants for years as littleton remarks in the same chapter otherwise it is if tenant for years which knows the end of his term does sow the land etc ibid  and those persons who agree with the owners of their houses at a certain rent howsoever small for any fixed time if it be but for half a year or even for a quarter of a year are nevertheless to be esteemed in law as tenants for years  quod tenent ad terminum annorum lib   c   sect    for they enjoy a free and certain possession to the end of the agreed term so that their tenure is perfectly free and they have sometimes been entitled liberi tenentes and freeholders in contradistinction to tenants in villanage though they are indeed freholders in a very different sense from the common acceptance of the term freeholder now applied only to those who are properly land owners which would therefore be a less equivocal title for them the others being also freeholders or free tenants though in a less durable tenure but their ancient indisputable right of sending burgesses to parliament proves their freedom as members of the community in the borough of southwark and many others to this day the renters of tenements or housekeepers in general paying scot and lot are the electors of the deputies to parliament so that the doctrine is unquestionable and in the city of westminster and several other ancient cities the same right by burgage tenure of voting for representatives prevails to this day because all cities were originally deemed boroughs as being the habitations of freoborges or free pledges i e the associated householders who were mutually pledged to maintain the public peace and defend and support the due execution of the laws and if the right of voting were fully restored throughout the kingdom to all householders or masters of families who principally support the burdens of the state even if the franchise should descend no lower it would be amply sufficient i trust to destroy the present deplorable corruption in the representation or rather the misrepresentation of the commons and to restore the ancient dignity and freedom of parliament especially if all the said householders were duly incorporated as deciners or freeborhes in their respective neighbourhoods  for then the number of deciners or freeholders in each county would be regularly known howsoever much the numbers of other males in the several tithings might vary and the advantage of this regularity of numbers would not only be the effecting a proportionable regularity of manners but it would also greatly facilitate the much wishedfor measure of a more equal representation of the people nay the representation may be made not only more equal but most equal or perfectly equal if all deciners in each county were allowed to vote as unquestionably in justice and constitutional right they ought to do for the junction of ten equal hundreds of deciners into one associated body would form the court of the thousand well known in the israelitish commonwealth which considered as a proportionable division of a county perfectly regular in numerical order both of officers and other deciners would much facilitate the conducting and ordering of public business and two such divisions of a thousand deciners each would be a proper number to send one deputy to parliament according to the present population of the kingdom so as not to exceed but rather diminish the present number of representatives thus a most equal representation of all the families in the kingdom would be obtained and two thousand families one with another might well afford to pay ample wages to one representative and the stipend might be very easily collected if the decenaries were duly formed and established and the several courts which regularly arise from the decenaries viz the hundred courts and also the courts of one thousand families each above proposed and lastly the junction of two such courts of the thousand for the election of one representative in the great common council of the realm the people of whatever parties or separate interests might go up altogether with their separate tithings or by their hundreds to the poll books in like manner as the ancient romans voted by their centuries by which means order would be preserved and no persons would be permitted to vote but those that were known to dwell and reside in the place or county where the election is made according to an ancient rule of the constitution eligantur in quolibet comitatu per homines in eodem comitatu commorantes et residentes see my tract on equitable representation etc p    and    and also an act of parliament there quoted which is still in force   hen v c   it is therefore an act of gross corruption utterly repugnant to the ancient constitution of the kingdom to bear the traveling charges of voters who dwell in distant places for such ought not to be permitted to vote at all except on the spot where they reside by which not only much expense would be saved to the candidates but also much immorality debauchery and tumult against the public peace at elections extract respecting bribery at elections from a representation of the injustice and dangerous tendency of tolerating slavery in england printed in      p    to     but how is he a negro claimed by a slaveholder as private property to be divested of his human nature or of his just right to the kings protection  a man may indeed be said to be divested of his humanity  st in a moral sense by his own action in stooping to any kind of baseness beneath the dignity of a man and  dly by the execution of the laws in punishment of some particular kinds of baseness for which a man may lawfully be divested of his humanity by a civil death that is may be disabled to hold any office or franchise etc as if such person was naturally dead this is one of the penalties expressed in a statute   geo ii chapter    against bribery and corruption in parliamentary elections whereby not less the briber than the bribed whether the offense be committed by himself or any person employed by him is subjected to the divesture abovementioned but the vilest and most ignorant negro slaves are not so inhumanly base and degenerate as these timeservers who offend against god the king their friends and fellow subjects themselves and all their unhappy posterity even the children that are unborn they are enemies to the state infinitely more to be dreaded than the most puissant foreign power at open war  no shuffling arts or equivocations whatsoever can lighten this monstrous load of guilt for which the offenders must one day most certainly be called to account notwithstanding that they may have escaped the penalties of this english statute for indeed it is merely the penalties or execution of the said statute which they escape and not the guilt of breaking it because the same is so warily drawn up that there is not the least room for mental reservation  a very large proportion of the freeholders in this kingdom it is to be feared are involved in this horrid guilt nay every elector who has but even eaten or drunk at the expense of another during the time of an election is likewise in some measure guilty though charity will incline us to suppose that their offense is for the most part occasioned by ignorance rather than wilful corruption for not only money but also any gift office employment or other reward whatsoever is forbid by the said act now this prohibition must necessarily include meat and drink since these articles cannot be considered below the estimation of a reward because they are expressly prohibited by a preceding act still in force viz   w iii chapter   whereby those candidates who shall directly or indirectly give present or allow to any person or persons having voice or vote in such election any money meat drink entertainment or provision etc are rendered incapable though elected to act sit or have any vote or place in parliament etc happy would it be for england if this salutary law could be strictly enforced bribes in money places etc are not productive of half so much evil as the debaucheries of election entertainments because the pernicious effects of the latter are so permanent that they may fairly be said to be transmitted from election to election the gross immorality as well as the deplorable idleness and poverty all forerunners of slavery which too much prevail in many parts of this kingdom ought i sincerely believe to be principally attributed to the unlawful practice of opening houses for public entertainment at elections and we cannot hope that this dangerous evil will ever be corrected unless the wisdom of the legislature shall hereafter think fit to oblige every candidate as soon as he declares himself such to promise upon oath that he will strictly observe every article of the last mentioned act against treating electors this long digression from the subject of negro slaves the author hopes may be pardoned especially if the reader will please to consider that civil and political slavery as well as slavery to sensual appetites are so very nearly connected with each other in their nature and effects that it is no very considerable transition from the present point to speak of them together but the case of this poor negro is very different if he is a slave yet it was not with his own consent that he was made so he neither sold himself nor has he betrayed others and cannot therefore be liable to such severe penalties he has not been guilty of any offenses that i know of for which he might lawfully like corrupt and venal voters who accept of money meat or drink at elections be divested of his humanity and therefore it must certainly be allowed that he differs from a horse or a dog in this very essential point viz his humanity   would be prevented  the number of houses in england and wales in the year      fell short of a million as the reader may see by a much better authority than mine is that of the very able and ingenious calculator dr price see  observations on the population of england and wales p    total of houses charged chargeable and excused in        0      in             but for the sake of a round number let it however says dr price be stated at a million p    the number of deciners or householders we may therefore also state at one million for the character of householder without farther distinction happily includes all persons of every rank and denomination that ought in strict justice and ancient prescription of constitutional right to elect and send their own representatives to parliament whether as knights citizens or burgesses  the million of householders would form exactly one thousand divisions of one thousand householders each viz  000 courts of the thousand which i have before recommended from ancient example and the junction of two such courts of the thousand for the election of one member of parliament as before proposed would form  00 courts of two thousand householders each which would elect five hundred representatives for south britain a proportion sufficiently near to the number     at present elected for that part of the kingdom because a reduction in number would perhaps be more beneficial than otherwise for certain it is that the ancient parliaments were not near so numerous as at present even without reckoning the deputies from north britain  this plan would indeed occasion some variation in modes and forms but no real innovation with respect to the national constitution because the right of election would still be vested where it ought viz in all the free householders or freoborges of all the counties and that in the most perfect proportion of equality that can be desired which ought surely to recommend the proposal if equal representation is at all a worthy object  if justice and right are to be preferred to their opposite extremes inequity or iniquity and tort which have too long prevailed  or lastly if we have honesty or humanity enough left amongst us in the fear of god to reject the evil and choose the good i e to exercise that only faculty which materially distinguishes men from brutes  should we ever be so happy as to see the true divisions of tithings and hundreds reestablished in this realm and the just reformation of parliament as here proposed to be effected by them actually take place by the establishment of equal representation numerically exact which it really may be if we have but common honesty enough amongst us to desire and promote it there will be an admirable harmony in the several gradations and proportions of public officers or magistrates over the commons of england and wales according to the present supposed state of population viz  deciners or householders paying scot and lot and mutually pledging each other and their respective families and servants to the common peace and common desence  000000 tithingmen or captains of tens the elected heads of every ten deciners being constables by the common law  00000 hundreders the elected chiefs of every ten tithings being highconstables and justiciaries or justices by the common law  0000 chiliarchs or colonels the elected chiefs of thousands being not only civil magistrates or justices but also the kings military lieutenants in their districts  000 senators or representatives in parliament elected every year once and more often if need be in  00 courts of  000 deciners each  00 but the facility of equalizing and thereby reforming the representation of the people in the great national council is not the only benefit that might be obtained by restoring the ancient mode of government by tithings hundreds etc  in all these various divisions of the people regular courts were anciently held for the maintenance of peace and right and for adjusting all differences amongst neighbors without expense for there was no cause or contest of such magnitude and importance for which a popular court of proportionable dignity could not be found in the larger divisions of wappentakes trithings and shires to adjust and determine it whereby tedious and vexatious lawsuits and the ruinous expenses attending them were happily avoided in like manner the general assemblies or congregations held in the gates of the israelites while under the theocracy were esteemed courts for justice and judgment wherein presided judges and officers that were freely elected by the inhabitants of each city or district as i have elsewhere shown see p    and the same reasonable mode of settling private differences by the congregation or church was not unknown even among heathen nations the people of ephesus it seems retained this salutary constitution of popular liberty even when under the yoke of the roman beast and had a power of holding popular assemblies called ecclesia or church for resolving difficult questions and disputes between individuals besides the ordinary courts of justice under the roman deputies for common offenses this appears by the speech of the town clerk of ephesus recorded in acts xix      who after he had appeased the tumult and confusion of the people that had hastily run together without notice or summons to specify the cause of assembling he said  ye have brought hither these men meaning two of pauls companions whom they had seized which are neither robbers of churches nor yet blasphemers of your goddess wherefore if demetrius and the craftsmen which are with him have a matter against any man the law is open or rather  the courtdays are held and there are deputies let them implead one another but if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters it shall be determined in a lawful assembly  in a lawful ecclesia ie in a congregation convocated or called together in due form and order by the proper officers this having been neglected in the then last hasty and tumultuous assembling of the people which occasioned the ephesian townclerks harangue so perfectly unexceptionable is this mode of determining private quarrels and contests without expense by a popular assembly that it seems clearly to be pointed out for the practice of christians in the commands even of our lord himself on the case of a trespassing brother mat xviii      go and tell him his fault said our lord between thee and him alone if he shall hear thee thou have gained thy brother but if he will not hear take with thee one or two more etc  and if he shall neglect to hear them    tell unto the church not unto the prelate of the church as popish writers contend therein grossly perverting so deluded and unguarded has the roman church been in her apostasy that a very learned jesuit cornelius a lapide was not ashamed to suppose various causes wherein this order of redress commanded in this text  might be omitted or inverted he might as well have said at once perverted  porro varias ob causas hic ordo omitti vel inverti potest ac suhinde debet ut is qui peccavit statim deferatur ad superiorem etc which being no part of the order enjoined by christ is a manifest perversion of the command a glaring attempt to render the word of god of none effect by vain traditions for which he had no better authority than a bare reference to some of his own order one salmeron etc the divine command by their vain traditions but  unto the congregation including the laity as well as clergy and the apostle paul reproved the corinthians for carrying their contests about worldly matters  things pertaining to this life before the established imperial courts of justice where unbelievers presided which contests ought to have been judged amongst themselves by the congregation of christian brethren   cor vi    but after the general establishment of christianity in this or any other nation the several popular courts of the tithings or hundreds or thousands or counties duly convened are the proper congregations of christian brethren for every neighborhood and in ancient times all those courts where the sheriffs held their tourns or rotulary visitations took cognizance not only of  worldly matters but also more especially of ecclesiastical cases as being the first agantur itaque primo debita verae christianitatis jura secundo regis placita postremo causae singulorum dignis satisfactionibus expleantur   inst p   0 or most important objects of their attention for thus the order of cases falling under their cognizance is stated as lord coke informs us   inst p     and   0 in the redbook inter leges h i cap   de generalibus placitis comitatuum ie says he  as well of the tourn beforementioned as of the county courts viz  let the due laws of true christianity be first discussed secondly the pleas of the king lastly let the causes of individuals be dispatched with suitable redress or satisfactions  the bishops sir edward coke by a citation from the red book in the custody of the kings remembrancer composed in the time of henry i proves that the bishops were then required to be present in popular courts of common law he refers us to the  th chap de generalibus placitis comitatuum which he interprets as well of the tourn as of the county court sicut antiqua fuerit institutione firmatum salutari regis imperio vera nuper est recordantione firmatum generalia

miseros laceratione confiniant agantur itaque primo debita verae christianitatis jura secundo regis placita postremo causae singulorum dignis satisfactionibus expleantur  whereupon they conclude says sir e coke that ecclesiastical causes were handled in the tourn in the reign of henry i long after the said supposed charter a charter to extend the tyrannical papal authority which was not enrolled till the second richard ii being never heard of before though pretended by the forgers of it to have been granted by william the conqueror and certain it is continues sir e coke that the bishops consistories were erected and the causes ecclesiastical removed from the tourn to the consistory after the making of the said red book ideo penes lectorem sit judicium   inst c    p  00 as well as the earls lordlieutenants sheriffs hundreders aldermen mayors magistrates etc presided in these ancient courts of the congregation whereby they were enabled to enforce the said due laws of true christianity against all offenders whether clergy or laity through the united power of the congregation which regularly assembled at certain fixed places and at stated times viz in the reign of henry i the county court was assembled twice and the hundreds and wapentachs twelve times in a year  debet enim shiresgemot his hundreda et wapentachia duodecies in anno congregari   inst c    p   0 these courts in their different degrees of importance proportionable to the magnitude of all questions to be discussed were the proper courts of the congregation to decide according to the due laws of true christianity beforementioned the united power of many being sufficiently effectual to resist and humble the most audacious individuals howsoever great and opulent whereas at present the most barefaced enormities of immorality and irreligion are beyond the reach of ecclesiastical correction the episcopal authority and more especially that which ought to restrain the laity being reduced almost to nothing through the fallacious enervating innovations and usurpations of the antichristian church of rome the grand enemy the inimical spirit of popery against the true christian episcopacy began very early to be manifested for the apostasy could not generally take place as i have before remarked until the clergy and people were deprived of their ancient right of electing their own bishops so that a violent usurpation of that right must of course be found amongst the first innovations of antichrist a remarkable instance of it by pope gregory the first in the year     i find recorded even by a popish abbot who appeals to gregorys own epistles and decretals for the truth of it so that the apostasy was certainly at that time begun for though gregory himself is too commonly esteemed a good primitive bishop yet his church had then for several years back received the brand mark of the growing apostasy by permitting their bishops to revive the wounded head of roman power by assuming the pagan title of pontifex maximus which the emperors of rome alone had exclusively held from the time of julius caesar down at least to valentinian the third to whom it may be traced if not to augustulus till it became extinct or dead with the power of the last emperor of the western branch so that pontifex maximus was manifestly the head that was as it were wounded to death by a sword  viz the sword of odoacer who then took possession of the seat of the dragon and set up an independent kingdom in rome itself without the peculiar title of unlimited roman dominion so that afterward when the bishops of rome by assuming that title did actually revive that blasphemous head his deadly wound was healed and all the world wondered after the beast and well might they wonder because the title of pontifex maximus is not less foreign to the primitive church of christ than it had been peculiar to the head of the roman idolatrous augurs on account of a ridiculous and strange kind of ceremony in the inauguration of the elected pontiff la consecratione di questo pontefice e tanto ridicula et strana che ella merita dessere tutta interamente dimostrata nel medesimo modo che lha scritta prudentio il quale dice che questo ponteficz nel suo habito pontificale con la mitera and it was a mitre of the same shape as those worn by the modern pontifs except that it was not then marked with the ominous insignia of three crowns and the spike at the top as represented in a coin of augustus caesar was not yet converted into a cross in testa et la vest alzata entravia in una fossa supra la quale era un ponte di legno tutto buccato so that the name of pontifex is manifestly derived from this wooden pons or bridge bored full of holes dove dal vittimario era condotto un toro ornato tutto di fiori et doro intorno al capo che il detro conduttore feriva nel petto et del sangue cosi caldo che nusciva et trapelava per i buscbi del ponte cra il detto pontefice tutto imbrattato confregarse ne gl occhi glorecchi le labia et la bocca et cosi uscendo fuora cosi sporcho et brutto et molto terribile a riguardare era da tutto il populo salutato et adorato etc discorso della religione de glantichi romani composto in franzese dal s guglielmo choul  et tradotto in toscano da m gabriel simeoni fiorentino in lione      p     whom they placed in his pontifical robes under a wooden pons or bridge built for that purpose over a dry ditch and bored full of holes that the blood of the victim a bull sacrificed to jupiter on the top of the bridge might fall through the holes upon the head and robes of the pontiff whereby that vicar of satan on earth was rendered terrible to behold that he might be saluted most probably on the feet  and adored by the people whereby the ancient pagan pontifs were notable types as well of the bloody roman emperors who afterward usurped to themselves the pontifical dignity and office and were likewise adored and deified as of the still more bloody though adored ecclesiastical apostates who under the same title and authority of pontifex maximus drenched all europe in blood by ordering crusadoes even against christians and inciting their votaries to blood by grants of plenary indulgences for sin  this true etymology of the word pontifex proves that it is foreign and inapplicable to any office or dignity in the church of christ though latin writers since the middle of the sixth century have industriously substituted it for episcopus the proper official title of christian bishops near twenty years after the time that the roman emperors lost this title of unlimited and illegal power by the sword of odoacer it was wickedly assumed by pope gelasius and afterward by anastasius the second and other succeeding popes as the learned anthony van dale has proved in the second of his nine dissertations p     nevertheless the wounded head could not be said to be completely healed and consequently the commencement of    0 years of bestial power could not take place whilst the regal power of the heruli of the goths or of the greek emperor by his exarchs were possessed of the throne of the beast but before the time of pope gregory three of the first national regal governments or horns without reckoning the government of the greek emperors which does not so properly fall under that description because it was cotemporary with the former empire which sprang up from the ruins of the imperial pontifex maximus had actually possessed themselves of the imperial city by conquest and again had successively lost their dominion being fundamentally destroyed and plucked up by the roots viz the kingdom of the vandals from africa under genseric that of the heruli under odoacer and that of the ostrogoths from theodoric to tottilas and theias and as soon as these three horns were fallen from their power in the bloody city pope pelagius a name which signifies division as much as the name of the ancient peleg or phalec for in his days was the earth divided was emboldened publicly to avow and establish a system of religious persecution and compulsion in order to give effectual weight to papal decisions for he ordained that haeretics and schismatics might be coerced by the secular arm when they could not be drawn to wholesome doctrine by arguments  ut haeretici et schismatici coerceri etiam seculari manu possent quando ad sanitatem rationibus non deducerentur platinae hist de vitis pontificum p xxxiii b and pope gregory was so confident in this pontifical system of the secular arm as well as all his successors who have generally been adroit in engaging the neighboring powers to avenge the papal quarrels occasionally one upon another that he was not content merely to rebuke but dared even to affront the greek emperor mauricius by contumeliously taunting him with his very low descent ex infima sort hominum said gregory see platinae hist p xxxv  we need not wonder therefore at his boldness in usurping an unlimited authority over the poor unarmed italian bishops who were otherwise his equals in real dignity of office deposing them according to his will a manifest token of the beast and openly violating the most sacred rights of the italian clergy and people in their episcopal elections that he might fill the italian sees with monkish prelates who would be more attached to the growing power than married bishops such as were for the most part those of the primitive church but the particular instance which i proposed to mention was at rimini in the year     where on the death of a bishop gregory sent a legate to interfere in the election and one odeatinus a nobleman being nevertheless elected bishop the pontif was pleased placuisset pontifici to command them on pain of pontifical censure to place another person in the sea the man elected and consecrated for this purpose by gregory was castorius who not being elected by the people of rimini was of course thwarted by them and suffered many things by party opposition the very evil which gregory pretended to avoid by his most partial corruption of the election ne illam i e electionem studia partium corrumperent for that was his plea for interference besides this opposition castorius was grievously afflicted with a distemper in his head on account of which he was invited by the pontif to change the air and visit him at rome but being even there no better he requested the pontif that a pastor might be sent to his church who could better promote the divine service and when the pontifs hope of castoriuss recovery by the roman air abated he administered the charge of the church of rimini by leontius bishop of urbin a second usurpation who was also a bishop of his own appointment in the mean while the sick castorius urged the pontif with his entreaties and at length prevailed on him to grant power to the clergy and people of rimini to elect a bishop for themselves i e to be reinstated in their ancient right which was done in the year     as may easily be known says my author from the epistles of gregory the great and he refers us to the decretals where the whole affair says he is related see italia sacra sive de episcopis italiae etc autore d ferdinando ughello florentino abbate s s vincentii et anastasii ad aquas salvias ordinis citerciensis et sacrae indicis congregationis consultore tom ii p     published permissu superiorum   to the true limited episcopacy for the popish bishops by continually grasping at undue power at length obtained in england a removal of all ecclesiastical causes and religious questions respecting morality as well as doctrine from the cognizance of our congregational courts of common law  ut nullus episcopus vel archidiaconus de legibus episcopalibus amplius in hundretto i e in turno placita teneant which is a plain acknowledgement however that all pleas relating to episcopal laws were held in the hundred court before the publication of this pretended charter nec causam quae ad regimen animarum pertinet ad judicium saecularium hominum adducant sed quicunque secundum episcopales leges de quacunque causa vel culpa interpellatus fuerit ad locum quem ad hoc episcopus elegerit et nominaverit veniat ibique de causa sua respondeat et non secundum hundrettum  this not intended of the hundred court sir e coke remarks but that in those times the sheriff did hold his tourn per hundreda see mag chart cap    and the exposition thereupon sed secundum canones et episcopales leges rectum deo et episcopo suo faciat si vero aliquis per superbiam elatus ad justitiam episcopalem venire non voluerit vocetur semel et secundo et tertio quod si nec sic ad emendationem venerit excommunicetur etc   inst c    p     to their own consistories to be holden at such times and at such places as they themselves should be pleased to direct so that when and where were equally unlimited and uncertain and the causes were then to be adjudged according to foreign canons and decretals unknown to the people more effectual means could not be devised for reducing the nation to the most abject slavery under the papal usurpation to accomplish this baneful purpose a fictitious charter was produced bearing the title of willielmus gratia dei rex anglorum etc that it might pass for a deed of king william commonly called the conqueror but even supposing it to have been authentic yet as it was neither published nor known till near  00 years after the death of william viz not till the second year of king richard ii anno      the invalidity of such an instrument to alter the due process of the law must be sufficiently obvious at the lastmentioned period however this pretended charter of william was enrolled it seems for the first time viz in  d richard ii being never heard of before as lord coke remarks   inst c    p     and the same learned author has produced ample proof from the red book before quoted that ecclesiastical causes were handled in the tourn the sheriffs circuit or circular visitation of the hundreds in the reign of henry i long after the said supposed charter and certain it is says he that the bishops consistories were erected and causes ecclesiastical removed from the tourn to the consistory after the making of the said red book ideo penes lectorem sit judicium it cannot therefore be denied that this wicked nay i may justly call it diabolical encroachment of the papal power on the most sacred rights of the people was effected like most other innovations of the apostate church by the help of an abominable lie  by a forgery so gross and obviously fraudulent and false that the success of it cannot reasonably be attributed to any other causes than  first with respect to the deceived to that kind of judicial blindness which darkens the perceptions of all persons who neglect the holy scriptures and receive not the love of the truth after being fairly warned that for this cause god shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie   thessalonians ii    and secondly with respect to the deceivers it may fairly be attributed to the consequent prevalence of the working of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness etc   thessalonians ii   to    a prevalence and success which god permits in his just judgment against national delinquency for deceivableness of unrighteousness are terms so clearly descriptive of the abovementioned abominable cheat against the rights of our congregational courts that the father of lies may well be deemed the first suggester of it as well as an active promoter of its success so that his visible partners in the deceit and their church the power of which in this kingdom was then most essentially promoted by it must necessarily be stigmatized by their share of labor and profit in so palpable a fraud for as  no lie is of the truth   john ii    the deceivableness of unrighteousness beforementioned and its baneful success afford as in many other instances some of which i have exposed in my declaration of the peoples rights p     to     afford i say an unquestionable token of their apostasy from the king of righteousness shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee which frames mischief by a law ps xciv  0 for what fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness and what communication has light with darkness and what concord has christ with belial   cor vi      and of their consequent fellowship with the prince of this world  why has satan filled thine heart to lie etc acts v   for he is a lier and the father of it john viii     without i e out of the pale of christs catholic church are dogs and sorcerers and whoremongers and murderers and idolaters and whosoever loves and makes a lie rev xxii     speaking lies in hypocrisy having their conscience seared with a hot iron foreidding to marry to abstain from meats etc   timothy iv   to   to enforce these and such like doctrines of demons as they are expressly termed in this text the abovementioned abominable forgery against the rights of our congregational courts were manifestly devised and intended now lest the severity of my expressions should give offense instead of warning to those persons for whose service it was intended i think it necessary to declare that my censure is not personal against the individuals of the romish persuasion but against the profession itself  against the iniquity falsehoods errors and usurpations of the papacy in the same manner that i professed myself an enemy to standing armies without the least disrespect or breach of charity toward the individuals incorporated therein see the preface to my declaration of the peoples rights p xxxvi i may fairly except however such individuals as shall be duly convicted of wilfully promoting forgeries and falsehood to prop the papal tyranny and delusion but with respect to all other individuals of that church who are not so directly chargeable with deceivableness of unrighteousness in their profession i am bound not only to regard them with christian charity but also after so severe a censure of their profession in general freely to declare that there are many very many individuals among them whose various good qualities and virtues justly entitle them to my sincere esteem and respect to such therefore i can only add in the words of the scripture  come out of her my people i e all ye that fear god and the more especially as the period of her power the completion of the    0 years of roman tyranny vested in ten or rather eleven crowned horns is probably not far distant all the prophetical marks of her apostasy being evident so early as about the middle of the  th century that ye be not partakers of her sins and that ye receive not of her plagues for her sin has reached unto heaven and god has remembered her iniquities rev xviii    who has nothing in christ john xiv  0  by this miserable forgery the courts of the congregation in england were deprived of the presence and aid of their bishops in public judgment this material branch of the bishops duty as a great popular magistrate is clearly proved by sir henry spelman see reliquiae spelmannianae published by bishop gibson p     it appears by epiphanius says sir henry that in his time as also many hundred years after bishops and clergymen did hear and determine causes lest christians against the rule of the apostle should go to law under heathens and infidels and it is said in the first epistle of clement if it were truly his that st peter himself did so appoint it and he previously in the same chapter cites a canon that was ordained a d     in concilio taraconenfi etc that nullus episcopus vel infra positus or official die dominico causas judicare praesumat that no bishop or inferior person presume to judge or try causes on the lords day and in page     where he censures the bishops of the eleventh and twelfth century who affected to get into their hands the secular power of counties sheriffwics and constableships of castles as   walter bishop of durham who having bought the county of northumberland of william the conqueror would needs sit himself in the county court but paid dearly for it for his countrymen furiously slew him even sitting there matt paris in ann  0   and  hugh bishop of coventry who exercised the sheriffs place but was excommunicated for it as contra dignitatem episc and so acknowledged his error dicetus in ann    0 to which he immediately adds  but every one will say it was a common thing in old time for bishops to be judges in secular courts i confess it says sir henry and think it godly and lawful as it was used at the first for the bishop and the earl fat together in the county court the bishop as chancellor to deliver dei rectum and populum docere the earl as secular judge to deliver rectum seculi and populum coercere as is manifest by the laws of king edgar and others but when the bishops began to supply both places and to be mere judges of secular courts then were they prohihited by many canons this prohibition of the canons however had generally a very different object in view from the ostensible or pretended motive of their being ordained i speak of the later canons the ancient canons confirmed the rights of the clergy and people in episcopal elections marriage etc but some of the later canons on the contrary favored the encroachments of tyranny and papal apostasy in the ancient canons commonly called apostolical it is ordained that if any bishop priest or deacon etc should abstain from marriage flesh and wine not on account of religious discipline  or exercitation  which was only   for a time that they might give themselves to fasting and prayer as allowed by the apostle   cor vii   under an express injunction that married persons should come together again lest satan should tempt them etc through their natural weakness it being manifest that such mere temporary discipline is alone to be understood in this place  but through defilement  i e through pretense that marriage or meats defiled the body forgetful that all things are exceeding good and that god made man male and female and viz by this doctrine of defilement blaspheming the creator either let him be reformed  or let him be deposed etc see canon li and the fifth apostolical canon also ordained that a bishop or priest or deacon should not put away his wife on pretense of religion or piety   but some of the later canons on the contrary invade the most natural rights of humanity the council of carthage held about the time of pope caelestine a d     commanded bishops priests and deacons to hold chastity and to abstain etiam ab uxoribus even from their wives see howels synop canonum p     so the   th canon of the council held in trullo of the imperial palace of justinian the second at constantinople censures the prelates of africa and libya who after their ordination did not refuse to live with their own proper wives thereby say the infatuated authors of the canon  occasioning offense and scandal to the people etc  and therefore this canon ordains that the like ie men living with their own proper married wives  should not by any means after that time be done and the learned theodore balsamon patriarch of antioch in the twelfth century cites several constitutions of the emperor justinian the first which were called  ie novellae or novelties an ominous title  which ordained that a man was not to be promoted to episcopal dignity who has a wife or children  a glaring opposition to the rules laid down in scripture for the choice of a bishop and again that bishops are to be deposed who dwell with a woman   see the paris edition of balsamons commentary on the canons p         and     thus the authors of some of the later canons are marked with a manifest stain of apostasy as men infatuated and deluded by the wiles of satan who holds them forth to open shame by the evidence of their own canons as teachers of the doctrines of demons viz forbidding to marry and commanding to abstain from meats etc of which devices and doctrines the apostle has given express warning see   timothy iv    so that the almost universal prevalence of these open marks of apostasy throughout christendom against the express warning of holy scripture against the strictest cautions of the ancient apostolic canons and even against nature itself is so wonderfully extraordinary that it would be really incredible were not the evidences of it which still exist notorious and undeniable the natural depravity of mankind tends not to such effects so that we can attribute it only to supernatural agents and though many of the boasted monkish revelations were really mere human forgeries yet i believe that many others were real apparitions of seducing spirits in order to hasten the unnatural apostasy but with respect to the present points viz the duty of bishops to preside in the congregational courts of common law and the peoples ancient right of judging ecclesiastical causes therein the learned seldom bears still more ample testimony in his titles of honor p   0 and the scyregemot which was says he  a court kept twice every year as the sheriffs turn is at this day was held by the bishop of the diocese and the ealdorman in shires that had ealdormen and by the bishops and sheriffs in such as were committed to sheriffs that were immediate to the king and so says he both the ecclesiastical and temporal laws were together given in charge to the country the authorities cited by mr seldon for this are as follow  videsis leg edgar cap   et not ad edmer page     and     historiam nostram de decimis cap      et leg canut cap    lambard sir edward coke has also cited the laws of edgar to the same purpose in his second institute p  0 viz  celeberrimus est omni satrapia his quotannis conventus agitor cui quidem illius dioecesis episcopus et senator intersunto quorum alter jura divina alter humana populum edoceto which also agrees says he with magna charta and other statutes and continual usage by that which has been said it appears continues sir edward coke that the law made by king henry i was after the great heat of the conquest was past but a restitution of the ancient law of england and forasmuch as the bishop with the sheriff did go in circuit twice every year by every hundred within the county etc a presence and aid of the utmost importance to the welfare of the people and of the whole commonwealth whilst the people retained any share of their just and ancient right in the election of bishops but little to be regretted when the bishops through the total perversion of that right by the gradual encroachments of monks popes and kings ceased to have that intimate connection with the people and their interest which their predecessors in office were wont to acquire so naturally by popular elections but the later bishops chosen by the usurpers of episcopal elections for very different purposes and selected for the most part from the monastic orders then falsely called regular instead of the regular parochial priesthood did as naturally become the dangerous advocates for very different interests the interests of their usurping constituents whether monkish or monarchical and more especially about the time of richard ii when the notorious forgery abovementioned was committed  the courts of the congregation were also by this detestable forgery cheated of the power of excommunicating irreligious and profane persons from their own body or society a power most essentially their own but which lodged where it is at present merely with the bishops of a reformed church who want it not for undue purposes like the papal prelates neither promotes episcopal dignity nor due ecclesiastical authority because ecclesiastical judgments and censures by flowing in an improper channel have excited and ever will excite the jealousy of the people and of course they have been generally thwarted and opposed in our courts of common law through a just jealousy in the courts of the bishops separate consistories and have sometimes been reversed and annulled with heavy costs and damages against the ecclesiastical judge or perhaps what is worse against his executors and innocent family after his death by which means the necessary control of vice and immorality is weakened and ecclesiastical censures howsoever just and proper in themselves are but too little regarded by rich and opulent offenders that can spare money for litigation so that the public is grievously injured by infectious examples of depravity without any effectual means of restraining them but it would be far otherwise if the congregational courts were restored to their ancient powers of acting by the common law with cognizance of all causes ecclesiastical as well as civil which formerly they enjoyed as i have already proved for as law was deemed the dictate of reason lex est dictamen rationis jenk cent p     and reason justly deemed a ray of the divine light ratio est radius divini luminis co lit     b common to all men of common sense as being derived and inherited from our first common parents so it followed of course that though many express laws for particular occasions and likewise various customs and usages proved by legal precedents formed a part of our common law of which the reverend sages of the law and regular students were undoubtedly the properest judges insomuch that the business of the courts could not be carried on without their assistance yet by far the greatest and most essential part of the common law consisted in the exercise of reason duly to discern between good and evil between right and wrong between justice and injustice in all cases whatsoever by the general principles of natural right see the  st  d  th and  th chapters of doctor and student and by those also which may be drawn from gods revelation in the holy scriptures which is declared to be the second foundation of our law see doctor and student chaprs   and     and as the members of a christian community are required by the scriptures to have their senses exercised through habit  heb v    or use to discern both good and evil  such assemblies with the assistance of the sages and regular students of the law were surely competent to determine whether any offense complained of or presented to them was really either immoral in itself or a nuisance in any respect to the community and in either case the law will find a

rudiments p     ought not to be foiled for the want of an express statute or a precedent for proceeding as at present justice indeed even at present does not fail for want of laws but rather by having too many for our acts of parliament have been multiplied of late years to an excess that is almost destructive of their end excessive as well in number as in tedious prolixity for by neglect of the common law men are apt to conceive that they have no remedy for abuses but statute making so that the number of our acts of parliament is annually increased though the difficulty of understanding and retaining them in memory regularly increases with the unweildy bulk of the collection and thereby renders them more favorable to evasion and impunity than to justice and right more profitable to the venal talents of perverting orators than effectual for the correction of manners hence arise the difficulty the uncertainty and the intolerable expense of obtaining justice whereby prudent men are frequently induced rather to lose their right than to risque the expense of defending it in the ordinary course of justice and violent men on the other hand are prompted by the difficulty of obtaining justice to revenge their own quarrels with their own hands hence duelling bloodshed and murder which are still farther encouraged by the corrupt modern practice of the courts in laying aside the ancient legal discrimination between manslaughter and murder as i have shown at large in a distinct tract on that subject printed several years ago in      and then sent to all the judges but it has not been in the least regarded though i have never had reason to apprehend any error in the performance none having yet ever been pointed out and the modern prevalence of duelling proves that the ancient doctrine and discipline of the courts which alone i have asserted was certainly right and necessary to be restored but the law is required to be effective law will rather suffer things against the principles of law than that a man shall be without a remedy grounds and rudiments p      and all men however great were made to regard it by amerciaments or mulcts in proportion as well to the crime as to the wealth or substance of the offender the contenement of the land owner being duly considered the merchandise of the merchant and the waynage of the husbandman see magna charta cap     there is no possible case either of immorality or even inconvenience but what is within the reach and correction of the common law for it is a rule therein that  nothing which is against reason is lawful nihil quod est contra rationem est licitum co lit    b and grounds and rudiments     and surely every thing that is immoral is against reason and again by another rule nothing that is inconvenient is lawful nihil quod est inconveniens est licitum co lit    b and grounds and rudiments     and ecclesiastical cases were also particularly regarded by it because whatever things related to the advancement of religion were in law deemed of the highest consideration  summa ratio est quae pro religione facit jenk cent p   et    noy p   grounds and rudiments p     so that if the congregational courts were duly reformed and reestablished the jurisdiction and cognizance of all ecclesiastical cases therein according to ancient usage would not only promore morality but also by strengthening ecclesiastical discipline would really enlarge the authority and dignity of episcopacy and if to this the clergy and people were also reinstated in their ancient right as christians freely to elect their own bishops duly observing the scriptural precautions against party divisions and tumults viz first to elect two unexceptionable or blameless    timothy     quorum vitam carpere nemo jure potest or  tit     inculpati presbyters by the common suffrage of all the people see the mode as well as the popular right of episcopal elections more fully stated in my tract on the law of retribution p     to     i have there proved i hope that the election of mathias to the dignity of an apostle was at the same time a precedent for elections to the office of a bishop and that the unexceptionable apostolic mode of election described in acts i      was disused indeed during the time that the apostles themselves administered the affairs of the church after the great day of pentecost when the promises respecting the gift of the holy spirit were visibly accomplished and during the continuance of the outward and extraordinary tokens of that glorious gift whereby the apostles manifested their authority to appoint bishops without the formulary precautions of the first precedent but that these just and equitable precautions became once more desirable as soon as the extraordinary gifts of the holy spirit i mean only the outward manifestation of apostolic power ceased in the church when the primitive mode of electing two unexceptionable presbyters by the people and referring the appointment of one of them to the providence of god by the decision of the lot according to the excellent precedent recorded in holy scripture was again revived in several places as being best suited to the ordinary state of the church in all succeeding ages for which i referred to examples testified by good authority in addition to which i have lately discovered amongst the valuable ms collections of the very learned dr tho mangey formerly prebendary of durham which by the favor of his worthy son the late rev mr john mangey my affectionate relation are now in my possession a reference to the council of barcelona held in the year of christ     wherein the reestablishment of that most cautious and unexceptionable mode of popular eections was expressly decreed by the bishops of a very considerable providence  tarraconesis provinciae episcopi in urbem barcinonensem etc in spain tarragonia and by them enjoined as a perpetual usage on the penalty of deposition solemnly denounced against all persons that should presume to act otherwise in future whether the ordainers of bishops or the ordained see the  d chapter of that council  wherein after reciting some of the necessary qualifications to render a man eligible to the dignity of a bishop they add  ita tamen ut duobus aut tribus quos ante consensus cleri et plebis elegerit metropolitani judicio ejusque co episcopis proesentatio quem sors proeeunte episcoporum jejunio christo domino terminante monstraverit benedictio consecrationis accumulet aliter deinceps quod absit proesumptum et ordinatores et ordinatos proprii honoris depositio subsequatur and this was ordained even where kingly power was established as appears by the title consilium barcinonense era dcxxxvii anno xiv regis reccaredi anno christi dxcix habitum see sacrosancta consilia tom v paris edition      or congregation or at least of all the episcopal communicants in each diocese that should demand their right of suffrage and then after solemn prayer to decide by lot before god and the congregation the appointment of one of the elected presbyters according to the authentic precedent described in acts i    to    the bishops would obtain such a natural connection with the people as great popular officers which they would really be by a popular election truly ecclesiastical in the true sense of the word ecclesia or congregation the surest foundation for popular respect and authority in addition to their proper dignity as being of the highest order of gods ministers in religion that they would effectually become what the common law entitles them viz not merely robur ecclesiae the strength of the church but in a more enlarged sense of the word ecclesia including our whole national community or commonwealth of christians robur reipublicae the strength of the commonwealth ordo episcoporum est robur reipublicae jenk cent p    viz the order of bishops is the strength force or hability of the commonwealth but in order to render this maxim obvious and unquestionable we must necessarily imply and include in the episcopal function that very important branch of it already mentioned viz the presiding as chief popular magistrates in the congregational courts of common law see also leges edgari regis no   and leges canuti regis no    de comitus wherein the bishop is expressly required to attend the sbyregemot and thaer teacan ge gods ribt and there teach the divine law so that the bishops attendance in the shireparliaments twice every year as well as in national parliaments is built on the very foundation of the english constitution and we must also suppose the continuance or reestablishment of the primitive christian freedom in episcopal elections that the bishops by real popular elections may be truly popular magistrates worthy to be entrusted with the civil as well as the ecclesiastical interests of the commonwealth mr sadler in his rights of the kingdom speaking of the time of king henry ii says  it seems considerable how all historians of that time and dispute do record the choice of bishops to be in the people in plebe and in populo as well as in clero they mention radulph ordained a bishop for the oreades but rejected by all because not elected by common assent of the people plebis clero principis it is every where in the old monks and how the poor bishop wandered up and down as an assistant to other prelates etc see p     and more instances also at p     the learned author of a tract printed several years ago as appears by the lift of tracts published at the same time but without a date entitled lex parliamentaria or a treatise of the law and custom of parliament etc has cited various proofs of the peoples right to elect bishops  that for some years says he after this new charter granted in this english parliament meaning a parliament held at london by king henry i the people were generally restored to the right of electing their own magistrates and officers civil military and ecclesiastical and this says the learned author i take to be the grand foundation of the magna charta of english liberties i e as it gave relaxation from norman tyranny and slavery and this may teach us that the rights and liberties of the commons of england are neither so illegally begotten as by rebellion nor of such tender years as some imagine etc p    the continuation of the evidence which i have collected on this head would take up too much room to be inserted in a note and therefore i propose to resume the subject in a distinct tract at the end of this publication and though these ancient congregational courts have unhappily fallen into disuse yet the law had duly provided for their continuance by establishing an annual court called the view of frankpledge wherein the association and due arrangement of the whole body of the people in their proper decinal divisions were intended to be completed and renewed one of the constant articles of enquiry being whether the decenaries were complete et fiant visus de francoplegio sic quod pax inviolabiliter observetur et quod decennae integrae sint sicut tempore henrici regis praedicti esse consueverunt fleta lib   c     fleta in this chapter expressly quotes magna charta and gives a transcript of the   th chapter of it word for word with very little variation except what may enable us to correct the common printed copies of that noble charter wherein we frequently find the word trithinga inserted instead of tithinga the proper word which is manifest from the various reading in fleta of the same import though in the plural number viz decennae i e tithings the english version commonly printed in the statute books has also indeed the word trything instead of tithing and sir edward coke in his commentary on that chapter calls the word three or four times trithinga though he has copied it right in the chapter itself see his  d inst p     et quod tithinga teneatur integra sicut esse consuevit etc  and let the tithing be kept entire as it has been accustomed to be i have a copy of magna charta printed for the stationers company in      which has the same true reading  et quod tithinga teneatur integra etc and this reading is still farther proved by sir edward cokes commentary upon it trithinga or tithinga says he is expounded for theothinga which signifies the frankpledge of ten households etc it is manifest therefore that the maintaining the tithings entire is expressly ordained by magna charta so that we have statute law the most respectable statute that was ever made as well as common law to justify the reestablishment of the tithings throughout the kingdom without having the least need to make a new act for that purpose it is already the law and the sheriffs and other magistrates who do not enforce it by holding the annual view of frankpledge for the legal purpose of maintaining the tithings entire as directed by magna charta are certainly deficient in their duty and ought to be duly amerced by the crown for their neglect of the most beneficial law both to the king and people that was ever made and the more especially ought they to be amerced if any riots or notorious robberies shall have happened within their respective jurisdictions during the time of their being in office because these in all human probability would have been prevented as well as the damages occasioned by them had the sheriffs done their duty in completing the tithings at an annual view of frankpledge as the law directs see the whole chapter concerning the view of frankpledge and other popular courts as inserted in the common statute books   henrici iii cap    no county court from henceforth shall be holden but from month to month and where greater time has been used there shall be greater nor any sheriff or his bailiff shall keep his turn in the hundred but twice in the year and no where but in due place and accustomed that is to say once after easter and again after the feast of saint michael and the view of frankpledge shall be likewise at the feast of saint michael without occasion so that every man may have his liberties which he had or used to have in the time of king henry our grandfather or which he has purchased since the view of frankpledge shall be so done that our peace may be kept and that the trything for tithing as i have already proved may be wholly kept or rather be kept entire or complete which may easily be done by means of the annual view of frankpledge as it has been accustomed and that the sheriff seek no occasions and that he be content with so much as the sheriff was wont to have for his viewmaking in the time of king henry our grandfather and perhaps the sheriffs fees for this viewmaking would be the only part of the business of reestablishing the tithings that would need some new regulation  the account of frankpledge given in dr cowells interpreter is worthy of being recited at length for the sake of those who cannot have recourse to that work  frankpledge franciplegium is compounded says he of franc i e liber and pleige i e fidejussor and signifies in our common law a pledge or surety for freemen for the ancient custom of england for the preservation of the public peace was that every freeborn man at fourteen years of age after bracton religious persons clerks knights and their eldest sons excepted should find surety for his truth toward the king and his subjects or else be kept in prison mr lambard also mentions this custom of imprisoning those that could not find surety see his tract on the duties of constables p   and   i will recite his words beginning with the preceding paragraph for the sake of more fully explaining the nature of pledges as well as their association in tithing and hundred courts after mentioning the cause of associating in tithing or decenary companies viz  for the better repressing of thieves and robbers he adds these companies be yet in some places of england and namely with us in kent called boroes of the said word borhes pledges or suertie albeit in the western parts of the realm they be commonly named tythings because they contain as i told you the number of ten men with their families and even as ten times ten do make an hundred so because it was then also appointed that ten of these companies should at certain times every three weeks le hundred court poit estre tenus ebescun trois semaignes see cromptons  authority et jurisdiction des courts etc p     in ancient times the hundred court was held every fifteen days  de quindena in quindenam  or once in a fortnight but was afterward altered by a resolution of parliament to clear up some doubts concerning the   th chapter of magna charta in the reign of henry iii to the time abovementioned viz de tribus septimanis in tres septimanas ubi prius teneri solent de quindena in quindenam etc see mr prynnes brief animadversions etc on the fourth part of the institutes p     and   0  meet together for their matters of greater weight therefore that general assembly or court was and yet is called a hundred furthermore it was then also ordained that if any man were of so evil credit that he could not get himself to be received into one of these tythings or boroes that then he should be shut up in prison as a man unworthie to live at liberty amongst men abroad whereupon a certain number of neighbors became customably bound one for another to see each man of their pledge forthcomming at all times or to answer the transgression committed by any broken away so that whosoever offended it was forthwith inquired in what pledge he was and then they of that pledge either brought him forth within    days to his answer or satisfied for his offense this was called frankpledge causa qua supra and the circuit thereof was called decenna because it commonly consisted of  0 households and every particular person thus mutually bound for himself and his neighbors was called decennier because he was of one decenna or another this custom was so kept that the sheriffs at every county court did from time to time take the oaths of young ones as they grew to the age of    years and see that he were combined in one dozen or another whereupon this branch of the sheriffes authority was called visus franciplegii view of frankpledge see the statute what dr cowel here calls a statute is printed indeed under that title in the common statute book but it has not in the least respect the form of a statute nor does it appear to be in reality any thing more than what the honorable mr justice barrington has conjectured i e  this supposed statute likewise says he referring to what he had before said of the preceding nominal statute viz this is most clearly no statute but only an entry made in the commonplace of some lawyer etc seems to have been taken says he as well as the preceding one from the notes or commonplace of some lawyer who had occasion to hold a court of frankpledge etc it contains indeed most of the usual articles of enquiry for a court of frankpledge but i must remark that the  th and  th articles contain a gross perversion of the ancient articles of enquiry concerning vagrants viz vagrants of whom there was any praesumption or suspicion of evil etc for this necessary object of enquiry is here perverted and altered to serve the purposes of a most detestable oppression villenage to bring poor laborers under the usurped authority of the great lords and landowners as appendages to their estates and mere private property happily therefore it is no statute i have a copy nevertheless of this false statute printed in the year      the  0 henry viii only a little time before the reformation when the whole bulk of all the statutes at large was contained in a very small pocketvolume little more than half the size of my hand so that this important book was hardly big enough in respect of its size to be deemed even a manual though it bears in its title page the extraordinary character of containing more statutes than ever was imprynted in any one book before this time and yet even then it contained it seems some things falsely called statutes that ought not to have been there i wish the many weighty folios were once more reduced to a single manual the proper articles of enquiry may be found in fleta lib ii cap    i must acknowledge however that this chapter contains some articles of enquiry favorable to the abominable oppression of villenage but they are distinct articles from that respecting vagrants and as villenage is now abolished there can be no occasion to recite them for view of franpledge made anno    ed   see decennier from this head i have already in the former part of the work extracted what

them is not only at this time legal but really required by law so that no new law is necessary for their revival as i have already shown and swallowed up in the county court but the county court itself is so far fallen also into disuse through a necessary consequence of neglecting the hundreds or wapentaks and the trithings that it seems as much as the latter to have lost its ancient importance which was that of a county parliament competent for all business bridges turnpikes regulations of commons goals workhouses etc within each county respectively business with which at present the great national council is clogged and pestered and the sessions prolonged instead of being dispatched in the proper county courts where the truth of the allegations for changes and new regulations

denizens of the age of    years and upwards except of archbishops bishops abbots priors and all religious persons and all clerks clergy earls barons and knights feme coverts rather married women deaf and dumb sick idiots infected persons and those who are not in any dozien rather  and those who are elsewhere included in a decenary  for that is the proper exception intended to enquire quire of the points aforesaid and of the articles following and not by villainies meaning villeins or bondmen a nor by women b but by the afferment or verdict of twelvec freemen at the least for a villain meaning a villein i e a bondsman or serfd cannot indict a freemane nor any other who is not receiveable to do suite in the samef  courts and therefore it was anciently ordained that none should remain in the realm if he were not in some decenny or tithing and pledgeed of freemen it belongs also to hundredours the chiefs of hundreds who are highconstables once a year to viewg the frankpledges and the pledgedh and therefore are the viewes called the view of frankpledges or rather and for this are such viewes called the views of frankpledge  the articlesi are these      vous nous dires par vous serements si tres tous sont qui la devoient venir a la jornee by the oaths you have taken you shall declare whether all they who ought do appear or not in the supposed statute of   th edward ii beforementioned the first article is  you shall say unto us by the oath that you have made if all the jurors that owe suit to this court be come and which not in both copies the presence of the jury is necessarily to be understood as appears by the mention of their oaths and of course we must suppose a previous summons or impannel to be the foundation of the business so that it now seems a very proper question to begin with as well at views of frankpledge as at all other courtleets or trithings and likewise at hundredcourts viz if all the jurors be come etc and which not  that the absentees may be duly amerced if they cannot assign a legal essoine or admissible excuse      si touts les franks k franks in ancient times were mentioned in contradistinction to serfs but as villenage is now abolished all men of every rank and degree are to be deemed franks or freemen in the congregational courts des hundreds ou del fief sont present if all the freemenk of the hundred or of the fee fief or manor be present      si touts les frankpledges eient lour dozeins entiers et touts ceux que ils ont plevies l this interpretation answers to no   in fletas    chap lib   which i believe to be the true reading instead of frankpledges  si omnes capitales plegii venerint sicuti venire debent et si decennas suas habuerint see also the supposed statute of   th edward ii no   if all the chief

complete and all those whom they have pledged      si tres touts ceux del hundred ou del fief d xii ans ensuis sint jure fealty al roy et de resceivors dautres escient mto tender the oaths of allegiance to boys of    or even    years of age seems very exceptionable and therefore i am happy to find that this does not seem to have been originally intended to be required for by the copy of this article in fleta all that is required of such very young persons is their being entered and pledged in some decenary  item si omnes duodecim annorum et ultra sint in decenna  enquiry should also be made whether all persons of that age attended the view of frankpledge as they ought see fleta no   item si omnes duodecim annorum et ultra venerint sicut debuerint this corresponds with the  d article of the supposed statute of   th edward ii as expressed in my old edition of      et si toutz de douze ans sont en lassise nostre seigneur le roy et queux ne sont mye et qui les resceite which is falsely rendered in the common version viz and if all the dozeins instead of all de douze ans or of    years be in the assize of our lord the king the view of frankpledge being that assise  eo quod dies regis est because it is the kings day as fleta says no    et in favorem pacis fuit inventus and which not and who received them i e in what households are they lodged nand the remaining part of the article is also better explained in fleta concerning receivers of others by another distinct article no   de hiis qui non sunt in decenna qui fuerint clerici qui milites qui forisfamulaverint et

see no  0 item de viis et semitis injuste obstructis vel arctatis thus not only the obstructing but also the contracting or narrowing of roads and paths is to be guarded against by the court of frankpledge see also what is called the statute of frankpledge   th edward ii des voies et semites amenues diminished or contracted ou estoppes or stopped up and also the three preceding sentences relating to encroachments viz des purprestures faitz en terres boys et en ewes a nuisance des mures measons fosses et hayes leves ou abatus a nusaunce des bounds sustreitz et emportes and then follows the former quotation de voies et semites amenus ou estoppes enquiries which should never be omitted see the common version in the statutebook articles no        0 and    viz of purprestures

whether of body or goods        de chescun faux judgment done pur lautre view en le hundred ou en le fiefs in the old version this is rendered given by the view in the other hundred which does not sufficiently agree with the original french and there is no coresponding article in fleta to enable me to find a more satisfactory rendering of every false judgment given for the other view meaning perhaps a retrospect to the preceding view in the hundred or fee        de chescun forstall faits en le common chemin of every forestallment done in the common highway        d touts torceous veest this word being abbreviated i can only guess like the former translator at the word intended to be understood vees may be an abbreviation for the plural of veue the proper french word for visus a view and may refer to the wrongful views mentioned in article    i e to any false judgments that may have been given in the preceding views torceous veues may also signify partial or favorable inquests taken by the sheriff and so also if the word intended should be venues torceous venues meaning packed juries or juries not duly chosen out by oath from the proper vicenage etc whereby the sheriffs were enabled to replevie or bail malefactors that otherwise were not bailable and in this sense the word veues also answers to the translation given above as a remedy to such wrongful views or favorable inquests the   th chapter of westminster primer or   edward i a d      cap    is expressly ordained in my old edition of      beforementioned it will be found in the    chapter and in the   th chapter of that edition of the primer in the common edition chap xv particular directions are given to distinguish the several cases wherein bail or replevin may be lawfully given or lawfully refused and that chapter is copied not only at length but even with some additions by leta in his useful chapter concerning the shiriffs turns and views of frankpledge to which i have such frequent occasion to refer on this subject he also directs a distinct article of enquiry concerning baitable persons detained and unbailable persons dismissed see no    item de replegiabilibus injuste detentis et irreplegiabilibus dimissis of all wrongful replevies i e either for regaining possession of goods that have been duly distreined or for the bayling and setting at liberty men that have been duly committed to prison this seems a very proper article of enquiry though it is not obvious at first sight how it can be deemed a translation of the article as expressed in the french copyt of horn but in the false statute of frankpledge there is an express article for it viz des gentes emprisonnes et puis lesses sauns garauntie see no    in the english copy of   th edward ii of persons imprisoned and after let go without mainprise i e without finding sureties either as bail for their appearance or as securities for the peace and their future good behavior        d tous torceous rescousesu or resistance against a lawful authority says dr cowell as for example if a baylife or other officer upon a writ do arrest a man and another one or more by violence do take him away or procure his escape this act is called a rescus in the supposed statute of   th edward ii the   th article seems to have the same object of enquiry viz of escapes of thieves or felons of all wrongful recousses or rescuesu   0  0 d chescun outrageous distress ou en autre fee ou en market pur foreign contract of every outrageous distress in another fee or manor or in the market for a foreign contract        d

who ought for to repair them        w des addoubers de viels draps demorrants horse de grands villes en lieux defendues  des tannors et blancheors d quirres et d main curriers i have joined these three sentences under one article or head of enquiry because i find them so connected in the supposed statute of   th edward ii x des vendours des draps et curriours des quirs aillours que en villes marchandes   of the makers of clothes dwelling out of great towns in places forbidden and of tanners and of curriers of leather this article is very different from the french original as well as from fleta and the supposed statute of edward ii and it is not easy to trace from any or all of these copies what has been originally intended according to the old copy of the myrrour it should be of the dressers or patchers of old cloths dwelling etcw as if the object was to prevent a secret vampingup of old unsaleable or damaged clothes in order to pass them for new in the articles of   th edward ii no  0 it is of clothsellers and curriers of leatherx dwelling out of merchanttowns which i should suppose to respect rather the markets than the dwellings of the clothsellers and curriers viz that all wholesale dealing in cloths and leather should be at public markets established in great towns like the famous clothmarkets at leeds and halifax and like the great leathermarket in leadenhall that proper market prices may be regularly ascertained and known for the common benefit of the manufacturers as well as merchants  and if this be really the intention of the article it will enable us the better to understand how far a man was formerly prohibited from exercising two several trades viz not any two trades in general but only such trades as are so particularly connected together that the exercise of both by one man might in some degree affect the public markets and like forestalling prevent the fixing of regular marketprices and even this limitation must be limited to such trades only which may affect the necessary articles of life for so i think we may understand the examples recited by fleta that the shoemaker and of course all other consumers of leather the sadler the breechesmaker the glovemaker shall not be a tanner for otherwise the proper marketprice for leather could not be so easily ascertained nor the tanner a butcher which would injure the fellmarket for pells and hides and would give him an undue advantage over other tanners nor the business of a tailor to be exercised perhaps by a clothier or manufacturer of cloth which would injure the clothmarkets but of this last article i am uncertain for i acknowledge that i do not understand what is meant by the abbreviated words in the original see fleta the same chapter no    item de abbatoribus coreorum praeterquam in civitatibus et burgis et etiam de hiis qui duobus utuntur officiis videlicet sutoriae et tanneriae vel tanneriae et carnificis vel officio scissoris et dub et etiam dub praeterquam in

cit zthose butchers who blow up meat with their breath are presentable according to mr robert powells treatise of the antiquity authority etc of the ancient courts of let etc p     and of course are

vendont vine perry pur sanc of all those who sell corrupt wine for sound wine        et servoise crew ou rousse ou de feves or made of beans ou deceraie perhaps for de cerelle a sort of perry pur covenable et sane and of those who sell beer or ale raw and not well brewed for that which is good and wholesome        des mens larcines in the articles of   th edward ii some particular kinds of petty thefts are specified no    des petitz larons come des owes selyns ou garbez no    des larons queux sakent draps ou garbes which in the common version are rendered no    of pety larons as of geese hens or sheafs no    of thieves that steal clothes or of thieves that do pilfer clothes to which the translator has added through windows or walls as if he understood garbes to bear a different sense from garbez in the preceding sentence signifying gerbes or sheaves of corn but to mean literally garbes garments clothes shirts or any part of our garb or dress which thieves might be tempted to pilfer from open windows walls etc fleta has this article of petty larciny but he has prefixed to it the article of cutters of purses whose crime when they do not fail in the attempt can seldom be ranked as petty larciny unless we may use the term of cutpurse to be applicable to all those petty villains whom we commonly call pickpockets see fleta no    item de scissoribus bursarum et latronibus de modicis latrociniis aucarum of geese garbarum of sheaves pannorum of clothes et hujusmodi of small larcines or thefts commonly called petit larceny when the goods stolen do not exceed the value of twelvepence        des scissors de burses of cutters of purses        d ceux qui les suffrent user lour mestier pur loier of those who suffer other persons to exercise their trade for hire this perhaps may relate to the several particular branches of trade beforementioned in p     and     two of which cannot lawfully be exercised by any one person for the reasons before assigned and this article may be intended to deter tradesmen in any of these branches from permitting tradesmen of different branches from carrying on the prohibited union of trades in their name for hire of those who suffer people to use any mystery for reward or fee        d pernors d thefeboot probably the same kind of persons may be intended by the redeemers of robbery mentioned in fleta see no  0 item de

conspirators        et de touts autres articles qui valor purront a pecher destruer this article must of course include all the other articles mentioned by fleta and also in the articles of edward ii though they are not particularly mentioned in the myrrour  also of the breakers of goals the ravishers of women and the seducers of wives and of nuns or single women no    item de fractoribus goalarum raptoribus mulierum et abductoribus uxorum et monalium in the articles of   th edward ii no    of women ravished not presented before the coroners de rape de feme qui nest my present devant le coroner which should rather be rendered of the rape of woman which is not presented before the coroner this includes not only the detestable acts of violence which alone is expressed by the former rendering but also the seduction or carrying off a minor even with her own consent which in law is deemed a rape because of the nonage the old saxon laws punished every lascivious affront or impudent incivility to women which might be deemed a leading step to greater injuries by proportionable amerciaments which the courtleets and views may surely resume if they please in favor of morality to vindicate the just rights of modest women and to promote honorable marriage which is notoriously hindered by the prevalence and facility of whoredoms and by the general neglect of doing justice to poor injured helpless girls it is unreasonable and unnatural that all the difficulties and ill consequences of temptation between the youth of both sexes should be cruelly laid upon the weaker vessel whereby she is too often irrecoverably loft and added to the pitiable swarms of wretched female seducers to revenge her injury on the other sex by the communication of a loathsome disease till her wretched career in the service of satan is closed by a miserable and hopeless death the marriage act has greatly added to the promotion of these evils by taking away the force of contracts and other circumstances of the common law that was favorable to the cases of injured young women and this merely to indulge the unreasonable pride of families by punishing their seducers who in ancient times would have been compelled to marry them  the coroners were particularly required to vindicate the rights of females by enquiring after rapes as appears by the last quotation from the articles of   th edward ii this circumstance is not mentioned in fleta though we there find a distinct article respecting coroners in which however this crime as being a felony must necessarily be included  item de feloniis quorum clamor non pervenit ad coronatores  also concerning felonies the cry of which did not reach the coroners the rights of the crown ought also to be enquired after at the torns of the sheriffs and at views of frankpledge and undoubtedly also at other leets not only of alienations of land etc but also of escheats of every kind and of the fines amerciaments and other profits of these popular courts which howsoever they may have been granted to private lords of manours may always be resumed according to the true legal doctrine of nullum tempus occurrit regi as res fiscalis a branch of the public revenue which ought never to be sold or transferred by any king to another person being res quasi sacra quae dari non potest nec vendi nec ad alium transferri a principe vel a rege regnante whereas it is otherwise in the alienation of lands tenements etc in which tempus currit contra regem sicut contra quamlibet privatam personam as i have shown in a distinct tract on that doctrine but the more sacred branches of the public revenue those which are properly res fiscalis should be carefully enquired after for if they were duly levied and paid into the exchequer to the public account they would considerably augment the national treasure without burthening the people nay they would be really on the contrary profitable to the people not only in a moral sense by restraining vice of every kind but also in pecuniary advantage by lowering the poors rates and by aiding the national treasury in so essential a manner as would render less taxes necessary  the   d article in fleta charges the leetjuries with the conservation of the rights of the crown et si in turnis vicomitis vel visibus hundredarum tunc sic de jure regis relato vel alienato in terra vel in mari per quem fuerit alienatum vel celatum et a quo tempore  notice should also be taken of any new customs or usages set up either in land or water see fleta no    item de novis consuetudinibus in terra vel in aqua levatis to which should also be added a strict enquiry after old customs and usages withdrawn especially of those which were due to the popular courts see the articles of   th edward ii no   of customs and services due to this court withdrawn how and by whom and in what bailiffs or hundreders times there are a few other circumstances of enquiry peculiar to the articles of   th edward ii viz de ceux queux vount en message dez larons see no    in the common version of such as go in message for thiefs no    of clippers and forgers of money fauseours de la money rather falsisiers of money no    of such as continually rather assiduously  assiduelement haunt taverns and no man knows whereon they do live or from whence this expense comes et home ne syet dount ceo vint no    of such as sleep by day and watch by night and fare well and have nothing no    of such as fly unto church or churchyard and after depart without doing that which belongs thereunto the latter part of this sentence is differently expressed in the original viz et puis sen vount sauns fair lassesse churches and churchyards no longer afford protection to delinquents but there are still some privileged places which should be so regulated as not to afford a temporary shelter to debtors etc merely to enable them to illude the due process of the law and then to escape without making any proper advances toward satisfying the law   sauns fair lassesse which i suppose should rather be lassise i e without demanding a due enquiry into their case by inquest or assise of a jury the privilege should afford them indeed a short temporary asylum from any single merciless creditor yet not so as to favor their escape but merely to give them time to call their other just creditors together in order to make an equal division as far as their effects will go after giving up all upon oath and then to be absolutely at liberty by the common law without fear of farther arrest if there is no just suspicion of concealment the due process of the law is sacred and ought not to be baffled nor even delayed in any other manner than what i have described by abuses of privileged places and therefore all courtleets or trithings are competent as being courts of the king to vindicate the law and to limit the asylum of privileged places within reasonable bounds so as to relieve oppressed debtors without violently injuring the just rights of creditors the old common law custom beforementioned in behalf of debtors viz that they should be absolutely relieved from the fear of arrest by giving up all their effects upon oath amongst their creditors was called in the north of england swearing themselves bare and i remember some instances of it several years ago but whether it is still in use i do not know it is however a reasonable usage which under the regulation of courtleets were they universally revived might prevent the imprisonment and consequent ruin of many useful and industrious members of society the only circumstance remaining to be cited from the articles of   th edward ii is no    of such as take doves in winter by doorfalls or engines doorfalls are not mentioned in the original but laces for lacets nooses or snares some other very necessary subjects of enquiry are mentioned by fleta though omitted in all the other lists of articles viz concerning all neglects in keeping watch and ward and concerning the kings highways not duly widened no    item de vigiliis non observatis et viis regalibus non elargatis and lastly all the other articles having been already cited item de hiis qui retinuerint probatores  also of those who had retained provers or as they were commonly called approvers an approver signifies in our common law says dr cowell one that confessing felony of himself appealeth or accuses another one or more to be guilty of the same and he is called so because he must prove that which he has alleged in his appeal staunf pl cor fo     and that proof is by battle or by the country at his election that appealed etc and whilst the barbarous and unreasonable custom of trials by battle continued a hardened villain that was skilful at cudgeling could bear a hearty drubbing had it in his power if it be true that the appellor had the election of the kind of trial and not the appellee to compel any honest man that happened to be weaker than himself either to risque the misfortune of an unequal combat or to lose his land and fly the country an enquiry therefore after the retainers and encouragers of such dangerous knaves was highly necessary in ancient times but the approvers of the present times i e those culprits who turn kings evidence to save their own necks cannot now endanger the life of an honest man in trials by the country unless the jury be extremly ignorant or partial because such men who have already confessed their own crimes cannot justly be deemed credible witnesses so that their information is of no other avail or weight than as it may lead to more substantial evidence and besides the crimes already mentioned every other act of injustice or vice whatsoever and even mere immoralities as i before remarked are within the cognizance of the courtleets or trithings which are competent in themselves to find a remedy for every inconvenience without fearching for acts of parliament because the latter were intended at least to aid and promote justice and not to take away or lessen the just power of the ancient courts in suppressing vice and immorality the pecuniary penalties however ordained by statutes against various crimes and misdemeanors may afford to the juries of leets some information respecting what may be deemed an adequate amerciament but it cannot be levied by virtue of the statute unless there is also an express clause giving power to leets for that purpose like the statute of   james i c   against drunkenness but as this i believe is very seldom the case it is better to proceed entirely by the authority of the common law in all cases wherein it is not expressly altered or changed by statute with respect to drunkenness a vice which generally precedes most other vices and cannot therefore afford the least color of excuse to any but is rather to be deemed an aggravation to the guilt of all vices every circumstance of it ought to be strictly enquired after and the defaulters should be regularly amerced without remission that they may want money at least though they do not want inclination for that damnable be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of god   cor vi   0 also gal v    vice profane swearing and cursing and also every idle or heedless mention of gods holy name should be duly mulcted at the court leet without respect of persons either of rich or poor except in a due proportion of the amerciaments to their respective abilities of paying that the penalties may be felt and regarded by offenders of all ranks so that the justice of the court may be equal and effectual  by a statute of   eliz c   some other articles of enquiry are submitted to the cognizance of court leets viz if any person has built or caused to be built any manner of cottage for habitation or dwelling or converted any other building to be used as a cottage for habitation or dwelling without assigning or laying to the same cottage or building four acres of ground at the least etc lying near to the said cottage to be continually occupied and manured therewith so long as the same cottage shall be inhabited  the forfeit or penalty is  0l to the king and the upholding maintaining and continuing any such cottage is  0s for every month the act does not extend to cottages erected in any city town corporate or ancient borough or market town etc nor to cottages for the necessary and convenient habitation or

be decreed to continue for habitation for and during so long time only as by such decree shall be tolerated and limited  but cottages builded upon commons or waste grounds were allowed only three

and  th edw vi c    and enclosed gardens orchards or ponds made in any such wastes or grounds are permitted by the last mentioned act to remain to the owners if they exceed not the quantity of two acres  v and vi  we must necessarily understand that the permission in these two clauses could not have been intended to extend to parts of commons or wastes that have been clandestinely joined by enclosures to any neighboring freehold land for the latter is notorious incroachment or pupresture on public rights by land owners who on account of the land they already possess are the least entitled to such an indulgence  the court leet should also enquire if there be any inmate or more families or households than one dwelling or inhabiting in any one cottage in which case the owner or occupier of the cottage forfeits to the lord of the leet  0s for every month that any such inmate or other family than one shall dwell or inhabit in any cottage as aforesaid etc see the before cited act of    eliz c   which gives full power to court leets to enquite and to take presentment by the oath of jurors of all and every offense in this behalf i e respecting cottages etc and upon such presentment had or made to levy by distressed to the use of the lord of the leet all such sums of money as so shall be forfeited etc  we are farther informed by fleta in the chapter before cited viz lib ii c    that when the chief pledges shall have answered distinctly says he cum autem capitales plegii ad haec capitula distinct responderint non solum est eorum veredicto fioes adhibenda verumetiam sacramento et veredicto duodecim liberorum hominum qui super indictamentis praedictis et etiam de concelamentis praedictis onerentur veritatem declarare nec poterunt a sacramento excusari per exceptionem quod non fine brevi reg co quod illo die non habebit exceptio locum quia concessum est omnibus libertatem visus francii plegii habentibus quod sui liberi tenentes vel alii liberi ad visus suos sectatores in turnis et visibus jurent non obstante ullo reglo mandato vel graviter pro contemptu amercientur eo quod dies regis est et in favorem pacis fuit inventus to these various heads or articles belief is due not only to their verdict but also to the oath and verdict of twelve freemen who upon the said indictments and also upon the said concealments are charged to declare the truth nor can they be excused from their oath by exception which is not without the kings writ because that no exception will have place on that day for to all that have the liberty of view of frankpledge it is granted that their own free tenants and other freemen suitors to their views or inquest shall swear act upon oath in turns and views notwithstanding any royal mandate to the contrary or they shall be heavily amerced for the contempt because that it is the kings day i e the day on which the great leet after michaelmas is held for the view of frankpledge is to be deemed the kings day and it was invented in favor of the common peace   and of all other articles availeable for the destruction of offenders  and the presentiments are to be sealed continues the author of the myrrour with the seals of the jurours so that none by fraud do increase or diminish them and that which cannot be redressed there by these presentiments is presentable at the shiriffes first turn and those things which the sheriffs cannot redress are to be presented by the sheriffs into the exchequer  all those who are presented for any offense which is mortal and banished persons who are returned and their receivers and those who are not in allegiance under the king are to be seized upon and their goods to be seized into the kings hands  and although it be so that the bailiffe cannot hear and determine any action at the leete in the original it is a la tornee nevertheless if any one present be grieved by any wrong full presentment and complain thereof or if the bayliffe or steward have a suspicion that the jurours be in some case perjured by concealing of any offense which is presentable or of any offender it is lawful for the bayliffes or stewards by twelve more discreet men in the original  per xii plus vaillant more courageous or more worthy to enquire of the truth thereof without delay and although that the last jurours should say that the first are perjured nevertheless because that no decenery in the original testimony  or jurour is not attestable in the original nest atteintable is not attaintable with less than two juryes and because the latter jurie is not taken but ex officio of the bayliffe and not in the nature of an attaint the first jurours are not to be taken attainted but are only to be amerced  and if any one profer himself to swear fealty to the king he is first to be pledged in some franckpledge and put into the decenery  mise en dizein placed in a decenary the french word dizein for a decenary being manifestly the root of the word dozen which now bears a very different sense ana be afterward sworn to the king and then he is sobidden to offend and common i e commune with offenders and he is to be enjoined to be obedient to his chief pledge chief pledge ie the captain of ten the elected chief of the ten deciners by whom the newlyadmitted stranger is to be pledged if he is not a householder but only a lodger a journeyman or a servant but with whom he is to be associated and numbered as a deciner if he has qualified himself for it by becoming a householder   and to take this oath in these views is none exempted who is past the age of    years a transposition of these figures viz    i have already remarked that    years seems too tender an age for persons to be required to take the oaths though it is certainly very proper that all persons of that age should appear at the view to be publicly admitted as members of the community and to be arranged under the protection of some decenary of associated housekeepers in order to be duly pledged to the public peace bracton as i have before remarked mentions the age of    years perhaps    or    when youths are more capable of bearing arms would be a more reasonable age or even the transposed number    is the number expressed in the original man or woman by this it plainly appears that all young girls above    years of age as well as youths are required to appear at the view of frankpledge and of course are liable to be fined for nonattendance married women are excused by the law but have surely a right to attend with their daughters if they think it proper to do so clerk nor layman except alliens strangers messengers or merchants and those who are in custody  at these views of turns and views of frankpledges essoignes hold tien lieu essoignes essoines take place or are to be admitted where the absence of those who cannot be there is excusable and such essoines are adjournable to the next courts following that the essoiners have  eyent may have  their warrants  thus it is manifest that the law requires all persons to attend the view of frankpledge and renders them liable not only to the censure of that court but also to be amerced if they neglect to attend and have not a reasonable excuse or legal essoin to justify their absence so that if sheriffs and other persons who have jurisdiction of leets were but convinced of the general utility of tithingassociations they have already ample powers to reestablish them in their respective districts and if the whole body of the people both men and women were thus regularly and systematically arranged in their proper divisions all riots mobbing and illegal obstruction at elections and on other occasions of popular concourse might be i e proper certificates of a legal excuse or admissible reason for their absence from the view of frankpledge easily prevented and the obscure sons of violence and anarchy might be most effectually restrained and by the facility of discovery be rendered forthcoming and personally responsible for all misdemeanors and even for such impertinencies and immoralities as ought to be curbed because every single unit of our national millions of inhabitants together with his or her communication and manner of living might then be easily traced as to a given point throughout all the regular gradations of shires thousands hundreds fifties tithings and families even to the very chamber of the sculking delinquent for whether a country be more or less populous it makes no difference in the efficacy and regularity of this system because the proposed numerical divisions would still bear the same proportions exactly with respect to each other in either case viz whether the people be few or many and the lesser divisions of tithings are so small and manageable that every individual as well as every family therein may be easily known and controuled by their elected chiefpledges who with their whole divisions are again included and controuled in still larger divisions equally well proportioned under superior chiefs or justiciaries and these justiciaries invested with ample power of law and right are so limited with respect to tort wrong or injury that they have no authority to act contrary to common consent nor to proceed against any man without due process of the law though they have effectual means of information concerning the abode and general circumstances even of the meanest individual throughout all the tithings by their nearest neighbors and acquaintance for when the tithing are properly regulated with their superior divisions each tithing may truly be said to be as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel ezekiel i    and more especially so when the rotation of watch and ward and of other public service is duly circulated throughout all the divisions of a whole nation for such wheels are indeed full of eyes round about ezekiel x    eyes to convey information and complete knowledge in all popular concerns whatsoever as i have elsewhere observed on the word cherubim see tracts on national defense by a free militia p  0 and     so that the most obscure offender cannot escape the justice of the community whenever he is duly indicted and sought  if this ancient form of popular government was duly established it would also regulate with the utmost precision the rights of all electors and would completely obviate the specious objections against parliamentary reformation that have lately been published in a little tract entitled  thoughts on a parliamentary reform this celebrated tract little as it is in bulk has still less of truth and justice in its positions and conclusions so that after paying all due respect to the singular wit and humor of the writer we must necessarily deem it as superficial and groundless as it is short but it is nevertheless rendered important and considerable by the great circulation and public notice with which it has been honored for though the author did not think proper to prefix his name the booksellers it seems have made no secret of it and the work has been industriously retailed by piecemeal in the news papers and has therein been publicly attributed to a certain facetious old gentleman of rank and consequence in the polite world and also of considerable celebrity as a writer by which circumstances we may easily account for the extraordinary ready sale and circulation of such a work  for it would most certainly afford the effectual means of maintaining perfect peace during the time of elections and would render the polling of the electors be they ever so numerous not only practicable but perfectly easy and free from confusion even if the limitations of the right of voting were drawn out to the most liberal extent that has yet been proposed even according to the plan which this author ironically declares he prefers to all the rest viz that of giving a right of voting universally together with annual elections this is the plan which he says appears to be the most uniform consistent and effectual but then he quaintly adds it has indeed one capital defect which is that it is absolutely and utterly impracticable etc  now if this was as true as it is witty the state of the nation would indeed be desperate for if the most effectual plan of reformation was really impracticable any attempt whatever to correct the enormous inequality or inequity of the national representation and its consequent ruinous venality and manifold destructive corruptions would indeed be hopeless and we should of course be obliged to embrace this authors forlorn and disloyal doctrine in p    which may truly be said to express the scope and drift of all his arguments because they are for the most part deistically in a wellintended work of the same celebrated author wherein deistical notions ought not to have appeared without their antidote we may find several very heterodox and dangerous positions stated as the remarks of some speculative and refined observers viz that to such persons it has appeared incredible say he that a wise and benevolent creator should have constituted a world upon one plan and a religion for it on another etc etc p      dly that the love of power riches honor and fame are the great incitements to generous and magnanimous actions yet by this institution meaning the christian religion are all these depreciated and discouraged p      dly that government is essential to the nature of man and cannot be managed without certain degrees of violence corruption and imposition yet are all these strictly forbid ibid  thly that nations cannot subsist without wars nor wars be carried on without rapine desolation and murder yet are these prohibited under the severest threats p     and      thly that the nonresistance of evil must subject individuals to continual oppressions leave nations a defenseless prey to their enemies yet is this recommended etc etc etc and at last he renders himself answerable for these pernicious and contradictory positions by indiscriminately adopting them all and making them his own saying to all this i answer that such indeed is the christian revelation though some of its advocates may perhaps be unwilling to own it and such says he it is constantly declared to be by him who gave it as well as by those who published it under his immediate direction but happily for mankind and the honor of our holy religion the texts which he has cited to justify his assertion contain nothing that can possibly afford the least sanction to any such doctrines and contradictions that world which our savior spoke of as being in opposition to him and his could not mean the world constituted upon the plan of the creator but only the wickedness of worldly men such as the apostle paul has particularly described in his second epistle to timothy chapter iii v    lovers of their ownselves covetous boasters proud etc etc etc lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such said the apostle turn away manifestly giving the very same advice which appears in one of the texts cited by this writer  be not conformed to this world romans xii    i e to the manners and unprofitable pursuits of such worldly men as i have described in the words of the apostle for of such is surely formed that world which is at enmity with god mentioned in another of the texts cited by him from the apostle james nay that   cor ii   jom iv   wisdom of the world which is at enmity with god cannot be illustrated by more flagrant examples than these very positions which our author has unguardedly adopted from some speculative and refined observers and more especially the third that government cannot be managed without violence corruption and imposition which i propose more particularly to examine because it is a political doctrine too generally adopted by placemen and pensioners and which is manifestly the very principle or essential spirit which pervaded and has notoriously influenced every page of our authors thoughts on a parliamentary reform his first position is materially connected with the third and will of course fall under the same examination with respect to his second position i shall briefly remark that though the love of power riches honor and fame are indeed most commonly the great inoitements to generous and magnanimous actions yet for the honor of human nature these are not to be deemed the only incitements because the most generous and the most magnanimous actions have much more noble incitements than he has conceived viz the love of god and the natural love of justice and right so that his position proves nothing against the merit of actions that are truly and perfectly generous and besides these worthy incitements the agency or influence of gods holy spirit is also to be deemed an incitement to generous and magnanimous actions nay it is certainly the highest incitement or the supreme principle of action in man by which all christians ought to be influenced and most certainly may be so if they do not neglect the promised means this i trust is amply proved in my tract on the law of nature etc  the fourth and fifth positions are grounded on a strange misunderstanding of the true doctrine concerning nonresistance for though we are indeed required to forgive personal injuries and to submit to them with christian meekness when any one of ourselves is individually the sufferer nevertheless we are most certainly bound in christian duty to resist evil and injury whenever the persons or property of other men are in danger and to defend each other from all unjust violence and rapine whenever it is in our power to do so and that even at the risk of our lives which i have fully stated in my tracts on crown law and passive obedience and if individuals may legally and consistently with their duty as christians resist evil in defense of each other surely a whole christian community or nation may most conscientiously be allowed in their united legislative or executive capacity a power of defending the innecent and of resisting evil and oppression for this is the true foundation of all just wars which certainly in the necessary defense of a nation may be carried on without the guilt of rapine and murder since even between individuals the inevitable killing of an adversary in the necessary defense of a mans own person is clearly justifiable in law as well as in reason which is the eternal law of god and national justice in many cases is unquestionably required to resist evil even unto blood the blood of the murderer i e of the voluntary killer of a man is absolutely required to be shed by man  by man shall his blood be shed genesis ix   and a moral reason is elsewhere assigned for this retaliation by man viz for blood it desileth the land and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein but by the blood of him that shed it number xxxv    and this surely is a resistance to evil a retaliation of violence in kind even to the utmost extremity of violence  to death this however must be understood only of judicial acts of retaliation duly limited in all their circumstances by the established laws of the community or nation which inhabits the land where the blood is shed but under such due restriction the retaliation of blood for blood is so far from being forbid that the land it is manifest cannot be cleansed without it the indiscriminate doctrine therefore of non resistance as stated in these two positions has no foundation in scripture nor indeed any where else except in the misunderstanding and inaccuracy of these speculative and refined observers  i may now return to the consideration of his third position that government is essential to the nature of man and cannot be managed without certain degrees of violence corruption and imposition yet all these are strictly forbid the first part of this sentence as well as the last must certainly be admitted as unquestionable truths but if the middle part of the proposition were equally true viz that government cannot be managed without violence imposition etc it would follow of course that the necessity of the case must regularly supersede all that is so strictly forbid concerning it and then indeed these speculative and refined observers would have a better foundation for their impious insinuation that the creator has constituted a world upon one plan and a religion for it on another nay i have frequently heard these very principles avowed in conversation by some other such friends to good government as our author in terms to the following effect that public business cannot be carried on without bribery and corruption that the measures of administration are indispensably necessary to maintain due subordination and good government and must not therefore be impeded by unseasonable negatives of parliament so that political necessity will sufficiently justify the statesman in exerting all possible influence to obtain a majority at any rate thus the plea of necessity is introduced to palliate and excuse nay even to justify and establish the most flagrant enormities as if inequity was become an essential principle of government so authorized and established by the sanction of general usage that every attempt to correct it must be deemed an innovation to the constitution  in no other point of view can be understood the fallacious and groundless charge of innovation which has regularly been opposed to parliamentary reform by men of a certain description whenever it has been proposed with these latitudinarians in principle all distinctions between right and wrong must be measured by political expediency because government according to them cannot be managed without certain degrees of violence corruption and imposition thus the celebrated writer has very honestly stated the ruling maxim of that venal majority with whom he always voted and associated and as these speculative and refined observers have carried this wretched system of political necessity and expediency to the utmost extent that it was capable of i have need only to cite their own woeful experience as a most striking and undeniable example of its absurdity  the iniquity of these acknowledged means of managing government viz violence corruption and imposition added to the miscarriages which such worthy ministerial accomplishments have of late years notoriously occasioned would form too heavy a burden for one broad back i speak therefore of the late governing majority in the aggregate and shall not be tempted to particularize unless any of them should still persist in soliciting and inviting as it were the national justice against themselves for their former misconduct when in power by any farther unreasonable and provoking opposition to the necessary reformation  under the baneful auspices of these justifying majorities and their managers the patrons and friends of this writer with the sanction also of his own steady vote in all their measures the most disgraceful and pernicious excess of  violence corruption and imposition has been tried and pushed to the utmost exertions of the national strength and resources and at an expense of blood and treasure far beyond all example of former times  and yet the detestable experiment has notoriously failed in almost every circumstance proposed to be effected by it and instead of raising a revenue to gratify and ease the country gentlemen has sunk the national resources in a hopeless gulf of debt the very interest of which is an annual expense of more than the value of an empire i e a revenue by the rule of inverse against the state like the negative quantity of the algebraists less than nothing a minus of eight millions per annum at least besides a most disgraceful dismemberment of the british empire so much for the experience of the speculative and refined observers  there are many maxims indeed which seem to favor the plea of necessity as   necessitas non habet legem necessity has no law   necessitas facit licitum quod alias non est licitum necessity makes lawful what otherwise is not lawful   salus populi suprema est lex the safety of the people which even bad ministers will pretend to regard is the supreme law   necessitas vincit legem necessity binds the law   necessitas legum vincula irridet necessity scorns the bands of law   nihil magis justum est quam quod necessarium est etc etc nothing is more just than that which is necessary etc etc  but the man who has not sufficient discrimination to assign the due legal limits to these doctrines of necessity is certainly unworthy to be trusted either in law or politics for the common law of england requires the accomaccomplished lawyer or politician to be also a christian and cannot therefore excuse the too fashionable doctrine of the vulgar great that a state necessity is not limited by the common rules of honesty and morality  the maxims in question therefore manifestly relate only to such laws as are made to remedy inconveniences not in themselves evil mere mala prohibita but cannot authorize any thing that is malum in se for that would be rebellion against god which no case can justify see the protest of a private person against every suspension of law etc p    to    for of those who say let us do evil that good may come the scripture has added whose damnation is just romans iii   and therefore melius est omnia mala pati quam malo consentire it is better to endure all adversities than to assent to one evil measure is an established maxim of right   inst    insomuch that a king cannot legally dispense with malum in se nor can all the omnipotence of parliament establish it by statute because by the renovating principles of the common law any such statute must be deemed null and void in itself a mere corruptela and no statute as i have elsewhere amply proved and as iniquity or malnm in se is never lawful neither is it ever necessary but on the contrary impolitic and hurtful even to a proverb he that sows iniquity shall reap vanity and the rod of his anger shall fall prove xxii    as it commonly renders bad worse this is the ordinary effect of wicked policy so amply demonstrated in the experience of the celebrated authors political friends so that even the powerful plea of necessity cannot justify such expedients nor excuse the dishonesty and treacherous conspiracy of those who practice them because the immorality of such evil policy whether attended with success or not is always certain and humiliating for the worldly politician who strives to parry off evil by evil from being perhaps simply unfortunate renders himself base miscreant and dishonorable in a prophetical description of an abandoned man see psalm xxxvi it is declared as a part of such a character that he has not abominated evii  what then shall we say of those wretched timeservers who not only vote for every evil measure and oppose every good one see thoughts on a parliamentary reform but even promote and inculcate evil by precept and regular principles see the detestable false doctrines of political necessity already cited the not hating evil soon draws after it the whole character of reprobacy  these with due deference to the speculative and refined observers are the additions or epithets due to immorality whenever it is active but this is not all even if the wicked policy seems at any time to be successful if it ever assists in warding off a temporary misfortune yet it only transfers the merited suffering from this world to the next by rendering the mere worldly politician obnoxious to eternal judgment which is certainly due to every one that shows himself more afraid of man than of his creator  more a passive subject under the prince of this world which is the devil himself the mammon of unrighteousness than a free citizen of the kingdom of god for the indispensable duty of the latter is  righteousness on all occasions  literally in everytime or at all times for there can be no time when righteousness and true judgment are not to be maintained so that there never can be a necessity to dispense with them or suspend them  blessed are the keepers or maintainers of judgment  i e true legal judgment without respect of persons of which the constitutional term in england is the due process of the law and  blessed also is he that does righteousness at all times psalm cvi   this is an unquestionable axiom of the eternal law of god and consequently must be received as one of the infallible maxims or foundations of the common law of england  this only is honorable this only is politic because  whosoever does not righteousness is not of god   john   0 and the same just principle is equally indispensable in the duty of every free citizen of the kingdom of england by all the infallible foundations of our common law to which the propositions of the speculative and refined observers are utterly repugnant how then shall we reconcile them must the very foundations of our law and national policy be torn up to make room for a tottering fabric of iniquity frightfully reared and suspended upon the rotten prop of an imaginary necessity no let us rather examine whether the proposition be true on which this supposed necessity is built viz that government cannot be managed without certain degrees of violence corruption and imposition or whether on the contrary this detestable union of three diabolical principles  violence corruption and imposition is not itself the most obvious efficient cause of all the necessities and misfortunes of every government and which if not speedily reformed in our own must inevitably produce a total subversion of the state and kingdom  search the histories of all preceding nations that are either entirely lost and overwhelmed with calamity and misery or else still unhappily continue upon earth a contrasted memorial of their once flourishing ancestry in a wretched existence of political slavery subjected to the despotic will caprice and misgovernment of arbitrary tyrants and see if a single instance can be found among them of any nation being thus deplorably reduced till these baneful seeds of destruction violence corruption and imposition planted and watered by the refined observations of such speculative writers as the author of thoughts on a parliamentary reform etc had taken deep root had sprouted grown up and flourished under their fostering hands till they were ripe for such a harvest and yet these refined observers would have us believe that the creator has constituted a world upon one plan and a religion for it on another p     as if there was no divine providence in this world to favor and encourage just men and just measures or as if gods ways were not equal which it seems was an erroneous conception also of the backsliding people of israel yet says the house of israel the way of the lord is not equal o house of israel are not my ways equal are not your ways unequal therefore will i judge you o house of israel every one according to his ways says the lord god repent and turn yourselves from all your transgressions so iniquity shall not be your ruin etc ezekiel xviii     0 by the ruin here spoken of as occasioned by iniquity is to be understood a temporal ruin to be brought upon their nation on account of the violence corruption and imposition and other iniquities with which their political government was unhappily managed this sense is rendered obvious by the preceding chapter as well as by several which follow it and particularly in the   d chapter these three baneful iniquities are plainly pointed out as principally concurring to effect the then approaching destruction of jerusalem and first with respect to violence behold said the prophet the princes of israel every one were in thee to their power to shed blood and again  in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger in thee have they vexed the fatherless and widow and with respect to their imposition and deceit in thee said the prophet are men which carry tales to shed blood and with respect to their corruption and bribery in thee said the prophet have they taken gifts to shed blood and these with other crimes are expressly declared to be the true causes of their political failure and national disgrace behold therefore said the prophet in the name and power of him who sent him i have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou have made and at thy blood which has been in the midst of thee can thine heart endure or be firm or can thy hands be strong in the days that i shall deal with thee i the lord jehovah have spoken it and will do it and then follows the denunciation of vengeance the usual effect of such management in politics and i will scatter thee among the heathen or nations and disperse thee in the countries and will consume thy filthiness out of thee ezekiel xxii     these are clearly temporal judgments  the expulsion of a whole nation from their native country and their dispersion as vagabonds amongst their enemies for their wicked policy in having managed their government with  violence imposition and corruption  in the   d chapter also the prophet again repeatedly reproves their impious supposition of an inequality in the ways of the creator which appears to have been essentially the same with the deistical proposition of our refined observers about a world upon one plan and a religion for it on another see verses    to    yet the children of thy people say the way of the lord is not equal but as for them said the prophet speaking of the speculative refined observers of that day their way is not equal when the righteous turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity whether in  violence imposition or corruption or as a literary advocate for all three he shall even die thereby but if the wicked turn from his wickedness and do that which is lawful and right he shall live thereby yet ye say the way of the lord is not equal o ye house of israel i will judge you every one after his ways and a little farther in the same chapter the prophet is charged with a solemn appeal to them concerning the improbability of their being permitted to continue in possession of their country if they continued their detestable practices of violence etc in direct opposition to the plan religion and laws of the creator wherefore say ye unto them thus says the lord god ye eat with the blood a practice expressly forbid under the patriarchal and christian as well as the mosaic dispensations and lift up your eyes toward your idols this is a charge of criminality which cannot be evaded by those who pray before images on the delusive pretense of assisting their devotion for though their prayers may be addressed to the prototype yet they are certainly guilty of lifting up their eyes toward their idols and shed blood and shall ye possess the land ye stand upon your sword i e they trusted in their standing armies the power of the beast and the source of all their criminal violence ye work abomination which includes every species of corruption and immorality and ye defile every one his neighbors wife thus private vices also hasten public calamities and national disinheritance and should therefore be strictly presented and suppressed by censures and amerciaments in the courts of the congregation the only effectual means of restraining immorality  and shall ye possess the land and then follows gods vindication of his providence in an awful denunciation of a sure temporal vengeance for such enormities say thou thus unto them thus says the lord god as i live surely they that are in the wastes shall fall by the sword and him that is in the open field will i give to the beasts to be devoured and they that be in the forts and in the caves shall die of the postilence for i will lay the land most desolate and the pomp of her strength shall cease and the mountains of israel shall be desolate that none shall pass through then shall they know that i am the lord when i have laid the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed it is manifest therefore that the creator has not constituted a world upon one plan and a religion for it on another but as his ways are equal does indispensably require all men who profess his religion as well rulers as subjects to conduct themselves in all things according to the plan of that religion which is righteousness for the prince of peace our leader and instructor is also the king of righteousness and accordingly the only plan of government which christians can hope to maintain in this world with prosperity and success must be that of  righteousness for righteousness exalts a nation  but sin is a reproach to any people prove xiv    the throne is established by righteousness prove xvi    see also the noble maxim of eternal law in psalm xxxvii     which may thus be rendered preserve integrity and regard right for the aftereffect to a man is peace this is the uniform doctrine of many other texts which manifestly relate to the management of temporal governments in this world the advice of the apostle paul to the philippians chapter i v    was manifestly intended to regulate their whole behavior as a christian community and not merely their duty as individuals only let your conversation be as it becomes the gospel of christ the imperative verb  in our letters politeuesthe rendered let your conversation be included the political duty of the philippians in all their public transactions and arrangements for the government of their community as well as the duty of individuals and the maintaining such becoming conversation in all our dealings public or private as may be suitable to our religious profession is not only a rule of christianity but also of the old law right either in the practice of the courts of judgment or in politics was never to be set aside nay not only right but right right i e perfect right or as it is rendered in our common version  that which is altogether just shall thou follow and the reason for that excellent rule is not less binding upon englishmen at this day than it ought to have been upon the israelites to whom it was originally declared viz that thou may live and inherit the land a reason surely which ought to awe all temporal governments into a strict observance of right right of invariable righteousness and honesty in all their measures see deuteronomy xvi  0 that which is altogether just  or right right shall thou follow that thou may live and inherit the land which the lord thy god gives thee therefore even in worldly policy as well as in future judgment the old english proverb is irrefragable honesty is always the best policy  and therefore the world or that part of it which is constituted upon a different plan is not constituted by the creator neither can it have any part in him for what fellowship is there between righteousness and illegality  and what communion to light with darkness and what concord to christ with belial   cor vi     but belongs to that being alone which deceives the nations to their temporal as well as their eternal destruction that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceives the whole world rev xii   i e deceives all that numerous and unhappy part of mankind that do not resist him according to the creators plan of religion but blindly adopt the contrary plan of  violence corruption and imposition these are the servants and ministers of satan and not of god and every government managed on such principles is manifestly a branch of satans temporal dominion fitted for destruction a hateful part of that world which is opposed to the kingdom of christ in the several texts that have been so grossly misunderstood by the celebrated writer abovementioned  let no man deceive you said the beloved apostle of christ he that does righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous he that commits sin is of the devil for the devil sins from the beginning and again in this the children of god are manifest and the children of the devil whosoever does not righteousness is not of god neither he that loves not his brother   john iii   and  0 so that even the omission of righteousness is also fatal and impolitic though not perhaps in so great a degree as the actual exercise of our celebrated authors three practical principles of iniquity  in the history of david we find that his omissions to execute justice and right on some occasions were attended by punishments almost as exemplary as those which marked his actual crimes his neglect to punish his son amnons detestable violence and persidy toward his sister tamer produced the treacherous murder of amnon by his brother absalom and again his farther neglect to punish absalom for that notorious murder for no human authority can pardon murder left him a bloody enemy to seek his own life and actually to dethrone him for a time  the holy scriptures abound with such striking instances of bad as well as of good actions but all of them are to be deemed as ensamples written for our admonition   cor x    and therefore we must not presume to say with the celebrated author that some of the occurrences related in scripture are of no importance at all p     and the more especially because even the occurrences which he himself has picked out i have no doubt says our celebrated author but that st paul was shipwrecked and that he left his cloak and his parchments at troas but the belief of these facts makes no part of christianity nor is the truth of them any proof of its authority it proves only that this apostle could not in common life be under the perpetual influence of infallible inspiration for had he been so he would not have put to sea before a storm nor have forgot his cloak and cited as samples of this unwarrantable doctrine and doubtless a gentleman so celebrated in the polite world for wit and genius must be supposed to have chosen the most obvious samples that could be found if there were any are so far from being of no importance at all that they are on the contrary highly important and truly profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction etc as indeed every other occurrence related in scripture most certainly is both important and necessary in some respect or other whether we have sagacity to discover it or not because the same authority assures us that all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness etc   timothy iii     happily the celebrated writer it seems has no doubt of these facts for otherwise the belief of them he must allow is necessary if it is but for one plain reason viz that they are related in the holy scriptures but whenever the occurrences mentioned in scripture are related in any other way in any way i mean that is contrary to or unsupported by the scriptureaccount of them like the celebrated authors own way of relating the occurrences in question then indeed as he says the belief of these facts when so related makes no part of christianity when this gentleman for instance remarks concerning the truth of them that it proves only that this apostle could not in common life be under the perpetual influence of infallible inspiration a point which requires no proof or dispute at all he immediately subjoins by way of illustration a state of circumstances which is utterly discordant with the scriptureaccount of these facts saying for had he been so i e under the influence of inspiration he would not have put to sea before a storm nor forgot his cloak but the celebrated author himself had forgot it seems that the apostle was a prisoner at that time and could not avoid being put to sea so that this circumstance proves nothing at all to the purpose of his argument and he has forgot likewise another circumstance which is still more unlucky for his assertion viz that the holy scripture has expressly informed us that the apostle actually foretold the danger of the voyage and has thereby given us ample proof of his being under the influence of infallible inspiration at the very time and in the very fact which the celebrated writer has ingeniously cited as a proof to the contrary see acts xxvii  0 the occurrence is therefore so far from being of no importance at all that it is perhaps the most important of any in the whole history of that apostle if we except his conversion because the actual attention of divine providence toward just and righteous men is exemplified for the comfort of all persons that are truly religious in this eminent instance of gods regard to the person of paul in giving him such foreknowledge for his preservation and the other circumstances of the shipwreck are also highly important in many other respects for though the ship was really lost agreeable to the apostles prediction yet god afterward gave to paul the lives of all that failed with him whereby he was authorized to assure them of safety even when they were at the utmost extremity of danger saying there shall not a hair fall from the head of any of you though there were     souls onboard so that the celebrated writer has indeed picked out a most important occurrence to serve him as a sample of those which he supposes of no importance at all and as to the other supposed occurrence viz that the apostle had forgot his cloak it has not the least foundation in holy scripture or elsewhere that i know of except in the lively imagination of this agreeable writer in order to give a quaint and facetious turn to the end of one of his sentences which is an object of more importance it seems with some fashionable authors than truth itself that the apostle left his cloak in troas  which i left says he in troas with karpus   timothy iv    and probably his books also is not to be disputed but we have no warrant to suppose that he forgot either cloak or books unless we may be allowed to confound all due discrimination of words and their separate senses for the sake of a bonmot and even this circumstance of the apostles having left his cloak and his parchments at troas immaterial as it may seem at first sight is not to be esteemed of no importance at all for this teaches us that the apostle though under a watchful providence found it necessary to provide against such natural insirmities as it is committed to the guardianship of human care to fence against and though he was instructed with an abundance of revelations yet that did not supersede the necessity and use of books for such improvement in knowledge as was within the power of human industry see mr ridleys sermon preached before the hon trustees for establishing the colony of georgia and the associates of dr bray in      p    these occurrences therefore i hope will at length prove both important and profitable even to the celebrated writer himself because a careful review of them as related in scripture must convince him that he has been too hasty and superficial in his citations whereby he himself stands as much in need of reproof as his celebrated writings do of correction so that his good sense i hope will incline him to profit by the instruction which necessarily arises from these two humiliating circumstances and if ever he should conceive that i may be able to assist his farther improvement by the removal of any apprehended disticulties he may assuredly command my best endeavors   founded not only on the like false idea of the universal and irremediable existence and prevalence of wrong in this world but also which is still worse on the same imaginary necessity of yielding to that wrong for the maintenance of government i e the delusive and baneful doctrine of a necessity to do evil that good may come the common received notion of deistical timeservers who will not admit the true comfortable doctrine of gods immediate direction and providence over all his works and consequently cannot form any idea of the necessity of doing right and of being strictly just on all occasions exceeds every other necessity and removes all difficulty from the soundest and best policy in the government of states and kingdoms  fiat justitia ruat coelum this gentlemans abilities as a writer his ready wit and smooth agreeable style insure a ready reception of his sarcasms even against the most interesting and serious truths i mean with careless superficial readers who delight more in wit or in elegant expression than in real information but with men of common sense and common honesty it may be deemed a sufficient answer to this gentlemans sophistry to remark that in proving too much he has far overshot his mark and consequently proves nothing that he has aimed at because his ingenious arguments against all honest endeavors to reform national abuses and against every plan that has yet been proposed for lessening the corruptions of parliament hold equally good against having any parliament at all and when we find that this apparent tendency of his arguments is not only a necessary conclusion to be drawn from thence exactly what an opponent would wish to fix upon him but also that it is a conclusion expressly acknowledged even in his own words see p    that those who cannot make shift with such a parliament must have none etc we may fairly suppose that he is not more serious in this than in most of his other positions and of course that the schemes presented to the public by real and pretended patriots that is as he says by those who have more honesty than sense and those who have more sense than honesty are not the only objects of this subtle writers irony but that he meant equally to ridicule the whole pack of their yelping opponents even his staunch old friends the pensioned advocates for corruption and good government as they are pleased to call it by setting them full cry upon false scents of untenable arguments  but if i am deceived in attributing to him a deeper sense and more honesty at bottom than perhaps he is willing to acknowledge yet i should be sorry to fall into the contrary extreme of imputing to him any degree of that unhappy disproportion between sense and honesty which he himself without the least scruple so quaintly and facetiously imputes to every other person that has written upon the subject common charity therefore obliges me to give him credit at least for the honesty of meaning well howsoever wide his arguments may be from truth and loyalty and as to his sense i have never presumed to question it but only the use or rather the abuse he has made of it for after all my hopes of being pardoned for the freedom of these remarks must rely on his good sense and i sincerely desire to experience so notable an instance of it though i am far from expecting the farther satisfaction of receiving his thanks for my labor and pains in searching and proposing an effectual remedy to the one capital defect of his most eligible plan of reformation because a removal of this defect in his opinion it seems would deprive the favored plan of its chief excellence viz its supposed impracticability an excellence however to be relished only by professed enemies to reformation and order to be convinced of the impracticability of this scheme says he in p   let us but figure to ourselves multitudes of all descriptions and denominations called out to exercise their right of voting inflamed by contest and intoxicated by liquor etc  but it is more reasonable in the first place to consider the actual state of things let us therefore rather figure to ourselves what is really the case at present multitudes of all descriptions and denominations actually called out not indeed to exercise their right of voting but what is far more dangerous to the community to exercise the wrong of preventing others from voting by tumultuously obstructing every avenue to the pollbooks and raving with all the horrible malice that the devil and drunkenness can inspire that they may intimidate and hinder quiet electors that really have the right of voting from exercising their right so that elections can be no longer free whilst such notorious menacing and open violence is so generally tolerated let us also figure to ourselves for the horrible scenes have been too recently imprinted on our memories to be easily effaced these suborned multitudes of all descriptions and beyond all description or of no description at all as much inflamed by contest and intoxicated by liquor as they possibly could be even if admitted to a right of voting weavers from their looms and miners from tinneries and coalpits sailors from their ships and soldiers from their quarters to whom we must add as the celebrated author has done thousands of thieves smugglers rogues vagabonds and vagrants and we must add also select troops of irish chairmen from the environs of the polite gaminghouses and whole bands of journeymen butchers the very scum and offal of all the shambles brandishing their formidable cleavers i say let us figure to ourselves all these respectable hinderers and obstructors of free election let loose not only for one day but for many days together throughout every part of the kingdom and such a scene of confusion of drunkenness and riot of rapine and even of murder etc will present itself by due recollection of very recent facts more strongly than by mere imagination as must shock us indeed with horror and ought therefore to convince us that we already experience the most consummate mischiefs and inconveniences that can possibly arise either from the multitude or the meanness of the persons that usually attend elections what then must we think of the morality and patriotism of those persons who regularly oppose every attempt to reform these intolerable grievances and corruptions  with respect to the danger which the celebrated author apprehends from all the rabble being let loose in one day throughout every part of the kingdom it is a mere bugbear are they not at present frequently let loose in one day throughout every part of the kingdom even one day in every week nay are they not at liberty any day or every day to be as loose if they please as those haughty persons who falsely esteem themselves so much their betters and yet perhaps they are not more licencious though certainly much less guilty than their unprincipled corruptors a great majority of the honorable gentlemen as they call themselves who solicit their favor at elections to whom all the mobs and all the mischiefs on those occasions are chiefly to be attributed for those men who bribe treat lead and excite these disorderly multitudes cannot surely be exempted by their rank titles or fortunes from being deemed a part of the mob when they are notoriously the most guilty and vicious part of it by being principals and movers of the rabble  and such men should remember that the vile practice of opening houses for election purposes is a species of bribery not only the most pernicious to the people and kingdom but also the most effectually degrading to themselves because they are thereby absolutely incapacitated in law to take their seats see note in p    and therefore all those persons that may fairly be convicted of this most pernicious and degrading misdemeanour ought most certainly for the honor of the house to be ejected let us also figure to ourselves the present inconvenient and hopeless method of determining disputed and undue elections and also the lamentable number of them by which the precious time and attention of the great national council must be principally engrossed to the manifest hindrance of national business whereas in ancient times when general elections throughout the kingdom were every year once and more often if need be viz previous to every session of parliament though the sessions were held not only annually but often twice and sometimes three and four times in a year yet there were not above two or three cases of elections questioned or complained of for above  00 years see the legal means of political reformation p    and    so that a restoration of our ancient parliamentary rights and a due reformation of modern abuses and innovations are unquestionably necessary to be demanded now that the exercise of our inestimable franchises are sunk down through the enormous disproportion of popular representation to the very lowest degree of possible existence and that all our public circumstances are really tainted with the most noxious corruption imaginable exceeding any superlative of it that can either be expressed or even conceived in short there is but one degree lower in humiliation and baseness to which the nation can possibly descend and that would be to adopt the wicked and disloyal position of this celebrated writer viz that those who cannot make shift with such a parliament must have none for to be contented like him to make shift with such a parliament would certainly be the lowest degree of parliamentary corruption for it cannot descend any lower as i have already remarked without actually losing its existence and therefore the one degree lower would be to admit this gentlemans baneful alternative the having no parliament at all which is certainly the lowest degree of political slavery  the necessity therefore of a parliamentary reform is unquestionable notwithstanding this celebrated writers thoughts to the contrary and the practicability of it will be equally certain if the constitutional remedy to the present national immorality and corruption is but previously applied viz a due reestablishment of the ancient view of frankpledge with all its just and legal usages and appendages for this is the true stateantiseptic which will sicken the worms of undue influence and put an effectual stop to their baneful progress on the vitals of the english constitution especially if some farther reasonable and very necessary heads of enquiry be added to the articles of annual inquest which i have already stated in pages     to     and ought to be inserted after the   d article  of all manner of conspirators leaving the article there distinguished by the number    for the conclusion of the whole  item    whether the elections of members to parliament have been freely and indifferently made without charge or expense as required by the laws of this kingdom see   and   w iii civ ad      and   geo ii c    a d      what person or persons have received bribes of any kind or have eaten or drunk the most pernicious participation of bribery at the expense of others during the time of an election the penalty of receiving any reward whatsoever on such occasions is  00l besides an incapacity from ever voting again see stat   geo ii c    and meat and drink entertainment or provision are expressly deemed articles of reward in the previous statute of king william see note in p        what attorneys or other persons have been agents in distributing money or other reward of any kind or in promising reward or emolument during the time of an election     what public houses have been opened a term sufficiently understood by the notorious practice of it for the purpose of influencing any election after the test of the writ or after the place became vacant and who has paid or has undertaken to pay and is directly or indirectly responsible for the expenses incurred by such public and unlawful entertainment if the proofs on this head can be fairly traced so as to criminate the persons elected they are thereby effectually incapacitated from holding their unjustlyacquired seats in parliament and by virtue of the abovementioned statute of   and   william iii are to be deemed and taken no members in parliament and shall not act sit or have any vote or place etc as if they had never been returned or elected members for the parliament and the act does not limit the conviction to any fixed period of time after the offense so that there is ample leisure and opportunity for researches on that head which all true friends to the honor and dignity of parliament ought to promote     what publican or victualler has supplied meat drink entertainment or provision during the time of an election to any person or persons whom they might justly have suspected of not intending to pay for the same at their own cost and charge for in this case the publican is as much a criminal agent in bribery as the pettyfogging attorney who bribes with cash notes or promises and is equally liable to all the penalties of bribery     and what person has made any disbursements or expenditure whatsoever either in his own behalf or in trust for others or even promise of expenditure or repayment directly or indirectly to promote such dishonest and baneful practices against the peace and welfare of the community  there is no doubt but that regular annual enquiries upon oath in all parts of the kingdom on these points would put an effectual stop to the expenses and corruption of elections and consequently to the tumults and other immoralities of them whereby the trite argument against the constitutional frequency of elections would of course be superseded so that the ancient right of newly electing our representatives for every session of parliament might again be happily restored without either inconvenience to the electors or expense to the candidates  and lastly as the original intention of these legal divisions of the people into tithings and hundreds was obviously for military as well as civil purposes some other additional articles of enquiry will also be necessary to reestablish and maintain the ancient legal military duties of the people in a regular watch and ward throughout the kingdom in order to prevent every species of robbery riot or other violence whatsoever by internal enemies as well as to be thoroughly prepared without the enormous and ruinous expense which at present is thought necessary against the apprehension of invasions by foreign enemies  that this was an ancient object of enquiry at views of frankpledge is manifest by the article which i cited from fleta in p     n viz item de vigiliis non observatis also concerning watches not duly observed  that the ancient and true constitution of the english state absolutely requires every man the clergy and judges excepted to have arms and to be duly trained and exercised in the use of them i have amply proved in my tracts on the means of national defense so that from thence it will be very easy to form such additional articles of enquiry as may be necessary to restore and preserve these two great national objects the general arming and training of the people to military services in watch and ward whereby the imaginary necessity of maintaining a numerous standing army in constant pay the most dangerous and unconstitutional of all our modern innovations will be effectually superseded and of course a probable means and opportunity would thereby be laid open to a virtuous administration of government a title that will most certainly be due to any administration that shall adopt and restore the just and free constitution of tithings and hundreds in their ancient legal purity of crowning their success in reformation with an effectual reduction of the national debt and taxes by means of the great annual savings that would arise from a proper gradual decrease i say a gradual decrease because i wish the reduction of our armies to be made without injury or any material inconvenience to the brave officers and men that have faithfully served therein to whom are certainly due all the kindness and reasonable liberality that the nation can afford to show them and though i am a professed enemy to standing armies in general yet at the same time i profess and really entertain a very cordial regard and benevolence to the deserving individuals of which they are composed the kind of reduction therefore which i wish to see is such as they themselves i believe would not think either unjust or hard upon them and yet i trust that the savings arising from it would be as effectual and speedy as those of any other plan that the nation can with consistent honor and due liberality to the parties adopt let us therefore suppose a reduction to be made by time rather than by the involuntary discharge of any one and by putting an entire step to recruiting and to the granting of any new commissions rather than by the stoppage of pay let discharges however be freely granted to all that request them and let liberal bounties in proportion to rank and pay be given to incite such requests that industrious subaltern officers and men may be encouraged and enabled to engage themselves in civil occupations a preference should also be given in the disposal of lucrative civil employments under the crown in such employments i mean as are necessary to be continued to deserving officers that are properly qualified for them provided they give up their military commissions and profession which would much hasten the reduction of the army and its expenses  the corpse of engineers and the regiment of artillery however are branches of the military establishment which cannot so safely be reduced or at least not in so great a degree as the other military corpse because they cannot so easily as other regiments be raised again in case of any sudden want of them a regular education being necessary for engineers and artillery officers in the study of mathematics projectiles mechanics military architecture surveying drawing etc but a proper establishment in these two branches duly maintained in study and practice would in case of any sudden emergency enable the present national militia and the trained hundreds and thousands or hosts of the people in their rotations of service to oppose with sufficient effect any power humanly speaking that could possibly be brought against them i have here supposed the national militia to remain on its present establishment for though i contend that the hundreds and tithings when duly trained form the true constitutional militia of this kingdom yet until that happy legal constitution can be so effectually reestablished as to be deemed of itself sufficient for the national defense i should be very unwilling to propose any alteration in the present establishment of militia for the counties except indeed some such obvious amendments as may render it less burdensome and ruinous to poor laborers by throwing a more adequate proportion of the expense upon those that can better afford it and also to prevent any man from being detained from home after he is duly disciplined longer than a month or six weeks at most at any one time in actual service lest he should thereby lose his civil occupation and become a mere soldier see tracts on the means of national defense by a free militia p                    of the duties of our present military establishments  the duties of watch and ward or guard were rendered light and easy by an equal service of the whole body of the people in rotation for which the modern term is a roster of service see leges gulielmi regis as published in lambards archionomia  st edit   to      fol     statuimus etc we ordain that all the cities and boroughs and castles and hundreds and wapentakes of our whole kingdom aforesaid shall every night be watched and guarded in gyrum i e into a circle or rather by a rotation viz a roster of service against crimes and enemies according as the sherifes and aldermen and magistrates and our ministers shall best provide by common council for the welfare of the kingdom and a little farther he adds statuimus et firmiter praecipimus etc we ordain and strictly command that all earls barons knights ministers servientes or sergeants and all the freemen of our whole kingdom aforesaid universi liberi homines totius regni nostri praedicti shall have and hold themselves always well in arms and horses as it is fit and right and that they may be always ready and prepared to fulfill their entire service to us and effectually to act whenever there shall be occasion according to the duly which they ought to do of right de jure to us for their lands and tenements and according as we command them by the common council i e by the parliament of the whole kingdom aforesaid and this entire service to the king thus duly limited by the national common council of the whole kingdom was rendered still more suitable to the dignity of a free people by the entire election also among themselves of all their officers not only of the tithingmen who had the civil power of constables and the military authority of sergeants and of the hundreders who had the civil authority of highconstables and justiciaries and the military rank of captains but also of the viscounts or sherifs and of the heretochii the commanders or leaders of the army ductores exercitus the same says the learned judge atkins see judge atkinss parliamentary and political tracts p         sir edw coke in his  d inst says judge atkins in his exposition of the statute of westminster   cap  0 concerning the election of the coroners by the freeholders which ever was so and so still continues says there is the same reason for election of sheriffs and so says he it anciently was by writ directed to the coroners in like manner continues judge atkins were the conservators of the peace chosen in whose place the justices of the peace now succeed and so the verdurers of the forest are to this day these were great and high liberties and did belong to the freeholders by which he must mean the liberi tenentes the free holders in burgage tenure viz the householders or deceners as well as others from all antiquity and are strong arguments to confirm those late authors that will by no means allow of a limited government but leave us under an arbitrary power and who call our laws and liberties but the concessions and condescensions from the regal and absolute power  as in the dialect of this present age may be called the lordlieutenants or deputy lieutenants for this the learned judge refers us to the law of k edward above cited isti vero viri speaking of the heretochii eligebantur per commune concilium pro communi utilitate regni per provincias et patrias universas et per singulos comitatus in pleno folkmote this full folkmote for the election of heretoches or lordlieutenants and of the sheriffs was ordered to be held every year in the beginning of october by the same law item aliud folkmote esse debet in quolibet comitatu per provincias et patrias totius regni praedicti universas scilicet in capite kl october ad providendum ibi quis erit vicecomes et qui erunt eorum beretochii et ad audiendum ibi justa eorum precepta concilio et assensu procerum et judicio folksmote etc  sicut et vicecomites provinciarum et comitatuum eligi debent this law says the learned judge atkins mentions this election as an use and custom  i must however remark that this quotation is taken from that part of k edwards laws which is printed in italics in mr lambards edition and which mr prynne calls a spurious addition and he cites a much higher authority that of the learned abp usher for the same opinion mr lambard himself however informs us that there were two different exemplars the one per antiquum very ancient and the other says he is not indeed so ancient which however contains more  alterum non ita sane vetus quod tamen plura complectatur and he informs us that he himself after making a diligent comparison of them had joined both together in such a manner however says he that the whole of the old exemplar is expressed in the larger letters i e the roman but whatever is expressed in the lesser characters the italics is to be attributed says he to the later copy  quae minoribus vero describuntur caracteribus ea recentiori sunt tribuenda but he does not express the least suspicion that the latter is spurious and he was surely a very competent judge of that matter as being one of the most eminent antiquarians of his time and the rev dr david wilkins who printed an edition of the anglosaxon laws in      has set forth the laws of k edward without distinguishing by roman and italic letters the various readings of the two eminent exemplars before mentioned as lambard and whelock had done before him so that he manifestly thought it right to adopt the additions in italics as properly belonging to the text though rejected by mr prynne or he would not thus have omitted the distinctions between the two exemplars  whatever objections abp usher might have had to some of the historical circumstances related in this exemplar of k edwards laws as for instance the correspondence between pope elutherius and the british king lucius the extensive conquests of king arthur etc yet as these circumstances were generally received for historical facts long before the fourth year of k william i when these laws of edward were newly collected these laws were newly collected in the  th year of k william i by a parliament elected and called together expressly for that purpose and the manner of the representation was remarkable twelve representatives were elected for each county of the whole kingdom and were sworn before the king after the manner of a jury that they would to the best of their power without departing either to the right or the left from the path of truth declare their laws and customs nothing omitting nothing adding nothing changing by prevarication etc post acquisitionem angliae praesatus rex angliae gulilmu quarto anno regni ui consillo baronum suorum fecit summoniti per universos angliae consulatus anglos nobile sapientes et sua lege eruditos ut eorum leges and jura and consuetudines abipsis audiret electi igitur de singulis totius patriae comitatibus viri duodecem jurejurando coram rege primum confirmaverunt ut quoad possent recto tramite incedentes nec ad dextram nec ad sinistram divertentes legum suarum and consuetudinum sancita patefacerent nihil praetermittentes nil addentes nil praevaricando mutantes a legibus igitur sanctae matris ecclesiae sumentes exordium quoniam per eam rex and regnum solidum subsistendi habet fundamentum leges libertates and paces ipsius concionati sunt dicentes and digested into the present form as appears by the first article the insertion of them into a manuscript alleged to be of that age cannot even if they were false afford any proof against the originality of the manuscript because the writers of that age in general believed these circumstances to be facts and might therefore with great probability be supposed to have inserted them  and as to mr prynnes exception in his brief animadversions etc on the fourth part of the institutes etc compiled by sir edw coke p     it is manifestly founded on a mere literal error of the transcriber of the m s which by no means injures the general credit of the copy and its other contents mr prynne says i cannot but take notice of one gross mistake in the spurious addition to the laws of k edward the confessor in mr lambert cited in the  d inst p  0 concerning the antiquity of the folkmote or court leet and administering the oath of allegiance in it to the people ad defendendum regnum etc hanc legem invenit arthurus  qui quondam fuit inclytissimus rex britonum et ita consolidavit et confoederavit regnum britanniae universum semper in unum hujus legis authoritate meaning the authority or happy effect of free folkmotes or courtleets i e the incomparable constitution of frankpledge which i now wish to recommend for the same purpose viz to unite the whole nation in one confederated body by a universal establishment of the law which arthur found with all its just and legal usages expulit arthurus praedictus saracenos et inimicos a regno when as it is most clear says mr prynne by galfridus monmuthensis mat westminster radulfus cestrensis ponticus verumnius etc an dom     to     and other our ancient and modern historians who write of king arthur record that he only fought his several battles with the saxons scots picts whom he expelled out of the realm but not with the saracens who never infested nor entered our island nor mention any such oath law court prescribed or held by him now that k arthur fought with the saxons scots picts etc must be readily allowed and also that he fought not with the saracens but if we consider the mention of saracenos as a mere literary mistake of an ignorant transcriber for scanios or scandios an ancient name much less known to the vulgar at the time when this copy was wrote than that of the saracens there will be no cause for farther cavil against the authenticity of the copy because such a mistake in a copy ought not to injure the credit of the original compiler of the work and that the word scanios or scandios was really intended is manifest from the context two pages farther wherein express mention is made of k arthurs conquest of scantia and gutland the countries from whence proceeded the most of arthurs enemies even the saxons themselves originally see sheringham de anglorum gentis origin if not the picts also the very nations mentioned by mr prynne himself and also by all the authors to whom he has appealed  there is just such another mere literal mistake a few pages farther which without proper warning might still farther induce a superficial reader to suspect the authenticity of the exemplar i mean the passage where mention is made of the election of king ina viz qui electus suit in regem per angelum who was elected king through or by means of an angel a very improbable circumstance instead of the obvious meaning of the original writer i e  per angliam  throughout england for this latter sense is clearly supported by the context immediately following which relates that ina first obtained the monarchy of this whole kingdom etc et qui primo obtinuit monarchiam totius regni hujus post adventum anglorum in brytanniam primus enim fuit rex coronatus anglorum et brytonum simul manentium in britannia post adventum saxonum etc and a little farther the text relates that he obtained wales and cornwall by his second wife as also the consecrated british crown which belonged to the last british king cadwallader so that the circumstance manifestly intended to be expressed was the general acknowledgement of ina as king over both the english and the britons that is per angliam throughout all england and not per angelum nevertheless these two palpable errors of transcribers have been copied in all the subsequent editions of k edwards laws without the least animadversion of the publishers to clear the original compilers and their work from the discredit of such improbable circumstances  with respect to mr prynnes objection to the antiquity of the hundred courts as declared in this addition to k edwards laws viz that arthur found this law hanc legem invenit arthurus etc and so by means thereof united and confederated the whole kingdom of britain into one et ita consolidavit et confoederavit regnum britanniae universum semper in unum and that by virtue of this law the said arthur drove the scantians or scandinavinians and enemies out of the kingdom etc i must observe that mr prynne has assigned nothing but negative evidence against the fact which is by no means sufficient to disprove it on the other hand as arthur did really succeed in uniting and strengthening the kingdom against his enemies the other part of the sentence is the more probable that he found this law because he certainly could not have pursued a more effectual and speedy means of restoring a divided and weakened kingdom than by reviving and enforcing this law which he is said to have found and had he been as careful after his success to maintain this law and to establish it in the countries which he conquered with free and equal liberty to all the inhabitants the happy effects of his success would not have had so short a duration  for though the britons certainly had this law both before and after the time of arthur yet they generally had it rather in name than in use or else they would certainly have been less dissolute in their morals and more united and powerful against their enemies they had this law i may say much in the same manner as we have it at this day it was really the law of the kingdom but not duly maintained the nominal divisions remained as at present but these divisions became local instead of popular the mere divisions of space instead of exact numerical divisions of the people which this law requires to be effective a sufficient answer to mr prynnes objection against the antiquity of this law may be gathered from a former part of this tract p      where i have referred to ample evidence that the divisions of hundreds and tithings centuriae centuriata comitia those comitia or assemblies of the people of rome by centuries where every one gave his vote in his century these sorts of assemblies were first instituted by servius tullius who divided as is above said the people into six classes and each classis into centuries these assemblies had a great share in ordering of all state affairs for they were summoned together to make great officers to approve any new law to proclaim war against any people and to implead any citizen of rome after his death they also chose the consuls praetors censors and sometimes the proconsuls and chief priests etc see danets dict of greek and roman antiquities what difficulty then can there be in supposing that arthur found this law among the britons who so lately before had been incorporated in the roman colonies of this island and decuriae romulus having at first divided the roman people into three tribes he appointed at the head of each tribe a colonel to command it i e the head of a thousand and afterward divided each tribe into ten curiae or companies and appointed a centurion or captain to command an hundred men and a decurion to command ten men ibid on the word decurio  were in use with the roman colonies in britain both in their civil and military government and that the britons were incorporated in those colonies so that it was very natural for the britons afterward to retain something of the same kind though badly observed in the civil constitution of britain differing for the most part only in names and titles from the future saxon constitution as for instance according to information verum quod modo vocatur comitatus olim apud britones temporibus romanorum in regno isto brytanniae vocabatur consulatus et qui modo vocantur vicecomites tunc temporis vice consules vocabantur ille vero dicebatur viceconsul qui consule absente ipsius vicea supplebat in jure et in foro leges edwardi regis no    from this copy of k edwards laws what is now called a county was formerly with the britons in the times of the romans in this kingdom of britain called consulatus and those who are now called vicecomites or sheriffs were then called viceconsules and he that was called viceconsul was the person who in the absence of the consul supplied his place in the law and in the court not only landowners but also householders and even all the inhabitants of a county are to be deemed suitors to the county court county court est le court de viscount pur touts les inhabitants deins le county this is the remark of the learned mr h finch in his nomotechnia p     on the statute of merton c  0 which ordains that every freeman which owes suit to the county trything hundred and wapentake or to the court of the lord may freely make his attorney to do those suits for him and this must necessarily be understood from the very nature of frankpledge because every man according to this constitutional law must be incorporated in some tithing and hundred which are the regular component parts of every county court and not the mere landholders alone as some persons of late have erroneously conceived  and therefore i think we may safely admit the assertion in this copy of k edwards law that arthur found this law notwithstanding the authority of mr prynne to the contrary and that the success of the british monarch in uniting and confederating by it his whole kingdom against foreign and domestic enemies is an example perfectly suitable to the purpose of my present work at the time when k arthur is said to have found this law it was perhaps no more in general use than it is at present for we even at this day may also be said to find this law that is we find it mentioned in all the lawwriters of the best authority as being the law and constitution of the kingdom though the usage is certainly lost in a case solemnly argued in the court of common pleas even so late as the  th k james the custom of frankpledge was considered as still existing in law though it certainly did not exist in usage and it seemed to the court says the reporter sir edw coke that they cannot adjudge him a chief pledge upon that verdict the circumstances of which are there mentioned for leets were divided in decurias or decennas unde dicitur decenarii to this day and out of every ten and one of them being pledge for the other from whence the court was called curia visus franciplegii one was called capitalis plegius seu primarius fidei jussor and in some places at this day he is called the tithingman and in yorkshire tenmantale and a little farther he adds and it appears by the said act of    edw ii that it ought to be enquired at the leet if all the chief pledges with their decenners that is the other nine appears by which it appears that the tenth principal man was the chief pledge etc vi report     and with respect to the variations in these two copies of k edwards laws collated by mr lambard i may now safely remark after having removed some of the principal objections that the variations which remain are not such as contradict each other in the least and though there is still another copy in roger de hovedens annals see rerum anglicarum scriptores post bedam piaecipui etc p        london       which contains the same laws for the most part but with many various readings and without the historical additions yet these several copies contain no variations upon the whole which can justify a rejection of any one of them in favor of another for it is probable that the most learned and loyal people amongst the english in the  th year of k william i would be induced at that time particularly to prepare collections of their old laws that they might report and obtain a confirmation of them in the parliament that was then called a regular jury of    sapientes et sua lege eruditos wise or discrete men and learned in their law being required to be elected and deputed by each county expressly for the purpose of reporting these laws and that historical parts were probably added to some one of the collections even at that time for no subsequent time was so likely to give occasion for such an addition by some one or more of these learned representatives in order to assert the antiquity as well as the certain efficacy of the excellent constitution of frankpledge by the eminent examples of the british k arthur and of the saxon king edgar who both of them found this law and experienced the happy effects of reviving and enforcing it    this law also provides in terms equally strong for the general arming of the people as the act of k william does for the entire service of the king see cap    de greve debent enim universi liberi homines totius regni juxta facultates suas et possessiones et juxta catalla sua et secundum feodum suum et secundum tenementa sua arma habere et illa semper prompta conservare ad tuitionem regni etc  that all freemen of the whole kingdom according to their means etc ought to have arms and those always to keep ready for the defense of the kingdom  by the same law they were restrained from pawning their arms non debent illa invadiare i e pignori ponere nex extra regnum vendere sed hoeredibus suis in extremis legare etc that they ought not to pledge them nor sell them out of the kingdom but bequeath them to their heirs etc  and to secure obedience to this law all men universi were obliged one certain day every year to show their arms throughout the whole kingdom in the cities in the boroughs in the castles in the hundreds and wapentakes of the kingdom which ought to be done says this law in the same day throughout the whole kingdom lest any persons should accommodate their friends and acquaintance with their arms and they themselves receive them back in return and thereby defraud the justice of the king and injure the king and kingdom universi vero praedicti singulis annis in crastino purificationis beatae mariae debent omni excusatione remota arma sua per universum regnum ostendere scilicet in civitatibus regni et in burgis et in castellis et hundredis et wapen achiis regni secundum eis quod statutum est et adjudicatum et juxta quod debent et idcirco hoc fieri debet uno eodem die per universum regnum ut predictum est ne aliqui possint arma sua familiaribus suis et notis accommodare nec ipsi illa mutuo accipere ac justitiam domini regis defraudare et dominum regem et regnum offendere   and the same law also commanded a just and exact observance of the watch duty which could be no otherwise in those ancient times than by a regular rotation of all the people in gyrum as described in king williams law and they were afterward carefully to provide against fires when they returned home to their houses et ut wardae i e vigiliae vel custodiae just et rite observentur et ut caute deinceps incendiis sibi illic provideant cum ad propria redibunt  the duty of watch and guard by the people was deemed so very important in ancient times and surely ought still so to be especially in towns and places of more than ordinary resort that the law prohibited the holding of markets and fairs in all places except those that were duly enclosed and fortified and in which of course the inhabitants ought according to the common law to perform the duties of watch and guard and be always prepared and trained in arms as above described for the entire service of the king in the true legal sense of service i e for the preservation of the kings peace in the effectual prevention of all tumults and riots for aiding and assisting the kings courts and their legal officers in the due process of the law and for the effectual security of all peaceable traders and their property see leges gulielmi regis item nullum mercatum vel forum sit nec fieri permittatur nisi in civitatibus regni nostri et in burgis clausis et muro vallatis et castellis et locis tutissimis ubi consuetudines regni nostri et jus nostrum commune et dignitates coronae nostroe quoe constitutoe sunt a bonis praedecessoribus nostris deperire non possunt nec violari sed omnia rite et per judicium et justitiam fieri debent et ideo castella not private castles but such only as had a regular establishment of civil magistrates et burgi et civitates sunt et fundatoe et oedificatoe scilicet ad tuitionem gentium et populorum regni et ad defensionem regni et idcirco observari debent cum omni liberate et integritate et ratione also no market or fair may be nor may be permitted to be except in the cities of our kingdom and in enclosed boroughs fenced with a wall and in castles and most secure places where the usages of our kingdom so that private castles cannot here be meant but such castles only as were governed by regular magistrates according to the common law as newcastle chester rochester colchester cirencester bicester etc and our common law and the dignities of our crown etc may not be lost nor defrauded nor violated but all things ought to be done in due form and by judgment and justice and for this cause castles hereby manifestly intending such castles only as i have described and boroughs and cities are established and built viz for the security of nations and people and for the defense of a kingdom and therefore they ought to be maintained with all liberty integrity and reason thus every city town and borough was supposed to contain within itself a complete establishment for maintaining the common law and the dignities of the crown and for doing all things in due form and by judgment and justice which certainly could not in any other way be effected than by these numerical divisions of the people in which the magistracy was always duly proportioned to the number of inhabitants so that whether they were many or few they were all equally manageable and the rotation of duty by being regularly circulated amongst all men was reduced and rendered easy to all the cities of the israelites under the theocracy had the same proportion of magistrates exactly which our common law requires and also regular rotations of public service but it does not appear that they had our happy constitution of juries whereby unexceptionable and impartial persons from among the people that are neighbors to the parties and the facts in every cause are appointed the legal judges of it had this indispensable constitution been a part of their law as it is of ours it is probable they would not so soon have fallen away from justice and judgment for they had no sufficient guard against partiality if a man was accused he had no right to reject the magistrate from being his judge even though he knew him to be his enemy or the friend and favourer of his accuser whereas in england a man may challenge and reject    jurymen if he thinks fit pevious to the trial of a charge of treason and  0 jurymen previous to trials for any other felonies without assigning any reason against them which is called peremptory challenge and he may challenge as many more as he can produce just and legal exceptions against which is called challenge with cause the total want of this just regulation laid the magistrates of the israelitish cities more open to the temptation of bribery than they would otherwise have been and afterward under the monarchy when these heads of thousands were appointed by the king instead of the people the want of juries became still more apparent for if the process against any man was directed by the kings letters or under his seal as in the case of naboth the judges were tempted to preserve only the mere outward form of the law without the spirit and intention of it they would not condemn indeed without a legal number of witnesses were set up to accuse but then there was no jury to determine whether or not these accusers were credible witnesses which the law equally required at that time as it does at present but in every other respect the government of the israelitish cities seems as i have said to have been similar to what our common law requires the rev dr sam croxall formerly archdeacon of salop has drawn up an account of the rulers of cities see his scripture politics chap   xv concerning the rulers of cities p                                          the third wheel of their government which as we mentioned before turned within the other two was the constitution and magistracy of every city within itself as the weight of superintending the affairs of every tribe was much lightened to the prince thereof by the subordinate jurisdiction of the heads of families the political burden of these latter was in like manner considerably alleviated by the share of authority which appertained to the rulers of cities every tribe having several cities belonging to it and every city being inhabited by a great number of families  the chief magistrate in these corporations was called the ruler of the city      some have questioned whether there were not more than one of these chief magistrates in every city that there were many subordinate ones having gradual authority under one another is very plain and that these were the same whom moses constituted to be judges of the people in the wilderness by the advice of jethro his fatherinlaw exodus xviii    he chose able men out of all israel but i have already proved that the able men were really elected by the people and made them heads over the people rulers of thousands rulers of hundreds rulers of fifties and rulers of tens and they judged the people at all seasons the hard causes they brought unto moses but every small matter they judged themselves  when therefore the tribes came to have cities belonging to them there these magistrates presided and exercised their jurisdiction which consisted principally of these three parts first to convene and hold senates and councils in order to enact such bylaws as were expedient for that body corporate of which they were members secondly to commission and authorize the judges to enter upon and to determine in the judiciary way such small matters as lay properly within their cognizance and thirdly to make a part of the great council of the nation as often as it was summoned to assemble by that person who held the helm of government  these are they who are intended in that precept where it is said deuteronomy xvi    judges and officers shall thou make thee in all thy gates which the lord thy god gives thee throughout thy tribes which officers we find mentioned upon other occasions deuteronomy xxix  0 ye stand this day all of you before the lord your god your captains of your tribes your elders and your officers again moses says deuteronomy xxxi    gather unto me all the elders of your tribes and your officers and we find joshua when he was old and stricken in age joshua xxiii   called for all israel and for their elders and for their heads and for their judges and for their officers  so when david calls together the great congregation to declare his purpose about the building of the temple   chronicles xxviii   we read of the captains over the thousands and the captains over the hundreds with the officers being summoned upon that occasion and afterward we are told that solomon made a speech unto all israel   chronicles i   to the captains of thousands and of hundreds and to the judges and to every governor in all israel the chief of the fathers and thus when that pious prince hezekiah was resolved upon a reformation both of religion and manners throughout his kingdom it is said   chronicles xxix  0 then hezekiah the king rose early and gathered the rulers of the city and went up to the house of the lord  as to their judiciary capacity they were not strictly speaking judges themselves but had the power of admitting what causes they thought were proper to come before the judges and of rejecting what they looked upon as frivolous or unnecessary to be enquired into        of the judiciary authority of these rulers we read farther in the case of jeremiah when another micaiah had heard his prophetical denunciations against israel and judah jer xxxvi    he went down into the kings house into the scribes chamber where all the princes these rulers were sitting and informed them of it and after when jeremiah was going out of the city into the land of benjamin irijah who suspected that he was going to desert to the army of the chaldeans who were lately broken up from besieging the city jer xxxvii    took jeremiah and brought him to the princes wherefore the princes were wroth with jeremiah and smote him and put him in prison  and upon his farther prophesying that the city should be given into the band of the king of babylon therefore the princes said unto the king we beseech thee let this man be put to death then zedekiah the king said behold he is in your hand for the king is not he that can do any thing against you which shows that they bore a mighty sway in the great council of the nation and that when they prayed judgment and execution against any one even the king thought it most safe and prudent to comply with them  the number of these rulers in every city was in proportion to the number of its inhabitants as many thousands as it contained so many rulers of that rank and denomination belonged to it from which regulation the estimation and consequence of each city was discernible at one view and from this consideration arises that fine allusion of one of the prophets concerning the place where christ should be born so understood and applied by the chief priests and scribes themselves as the evangelist informs us mat ii   mic v   but thou bethlehem ephratah though thou be little among the thousands of judah in comparison of those cities that have rulers of thousands belonging to them yet out of thee he shall come forth unto me that is to be ruler in israel whose goings forth have been of old from everlasting so exactly was almost every minute circumstance relating to the savior of mankind delineated and foretold by those divinelyinspired writers who lived so many hundred years before he came into the world    captains of thousands etc  the rest of the officers that governed the army we find called by the titles of captains of thousands captains of hundreds captains of fifties and captains of tens who probably were of the same rank with those whom moses constituted in the wilderness rulers of thousands etc and at first acted in a double capacity being at the same time civil magistrates and military officers  the captains of thousands seem to have been much the same as colonels of regiments with us and the captains of hundreds might probably answer to those who in our army have the command of troops and companies the captains of fifties and tens to our subalterns sergeants and corporals  among the list of davids adherents while he fled from saul   chronicles xii     and kept himself close at ziklag after several names mentioned it is said these were of the sons of god captains of the host one of the least was over an hundred and the greatest over a thousand again we read of others said   chronicles xii  0 to be captains of the thousands that were of manasseh and when david had thoughts of bringing the ark of god from kirjathjearim we are told   chronicles xiii   he consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds and with every leader and again when he declared his intentions about building the temple it is said that he   chronicles xxviii   assembled all the princes of israel the princes of the tribes and the captains of the companies that ministered to the king by course and the captains over the thousands and the captains over the hundreds  so when jehoiada the high priest had a mind to bring on the restoration by declaring joash to be king   kings xi   he sent for the rulers over hundreds with the captains and the guard and showed them the kings son and gave them proper instructions what they were to do and the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that jehoiada the priest commanded and to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king david s spears and shields that were in the temple of the lord and he took the rulers over hundreds and the captains and the guard and all the people of the land and they brought down the king from the house of the lord and be sat on the throne of the kings and we read   kings i         of three captains of fifties who with their fifties were sent successively by ahaziah king of israel to bring the prophet elijah to him the apocryphal writings tell us   mac iii    that judas ordained captains over the people even captains over thousands and over hundreds and over fifties and over tens  these officers from the captain of the host down to the lowest subaltern appear after the monarchy took place to have received their commissions from the king whereas they were before chosen by the people when samuel declares to the people the manner of the king that was to reign over them this is part of it   samuel viii    he will appoint him captains over thousands and captains over fifties etc accordingly when saul began to grow jealous of davids rising glory   samuel xviii    he removed him from him and made him his captain over a thousand so we read   samuel xviii   that david numbered the people that were with him and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them   chronicles xxv   and that amaziah gathered judah together and made them captains over thousands and captains over hundreds   in israel ready to my hand which is so suitable to my present purpose that i should do injustice to the subject if i neglected to give my readers some extracts of it in the authors own words  the military duties of watch and guard in cities towns etc which by the laws of k william i were ordered to be performed in gyrum i e in due rotation of service by all the inhabitants as i have already shown were farther regulated by the statute of winchester in the   th k edw i a d      which without altering the former law about rotation specifies the strength of the guard to be set in each place and ordains for i will cite it as abbreviated by mr lambard in his duties of constables p    which proves that he thought it still in force so late as the reign of q elizabeth in      that night watches should be kept yearly from the feast of the ascension until michaelmas by six men at every gate of every city by    men in every borough town and in every other town by six men or four men or according to the number of inhabitants in the town all the night long from sun setting to sun rising so that if any stranger did pass he should be arrested till the morning and then set at large if no suspicion were found of him but if any suspicion fell out against him then he should be imprisoned till he might be lawfully delivered and of these watches says mr lambard the officers before named have the charge within the limits or places of their auctorities as the constable in his town the borsholder in his boroe and the high constable within all his hundred and these officers ought to see these watches says mr lambard by which he plainly insists on the continued force of this statute so that the enquiry concerning watch duty at views of frankpledge ought to be regulated by it duly set and kept and ought also to cause hue and cry the hue and cry was a military exertion of the civil power which all men were obliged to attend with their arms in military array whenever legally summoned to do so even so late as the  d hen vii   as mr dalton in his officium vicecomitum relates the sheriffs bailiff to execute a replevy took with him  00 men armed modo guerrino sc with brigandines jackes and guns and it was holden lawful says he for the sheriffs officer has power to take assistance as well as the sheriff himself p     and a little farther he adds p     and every man is sworn says keble to be aiding to the sheriff in his business and if they do it not at the request of the sheriff they shall be fined   hen vii   br fine pur contempt    and trespass     see also stat of   hen v cap   which inflicteth both fine and imprisonment upon such as shall not aid the sheriff they being thereunto required this proves that the military capacity of every man is required to support the civil government to be raised after such as will not obey the arrest of such watchmen this power of arresting suspicious persons in all towns and boroughs shows the necessity of having in each town and borough a proper goal or appointed place of confinement especially as the common law required that if any man was of so evil credit that he could not get himself to be received into one of these tythings or boroes that then he should be shut up in prison as a man unworthie to live at liberty amongst men abroad lambards duties of constables p   and the expenses necessary for the building and maintaining such proper places of confinement might be levied by the court leet on the inhabitants of each district for the leet has competent power according to the common law to levy taxes for defraying all necessary public works see powells treatise of the antiquity etc of courts of leet or view of frankpledge etc p     any bylawes for the commonweal may be made in a leet and are good and will lie against those that do not consent as to make cawseyes highways bridges and such like and no public works surely are more for the common weal or more necessary for enforcing a due compliance with the common law than the erection of proper goals and places of confinement or houses of correction and of industry in lesser districts to prevent the accumulation of multitudes of prisoners in the county goals where they mutually corrupt each other and to prevent the baneful practice of selling convicts into foreign slavery or into miserable torture in floating prisons who according to the common law ought to be punished only upon the spot where their offenses as well as their contrition and amendment might be known for if there should be still cause to suspect a want of improvement in any of them so that they should not be able to obtain a readmission into any tithing of frankpledge the leets had ample authority to prolong their imprisonment and to keep them hard at work to defray the expenses of a sober and limited diet the very best mode of inclining reprobates to hear reason and instruction the indefatigable labors of the benevolent and truly patriotic mr howard who has so disinterestedly devoted both himself and his fortune to the public service afford ample materials for selecting the most just and effectual means of forming such necessary establishments    th edward iii fol    but a bylaw to repair a church binds none but such as do assent vid co   fol    aleet may make bylawes the lord by prescription may distreyne for the amerciaments and sell the distress for the king may so do and the leet is the kings although the lord has the profits brook leet    prescription  0 the same power that is here attributed to the lord of a leet certainly belongs also to sheriffs mayors bailiffs and hundreders or high constables who may hold leets by the common law and consequently have a right also by prescription to distreyne for the amerciaments and to sell the distress i must also observe that where any lord of a manor has enjoyed a right of holding a court leet and has either abused or neglected his power the king may certainly according to the true limited doctrine of nullum tempus see my separate tract on that head resume the right of the court and all the profit of it which is properly res fiscalis and must in that case restore the power of the holding the said court to the high constable or proper officer by the common law  so that the modern usage of applying to the great national council on such occasions is clearly wrong because it not only occasions a needless expense interferes with more important business of the nation and grievously prolongs the sittings of parliament but also tends to enure the members to private solicitations in behalf of partial objects facilitates the practice of canvassing them individually and thereby lays them open to influence and temptation in higher matters whereas frequent but short sessions of newly elected parliaments like those of ancient times would effectually cut up the roots of corruption and undue influence  in order the more effectually to promote the happy system of government which i now recommend viz that all freeborne men within this kingdom  should cast themselves into tithings see p    and    for the common security of all it was ordained by king william i ut omnes habeant et teneant legem regis edwardi in omnibus rebus adauctis his quae constituimus says the statute of william ad utilitatem anglorum that all persons should have and hold the law of king edward wherein the more ancient laws for maintaining the tithings and hundreds are collected and stated in all things those things being also added which we have ordained said william for the use of the english and no free nation could reasonably desire more substantial and effectual additions for the security of their own peace and liberty than those additional laws of william most of which i have already cited that all cities boroughs castles hundreds and wapentaches of our whole kingdom shall be watched and guarded in girum in rotation or by a roster of service against malefactors and enemies according as the sheriffs aldermen mayors praepositi a title as frequently given to the hundreders or highconstables and others our ministers shall better provide by common council i e by parliament for the good of the kingdom that all earls barons knights and sergeants servientes and all freemen of our whole kingdom aforesaid universi liberi homines totius regni nostri praedicti shall have and hold themselves always well in arms and in horses ut decet et oportet suitably to their rank and that they may be always ready and prepared to fulfill our entire service whenever there shall be occasion and as they ought of right de jure to do for their lands and tenements and as we shall appoint them by common council of the whole kingdom so that the english were so far from being enslaved by what is commonly called the conquest that k wms statute expressly submits the efficient power of the kingdom the national militia to the orders of parliament and also the clause which i have but just now cited for the regulation of watch and ward  to these i must now add a farther excellent clause of k williams statute omnis hemo qui voluerit se teneri pro libero sit in plegio i e fidejussione ut plegius eum habeat ad justitiam si quid offenderit et si quisquam evaserit talium videant plegii ut solvant quod calumniatum est et purgent se quia in evaso nullam fraudem noverint requiratur hundredus et comitatus sicut antecessores statuerunt et qui just venire debent et noluerint summoneantur semel et si secundo non venerint accipiatur bos unus at si tertio alius bos et si quarto reddatur de rebus hujus hominis quod calumniatum est quod dicitur ceapgyld al orfgyld quod idem est et insuper regi forisfacitura  which is necessary for the better enforcing and promoting k edwards laws viz that every man who shall be willing to be deemed a freeman shall be in pledge shall enter himself into some tithing of frankpledge that the pledge may have him to justice if in any thing he should offend and if any of such pledged persons should abscond that the pledges may pay whatsoever damages are laid or rather are proved and may clear themselves that they knew or were privy to no fraud in the absconded person let the hundred court be demanded or summoned  and the county court and those who ought of right to attend at either of these courts as the context requires us to understand and shall be unwilling let them be summoned once and if to a second summons they shall not come let one ox be taken or perhaps the medium value of one ox at the current marketprice for thus the quantum of the forfeit would generally bear a due proportion or nearly so to the true value of money as collegerents are sometimes ascertained by the value of certain quantities of corn and if to a third summons he shall not come let another ox be taken and if to a fourth summons they shall not come let what is rated be paid out of the effects of this man which is called ceapgyld ceapgyld ceap in the saxon tongue signifies price wages cattle wealth or chattles and gyld signifies payment the compound word ceapgyld according to mr somner signifies rei furto ablatae pretium the price of any thing stolen but which in this law must evidently mean the payment or forfeit of the mans reputed wealth and  or orfgyld so likewise orfgyld orfe signifies money cattle effects and the compound word mr somner renders rei pretium the price of any thing so that i suppose both these words to be synonymous with the saxon word  regular summonses however were required by law to be made seven days before any of these courts unless a legal and admissable excuse could be assigned for the omission  et septem diebus antea summoniri nisi publicum commodum vel dominica regis necessitas terminum praeveniat see k edwards law de heretochiis etc and a neglect or disregard of a legal summons to a court of law might surely be deemed a contempt of the law the declared penalties for which a single or double forfeiture of the mans were were which is commonly rendered aestimati capitis not the whole value of a mans estimated wealth but only such a certain rate according to each mans rank in life as he might justly be supposed able to pay in case he should incur a penalty or forfeit without being ruined and degraded by it agreeable to what i have remarked in p    and    on the due limitation of amerciaments by the   th chapter of magna charta which was certainly the law of the kingdom long before that time because even in k edwards laws it appears that a man might be amerced twice his were his weram suam for a second offense and all that he was worth for a third offense so that a mans were or estimated price was certainly very far within the compass of his real wealth or substance and therefore all these amerciaments must necessarily be understood to have been levied strictly according to the spirit of what was afterward ordained in magna charta i e saving to a man according to his rank his contenement or merchandise or wainage without degrading him from his rank and means of livelihood except the same crime was obstinately repeated and such amerciaments were to be made only by the oath of honest and lawful men of the vicinage according to the regular usage of all the ancient leets and popular courts the great object of amerciaments was to compel men of all ranks to respect and observe the laws whence arose the necessity of varying the quantum of the mulct in due proportion to the offenders ability to pay without actually depressing or degrading him from his rank and of this due proportion a jury of the vicinage were the only proper judges  may perhaps help to explain the nature of the amerciaments mentioned above for neglect of summonses et qui leges apostabit i e violarit si fuerit anglicus vel dacus vel waliscus vel albanicus vel insulicola werae suae reus sit apud regem et si secundo id faciat reddat bis weram suam et si quid addat tertio reus sit omnium quae habebit and whosoever shall neglect or violate the laws whether he be englishman dane welchman or scot or islander shall forfeit his were with the king and if he shall do it a second time let him pay twice his were and if he shall add a third time i e a third repetition of the same offense let him forfeit all that he shall have   to increase amerciaments on the repetition of offenses seems to be both just and necessary but whether in so enlarged a proportion as that of doubling the were for a second conviction and forfeiting all on a third may reasonably be questioned especially as there is no express exception for second and third offenses in the limitation of americaments ordained by the   th chapter of magna charta nevertheless if we consider that a frequent repetition of the same misdemeanor is undoubtedly a heinous aggravation of it and that it was always so considered in the common law and punished accordingly by an aggravation of the mulct as appears by the laws already cited we shall perhaps be inclined to believe that the authors of the said limitation of mulcts in magna charta though they certainly intended to regulate by it the pecuniary penalties of crimes in general yet for any thing that appears they had not in contemplation the peculiar circumstance of a contemptuous repetition of any crime and may therefore be justly supposed not to have intended to abridge the salutary spirit of the common law so necessary for its own preservation in duly punishing by gradual advances of severity any repeated contempts of its authority  if all these points be duly considered it must appear that our common law is already vested with ample powers to enforce a revival of the ancient constitution of this kingdom so that nothing is wanting but a general communication of its principles the purpose of this tract to engage the will of the public for its reassumption that the summa et maxima securitas of our ancestors see p   may be once more established the happy effects of which cannot be expressed in stronger terms than in the words of sir edw coke on this very subject by the due execution of this law says he speaking of the view of frankpledge in his comment on magna charta p     d inst such peace whereof this chapter speaks was universally holden within this realm as no injuries homicides robberies thefts riots tumults or other offenses were committed so as a man with a white wand might safely have ridden before the conquest with much money about him without any weapon throughout england and one says truly referring to mr lambards explanation of aestimatio capitis conjectur a est eaque non levis haud it a multis scatuisse prisca tempora sceleribus quippe quibus rapinae furto coedi caedi or manslaughters if he meant voluntary slaughters or murders ought not to have been mentioned here as crimes formerly punished only by pecuniary mulcts for though i am well aware that many eminent lawwriters have supposed this as well as the learned mr lambard and the excellent lawyer who quoted him and though perhaps too many instances may be cited of such a corrupt usage sometimes prevailing in ancient times so as to strengthen the supposition yet it never was the law since the establishment of christianity but a real perversion of the law whenever it was done which must have been occasioned either by corrupt partiality or favor from the officers of the crown or through their ignorance and want of due discrimination to be aware of the particular circumstances of manslaughters wherein fines or mulcts might sometimes legally take place as in involuntary manslaughters to make men more careful of each others lives and even in cases of accidental deaths wherein the deodands were in the nature of mulcts and also the particular circumstances when mulcts might be levied for actual murder which was only when the murderer had fled and could not be taken that a certain sum should be paid for him and should be collected because they had not taken the killer etc si autem aufugeret i e interfector et capi non posset slverentur pro co    marcae et colligebantur in villa ubi quis esset interfectus et ideo quia interfectorem non habuerunt et si in tali villa pro paupertate colligi non possent colligerentur in hundredo in thesauro regis deponendae bract lib   c    nb the fines were to be deposited in the exchequer  deponendae and not appropriated for a year and a day lest the murderers should in the mean time be taken in which case the fines were to be returned to the town or hundred as will hereafter be shown but if he could be taken the same law declared fieret de eo justitia let justice be done upon him and the only justice in the laws of god and man for such a crime was and is the retribution of death the learned judge bracton copied from k edwards laws this very expression concerning a convicted murderer sieret de eo justitia as also the alternative when the murderer could not be taken si autem aufugeret solveretur ut supra dictum est see leges edouardi regis c    the doctrine here referred to by the words ut supra dictum est is in the preceding chapter of king edwards laws viz no    entitled lex murdrorum to the following effect si quispiam murdratus alicubi reperiebatur querebatur apud villam ubi inveniebatur interfector illius qui si inveniri poterat tradebatur justitiae regis infra ipsos   dies interfectionis si vero inveniri non peterat mensis et unius diei respectum habebant ad eum perquirendum quod si intra terminum non inveniebatur colligebantur in villa illa    marcae quod si ad tantae solutionem pecuniae non sufficiebat per hundredum colligebatur quod in villa non poterat veruntamen quoniam omnino villa confundebatur providerunt barons quod per hundredum colligerentur et sigillo alcujus baronis comitatus sigillarentur et ad thesaurarium regis deportarentur quas sigillatus perhaps for sigillatas ipse servaret per annum et diem unum quod si infra hunc terminum possit murdrator haberi traderetur justitiae regis et ipsi marcas thesaurario regis commendaas rehaberent so that the fine appears manifestly to be intended for no other purpose than to induce the inhabitants to bring the murderer to justice sin infra tempus annuum non posset teneri parents murdrati sex marcas haberent rex quadraginta etc etc that if a murdered person was any where found enquiry was made after the murderer who if he could be found within eight days he was to be delivered to the justice of the king but if he could not be found the inhabitants had a respite respectus of a month and a day to search for him within which term if he was not found the    marks beforementioned were to be collected in the town or if so large a sum could not there be raised throughout the hundred and to be delivered sealed up to the kings treasurer who was to keep them sealed up for a year and a day that if within this term the murderer could be taken he should be delivered to the justice of the king and the marks were to be returned so that justice and not the fine was manifestly the object for otherwise some farther provision would have been made that the fine should not be returned to the innocent inhabitants until the abilities of the guilty person to make it good were ascertained and besides the justice of the king could not legally be deferred because the law ordained that justice should be done upon the murderer fieret de eo justitia and there could be no other justice to expiate the crime of murder except the blood of the criminal after the laws of god were acknowledged by our anglo saxon ancestors so that the king could not remit the due punishment either for a fine or through favor without drawing upon his own head a share of the guilt of blood and as a proof of this the crime of wilful killing or murder was in the laws of k canute deemed oteless that is uneiable which is amply demonstrated by the learned mr justice aland in the preface to his edit of fortescues treatise on the difference between an absolute and limited monarchy p    to    see also my tract on crown law etc  plurimisque aliis sceleribus mulctae imponebantur pecuniariae cum hiis hac nostra tempestate as for instance

by the author to the committee of delegates from the several counties etc and entitled a proposal for removing the enormous disproportion of popular representation enjoyed by the corrupt and venal boroughs which boroughs are now vested or monopolized in the hands of a few individuals as private property a property avowedly estimated by the value of the seats in parliament instead of the only lawful property therein the real rentals of the tenements and at that unlawful and exorbitant estimation notoriously bought and sold to the disgrace and perversion of parliamentary authority the present great national evil the notorious misrepresentation of the commons in parliament cannot safely be remedied or altered for the purpose of amendment by any other mode than that of reverting back to the first principles of the constitution and by reviving the ancient rights of all denominations or classes of the people at the same time carefully rejecting every innovation that is not consistent in principle with the ancient usages of the realm of which the certain effects are already known whereas no human prudence can insure the real tendency and final effect of an innovation in matters of state howsoever plausible it may at first appear  though all true friends to the cause of liberty and the natural rights of mankind would wish that every man should vote for his representative in the national council without any other description of right or qualification than that of being a man yet if this has not already been the usage of the realm it is not perhaps advisable at least at present to be adopted  we know not what would be the effects of it probably they would be good but we ought to walk in a trodden path and build on sure foundations  that every man as such if he was but an inhabitant of a county did formerly vote in the court of that county called the plein county or full county at elections for the knights of the shire seems probable by the description of very great outrageous and excessive number of people dwelling within the same counties etc voting at such elections as mentioned in the act of   hen vi cap    which restrained the right of voting for knights to the freeholders of  0s per ann lands or tenements  but a just definition of terms will best show what description of persons have an unquestionable right to vote for representatives according to the fundamental principles of the constitution  the titles of freeholder and libertenens are ambiguous terms not sufficiently descriptive of the rank intended to be expressed for they are applied at present only to landowners that is to those who have at least a lifeinterest in lands or houses which last as being built on land do equally entitle the proprietor to the rank of a landowner but these ambiguous terms freeholders and liberi tenentes have sometimes been applied also to the freerenters of tenements by the year in contradistinction to the tenants at will and holders in villenage for the old saxon freoborges or freeburgesses that is the free pledges of the realm were equally free in their condition with those persons we now call freeholders though the tenure of many of them was not permanent they being by far the greatest part of them only the renters of tenements by the year though indeed the landowners themselves those that were housekeepers or householders must have been included under the same general description of freoborges  sir edward coke defines the meaning of the word burgh to be because it sends burgesses to parliament and though this is not the proper derivation of the word it is certainly the ancient usage of all boroughs as well as the right of all burgesses or freoborges for burghs were originally named from burgesses or freoborges i e freepledges it was in former times says sir edward coke speaking of the word burgh taken for those companies of ten families which were one anothers pledge and therefore a pledge in the saxon tongue a borhoe whereof some take it that a burgh came etc whereof also comes headborough or borrowhead capitalis plegius a chief pledge viz the chief man of the borhoe etc co lit p  0   in their collective capacity in tithings and hundreds many of which might be included in one borough and not vice versa the burgesses from the burghs which at present is commonly understood and may indeed in some cases of the more modern boroughs incorporated by charters be really the fact a different etymology may also be assigned to many towns the names of which end with berg or burg which signifies a fortification or castle from the greek  of which the learned sheringham has given some instances in his tract de anglorum gentis origin p       in the great annual courts of frankpledge throughout the kingdom every housekeeper was incorporated with nine other neighboring housekeepers archbishops bishops peers and other great men excepted who pledged their own households and were supposed in law to have a tithing within their own families but all other householders or renters of houses per annum were incorporated in distinct legal associations called tithings or decenaries from the incorporated number of housekeepers in each and though all youths of    or    years of age as also lodgers journeymen and male servants were likewise obliged to attend the great annual court of frankpledge and be there sworn to the kings peace and be also regularly included in the decenary and trained in the use of arms together with the ten housekeepers in whose families they were respectively included and numbered yet the ten housekeepers only were properly freoborges because they were the responsible persons who pledged all the rest and had a fixed habitation and certain interest in the state paying scot and lot being liable to all national as well as county and parish rates  and these ten freeborgs of each tithing were still farther distinguished by the title of deciners i e decenarii a term very properly expressive of their rank and quality as fixed and permanent members of a decenary consisting of ten such associated members one of which was annually elected chief of the ten or tithingman  the term deciner has been very much mistaken and misrepresented by law writers some applying it merely to the headborough or capitalisfriborgus the tithingman or head of each ten freeburgesses and others again to every man that was included in a tithing which is a gross abuse of the term for a tithing may consist of many more than ten even  0 or  0 males yet the ten housekeepers who are principally responsible and thereby actually constitute the decenary both in number and title those ten alone are properly the deciners of a tithing  again the word denizen has strangely puzzled the etymologists who have sought its derivation some from the french tongue others again from the ancient british but both equally in vain for though it appears that the britons had the term denizen in use amongst them before the coming in of the anglosaxons yet as all the roman colonies established among the britons were not only divided into centuriae or hundreds but had also their decuriones and consequently decenaries also for the captain of the ten could not be without the nine whom he headed both in their civil and military government it is clear that the term denizen is of pure latin original from the numeral adjective deni forming the latin verb denizo to express the adoption of any person into all the franchises and rights of a decenary and our lawwriters have regularly used the participle denizatus and the derivative substantive denizatio to express the introduction of aliens to the franchises of naturalborn subjects and yet they have not perceived the obvious meaning of these words both in sense and sound  for the alien is admitted by denization to all the rights of mutual protection enjoyed by the community of natives in their established decenaries and if he then becomes a housekeeper and one of the ten housekeepers who jointly constitute a tithing or decinary he is of course a deciner and with other deciners is an incorporated member of the county which he inhabits for as the hundreds are the constituent parts of the county and the tithings the constituent parts of each hundred it necessarily follows that the deciners are suitors of the countycourts which right at present is very improperly attributed to the freeholders or more properly to the landowners alone for the right of the deciners or free burgesses to the countycourts is demonstrated by the examples which have been given of general elections for knights citizens and burgesses all together promiscuously in the countycourts which i have recommended in a former tract see equitable representation necessary to the establishment of law peace and good government etc p       as one means of reducing the enormous disproportion of representation at present enjoyed by some particular boroughs to the effectual disfranchisement of all the rest whereby the kingdom has lost the means of expressing the sense of the people in parliament and the king has been deluded by majorities of alternate factions factions which falsely calling themselves the commons of england have plunged the nation into desperate measures and enormous expenses and thereby loaded it with a burden which it cannot possibly bear and retrieve without a speedy reformation  though the representatives of cities are now called citizens yet it appears that all cities and large towns have their right of voting as being ancient boroughs that is they had their right of voting from the inhabitants being freoborges or freepledges of each other in their respective decenaries as deciners and their right of becoming deciners arose from their being householders paying certain rent per annum or paying each of them yearly an annual rent for that is the true definition of burgagetenure as described by littleton and therefore not only householders whose houses are their own property but also every renter of a house or tenement who is equally liable to bear the burdens of the state by being rated to all public and parochial taxes ought to be admitted to vote for their representatives in parliament a right which they anciently enjoyed for of such old towns called boroughs says littleton p  0  b come the burgesses of the parliament when the king has summoned his parliament  the ancient city of westminster and many other cities for the towns that now be cities or counties in old time were boroughes and called boroughes for of such old towns called boroughs come the burgesses of the parliament etc lit p  0  b  as well as the ancient borough of southwark still retain the original usage and rights of burgagetenure the mere renters of houses or householders throughout all the parishes respectively included in each being still entitled to vote by ancient prescription which clearly proves the original nature of burgagetenure though it is very much altered in some other places partly through the encroachments of purchasers of boroughs to reduce the number of voters and partly by granting exclusive privileges to a few people in the incorporated chartered boroughs  the shortest and most easy mode of restoring to all the householders of this realm their ancient right of voting is first to restore their ancient capacity of deciners by advising them to throw themselves into tithings or decenaries and to hold annual courts of frankpledge now too long neglected for the renewal and continual preservation of the tithing associations  by this means both the civil and military government of the people will be completely restored and peace and defense will be completely secured so that housebreaking and robbery will no longer be known amongst us for such was once the happy state of the kingdom and effected by the very same regulations here recommended a farther advantage by restoring this ancient legal and constitutional mode of government will be that the exact proportions of the people in each county who have a right to vote will be truly ascertained whereby may hereafter be introduced a representation of all the counties perfectly equal in proportion to their respective numbers of householders for if in each county divisions were formed consisting each of  00 decenaries or tithings including  000 householders each that proportion will be found on calculation to contain the most convenient and proper number to be joined in the election of one deputy for parliament in order to obtain an equal representation of all the families in the kingdom and no persons will be excluded but servants and others who have no fixed habitation of their own and consequently at present have no permanent interest in the state or at least do not bear so large a proportion of relief to its burdens as the housekeepers do  two thousand families might well afford to pay ample wages to one representative and the stipend might be very easily collected if the decenaries were duly formed and established and the several courts which regularly arise from the decenaries viz the hundred courts and those which might most conveniently be added to superintend and regulate the hundred courts viz the court of one thousand families answering to those of the israelitish commonwealth the thousands of ephraim the thousands of judah and lastly the junction of two such courts of the thousand for the election of one representative this last proposed court of  000 householders would probably be equal to what some of the old trithing courts formerly were which are said to have sometimes included the third or fourth part of a county  if every division of  000 families were to elect one deputy to represent them in the great common council of the kingdom the whole number of representatives for south britain would amount according to the present state of population to about     this calculation is formed from the account of the number of houses charged chargeable and excused in      viz         see dr prices observations on the population of england and wales p    in my former proposal from which this is extracted where i make the number of representatives amount to  00 i have for the sake of a round number followed dr prices advice when he says concerning the number of houses in p    let it however he stated says he at a million  by which there would be a profitable reduction of    members  this would be no innovation because the election would still be vested where it ought viz in all the free householders or freeborges of all the counties and that in the most perfect proportion of equality and this order of equity would not be liable to change or to be corrupted because the number of deputies or delegates would rise or fall in due proportion with the degree of population in each county from time to time  granville sharp  tract number iii being a memorandum on a late proposal for a new settlement to be made on the coast of africa recommending to the author of that proposal several alterations in his plan and more especially the adoption of the ancient mode of government by tithings or decenaries and hundreds as being the most useful and effectual mode of government for all nations and countries the proposal for a settlement on the coast of africa will deserve all encouragement if the settlers are absolutely prohibited from holding any kind of property in the persons of men as slaves and from selling either man woman or child even to claim any human person as a slave ought to be considered as an affront to the whole community and be punished accordingly  with respect to the proposal for leave to purchase slaves the permission if granted at all must be very carefully guarded and the price given must be considered and declared at the time of purchase to be a mere pecuniary debt for redemption due from the person purchased to the society or state of the settlement and by no means to be tranferred to any single individual which would introduce domestic tyranny and traffic in the bodies of men but the debt to be discharged at leisure without increase or interest whenever the redeemed or his friends shall tender the amount of the first price in default of which the price should be worked out by a limited proportional service to the state and the state should hold forth at the same time ample encouragement to engage compliance and submission but it should be an established principle that the state or society ought rather to lose the value of the purchase than by compulsion to enforce involuntary servitude whereby honest labor that should always be deemed honorable is rendered odious and slavish  rules must also be laid down to prevent the monopoly of land within the bounds of the settlement and a sufficient reserve of land must be made for public services schools and religious instruction in each township and for cottage land to be distributed in small parcels to new settlers and redeemed captives which parcels must revert to the state or community for the same benevolent investiture to others of the like condition as soon as the temporary possessors are enabled to purchase larger lots for it will prevent in some degree the monopoly of land if the cottagelots are untenable with other land common land should also be reserved for a competent distance round each town and village wherein all inhabitants rich and poor should have an equal personal right because the claims of rich landholders when made in proportion to the size of their bordering estates is unreasonable and unjust and has occasioned a cruel perversion of the utility of common lands in england for the live stocks of rich farmers occasionally turned loose upon the commons generally deprived the cattle of the poor inhabitants of their necessary sustenance and the late divisions for enclosures by act of parliament having been for the most part inconsiderately granted in the same unjust proportions have at length nearly annihilated the common lands of england whereas on the contrary the large possessions of the neighboring landholders ought in reason and natural justice rather to have excluded them from the least share in the inheritance of the poor inhabitants or at most their share should have been merely personal as men and individuals equal to but not exceeding the claims of their neighbors that the common lands might be truly in common  the managers entrusted with the societys property to form the settlement should have no settled dominion or authority over the people as governors or judges but should be contented with that superiority and influence which their pecuniary trust as agents and overseers for the society will naturally afford them and their services may be amply rewarded and encouraged after the first years salary by an admission to a due proportion or share with the members of the society in the general profits of the settlement and in the profits of the common or public trade of the society but no private trade whatsoever should be permitted to any of the societys managers and agents  the officers for internal government as the governor or mayor the sheriffs and other magistrates constables etc etc should be freely elected every year by all the inhabitants due qualifications being premised to render men eligible to offices of dignity and trust  the purposes of the defense legislation public justice government and subordination of the settlers and their union as a community however large and extensive the settlements may hereafter become are points more easily to be accomplished than is generally conceived provided the ancient anglosaxon government by mutual frankpledge in tithings ordecenaries and hundreds a short yet very comprehensive and wellstated account of this ancient mode of government was published in the year    0 on the spur of an occasion which too clearly demonstrated the lamentable want of this excellent institution i mean the dangerous riots in that year which could not have proceeded to such an alarming excess had not this institution been long disused for otherwise the civil power as the sensible author remarks would have fully guarded us from its outrages p    i ascribe says he in letter ii p    the complete formation of those general outlines by which we have ever defined the english constitution to alfred on the authority of historians who specify the particular regulations which rendered his government so happy as well as glorious which have been in some degree preserved amidst violent and numerous revolutions to which every englishman has an unconquerable partiality and the restoration of which to their proper vigor and effect would secure our persons and property and preserve that peace and order which are so essential to the happiness of the community  keeping in view those general those beautiful outlines which were formed by the institutions of our early ancestors over which the people sighed when broken and deformed by the norman conquest by the bloody contests of the houses of lancaster and york by the tyranny of the house of tudor and the folly of that of stuart and an attention to which alone rendered the revolution a blessing we must define an english citizen to be a freeman who is to owe his protection and the security of his family and property to a civil government of which he is an essential member  you will observe sir that i confine myself to one object or one part of our constitution which provided for the safety of individuals and the preservation of order by the following regulations still existing in names and forms the revival of which would be the most beneficial and popular act of government which can well be imagined  the whole kingdom was as it is now divided into counties hundreds and tithings ten families were associated their names entered their occupations defined the males in them from eighteen to fifty or sixty years of age pledged themselves for the security of the tithing and to obey the summons of the decennary or tithingman on the least apprehension of danger they were furnished with such arms as the times afforded  the perfect knowledge which every neighborhood had of its inhabitants the concern which every man had in the security of every man and the obligation which every decennary was under to be answerable for his tithing either prevented all violations of peace and order or corrected them at their first origin  all the decennaries or tithingmen were chosen by the people once a year and this is an essential circumstance in the institution  the ten tithingmen of every district called a hundred because it contained a hundred families chose a person to preside over the hundred to whom they made their appeals and who had a power of calling them out all these were amenable to the earl or count who governed the county and he was amenable to the king who either by the earl or by the sheriff both of which were of his own appointment the worthy author in this point is mistaken the sheriff as well as the earl and heretock were in ancient times chosen by the people  could call out the whole force of a county or of any number of counties as the public exigencies required while the internal peace and order of each district was provided for without his interference and in a manner perfectly consistent with his general authority and influence  nothing has ever been imagined more simple in its construction or more effectual in the execution than this part of the english constitution the several powers of it which in most cases are in eternal discord are here so happily blended that the people are secure and free the kings power extends to every thing but mischief and is in reality greater than can be obtained on any other plan  these regulations might be easily restored and rendered as effectual as ever the prepossessions of the people are strongly in their favor and perhaps no others can be contrived which will not set the body of the people at enmity with government which will perfectly allay their apprehensions and jealousies will make them the ministers of their own security while the power of the king reaches every individual of them by a chain every link of which is effectual and will not interfere with the prerogative of the king in other departments of the state however the business of them may be administered      if you mean that it is impracticable says he in letter iii because the inhabitants of this country are too far advanced in luxury too indolent too effeminate to enter on any plan of security which will require the least trouble or put them to the least inconvenience and if you can ascertain this fact i have no answer to make but the trouble and inconvenience are such as would not be complained of by women what is it but an amusement to learn the common use of arms what inconvenience to submit to such regulations as may bring together a neighborhood a parish the ward of a city a town a district etc to clear them of vagabonds occasionally to assist the civil magistrate and to lay the basis of a general security confidence and strength where it ought to be laid in the whole body of the people  i will venture to affirm that there is no other method by which disturbances riots and insurrections can be prevented without debasing the people into the condition of brutes and there is no other method by which a king may hold every man in the nation in his hands while every man in the nation would feel and know himself to be as free as it is possible he should be in society  hints have been thrown out of acts of parliament which render such associations as i recommend illegal but the acts are not specified i know there are laws forbidding a mans going armed in a time of tranquillity and peace without leave from a magistrate and specifying such assemblies of people as are dangerous and seditious but without the most distant reference to the right which every man has from nature from the connivance of the most despotic governments and from the express provisions of the english constitution to provide for his own defense and that of his family and to unite with his neighborhood under the eye and direction of the supreme magistrate for the general peace and order of the community  if there were such laws as you mention they could not possibly have effect against not only a necessary right or nature but an essential principle of the english constitution if a law were made that because it is possible an english elector may become venal therefore all electors must relinquish the right of voting  would this constitute an obligation will any man say that the legislature is competent to the making of such a law  how much less to annihilate the first and most important principles of human society by awarding that as it is possible men may make an improper use of their limbs or their arms which may be as necessary as their limbs they must therefore suffer them to be taken off  the power of the legislature like every power in human society is limited by certain and accurate bounds it may exceed these bounds and commit absurdities and even offenses the english legislature is just as competent to make a law by which every englishman may be banished to the orkneys or put to death as it is to enjoin the people to give up the right of selfdefence and preservation by the use of their limbs or by the use of arms  the apprehension that associations will produce commotions and riots instead of preventing them must be pretended only and all the arguments for depriving the people of the right of associating because they have often assembled for mischievous purposes are delusive cardinal de retz says that all numerous assemblies are mobs and i will add that all mobs are mischievous let the people who might form such assemblies be divided into small bodies and though the individuals be not improved they will act reasonably and well the design of associations is to prevent large and tumultuous assemblies to arrange the people under the eye of government as accurately as an army without diminishing their constitutional independence and liberty to increase the difficulty of misleading them and to destroy all ideas of appeals to them  here i beg to be understood not as aiming at any of the rights of the people but the idea of an appeal to them has been borrowed from the government of rome in england it is like the introduction of military force a thing that negligence or mismanagement may render necessary but the constitution is perfect without it no supposition is made of the possibility of having any occasion to make it and whenever it is made the remedy may be as hazardous as any evil it can be designed to remove a whole nation like the human body in order to act with harmony and pleasure must be divided into small parts each having its local power subject to the direction and control of the general will p    to      be duly adopted and this being already consistent with the common law and ancient constitution of this kingdom still deemed legal though not in use might be lawfully established even if the settlement is made within the boundaries of the present english claims but in that case the legal process in all the courts of justice must be carried on in the kings name and the settlers may not refuse to admit a governor or lieutenant of the kings appointment with a limited delegation of authority according to the constitution of england whenever the privy council shall think proper to send one  but if the settlement be attempted in any other part of africa not claimed by european powers the managers must first obtain the consent and association if possible of the native inhabitants or else the establishment must be made on an uninhabited part of the coast and as the majority of the settlers will probably be negroes returned from slavery and oppression to their native soil there will be no necessity to form the plan of government strictly by the constitutional model of england any farther than reason and experience may suggest the adoption of some particular parts of it but we may in that case assume the liberty of drawing a precedent for government from more ancient and more perfect documents than our saxon records viz from the example or rather the original intention of the israelitish commonwealth purified and improved by the general precepts and maxims of the gospel and by the example of free congregational government amongst the primitive christians who decided their own temporal litigations and differences  things pertaining to this life   cor vi      as well as ecclesiastical questions in their regular assemblies of all the people which method was an ancient ethnic custom derived probably from patriarchal times as appears by the example of the pagan ephesians recorded in acts xix       whom their town clerk referred to a lawful assembly  apparently distinct as the context proves from their ordinary courts of justice then subject to the romans for the examination and resolution of all extraordinary questions  the israelitish government under the theocracy was administered by freelyelected judges and officers see my tract on the law of nature p     to     throughout all the tribes and cities or gates except in the extraordinary cases of prophetical judges though these were probably elected likewise as soon as their superior or supernatural abilities became generally known  they had a regular gradation of official power heads of tens of fifties of hundreds and of thousands besides the provincial governors who were ancient heads of houses or tribes these altogether formed one great band of allegiance uniting the whole community together for action and defense as one man with one mind viz by the free resolutions of the majority the smaller divisions being regularly included and controuled in the larger and the individuals of all the divisions being mutually bound to each other by the reciprocal ties or allegiance of frankpledge which our saxon ancestors and many other even savage and heathen nations the romans had their decuriones and centuriones not only in their military but also in their civil government and consequently they must have had the popular divisions of tithings and hundreds much in the same manner as those established by k alfred in england in imitation of the israelitish commonwealth and even the chinese and japonese it is said have tithings to this day  have in some degree maintained probably from the patriarchal times for all men having the knowledge of good and evil are capable of this form of government if it is once properly explained to them and established and there is no mode of defending restraining and keeping in order a promiscuous body of men so cheap so easy or so certainly effectual for every profitable purpose as that of mutual government by the principles and maxims of right in such equal proportioned congregations each of which is a constituent part or member of a more powerful congregation in the great unity or commonwealth wherein every individual however violent or morose in himself is prevented from injuring others by having his person and his property rendered answerable for all damages which he either occasions by his own rapacious violence or caprice or which he does not endeavor to prevent in others as a member of the tithing wherein any violence or offense is committed for according to the law of frankpledge no man is entitled to liberty omnis homo qui voluerit se teneri pro libero sit in plegio ut plegius eum habeat ad justitiam si quid offenderit etc see lambards archionomia p     b  that is not duly pledged by his nearest neighbors for the mutual conservation of peace and right  under this form of government all public works as entrenchments or earthworks and fortifications to secure the towns and strengthen the country canals and highways for public passage sewers and drains for the general health of the country etc may be formed and maintained by a rotation of service in which the value of daily attendance must be estimated that defaulters may bear their share or rather a double share of the burden and the expense of watch and ward or military service must be defrayed in the same manner by which means no debt will be incurred for the defense of the state rich funds may also be obtained to support the credit of a public exchequer without laying any perceptible burden on the community by a general agreement to punish by fines and mulcts in due proportion to the wealth and possessions of delinquents increasing likewise by repetition for all offenses as well of omission or neglect of public duty as of commission except for murder rapes and unnatural crimes which by the laws of god are unpardonable by any community the people themselves to be judges people of the vicinage unexceptionably disinterested liable besides to the challenge of the parties and duly sworn according to the known laws of english juries to do right in the presence of the ordinary judges and officers elected to preside and keep order in the assemblies  granville sharp old jewry aug        tract number iv an easy and practicable plan for laying out settlements on uncultivated lands in equal divisions of ten tithings or  00 families each whereby new colonies may be most advantageously formed and extended in regular districts of hundreds agreeable to the ancient legal divisions of our anglosaxon ancestors several years ago i made some memorandums of a method of forming frontier settlements which i copied from the second edition of a book first printed at philadelphia but reprinted at london in      and entitled an historical account of the expedition against the ohio indians in the year      under the command of henry bouquet esquire to which are annexed military papers containing reflections on the war with the savages a method of forming frontier settlements etc my reference for the lastmentioned subject is to p    of the said book but as i have not the book itself at present i cannot pretend to be perfectly accurate in my quotations from it neither do i remember whether the author recommended a government by tithing and hundred courts with their proper officers according to the anglosaxon model but only that his proposed settlements were happily for my present purpose laid out in equal divisions of one hundred lots each for the maintenance of one hundred families so that of course the constitutional regulations for hundreds recommended in the preceding tracts will not be less suitable and beneficial to his scheme than his certainly is to mine  let us suppose a settlement says he to be formed for one hundred families composed of five persons each upon an average  lay out upon a river or creek a squ of    0 yards or a mile for each side that square will contain   0 acres allowance for streets and public uses  0   0 acres to half an acre for every house  0   0 acres to  00 lots at   acres   0   0 acres the four sides of the square measures  0 0 yards which gives to each house about  0 yards in front to stockade and the ground allowed for building will be   0 feet front and about  00 feet deep  an acre of ground will produce at least  0 bushels of indian corn therefore two acres are sufficient to supply five persons at the rate of    bushels each person two other acres will be for cows and sheep another for hay or to be sown with red clover the remaining half acre may be laid out for a garden thus far the authors plan may be applicable to lands even in england especially if laid out in less divisions of tithings instead of hundreds preserving the same due proportion of land in lots for each family the ten families with their habitations would form a compact little village under the government of a tithingman annually elected from among themselves whereby all would be rendered mutually responsible for each other for the common peace and to make good every damage that might be occasioned by the ill behavior of any individual among them an estate laid out in small farms with such a tithing village in the center of it for a constant supply of laborers might be made to maintain a much greater number of people than land generally does in the ordinary way of farming and would consequently be much more beneficial both to the landlords and to the nation at large commons and waste forests or chases might thus be laid out and occupied by the laboring poor to the great reduction of parish rates as well as of the price of labor for free and useful laborers would never be wanting if such a regular provision under their own management could be found for their families but the possession of such parishlots should be limited to those persons who occupy no other land and should be delivered up to the parish or community for the use of other unprovided families as soon as any possessor obtains more land either as a farm or in fee as recommended in a former tract to prevent the monopoly of land and the entire deprivation of the poor from any share in it as at present  the remainder of the authors scheme is suitable only to unoccupied countries like many parts of africa and america where the people are few and the lands of small value viz round the town says he are the commons of three miles square containing exclusive of the lots abovementioned    0 acres on three sides of the town five other squares will be laid out of three square miles containing    0 acres each one of which is reserved for wood for the use of the settlement the other four to be divided into    outlots or plantations of about   0 acres each so that in the four squares there will be  00 such plantations for the  00 families another township may be laid out joining this upon the ame plan and as many more as you please upon the same line without losing any ground  the following is a rough sketch of the whole    the banks of the river as in ancient times should be deemed common or public as the river itself under the conservation of the community and should be reserved for future improvements as for the accommodation not only of fishermen but also of manufacturers traders and of all industrious strangers and docks or navigable cuts whenever the level of the country will permit should be made from the river as far back at least as the center between every two townships  the spaces between the squares are left for roads and common communications between the several lots and the roads which divide two distinct townships should be still more spacious for the common use of all the inhabitants the cartage of their produce and other traffic the driving of cattle etc and a spacious road to be formed lengthways throughout the whole settlement ought in forming the lots to be reserved through the center of each township the central lots which will thereby be diminished in size will find ample compensation in value by their situation on the great central road which i have expressed by a dotted line i do not remember whether any roads or spaces for them were expressed in the original plan of the author  i would likewise deviate from the original plan of the author with respect to the situation of the    0 acres of woodland for each township which i conceive had better be reserved in one of the most distant squares at an angular situation from each town instead of being in the opposite square according to his proposal for the towns will not only be more healthy by having the uncleared lands more distant from them but also the inhabitants when on watch and ward duty will be better enabled to discover the approach of any lurking savages or other enemies in time of war  granville sharp old jewry aug        tract number v a farther declaration of the ancient popular or congregational right to elect bishops intended to illustrate more effectually a maxim of the common law cited in p    viz ordo episcoporum est robur reipublicae jenk cent p    ordo episcoporum est robur reipublicae jenk cent p    it is an established maxim of the common law of england that the order of bishops is the strength force or hability of the commonwealth but in order to render this maxim obvious and unquestionable we must necessarily imply and include in the episcopal function that very important branch of it already mentioned viz the presiding as chief popular magnistrates in the congregational courts of common law see second note in p    leges edgari etc  and we must also suppose the continuance or reestablishment of the primitive christian freedom in episcopal elections that the bishops by real popular elections may be truly popular magistrates worthy to be entrusted with the civil as well as the ecclesiastical interests of the commonwealth mr sadler in his rights of the kingdom speaking of the time of k henry ii says  it seems considerable how all historians of that time and dispute do record the choice of bishops to be in the people in plebe and in populo as well as in clero they mention radulph ordained a bishop for the orcades but rejected by all because not elected by common assent of the people plebis clero for cleri  principis it is every where in the old monks and how the poor bishop wandered up and down as an assistant to other prelates etc see p     and more instances also at p     the learned author of a tract printed several years ago as appears by the list of tracts published at the same time but without a date entitled lex parliamentaria or a treatise of the law and custom of parliament etc has cited various proofs of the peoples right to elect bishops  that for some years says he after this new charter granted in this english parliament meaning a parliament held at london by k henry i the people were generally restored to the right of electing their own magistrates and officers civil military and ecclesiastical and this says the learned author i take to be the grand foundation of the magna charta of english liberties ie as it gave relaxation from norman tyranny and slavery and this may teach us that the rights and liberties of the commons of england are neither so illegally begotten as by rebellion nor of such tender years as some imagine but if any man is not convinced from what i have before produced touching the origin of english parliaments and the antiquity of the house of commons let him peruse the authors cited in the margin dier  0 and  0 see mirror c   sect   bra flet lambards archaion            sir r atkins p  0    etc vide post c   and    especially the treatise writ by that learned judge sir robert atkins

which other authors confirm and enlarge that one ranulph bishop of durham whom mat etc adorn with the sublime titles of vir pessimus and corruptissimus homo perversus and ad omne scelus paratus vir

and henrico coronato de communi consilio gentis anglorum posuit rex eum in vinculis etc  nor was the concurrence of the commons in parliament requisite only to the imprisonment or exauctoration of bishops rights of the kingdom p           0 etc  the same assent seems as necessary and that too in a superior degree as to their election or confirmation diverse instances of this appear in the historians of those times i shall select some to prove it then the custom of england scotland wales ireland france etc  anno      ralph bishop of rochester sax chr p  0   was elected archbishop of canterbury by the king annuente plebe and clero eadmer  this was done in communi consilio apud windsore hoveden  and i find about the same time that another ralph who had been ordained a bishop in scotland was rejected by all because not elected with the consent of the people etc and notwithstanding his consecration was forced to wander about and officiate as a coadjutor to other bishops  about the year    0 malmsb  one david was consecrated bishop of bangor by the then archbishop of canterbury but it is expressly said that he had been thereto elected a principe clero and populo walliae i e by a welsh parliament and in the same reign one gregory an irish abbot was elected to the bishopric of dublin a rege hiberniae and clero and populo an irish parliament so that the commons at this time were a constituent part of the scottish welsh and irish parliaments as well as with us in england  and in the year      vide sax chr sub an       i find that famed scholar gilbertus universalis to be elected and consecrated bishop of london annuente clero and populo this seems at a parliament at london  but this right of the commons in electing bishops does more clearly appear in henry iis time when all historians agree it to be a general custom both here and in france and seems founded on diverse express canons of the primitive church insomuch as mezeray in his history asserts that until that time i e the middle of the   th century the voice of the people in electing bishops was esteemed the voice of god  even the histories published by papal authority bear ample testimony of the peoples right and the exercise of it in ancient times though it has been long usurped by that very authority see italia sacra the history of the italian bishops cited in the former tract vol i p      in the account of the bishops of tarracina where it is expressly declared that on the death of avitus bishop of tarracina st valentine was elected bishop by the clergy and people of that city s valentinus clari et flaviae nobiliss terracinensium filius defuncto avito a clero et populo ejusdem civitutis episcopus electus etc st valentine is said to have suffered martyrdom about the year      in the account of the archbishops of florence vol iii p    of the said work zenobius about the year     is said to have been elected not only by the clergy but by all the people which unanimity was esteemed a divine call not lawfully to be refused non solum a clero sed etiam ab universo populo solemniter ad pontificatus this expression pontificatus for episcopatus is much more modern than the times to which it is here applied though considered perhaps as a synonymous term by the compiler of this history who of course may be supposed to express himself in the modern language of his own times there are many examples of the like gross misapplication of this word and also of pontifex for episcopus by ecclesiastical historians but we are not therefore to conceive that they found these words so applied in the ancient records from which they compiled their histories for the word pontifex did not signify a christian bishop the etymology of the word being deducible entirely from a gross pagan ceremony as i have already shown in p    peculiar to rome itself and applicable to none but the pagan augurs of rome until the roman emperors of the western branch usurped the title of pontifex maximus for political purposes and whilst they continued in power to maintain it which they did at least to the death of valentinian iii ac     if not to the time of augustulus when the western branch of the roman empire was entirely abolished by odoacer in the year     no bishop could either have the power or even an inducement to assume the title of pontifex until the imperial head to which it was inseparably annexed became as it were wounded to death nor until the time was come that this deadly wound was to be healed and woe be to that bishop who first disgraced his function by that fatal mark apicem est electus nec vero licuit ei reniti vel obsistere istius modi electioni quorum ut praefatus sum ita consensu et annisu omnium suorum concivium fuerat postulatus ad ejusdem ecclesiae gubernacula ut palam daretur intelligi divinitus eum ad ejusmodi fuisse officium invitatum and about the year of christ     silvianus an african was elected bishop of tarracina a clero et populo tom i p    0 but the language respecting the appointment of the bishops of tarracina was totally different in the very next century nay even under their saint gregory or pope gregory the great the papal usurpation on the rights both of clergy and people was become shamefully notorious for we read of bishops taking the charge of the church of tarracina ex imperio magni gregorii by the command of great gregory great gregory indeed he might well be called for the popes having then lately see p    revived the imperial title of pontifex maximus were become suitably great and imperious in their language so that notwithstanding the countertitle of servus servorum dei which gregory had hypocritically assumed as a cloak of humility to cover the pride of the former title yet in his imperious language he sufficiently manifested the character of the little horn foretold by daniel chapter vii   in which were eyes like the eyes of a man i e the horn was to be a bishop or rather a succession of bishops who are properly seeers or overseers viz  very aptly represented by the eyes of a man and a mouth speaking great things and accordingly we read of agnellus bishop of funda or fanda who managed the church of tarracina ex imperio by the command of great gregory aguellus fundanus episcopus tarracinensem ecclesiam administravit ex imperio magni gregorii etc tom i p      and also that constantius bishop of palermo had charge of the flock of tarracina ex imperio by the command of the same st gregory the pontifex constantius panormitanus episcopus curam gessit de grege tarracinen ex imperio ejusdem s gregorii pontif uti palam fit ex lib   epist    tom i p      thus the popes began to elude the election of bishops by appointing other bishops to take care of the vacant sees but they afterward boldly took the election even nominally upon themselves which before they had usurped indeed in effect but did not so openly profess and accordingly in the very same page we read of one ambrosius a monk being elected bishop of tarracina by pope alexander ii in the year  0   ab alexandro ii electus fuit episcopus an  0   and also of one gregory another monk being elected gregorius monachus casinensis a paschali ii pontifice electus etc bishop of tarracina by pope paschal ii  the popes obtained this absolute dominion over episcopal elections by various arts and wiles and by gradual encroachments craftily made according to the circumstances of the people they intended to deceive from time to time and they always advanced in their demands after the admission of every unjust claim which demonstrates the danger of swerving in any respect from primitive usages the monkish clergy in every part of the world in proportion as the false notions of the sanctity of celibacy advanced and prevailed were regularly the instruments employed in thus sapping the rights of the clergy and people but the fathers at the council of laodicea which was as early as the year of christ     or     according to bishop beveridge see dr caves hist eccles p     did not proceed so gradually in sapping the rights of the people but boldly excluded them at once from all interference at episcopal elections see canon xii and also from the appointment of priests see canon xiii which however as the learned patriarch of antioch balsamon has remarked affords proof that not only bishops were elected in ancient times by the multitudes or people  but even the priests also  says balsamon  etc that the people were allowed a share in the election even of their priests as well as of their bishops appears also by a quotation which i find in the m s notitia ecclesiastica of the learned dr mangey before cited viz did lxxvi can quicunque exinde jam accessu temporum presbyterio vel episcopatui si eum cleri et plebis evocaverit electio societur vide anton aug epic juris pont lib   tit    the figure preceding the   is blotted and not legible  et lib   tit    and that it was an established practice in spain for the clergy and people of each city or district to elect priests appears by the   th canon of the fourth council of toledo sed nec ille deinceps sacerdos erit quem nec clerus nec populus propriae civitatis elegerit vel auctoritas metropolitani vel comprovincialium sacerdotum assensio exquesivit etc consilium toletarum iv anno c     sacrosancta concilia tom   par edit        the monkish prelates in the second council of arles at a much later period ad     durst not proceed so rapidly against the peoples right of election though shamefully bold at that time in promoting the doctrines of doemons by prohibiting marriage or in the words of scripture forbidding to marry see the second third fourth and   d   th   th and   d canons of that council but with respect to episcopal elections they seem to have affected an imitation though a very delusive one of the ancient mode of electing two or three persons as described in a note of a former tract p      0 and they thought themselves obliged still to acknowledge that the people were entitled to some share in the election which however they reduced to as small a proportion as they could venture to do at that time and craftily stated it in a most precarious light to leave room for farther innovation viz that three persons should be nominated by the bishops i e instead of the people as before out of which three persons the clergy or citizens should have power to elect one placuit thus like popes and kings they manifested their will and pleasure against right in ordinatione episcopi hunc ordinem custodire ut primo loco venalitate vel ambitione submota tres ab episcopis nominentur de quibus clerici vel cives erga unum eligendi habeant potestatem concilium arelatense ii can    howels synop can p  0  these are farther proofs of the deceivableness of unrighteousness mentioned in p       by which the monastic clergy rendered themselves too generally the notorious instruments of the man of sin the word vel is artfully inserted instead of the copulative et between the words clerici and cives that the acknowledged right of the citizens might be occasionally suppressed whenever the temper of the times would permit the same crafty insertion of vel for et metropolitanus episcopus a comprovincialibus episcopis clericis vel populis electus etc howels synop can p     may be seen in the seventh canon of the second council of orleans concilium aurelianense ii ad     where it is manifestly intended as a preparatory step to the suppression of the peoples share in the election  the like monkish craft appears also in the third canon of the third council of orleans de comprovincialibus vero ordinandis cum consensu metropoliti cleri vel civium etc ibid p      ad     but though this deceitful mode of innovation could pass at arles and orleans yet it was too gross to be admitted in the capital of france at a still later period for even so late as the third council of paris a d     we find the right of the clergy and people to elect bishops expressly juxta antiquam consuetudinem etc publicly asserted and established and even the royal interference or mandate most carefully and in express terms prohibited see sacrosancta consilia tom   p     paris edit      concilium parisiense iii circa annum christi dlvii pelagii papae iii childeberti regis xlvi cviii  et quia in aliquibus rebus consuetudo prisca negligitur ac decreta canonum violantur placuit ut juxta antiquam consuetudinem canonum decreta serventur nullus civibus invitis ordinetur episcopus nisi quem populi et clericorum electio plenissima quaesierit voluntate non principis imperio neque per quamlibet conditionem contra metropolis voluntatem vel episcoporum comprovincialium ingeratur quod si per ordinationem regiam henoris istius culmen pervadere aliquis nimia temeritate praesumpserit a comprovincialibus loci ipsius episcopus recipi nullatenus mereatur quem indebite ordinatum agnoscunt si quis de comprovincialibus recipere contra interdicta praesumpserit sit a fratribus omnibus segregatus et ab ipsorum omnium caritate semotus etc and because in some things the ancient usage is neglected and the decrees of the canons are violated it pleased the assembly to ordain that the decrees of the canons should be observed according to ancient usage no person contrary to the will of any citizens shall be ordained bishop except him whom the election of the people and clergy shall have required by the most ample desire by the most manifest majority in sentiment let not any bishop be brought in by the command of the prince or king nor through any condition or terms whatsoever against the will of the metropolitan or of the conprovincial bishops but if by royal appointment any bishop with too much rashness shall presume to pass through or attain the summit of this honor he by no means deserves to be received by the conprovincial bishops of that province whom they know to be unduly appointed if any one of the conprovincial bishops shall presume to receive him contrary to these prohibitions let him be severed from all the brethren and removed from the esteem of all of them etc which is clearly the penalty of excommunication decreed against any bishop that shall presume to acknowledge the authority of any royal appointment to the dignity of a bishop and they had it in their power to render such appointments null and void by refusing the essential introduction to the office the giving an episcopal commission by laying on of hands and previous prayer  but the grand enemy to law and right  the papal power found means at length to dispense with this just parisian law for pope zacharias the same that absolved pepin from his oath of allegiance to king childeric iii thought proper also in the plenitude of his dispensing power to indulge king pepin that he might nominate bishops to be ordained throughout the kingdom of france as any sees should become vacant see italia sacra tom i p    hic pontifex speaking of sanctus zacharias a benedictine monk made pope ad     pipino regi francorum indulsit ut per galliae regnum in episcopos ordinandos ubi seeds vacasset aliqua nominaret   the danger of regal influence in episcopal elections had been early foreseen and carefully guarded against not only by the council of paris last cited but also by the primitive church the peculiar care and caution of the primitive church to preserve episcopal elections from undue influence is worthy to be remarked because it demonstrates the existence and preeminence of the episcopal order in the church clearly distinct and superior in office and degree to the order of presbytery from the apostolic times and though all bishops must certainly be presbyters yet the constantreordination of every presbyter after being elected or nominated to the office of a bishop by the same essential rites of solemn prayer for the guidance and assistance of the holy spirit with the imposition of hands demonstrates that presbyters though really pastors and in some respect overseers of distinct flocks or congregations of christians yet were not properly bishops  in the primitive ecclesiastical sense until admitted to that dignity by the renewal of their sacred orders with the express designation to the episcopal function for the essential rights of ordination prayer for the holy spirit and laying on of hands are the same for all the three degrees of the christian ministry differing only in the designation to their respective duties of deacons presbyters and bishops  and thereby the wickedness of this lawless pope and his indulgence to k pepin is rendered the more conspicuous the learned bishop beveridge gives a decided opinion that the  0th canon of the ancient codex which he calls codex canonum primitivae ecclesiae was necessarily ordained lest any person by money or means of secular powers should be promoted but only by the free election of the clergy and people ne quis pecunia aut secularium potestatum open sed liberatantum cleri populique electione promoveatur see his codex canonum ecclesiae primitivae vindicatus etc p  0  but no comment can be more clear and decided than the canon itself in guarding against the interference of princes viz if any bishop having availed himself of the power or influence of worldly princes shall through them have obtained authority over a church let him he deposed and separated or excommunicated and also all those that communicate or have fellowship with him  see bishop beveridges codex canonum primitivae ecclesiae can  0 p     the council of paris before cited seems to have copied the spirit of this law thus the most jealous republicans may be convinced that episcopacy has no necessary connection with monarchy but on the contrary is an institution which ought to be entirely independent of it independent i mean with respect only to nomination or election to the dignity so that royal mandates and letters missive with the conge delire are by no means founded in right but are only modern encroachments promoted by popes and monks when they were unable to monopolize the power of election to themselves for they would rather throw the nomination into the power and will of arbitrary princes than see it lawfully exercised by the clergy and people provided their partial favor toward royalty were admitted as an indulgence from their own plenitude of power but though king pepin was base enough to avail himself of the presumptuous and wicked encroachment of pope zachary on the peoples rights yet his son and grandson were more honorable than their ancestor and instead of basely accepting this most unjust papal indulgence on the contrary asserted the popular right to elect bishops in the plainest and most unequivocal terms and nobly and disinterestedly rescued it from the usurpations of the monkish clergy which had almost universally prevailed for some time before for the emperor charles the great most nobly ordained that bishops should be chosen according to the statutes of the canons by the election of the clergy and people of the proper diocese see capitularia caroli magni lib i    ut episcopi per electionem cleri et populi secundum statuta canonum de propria diocesi elegantur and the emperor lewis the good or ludovicus pius also asserted the same just rights of the clergy and people let a bishop be elected by the clergy and people of the proper diocese without respect of persons or bribes but on account of worthiness of life and gift of wisdom see capitularia ludovici pii which are annexed to the canons of the third council of aix  concilium aquisgranense iii a d     sub ludovico pio celebratum cap   episcopus per clerum et populum eligatur de propria dioecesi absque personarum et munerum acceptione ob vitae meritum et sapientiae donum howels synop can p  0    these excellent laws would probably have continued in force much longer than they did if they had been observed with the primitive precautions stated in a former note viz to elect two and afterward to decide by lot because this ancient mode of exercising the joint elective rights of clergy and people is so safe and perfectly unexceptionable that it must have obviated the plausible objection that was usually alleged by popes and monks against popular elections ie the danger of exciting party animosities and tumults the monks however were not able entirely to set aside these excellent constitutions of charles and lewis for several years afterward and the influence of them seems to have extended even to rome itself for the bishops at a lateran council not less than    years afterward viz a d     asserted the rights of the clergy and people and even the pope himself nicolas i concurred the more willingly perhaps because the general purpose of the canons then made was to curb the extravagance of a rival metropolitan john viii archbishop of ravenna whose province was entitled aemilia the very first canon was to restrain the archbishop from consecrating bishops throughout the province of aemilia except after the election of the clergy and people a testimony highly to the point in question and the more especially if we consider that it proceeded from a quarter the seat of usurpation that had long been inimical to all popular rights see caput primum  episcopos per aemiliam non consacres nisi post electionem cleri et populi italia sacra tom   p     this canon would have done more honor however to the lateran council and pope nicolas had it extended to episcopal elections in general instead of being confined to the province of aemilia the archbishop of aemilia had probably encroached on the elective rights of the clergy and people of his province but this alone could not have been considered at rome as a crime it having been the regular practice of the popes themselves had he not at the same time professed independence of the roman see and the pontif though probably like his prececessors a natural enemy to the elective rights of the clergy and people was content it seems to acknowledge them whilst the reformation tended to reduce the pretensions of his rival and indeed he gained a complete conquest over him by means of this lateran council wherein he reduced him to the pitiful dilemma of accepting a continuance of his preferment on the most humiliating terms of submission to the roman see which was by no means due from a metropolitan bishop and compelled him basely and dishonestly to yield up the just rights and independence of his province to the encroaching jurisdiction of the papal power  a very few years afterward about the year     pope john viii or rather john ix as he is styled by platina many ancient writers of good repute represent pope john viii to have been a woman and some of them add that he was even an english woman it is therefore to avoid the throwing any farther unnecessary blame on our reputed countrywoman that i say rather john ix than john viii because the times i speak of were about the quarter part of a century later than the period usually assigned for the infallible dominion of our extraordinary english pope of late indeed it has been a sort of fashion amongst protestant writers as well as papists to deem the story of pope joan a mere fable thus much however is certain that if it be a fable it was not invented by the protestants accounts of it were written by undoubted catholics some centuries before the reformation and these accounts were even printed several years before either luther or calvin were preachers martin the author quoted for it by platina was a dominican friar apostolicchaplain under pope nicolas iii ad      and was afterward a popish archbishop in poland so that from his situation and rank in life it was neither probable that he should want the best information on that subject which the times he lived in could afford nor that he should adopt such a story had it not been current and generally admitted at that time platina who quotes him was employed by pope sixtus iv to write the history of the popes and would not surely have quoted this story from martin if he had thought that it might with propriety have been absolutely rejected but on the contrary he is so far from making martin alone answerable for the story that he declares it to be the common report  haec quae dixi vulgo feruntur commonly reported it seems by several authors whom he is pleased however to deem uncertain and obscure incertis tamen et obscuris auctoribus though he had no right to include martin in this vague censure in the very next sentence however he entirely exculpates him as well as his obscure authors from the invention of the story by adding that it was what almost all affirm quod fere omnes affirmant see p    a this was printed at venice in     werneris rollwinck who in his fasciculus temporum relates the story without expressing the least doubt about the truth of it was a carthusian friar so that he was as little likely as the two former writers to publish this account through any pique or prejudice against the papacy rollwink has also added that this john was the sixth pope who had the name of sanctity without the thing itself and like others was also smitten of god and not placed in the catalogue of pontiffs et hic sextus videtur fuisse papa qui nomen sanctitatis sine re habuit usque huc et similiter sicut alii a deo plagatus fuit nec ponitur in catalogo pontificum see p    b this was printed in the year      in the chronicle of sigebert the story is related as a current report i e fama  fama est hunc joannem foeminam fuisse etc this author was a benedictine monk about the year   00 and his work was printed by h stephens the french kings printer at paris in      so that there is no reason to suspect either the author or the printer of partiality against popery of all these different authors except the first martin i have the printed copies before me of the several dates abovementioned many other authors i find quoted for the story who were also professed roman catholics as marianus scotus a monk at mentz who wrote a chronicle about the year  0   the chronicle also of petrarque printed at florence in      that of antoninus who was archbishop of florence and died a d      that of the abbe trithemius and also the commentaries of raphael volatteranus dedicated to pope julius ii etc etc etc and all before the protestant times so that the fable if it is one must not be attributed to protestants but we cannot say so much for the opposition that has been made to it for the protestants may certainly be said to have innocently occasioned it though they cannot justly be answerable for the futility of the farfetched arguments and pretenses that have been raked together by learned jesuits for that purpose the advancement of the reformation rendered it necessary indeed for the honor of the eternal city to patch up and plaster over the incurable sores and blains of the papal pretenders to infallibility but after all the pains that have been taken the reasons or rather excuses alleged for the first introduction of the perforated chair the famous seeds stercoraria see platina p    are so frivolous and unsatisfactory that they seem much more improbable and fabulous than the plain fable itself as they presume to call it which most naturally accounts for the absurdity  openly availed himself of this newly acquired extension of power by ostentatiously submitting the archbishops of ravenna together with the archbishops also of milan against all probability of right or seemliness to the jurisdiction of the bishops of pavia or more properly papia a very ominous appellation derived as even my popish author admits see italia sacra tom i p  0   from the latin interjection pape o wonderful or o strange the pontif however thought himself obliged to admit at the same time the elective rights of the clergy and people of pavia probably the better to secure from examination and opposition the usurped authority of the privilegium as he called it whereby he exalted the bishops of papia above their brethren the independent metropolitans of ravenna and milan this privilegium would not have been mentioned by me had it not contained an express testimony   decernimus ut si humana contradictione probably for condition tuae sedis episcopus ex hoc mundo migraverit de proprio clero quem idoneum prae caeteris clerus et populus repererit potestatem habeant secundum statuta venerabilium patrum et romanae sedis antistitum nulla seculari contradicente potentia eligendi episcopum italia sacra tom i p  0   to the popular right of election and the author of italia sacra speaking farther of this pope john and bishop john relates that the latter obtained these and also other privileges in a council held at papia by pope john but these it seems were the chief as being the only privileges he has particularized in quo concilio ab eodem pontifice alia obtinuit priviligia ac praecipue ut populo cleroque papiensi suum episcopum eligendi jus esset eidemque concessit ut quoties mediolanensem ac ravennatensem archiepiscopos cum suis suffraganeis ad synodum vocaret accederent etc italia sacra tom i p  0    about seven or eight years before this time viz a d     or   0 the   th council of constantinople entitled by the popish or latin party the eighth general council wickedly declared against the unalienable popular right of electing bishops and formed a canon expressly against it pope john therefore on the lastmentioned occasion might have besides his partiality to the bishop of papia a still farther inducement for reestablishing the clergy and people of papia in their just right of election viz to demonstrate the plenitude of his power in dispensing with laws because whatever tends to aggrandize the papal jurisdiction may sometimes afford an ample reason even for a pontif to do right the same reason probably may be assigned for the continuance of popular elections even at rome itself long after the said decree of the general council against them for pope adrian iii in the year     was so bold  tanti animi fuit says platina in behalf of this just right that he announced it to the senate and people viz that in creating a pope the authority of the emperor should not be waited for and that the suffrages of the clergy and people should be free adrianus iii patria romanus patre benedicto tanti animi fuit ut init o pontificatus sui statim ad senatum populumque retulerit anno domini dcccxcv ne in creando pontifice imperatoris auctoritas expectaretur utque libera essent et cleri et ppuli suffraga quod quidem inst tu um a nicolao primo tenta um potiusquam inchoatum diximus but mak the leading cause of adrians boldness ilectum credo hac opportunitate adrianum quod karolus imperator ab italia cum exeritu discedeus in normannos rebellantes moyerat and he adds that this institution was rather attempted than begun by pope nicolas i but this however was not the case for even he himself relates in his accounts of pope nicolas on the preceding page not only that the clergy and people did really elect without waiting for the imperial will but also that letters were afterward received from the emperor lewis ii in which he highly commended the romans that they had knowingly and wholly created their own chief pontif without waiting for the wish of others who perhaps in that business through the want of personal knowledge might have had less judgment supervenere a ludovico imperatore literae quibus romanos adniodum laudat quod summum pontisicem sciente et integre creassent non expectato aliorum voto qui forte ea in re ob ignorationem personarum minus judicii habuissen   it is manifest therefore that platina was inclined to attribute the merit of promoting free popular elections at rome rather to the pope than to the emperor to whom it was more strictly due even according to his own evidence for popes and monks could not endure a concurrent right of the people in episcopal elections except when it might seem to aggrandize the holy see as a peculiar privilege or unless it were admitted in any particular place by papal favor and indulgence as at papia for the like purpose of aggrandizement but in all other cases they were the regular professed enemies to popular right so that to their influence and not to the influence of imperial or royal power is the wicked decree against free elections to be attributed and this was carried it seems on the stale pretense of probable tumults and the confusion that a multitude of electors might occasion just as the present tumults in westminster afford to the enemies of the english constitution an exulting argument against the ancient right of frequent elections who instead of being willing to correct the abuse of an institution would rather destroy the profitable use of it but such perverse reasoners are either deplorably ignorant or else shamefully wicked for the same argument holds equally good for robbing the people of their pecuniary property because many of them make a very improper use of what little money they have to spare and indeed the robbery would be much less dishonest and sinful in the latter case than in the former for though both are rights of the people and cannot therefore be infringed without iniquity and injustice which are hateful in the sight of god yet the right of election whether it be to civil or ecclesiastical offices is inestimable and above price so that no plea of expedience or even of necessity can justify the gross dishonesty of infringing it they might as well persuade us to cut off our legs lest we should strain our ancles in walking or absolutely to prohibit all men from riding on horseback because some men have had dangerous falls and others have accidentally lost their lives by it yet such arguments are not more grossly absurd than this pretense of tumults as a reason for robbing the people of their election rights and yet this absurdity prevailed in the   th council of constantinople though the popular right was expressly allowed on a longtemps conserve aux laics le droit dassister aux elections says herycourt in his analyze p    et dy donner leur suffrage la confusion que pouvoit causer la multitude des electeurs engagea a ny admettre plus que la clerge on en fit un decret expres dans la viii concile general for so he styles but very improperly the   th council held at constantinople in     ce changement na point empeche que lon ne fut oblige de demander le consentement des sovereigns and this obligation to ask the consent of sovereigns monkish prelates were content to endure notwithstanding that the interference of all secular princes in episcopal elections is strictly forbid by the canons of the primitive church see p     provided they could but prevail on the monarchs to join them in effecting an entire exclusion of the peoples right to elect however neither the monkish nor the monarchical influence could entirely overcome the popular right in england until many years afterward which i have already proved by several incontestible examples but it was far otherwise in france for even in the same century ninth the kings of france instead of maintaining equal justice between the clergy and people like their predecessors charles the great and lewis i and ii now claimed to themselves the nomination of bishops of which i find a memorandum in the learned dr mangeys notitia ecclesiastica before cited viz it seems says he that in the ninth century the kings of france claimed the nomination of bishops and if this monarchical usurpation of the most essential popular right in the christian church was not actually promoted by the roman mystery of iniquity for i have already given an instance of pope saint zachariahs plenary indulgence to such dishonesty see p     it had at leastafterwards the express consent of the roman court provided that the papal share of the unlawful plunder might be admitted with it and accordingly we read of the concordate as formerly between the murderer herod and pontius pilate now also between pope leo x and k francis the pope collates upon the kings nomination this memorandum i found in dr mangeys notitia ecclesiastica for which he cites herycourt lib   c   le concordat fait enter leon x et francois i a transfere a nos rois tout le droit des electeurs the concordate made between leo x and k francis i has transferred to our kings all the right of the electors this indiscriminate writer could not perceive or if he did he must be charged with a much worse fault than indiscrimination that the droit of the electors could not be transferred by those who had no right in it and consequently that the kings of france do not exercise a droit but a tort as long as their unjust usurpation of the droit continues and i wish i could speak more favorably of the usurpation of our elective rights in england  the rights of episcopal elections as well as the nature of the episcopal office itself have indeed been subjects of much controversy in the christian church and the several dissentients that have hitherto published their opinions might long ago have approached much nearer to an agreement in the happy medium of truth had they been endued with sufficient impartiality but this alas has been too much wanting on every side of the controversy the episcopalians on the one hand though they have in general well maintained and proved the nature and efficacy of the episcopal function and the exercise of it in every age of the church clearly distinct from the office of mere presbyters demonstrating that though every bishop must be a presbyter yet that every presbyter most certainly was not a bishop nevertheless on the point of episcopal elections they have either been totally silent like the learned archbishop usher archbishop usher however in another useful work not professedly on the subject of episcopacy has nevertheless in occasional notes produced several instances of bishops elected by the people as well as by the clergy see veterum epistolarum hibernicarum sylloge viz the   th   d   th  0th and   st epistles with the archbishops remarks upon them together with his remarks on the   th epistle all which remarks will be found at the end of the book under the title of epistolarum recensio the examples relate to the free elections by the clergy and people of the bishops of dublin and waterford between the years of christ  0   and      which bishops as well as the bishops of limerick received in those times their episcopal ordination or consecration from the archbishops of canterbury and freely acknowledged the jurisdiction of that see the inhabitants of the said irish cities were colonies of normans who invaded ireland and took possession of those parts under the command of rollo and his two brothers according to an account cited by archbishop usher ibid p     which was probably before his conquest and settlement in a part of france about a d     dublin however and the greatest part of ireland was afterward viz about a d     conquered by our anglosaxon king edgar as appears by his charter of that year de oswaldes law ib p     a circumstance not much noticed by historians as the archbishop remarks on the said charter or diploma p     in quo says he quod omnes historiae tacent maximam partem hiberniae cum sua nobilissima civitate dublinia anglorum regno subjugatam a se fuisse confirmat but though our anglosaxon government soon afterward lost their dominion in ireland with respect to temporal matters yet these norman colonies in ireland long afterward freely acknowledged and endeavored of their own accord to maintain an ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the archbishops of canterbury over their own elected bishops by regularly applying to archbishop lanfranck and some of his successors archbishops of canterbury to consecrate their elected bishops and the elergy and people of dublin in one of these epistles viz to radulph archbishop of canterbury a d      say  we have always willingly submitted ours i e our bishops to the government of your predecessors from which we remember that ours received ecclesiastical dignity antecessorum enim vestrorum magisterio semper nostros libenter subdimus a quo recordamur nostros accepisse dignitatem ecclesiasticam p  00 but whether the submission of these irish sees to the province of canterbury commenced only after the establishment of the normans in england is not certain though it is most probable that the custom might have been founded on a more ancient connection of those cities with the province of canterbury under the anglosaxon conquerors especially as the burgesses and clergy of dublin in their letter dated a d      last cited assert that their voluntary submission to that see had been preserved a long time multo tempore for they warn sciatis vos revera quod episcopi hiberniae maximum zelum erga nos habent et maxim ille episcopus qui habitat ardimachae quia nos nolumus obedire eorum ordinationi sed semper sub vestro dominio esse volumus iccirco vestra suffragia supplices petimus quatenus gregorium ad sacrum ordinem episcopatus promoveatis si amplius illam parochiam quam multo tempore vobis servavimus retinere volueritis vale the archbishop of canterbury that the bishops of ireland have great zeal say they or wrath against us and chiefly the bishop that dwells at armagh because we are unwilling to obey their ordination but we are always desirous to be under your government and therefore we request your suffrages so far that you may advance gregory whom they call in the former part of the epistle nostrum electum to the sacred order of episcopacy if you shall be willing any longer to retain that see which for along time multo tempore we have preserved to you epist  0 p  00 the   th epistle an  0   is from the clergy and people of the church of dublin to lanfranck metropolitan of canterbury in the address of which they tender their debitam subjectionem see p    venerando sanctae cantuariensis ecclesiae metropolitano lanfranco clerus et populus ecclesiae dublinensis debitam subjectionem  vestrae paternitati est cognitum quod ecclesia dublinensis quae hiberniae insulae metropolis est suo sit viduata pastore ac destituta rectore proptrea eligimus presbyterum nomine patricium nobis sufficientissime cognitum natalibus et moribus nobilem apostolica and ecclesiastica cisciplina imbutum fide catholicum in scripturarum sensibus cautum in dogmatibus ecclesiasticis exercitatum quem nobis quantocius petimus ordinari episcopum quatenus auctore deo regulariter nobis praeesse valeat et prodesse et nos sub ejus regimine salubriter militare possumus quia integritas praesidentium salus est subditorum et ubi est incolumitas obedientiae ibi sana est forma doctrinae   they inform him that the church of dublin is widowed of its pastor and destitute of a ruler therefore we say the clergy and people have elected a presbyter by name patrick to us very sufficiently known noble in birth and morals etc whom we request as soon as may be to be ordained our bishop etc  the   d epistle ac  0   p    is from anselm archbishop of canterbury to the bishops of ireland informing them that on the death of his predecessor archbishop lanfranc the king the bishops and the great men of the kingdom had dragged him violently to the episcopal chair the clergy and people calling out for the same purpose  defuncto beatae memoriae praedecessore meo lanfranco archiepiscopo cum in normannia beccensis monasterii abbas extitissem unde et praefatus antecessor meus ad regendam ecclesiam cui deo auctore praesieo ante me processerat occulto dei judicio pro utilitatibus ecclesiasticis in angliam veni quo venientem tam rex quam pontifices regnique optimates adcathedram pontisicalem non vocando non rogando ut fieri assolet immo violenter rapiendo pertrahunt clero et populo acclamantibus in id ipsum ut nec unus cui quod gerebatur displiceret visus fuerit interesse p  0  this seems to have been an election by the parliament like many other examples about that time viz by the king the bishops the lords of the kingdom the clergy and people and therefore though it affords evidence of the popular right to elect yet it is not a proper example for imitation in episcopal elections which should be made only by the clergy and people of each particular diocese according to the ancient canons and practice of the primitive church  the   th epistle a c  0   p    is from the clergy and people of the town of waterford with king murchertag and bishop donald to archbishop anselm wherein they say  nos et rex noster murchertachus et episcopus domnaldus et dermeth dux noster frater regis elegimus hunc presbyterum malchum walchelini wintoniensis episcopi monachum nobis sufficientissime cognitum etc etc hunc nobis petimus a vestr paternitate ordinari pontificem quatenus regulariter nobis praeesse valeat et prodesse et nos sub ejus regimine salubriter domino militare possimus etc  we and our king murchertach and bishop donald and dermeth our duke brother of the king have elected this presbyter malchus the monk of walchelin bishop of winchester to us very sufficiently known etc him we request to be ordained our bishop by your paternity etc  the   st epistle in p  0  is from henry i k of england to radulph archbishop of canterbury as follows henricus rex angliae radulpho cantuariensi archiepiscopo salutem  mandavit mini rex hiberniae per breve suum et burgenses dublinae quod elegerunt hunc gregorium in episcopum et eum tibi mittunt consecrandum unde tibi mando ut petitioni eorum satisfaciens ejus consecrationem sine dilatione expleas test ranulpho cancellario apud windelsor p  0     the king of ireland has informed me by his brief and the burgesses of dublin that they have elected this gregory who was probably the bearer of the kings letter as well as of the former no  0 from the burgesses and clergy of dublin and send him to thee to be consecrated wherefore i command thee that satisfying their petition thou may complete his consecration without delay at windsor witness ranulph chancellor  thus it appears that the conquest of ireland by king edgar did not affect the just liberties of the church of ireland for the norman colonies therein still enjoyed the uninfluenced election of their own bishops and though they acknowledged the jurisdiction of the province of canterbury in ecclesiastical matters even when they were become independent and separated from us under a king of their own yet that submission was perfectly voluntary and free and was continued for no other reason than because they had originally received episcopal ordination from the archbishops of that see nevertheless they declared themselves at liberty to receive consecration from the archbishop of armagh and other irish bishops who earnestly desired to confer it on them in case the prelates of canterbury should be negligent in their superintendency and the bishops also of the native irish and their flocks were equally free and independent in ecclesiastical matters having preserved a due succession of the sacred order of episcopacy from the early times of their first conversion  before the time of the first patrick down to the barbarous times of our k henry ii who invaded their island under the delusive sanction of a papal commission to compel the submission of the church of ireland to the jurisdiction and doctrines of the church of rome and to pay an annual tribute to the pope of one penny for every house and all this on the delusive pretense of instructing the irish reforming their manners etc henry obtained his first commission for these purposes from pope adrian iv a d      which archbishop usher has inserted in his said collection of ancient epistles p  0  and he informs us in p     from trivettus that henry treated with his parliament at winchester concerning the conquest of ireland but because it did not please his mother the empress that expedition was postponed to another time the empress probably was shocked with the injustice of the proposal notwithstanding the popish dispensation for it  afterward however in the year      pope alexander iii revived the former wicked and presumptuous grant of adrian for invading and usurping the temporal rights as well as spiritual jurisdiction of the clergy and people of ireland whereby  the dominion of the irish kingdom was indulged to henry and in the plenitude of his unlimited and unlawful power this man of sin  presumptuously ratified and confirmed   concessionem ejusdem i e adriani papae super hibernici regni dominio vobitindulto falva beato petro et sacrosanctae romanae ecclesiae sicut in anglia sic et in hibernia de singuls domibus annua unius denarii pensione ratam habemus et confirmamus etc p     the iniquity the usurping popes may therefore most justly be deemed the most cruel enemies and destroyers of the temporal as well as ecclesiastical rights of the people of ireland yet so great was the darkness occasioned by the future papal jurisdiction therein that the mist is not yet entirely dispelled so that multitudes of wellmeaning irish people cannot yet perceive that the corrupted and usurping church of rome ought to be ranked amongst the most inveterate and dangerous enemies of the church of ireland    in his excellent little tract de episcoporum et metropolitanorum origin and dr cave in his learned and laborious dissertation concerning the government of the ancient church by bishops metropolitans and patriarchs or else have expressed a great degree of prejudice against all ancient testimonies which tend to justify any claim of popular or congregational right in the choice of bishops and zealously opposing thereto a multitude of precedents wherein the imperial or royal power has been exercised in the appointment of bishops and like the indiscriminate herecourt before quoted not discerning that the latter are precedents only of usurpation not of right those of the opposite party the presbyterians who attribute the dignity and function of bishops to their presbyters the learned author of an enquiry into the constitution discipline unity and worship of the primitive church etc a work commonly attributed to the late lordchancellor king has labored hard to level the primitive bishops to the degree of mere rectors of parishes and to elevate the presbyters to the rank of bishops though there are clear proofs of the superiority of bishops and of the ordinary residence in each place but of one bishop with several presbyters and deacons at the same time included even in some of the citations which he has collected to favor a contrary doctrine his opinion seems to have been built principally on a peculiar explanation of the word ordination that ordination says he that i shall speak of is this the grant of a peculiar commission and power which remains indelible in the person to whom it is committed and can never be obliterated or rased out except the person himself cause it by his heresy apostasy or most extremely gross and scandalous impiety thus far there is no need to oppose his sense of ordination but he adds now this sort of ordination says he was conferred only upon deacons and presbyters or on deacons and bishops presbyters and bishops being here to be considered as all one as ministers of the church universal p     this appears to be the keystone whereby the whole fabric of the doctrine throughout his work is suspended and held up and consequently the whole building must fall by the removal of it very happily for the determination of the dispute he has produced within a few pages after the place from whence this quotation was taken some clear and unquestionable examples of the ordination of some persons to the degree of presbyters who really were not bishops and never had episcopal dignity in the ordinary ecclesiastical sense of the word episcopal so that they could not consistently with truth be considered as all one with bishops according to this learned writers hypothesis  he cites in p     the express testimony of eusebius for the ordination of origin to be a presbyter that the bishops of caesarea and jerusalem ordained or laid hands upon him into the presbytery i e to make him a presbyter  eusebius lib   c   p  0  here then is a clear proof of the ordination of a person to be a presbyter by the hands of bishops and yet no man that has any regard to the testimony and truth of ecclesiastical history will presume to say that origin was a bishop though he was unquestionably ordained to be a presbyter and consequently it cannot be true that the ordination of  presbyters and bishops is to be considered as all one  by another quotation in p     from eusebius this learned writer proves also that novatian was ordained a presbyter by imposition of hands ie the hands of a bishop as eusebius declares  cornel apud eusebius lib   cap    p      and that this is a clear example of the ordination of a mere presbyter manifestly distinct from ordination to the episcopal dignity is demonstrated by the same chapter of eusebius which relates the wicked fraud of this same presbyter novatian at a time when he was already a presbyter to obtain a farther ordination for the episcopal dignity by inveigling three simple country bishops to ordain him a bishop by the imposition of their hands and therefore though all bishops are certainly presbyters yet these examples cited by the learned writer clearly demonstrate that all presbyters are not bishops and consequently that their ordination is not to be considered as all one the rite of ordination i e the laying on of hands by the bishops after solemn prayer of the whole congregation for the assistance of the holy spirit is indeed all one as well in the ordaining of deacons as in the ordination of presbyters and in the consecration of bishops differing only in the designation to these respective offices of the christian ministry as i have already remarked in p     n but then this single circumstance of designation is sufficiently effectual to occasion an essential difference in the three degrees of holy orders for what are orders but designations or declarations of the office conferred or function to be discharged insomuch that a person who has been duly ordained by the same solemn rite with a designation to the office of a deacon may not assume the office of a presbyter without a repetition of that rite and an express order or designation to the office and duty of a presbyter and a presbyter who has twice received holy orders by the same solemn rite cannot lawfully assume the dignity and office of a bishop until he has been first duly elected to be a bishop and secondly which is the most essential circumstance by which episcopal authority is really conferred until he have been once more ordered or ordained notwithstanding his two former orders as a deacon and as a presbyter and that with a repetition of the same solemn rite the laying on of hands with previous prayer but differing in this that there is always an express order or designation to the episcopal function previous to the prayers and laying on of hands the example of novatian cited above shows that the reordination of presbyters in order to obtain the degree and function of a bishop was deemed necessary even early in the third century other examples which i have quoted in pages   0    n concerning the reordination of presbyters that had been elected to be bishops prove that the same opinion as well as practice was preserved in the middle centuries of christianity and the present universal practice of the episcopal church in giving priests orders always previous to episcopal consecration is too well known and established to need the citation of particular examples for illustration  the learned chancellor if he was the writer of the said book has also supposed that the petition of a candidate for holy orders was to the whole presbytery because says he p     a bishop alone could not give those holy orders as is most evident says he from cyprian who assures us that all clerical ordinations were performed by the common counsel of the whole presbytery and therefore says he when upon a most urgent and necessary occasion he had been forced to ordain one but a lector without the advice and consent of his presbytery which one would be apt to think was no great usurpation he takes great pains to justify and excuse himself for so doing but all this supposition falls at once to the ground as soon as the authority which he has cited for it cyprians   th epist is more carefully examined for it really contains no such doctrine and does not at all relate to clerical ordinations which he has too hastily supposed cyprian had not given holy orders the subject of the learned writers argument to the persons for whose appointment he thought it necessary to apologize in that epistle for they were still sub clero as he expressly declares under the degree of clergy so that the apology could not be for having ordained any one in the ecclesiastical sense of that word but only for having made or appointed one man a lector or reader in the church and for having made another man a subdeacon fecisse me autem sciatis lectorem saturum et hypodiaconum optatum confessorem these were mere local functions in the church at the disposal not only of the presbyters and deacons but also of the laity or whole congregation who have a right to elect to such offices in many places even to this day so that an apology was really necessary in this case for having acted without their consent but no apology would have been due had the case been a mere ordination or conferring of holy orders the example is entirely foreign to the question of presbyters having a right to confer holy orders and as a proof that it is so be pleased to remark that the apology is addressed jointly to the presbyters and deacons and cannot therefore prove the right of the former to confer holy orders without admitting also the latter to the same degree of authority an idea which the learned writer never intended to promote  cyprian has been as much misunderstood by some former advocates for the presbyterian pretensions to the right of ordaining who to prove that ordination by bishops without the assistance of presbyters was always forbidden and opposed tell us says dr hammond of aureliuss being ordained by cyprian and his colleagues ep    and then assure us from ep    that by his colleagues he means his presbyters where yet there is no other proof of it but the using of these words in the inscription of the epistie cyprianus cum collegis et ego et collegae cyprian with his colleagues and i and my colleagues this says dr hammond is a great but discernible fallacy put upon the reader as will soon appear   if we but observe that the   d epistle where he tells of aurelius was written by cyprian to his presbyters and so they are the persons whom he advertiseth what he and his colleagues had done and so sure were not those colleagues that did it with him or secondly if for the understanding cyprians notion of colleagues ep    we shall but look forward to the next epistle    for that will fully discover it being this cyprianus et caeteri collegae qui in concilio affuerunt numero lxvi where cyprians colleagues are evidently the    bishops that were in council with him and so st austin in his   th epistle to st hierome mentioning this very epistle says cyprianus cum coepiscopis suis cyprian with his fellow bishops an irrefragable evidence that these his colleagues were bishops the like says he might be also observed of the testimony out of firmilian which they there subjoin of the seniores and praepositi that have power of ordaining by whom say they the presbyters as well as the bishops are understood but again it is clear by the express words of the epistle that by them are meant the bishops in their annual council necessario apud nos fit ut per singulos annos seniores et praepositi in unum conveniamus etc  i should not have made so long a quotation from dr hammond had not the learned chancellor or author of the tract just before cited once more held forth these very testimonies to justify ordination by presbyters though they had long before been so amply confuted by dr hammond  it is a sad mistake says the rev mr tho samon in his historical collections relating to the originals etc of the inhabitants of great britain p        of those who have a prejudice against episcopacy that it is an invention of the popish times and that our reformers so modelled the constitutions of our church as they might be most agreeable to the humor of the romanists but certainly the history of britain may convince any man of the contrary the popish times did not begin at the council of arles yet there we had our bishops the fathers of the council of nice had spent their days under the severest persecutions of the heathen and were just entered upon the morning of the christian empire and shall we think that popery was then prevalent our church is now settled as it was at that time not only bishops all over britain so far as it was christian but very near the same number of bishops the three chief bishoprics were settled at three most distant and proper places to have jurisdiction over the rest london york and caerleon there were in all    cities and accordingly    bishoprics as the number is given us both by gildas and bid and if we have now two less yet so much of britain as lies between berwick and edinburgh now belonging to scotland may well be allowed for the making of two at the council of nice the jurisdiction of their metropolitans was settled and the union of all the bishops of the province provided for such was the order and harmony of the whole clergy that though the diocese was so large that it could not be particularly known and taught by the superior officers of the church yet every one acting in his place and being accountable to those above him there was no defect either in the doctrine or discipline of those primitive times  certainly there is demonstration for episcopacy in that there were not only bishops before popery but when the popish missionaries set up in the world the old bishops were the very men that made the opposition against them nothing can be more undoubted in history than that the british bishops met austin and his companions at the famous oak upon the banks of severn and there utterly broke with them peremptorily refusing subjection to the pope of rome it is also as certain that colman bishop of lindisfarn and his northern clergy who had their original christianity from britain maintained the grand dispute at streanshale against agelbert wilfrid and the rest of the romanists that they retired and forsook their preferments rather than they would submit to the impositions of rome the laying aside their ancient observations and receiving the papal tonsure were looked upon by them both as innovations and badges of servitude to a foreign power and therefore rejected by them as they are by us at this day we must maintain like them the customs of the church which have been from the beginning there always was a commemoration of christ and his apostles at certain times which we also observe without any he or she saints of the roman make there always was a submission to the authority of the church in matters of decency and order which is all that we require without the least subjection to the church of rome we yield no deference we utterly renounce her authority over us and to suppose that our reformers either wanted judgment to distinguish between the ancient customs of the church and the later inventions of popery or that they wanted integrity to the true christian religion whose works and martyrdom bear witness in their favor is such a pretense as cannot support itself under a sincere consideration  we should be fond of episcopacy if we did but review that opposition which the pope always made against it if we did but observe how he could never compass his ends but by the destruction of its power he raised up the several orders of monks that those who were employed in religion might depend upon him and not upon their bishops he exempted the monasteries from the jurisdiction of the diocesans that all those rich plantations might heartily espouse the tyranny and superstition of rome he did all he could to transform the bishops into monks and prevailed so far that every archbishop of canterbury thought it necessary to put on that habit which made his episcopacy subservient to another sort of government he found that a diocesan bishop with his clergy in a cathedral church was such a bulwark to the national establishment that he could not dilate his empire he therefore by his interest with king egbert got the great oswald law to pass by which the presbyters were cast out and monks put into their places how can episcopacy be a popish invention when it has been all along the great business of the pope to overthrow it  we must ever own great honor and reverence due to columba who planted his monastery or university in the isle of hye upon the coasts of scotland which was a seminary for all the christian ministers of the north but that the custom or education of this place should be against episcopacy is impossible since they not only had a bishop in that little island but adamnanus one of the successors of columba gives us an account of the great deference they always paid to that order bishop aidan came from thence converted the northumbrians had his episcopal see in the island of lindisfarn which was afterward removed to durham after he was dead bishop finan was ordained by the scots and succeeded him by finan was diuma the first bishop of litchfield ordained whose successors were also from scotland and of the episcopal order we meet also colman from scotland that bishop of the northumbrians who was ejected for the protestant cause if columba himself had such an affection of the monastic life that he would not stir from hye and was of so great authority that it was thought fit the bishops of the north should be accountable to him and his successors to whom so much was committed of the royal power this can be no argument against episcopacy itself since it is declared at the same time that such a submission of bishops to an abbot was a perverting that order which was established in the church those who read only the account of scotland in the last century may perhaps have an opinion that there was an ancient of presbyterian government there but all authentic histories testify that they had the same constitution of ecclesiastical orders which were in the rest of britain and all other christian nations    and also more particularly the independents who together with them contend for the congregational or popular right to elect are apt to lay too much stress perhaps on this external circumstance of free election for they generally consider it as essential to the sacerdotal function whereas in fact it is only expedient and desirable but not absolutely necessary being indeed the most prudent mode of introduction to the constituting rite of consecration but no part of the rite itself which consists only of solemn prayer with the laying on of hands in which latter the laity can have no pretense to interfere we may safely acknowledge without injury to our electionrights that the bishops of the primitive church who succeeded immediately after the apostles were not generally elected by the people but were appointed either by the apostles themselves as i have before remarked or by apostolic men for which see the evidence of tertullian p     ceterum si quae audent interserere se aetati apostolicae ut ideo videantur ab apostolis

laying on of hands is publicly rejected by many of the independent and socinian ministers the ceremony of the imposition of hands says one of them for instance in reporting the character of an eminent socinian preacher he also refused to submit to because he considered it as void of any just meaning where no extraordinary gifts are or can be imparted this opinion of the imposition of hands must have been too hastily taken up because it is certainly erroneous the fact is that this ceremony like all other outward rites that were instituted by christ or his apostles may or may not be efficacious according to the inward disposition or sincerity of the person to whom the outward rite is administered  neither the administration of baptism nor the participation of the lords supper can impart any good effect on those who receive them unworthily without sincerity without regard to the internal and spiritual god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth john iv     there is nothing in this text which can fairly be construed against the use of external ceremonies either of the laying on of hands or of the sacramental institutions of christ though it is certainly applicable to enforce the necessity of a sincere and spiritual devotion in the use of them as also in our daily prayers but those men who not only despise these institutions of christ and his primitive church but even neglect for the most part in their public meetings christs positive injunctions to pray  ask and it shall be given to you etc mat vii   and neglect more especially to pray for the holy spirit which is so clearly promised to them that ask luke xi     through a groundless persuasion that they do obtain that heavenly gift by other means those men i fear are under a very dangerous delusion of a contrary spirit for it would be unreasonable to admit their pretensions to spiritual worship in the sense of that text of john viz in spirit and in truth whilst they prefer their own novel way of worship to that true worship which was so clearly commanded by christ and practiced by the primitive christians and the universal church   signification but merely to please men by an outward conformity to the ceremonies for some worldly advantage or favor as many do by way of test to such men no extraordinary gifts are or can be imparted by these outward rites which on the contrary rather increase their condemnation for though very worthy ministers who officiate therein or administer these outward rites may be deceived by the outward deportment of the persons to be baptized or communicating yet gods holy spirit is not to be mocked as we learn by the sad example of ananias and saphira whose dissimulation was punished by an immediate stroke from god to impress the infant church with a due sense of the almighty power and the necessity of sincerity in all things pertaining to gods service such extraordinary outward manifestations of gods spirit are not now to be expected it is sufficient that they continued until authentic historical accounts of our holy religion were dispersed in writing throughout the greatest part of the known world and the canon of the sacred scriptures completed in which ample accounts of them are related so that we may say of the new testament as our lord said of the old testament adding to the necessity of believing moses and the prophets the necessary belief also of the new testament that the men who believe not these additional testimonies of christs disciples and witnesses would not believe even if one should rise from the dead thus it appears that the extraordinary outward manifestations of gods spirit in working miracles are no longer necessary for the edification of the church but we must not therefore say that no extraordinary gifts are or can be imparted for miracles are not the only test of the real inspiration of gods holy spirit but love good works and holding fast the faith which was once delivered to the saints these are the fruits by which we are to judge of the tree and without these even miracles are to be suspected of delusion and are to be esteemed rather as the lying wonders of satan than as the works of god the power of working miracles therefore is not such an extraordinary gift as we have any right to look for or to expect under the present dispensation of the christian religion and yet the gift of gods spirit which every true christian has a right to expect according to the unquestionable promises of christ is certainly an extraordinary gift and is as certainly imparted to all that duly ask it in the meritorious name of our redeemer if we may confide in the truth of the holy scriptures it is always an extraordinary gift though imparted according to the ordinary dispensation of our religion because it supports and endows pious and worthy men on many occasions far beyond their ordinary or natural abilities and strength it is i say a real addition to the ordinary nature of man and therefore always an extraordinary gift being nothing less than a real participation of the divine nature of which we may if we will be partakers  through the exceeding great and precious promises of that divine person that has called us to glory and virtue see   pet i      if men are thus assured that this extraordinary gift may be obtained by asking according to christs directions they surely cannot doubt of its being imparted when they ask it in a more particular manner on great and solemn occasions as at the baptism of adults or the confirmation of persons that have been baptized in their infancy and at the sacramental commemoration of christs death according to our lords own institution these outward rites cannot impart the extraordinary gift but the goodness and truth of god are absolutely pledged if i may use such an expression to fulfill the exceeding great and precious promises in favor of prayer for that extraordinary gift and such prayer having this the object does always make a part of those solemn rites whereby they are most certainly rendered efficacious if sincerity be not wanting in those persons to whom they are administered  and it is exactly the same thing with respect to the imposition of hands either in the consecration of bishops or in the ordination of priests and of deacons because that ancient rite of christs church is always performed with solemn prayer in christs name for the holy spirit to guide and assist the persons consecrated or ordained and the prayers of the congregation are also desired on their behalf and therefore if the persons elected to be consecrated for the office and dignity of bishops and the candidates for priests or deacons orders are really sincere themselves in their prayers and undertakings there is no doubt but the laying on of hands thus accompanied with suitable prayer and devotion is truly efficacious and does impart the extraordinary gift abovementioned for the action of laying on hands has nothing in it indecent immoral or contrary to gods laws such as might be supposed to hinder the good effect of christs absolute promises to them that ask but on the contrary is authenticated and sanctified by apostolic usage declared in canonical scripture as well as by the constant subsequent practice of all the primitive churches of christ and ought not therefore to be laid aside on the groundless pretense that no extraordinary gifts are or can be imparted  granville sharp old jewry oct      a very worthy member of parliament having lately read as much of this tract as was then printed was pleased to propose the following queries in answer to which the following letter was sent to him by the author viz how could we divide this and other great towns into tithings  would not streets be a better division in cities parishes and streets instead of tithings and hundreds   answer dear sir the ancient mode of dividing great cities was by wards each of which was governed by an alderman the ealdorman of the anglosaxons an officer of great authority in the common law being a justiciary and having all the powers of our modern justices of the peace and what is more was always elected by the housekeepers or deciners of the ward over which he presides this ancient mode of division by no means interferes with the lesser divisions of tithings and hundreds so far from it that the government of the wards is not complete without them the lord mayors precept to the aldermen orders them to this day to hold courts of frankpledge see bohuns privilegia londini p     under the head of wardmote courts and the lord mayors annual precept to hold them which latter amongst other things contains the following article  no    and for that of late there is more resort to the city of persons evil affected in religion and otherwise than in former times has been you shall diligently inquire if any man be received to dwell or abide within your ward that is not put under frankpledge as he ought to be by the custom of the city etc  which were not without the regular divisions of tithings to give them effect the wards are local divisions of various magnitude and have been formed as you suggest some by streets some by the intersection of brooks now covered over but those various dimensions of space required a regular numerical division of the housekeepers in order to ascertain the due proportion of the representatives in the common council of the city  the averagerate of commoncouncilmen to the housekeepers or deciners is at present about one to  0 and as the city was in ancient times more populous and the houses smaller for each family when men were restrained by law from building in the environs of the city it is probable that the true proportion of housekeepers to elect one commoncouncilman should be  00 so that the common council has formerly been an assembly of hundreders or high constables as the gates of the city have been removed so as to leave this most important place entirely exposed to the fatal consequences of any sudden riot the attacks of any hardened banditti and especially in cases of any alarms by fire to the most dangerous confluence of multitudes of unknown people many of whom plunder the distressed and others hinder the necessary means of assistance it is highly expedient that some means of defense should be devised i have been told that in the great cities of japan the streets are barricadoed and shut up with palisade gates every night and that the people are actually divided into tithings and hundreds i have much to say on this subject and if you are not going out of town immediately i will do myself the honor to wait on you and communicate my thoughts  i remain with great esteem dear sir your most humble servant granville sharp old jewry aug             esquire
