a concise and genuine account of the dispute between mr hume and mr rousseau  with the letters that passed between them during their controversy  as also the letters of the hon mr walpole and mr dalembert relative to this extraordinary affair  translated from the french  london printed for t becket and p a de hondt near surrystreet in the strand mdcclxvi  advertisement of the french editors the name and writings of mr hume have been long since well known throughout europe at the same time his personal acquaintance have remarked in the candor and simplicity of his manners that impartiality and ingenuousness of disposition which distinguishes his character and is sufficiently indicated in his writings  he has exerted those great talents he received from nature and the acquisitions he made by study in the search of truth and promoting the good of mankind never wasting his time or sacrificing his repose in literary or personal disputes he has seen his writings frequently censured with bitterness by fanaticism ignorance and the spirit of party without ever giving an answer to his adversaries  even those who have attacked his works with the greatest violence have always respected his personal character his love of peace is so well known that the criticisms written against his pieces have been often brought him by their respective authors for him to revise and correct them at one time in particular a performance of this kind was shown to him in which he had been treated in a very rude and even injurious manner on remarking which to the author the latter struck out the exceptionable passages blushing and wondering at the force of that polemic spirit which had carried him imperceptibly away beyond the bounds of truth and decency  it was with great reluctance that a man possessed of such pacific dispositions could be brought to consent to the publication of the following piece he was very sensible that the quarrels among men of letters are a scandal to philosophy nor was any person in the world less formed for giving occasion to a scandal so consolatory to blockheads but the circumstances were such as to draw him into it in spite of his inclinations  all the world knows that mr rousseau proscribed in almost every country where he resided determined at length to take refuge in england and that mr hume affected by his situation and his misfortunes undertook to bring him over and to provide for him a peaceful safe and convenient alylum but very few persons are privy to the zeal activity and even delicacy with which mr hume conferred this act of benevolence what an affectionate attachment he had contracted for this new friend which humanity had given him with what address he endeavored to anticipate his desires without offending his pride in short with what address he strove to justify in the eyes of others the singularities of mr rousseau and to defend his character against those who were not disposed to think so favorably of him as he did himself  even at the time when mr hume was employed in doing mr rousseau the most essential service he received from him the most insolent and abusive letter the more such a stroke was unexpected the more it was cruel and affecting mr hume wrote an account of this extraordinary adventure to his friends at paris and expressed himself in his letters with all that indignation which so strange a proceeding must excite he thought himself under no obligation to keep terms with a man who after having received from him the most certain and constant marks of friendship could reproach him without any reason as false treacherous and as the most wicked of mankind  in the mean time the dispute between these two celebrated personages did not fail to make a noise the complaints of mr hume soon came to the knowledge of the public which at first hardly believed it possible that mr rousseau could be guilty of that excessive ingratitude laid to his charge even mr humes friends were fearful lest in the first effusions of sensibility he was not carried too far and had not mistaken for wilful crimes of the heart the vagaries of the imagination or the deceptions of the understanding he judged it necessary therefore to explain the affair by writing a precise narrative of all that passed between him and mr rousseau from their first connection to their rupture this narrative he sent to his friends some of whom advised him to print it alleging that as mr rousseaus accusations were become public the proofs of his justification ought to be so too mr hume did not give into these arguments choosing rather to run the risk of being unjustly censured than to resolve on making himself a public party in an affair so contrary to his disposition and character a new incident however at length overcame his reluctance mr rousseau had addressed a letter to a bookseller at paris in which he directly accuses mr hume of having entered into a league with his enemies to betray and defame him and in which he boldly defies mr hume to print the papers he had in his hands this letter was communicated to several persons in paris was translated into english and the translation printed in the public papers in london an accusation and defiance so very public could not be suffered to pass without reply while any long silence on the part of mr hume might have been interpreted little in his favor  besides the news of this dispute had spread itself over europe and the opinions entertained of it were various it had doubtless been much happier if the whole affair had been buried in oblivion and remained a profound secret but as it was impossible to prevent the public interesting itself in the controversy it became necessary at least that the truth of the matter should be known mr humes friends unitedly represented to him all these reasons the force of which he was at length convinced of and seeing the necessity consented though with reluctance to the printing of his memorial  the narrative and notes are translated from the english and are now retranslated for the most part from the french the french editors having taken some liberties not without mr humes consent with the english original english translator  the letters of mr rousseau which serve as authentic proofs of the facts are exact copies of the originals in the present edition mr humes letters are printed verbatim and to mr rousseaus the translator has endeavored to do justice as well with regard to the sense as the expression not that he can flatter himself with having always succeeded in the latter he has taken the liberty also to add a note or two regarding some particular circumstances which had come to his knowledge   this pamphlet contains many strange instances of singularity that will appear extraordinary enough to those who will give themselves the trouble to peruse it those who do not choose to take that trouble however may possibly do better as its contents are of little importance except to those who are immediately interested  on the whole mr hume in offering to the public the genuine pieces of his trial has authorized us to declare that he will never take up the pen again on the subject mr rousseau indeed may return to the charge he may produce suppositions misconstructions inferences and new declamations he may create and realize new phantoms and envelop them in the clouds of his rhetoric he will meet with no more contradiction the facts are all laid before the public the original letters of both parties will be lodged in the british museum on account of the above mentioned defiance of mr rousseau and his subsequent insinuation that if they should be published they would be falsified  and mr hume submits his cause to the determination of every man of sense and probity  an account of the controversy between mr hume and mr rousseau august        my connection with mr rousseau began in      when the parliament of paris had issued an arret for apprehending him on account of his emilius i was at that time at edinburgh a person of great worth wrote to me from paris that mr rousseau intended to seek an asylum in england and desired i would do him all the good offices in my power as i conceived mr rousseau had actually put his design in execution i wrote to several of my friends in london recommending this celebrated exile to their favor i wrote also immediately to mr rousseau himself assuring him of my desire to oblige and readiness to serve him at the same time i invited him to come to edinburgh if the situation would be agreeable and offered him a retreat in my own house so long as he should please to partake of it there needed no other motive to excite me to this act of humanity than the idea given me of mr rousseaus personal character by the friend who had recommended him his wellknown genius and abilities and above all his misfortunes the very cause of which was an additional reason to interest me in his favor the following is the answer i received  mr rousseau to mr hume motierstravers feb         sir i did not receive till lately and at this place the letter you did me the honor to direct to me at london the  d of july last on the supposition that i was then arrived at that capital i should doubtless have made choice of a retreat in your country and as near as possible to yourself if i had foreseen what a reception i was to meet with in my own no other nation could claim a preference to england and this prepossession for which i have dearly suffered was at that time too natural not to be very excusable but to my great astonishment as well as that of the public i have met with nothing but affronts and insults where i hoped to have found consolation at least if not gratitude how many reasons have i not to regret the want of that asylum and philosophical hospitality i should have found with you my misfortunes indeed have constantly seemed to lead me in a manner that way the protection and kindness of my lord marshal your worthy and illustrious countryman has brought scotland home to me if i may so express myself in the midst of switzerland he has made you so often bear a part in our conversation has brought me so well acquainted with your virtues which i before was only with your talents that he inspired me with the most tender friendship for you and the most ardent desire of obtaining yours before i even knew you were disposed to grant it judge then of the pleasure i seel at finding this inclination reciprocal no sir i should pay your merit but half its due if it were the subject only of my admiration your great impartiallty together with your amazing penetration and genius would lift you far above the rest of mankind if you were less attached to them by the goodness of your heart my lord marshal in acquainting me that the amiableness of your disposition was still greater than the sublimity of your genius rendered a correspondence with you every day more desirable and cherished in me those wishes which he inspired of ending my days near you oh sir that a better state of health and more convenient circumstances would but enable me to take such a journey in the manner i could like could i but hope to see you and my lord marshal one day settled in your own country which should for ever after be mine i should be thankful in such a society for the very misfortunes that led me into it and should account the day of its commencement as the first of my life would to heaven i might live to see that happy day though now more to be desired than expected with what transports should i not exclaim on setting foot in that happy country which gave birth to david hume and the lord marshal of scotland  salve facis mibi debita tellus haec domus haec patria est  j j r   this letter is not published from a motive of vanity as will be seen presently when i give the reader a recantation of all the eulogies it contains but only to complete the course of our correspondence and to show that i have been long since disposed to mr rousseaus service  from this time our correspondence entirely ceased till about the middle of last autumn      when it was renewed by the following accident a certain lady of mr rousseaus acquaintance being on a journey to one of the french provinces bordering on switzerland had taken that opportunity of paying a visit to our solitary philosopher in his retreat at motierstravers to this lady he complained that his situation in newschatel was become extremely disagreeable as well on account of the superstition of the people as the resentment of the clergy and that he was afraid he should shortly be under the necessity of seeking an asylum elsewhere in which case england appeared to him from the nature of its laws and government to be the only place to which he could retire with perfect security adding that my lord marshal his former protector had advised him to put himself under my protection that was the term he was pleased to make use of and that he would accordingly address himself to me if he thought it would not be giving me too much trouble  i was at that time charged with the affairs of england at the court of france but as i had the prospect of soon returning to london i could not reject a proposal made to me under such circumstances by a man so celebrated for his genius and misfortunes as soon as i was thus informed therefore of the situation and intentions of mr rousseau i wrote to him making him an offer of my services to which he returned the following answer  mr rousseau to mr hume strasbourg dec        sir your goodness affects me as much as it does me honor the best reply i can make to your offers is to accept them which i do i shall set out in five or six days to throw myself into your arms such is the advice of my lord marshal my protector friend and father it is the advice also of madam    the person here mentioned desired her name might be suppressed french editor  as the motive to the suppression of the ladys name can hardly be supposed to extend to this country the english translator takes the liberty to mention the name of the marchioness de verdelin   whose good sense and benevolence serve equally for my direction and consolation in fine i may say it is the advice of my own heart which takes a pleasure in being indebted to the most illustrious of my contemporaries to a man whose goodness surpasses his glory i sigh after a solitary and free retirement wherein i might finish my days in peace if this be procured me by means of your benevolent solicitude i shall then enjoy at once the pleasure of the only blessing my heart desires and also that of being indebted for it to you i am sir with all my heart etc  j j r   not that i had deferred till this time my endeavors to be useful to mr rousseau the following letter was communicated to me by mr clairaut some weeks before his death  mr rousseau to mr clairaut motierstravers march        sir the remembrance of your former kindness induces me to be again importunate it is to desire you will be so good for the second time to be the censor of one of my performances it is a very paltry rhapsody which i compiled many years ago under the title of a musical dictionary and am now obliged to republish it for susistence amidst the torrent of misfortunes that overwhelm me i am not in a situation to review the work which i know is full of oversights and mistakes if any interest you may take in the lot of the most unfortunate of mankind should induce you to bestow a little more attention on his work than on that of another i should be extremely obliged to you if you would take the trouble to correct such errors as you may meet with in the perusal to point them out without correcting them would be doing nothing for i am absolutely incapable of paying the least attention to such a work so that if you would but condescend to alter add retrench and in short use it as you would do your own you would do a very great charity for which i should be extremely thankful accept sir my most humble excuses and salutations  j j r   it is with reluctance i say it but i am compelled to it i now know of a certainty that this affectation of extreme poverty and distress was a mere pretense a petty kind of imposture which mr rousseau successfully employed to excite the compassion of the public but i was then very far from suspecting any such artifice i must own i felt on this occasion an emotion of pity mixed with indignation to think a man of letters of such eminent merit should be reduced in spite of the simplicity of his manner of living to such extreme indigence and that this unhappy state should be rendered more intolerable by sickness by the approach of old age and the implacable rage of persecution i knew that many persons imputed the wretchedness of mr rousseau to his excessive pride which induced him to refuse the assistance of his friend but i thought this fault if it were a fault was a very respectable one too many men of letters have debated their character in stooping so low as to solicit the assistance of persons of wealth or power unworthy of affording them protection and i conceived that a noble pride even though carried to excess merited some indulgence in a man of genius who borne up by a sense of his own superiority and a love of independence should have braved the storms of fortune and the insults of mankind i proposed therefore to serve mr rousseau in his own way i desired mr clairaut accordingly to give me his letter which i showed to several of mr rousseaus friends and patrons in paris at the same time i proposed to them a scheme by which he might be relieved without suspecting any thing of the matter this was to engage the bookseller who was to publish his dictionary to give mr rousseau a greater sum for the copy than he had offered and to indemnify him by paying him the difference but this project which could not be executed without the assistance of mr clairaut fell to the ground at the unexpected decease of that learned and respectable academician  retaining however still the same idea of mr rousseaus excessive poverty i constantly retained the same inclination to oblige him and when i was informed of his intention to go to england under my conduct i formed a scheme much of the same kind with that i could not execute at paris i wrote immediately to my friend mr john stewart of buckingham street that i had an affair to communicate to him of so secret and delicate a nature that i should not venture even to commit it to paper but that he might learn the particulars of mr elliot now sir gilbert elliot who would soon return from paris to london the plan was this and was really communicated by mr elliot some time after to mr stewart who was at the same time enjoined to the greatest secrecy  mr stewart was to look out for some honest discreet farmer in his neighborhood in the country who might be willing to lodge and board mr rousseau and his gouvernante in a very decent and plentiful manner at a pension which mr stewart might settle at fifty or sixty pounds a year the farmer engaging to keep such agreement a profound secret and to receive from mr rousseau only twenty or twentyfive pounds a year i engaging to supply the difference  it was not long besore mr stewart wrote me word he had found a situation which he conceived might be agreeable on which i desired he would get the apartment furnished in a proper and convenient manner at my expense but this scheme in which there could not possibly enter any motive of vanity on my part secrecy being a necessary condition of its execution did not take place other designs presenting themselves more convenient and agreeable the sact however is well known both to mr stewart and sir gilbert elliot  it will not be improper here to mention another plan concerted with the same intentions i had accompanied mr rousseau into a very pleasant part of the county of surry where he spent two days at colonel webbs mr rousseau seeming to me highly delighted with the natural and solitary beauties of the place through the means of mr stewart therefore i entered into treaty with colonel webb for the purchasing the house with a little estate adjoining in order to make a settlement for mr rousseau if after what has passed mr rousseaus testimony be of any validity i may appeal to himself for the truth of what i advance but be this as it will these facts are well known to mr stewart to general clarke and in part to colonel webb  but to proceed in my narrative mr rousseau came to paris provided with a passport which his friends had obtained for him i conducted him to england for upwards of two months after our arrival i employed myself and my friends in looking out for some agreeable situation for him we gave way to all his caprices excused all his singularities indulged him in all his humors in short neither time nor trouble was spared to procure him what he desired it is probably to this excessive and illjudged complaisance mr h may in a great degree impute the disagreeable consequences that have followed there is no end in indulging caprice nor any prudence in doing it when it is known to be such it may be thought humane to indulge the weak of body or mind the decrepitude of age and imbecility of childhood but even here it too often proves cruelty to the very parties indulged how much more inexcusable therefore is it to cherish the absurdities of whim and singularity in men of genius and abilities how is it possible to make a man easy or happy in a world to whose customs and maxims he is determined to run retrograde no capricious men like froward children should be left to kick against the pricks and vent their spleen unnoticed to humor is only to spoil them english translator  and notwithstanding he rejected several of the projects which i had laid out for him yet i thought myself sufficiently recompensed for my trouble by the gratitude and even affection with which he appeared to repay my solicitude  at length his present settlement was proposed and approved mr davenport a gentleman of family fortune and worth offered him his house at wooton in the county of derby where he himself seldom resides and at which mr rousseau and his housekeeper are boarded at a very moderate expense  when mr rousseau arrived at wooton he wrote me the following letter  mr rousseau to mr hume wooton march         you see already my dear patron by the date of my letter that i am arrived at the place of my destination but you cannot see all the charms which i find in it to do this you should be acquainted with the situation and be able to read my heart you ought however to read at least those of my sentiments with respect to you and which you have so well deserved if i live in this agreeable asylum as happy as i hope to do one of the greatest pleasures of my life will be to reflect that i owe it to you to make another happy is to deserve to be happy ones self may you therefore find in yourself the reward of all you have done for me had i been alone i might perhaps have met with hospitality but i should have never relished it so highly as i now do in owing it to your friendship retain still that friendship for me my dear patron love me for my sake who am so much indebted to you love me for your own for the good you have done me i am sensible of the full value of your sincere friendship it is the object of my ardent wishes i am ready to repay it with all mine and feel something in my heart which may one day convince you that it is not without its value as for the reasons agreed on between us i shall receive nothing by the post you will be pleased when you have the goodness to write to me to send your letters to mr davenport the affair of the carriage is not yet adjusted because i know i was imposed on it is a trifling fault however which may be only the effect of an obliging vanity unless it should happen to be repeated if you were concerned in it i would advise you to give up once for all these little impositions which cannot proceed from any good motive when converted into snares for simplicity i embrace you my dear patron with the same cordiality which i hope to find in you  j j r   some few days after i received from him another letter of which the following is a copy  mr rousseau to mr hume wooton march         you will see my dear patron by the letter mr davenport will have transmitted you how agreeably i find myself situated in this place i might perhaps be more at my ease if i were less noticed but the solicitude of so police an host as mine is too obliging to give offense and as there is nothing in life without its inconvenience that of being too good is one of those which is the most tolerable i find a much greater inconvenience in not being able to make the servants understand me and particularly in my not understanding them luckily mrs le vasseur serves me as interpreter and her fingers speak better than my tongue there is one advantage however attending my ignorance which is a kind of compensation it serves to tire and keep at a distance impertinent visitors the minister of the parish came to see me yesterday who finding that i spoke to him only in french would not speak to me in english so that our interview was almost a silent one i have taken a great fancy to this expedient and shall make use of it with all my neighbors if i have any nay should i even learn to speak english i would converse with them only in french especially if i were so happy as to find they did not understand a word of that language an artifice this much of the same kind with that which the negroes pretend is practiced by the monkeys who they say are capable of speech but cannot be prevailed upon to talk lest they should be set to work  it is not true in any sense that i agreed to accept of a model from mr gosset as a present on the contrary i asked him the price which he told me was a guinea and half adding that he intended to present me with it an offer i did not accept i desire you therefore to pay him for it and mr davenport will be so good as repay you the money and if mr gosset does not consent to be paid for it it must be returned to him and purchased by some other hand it is designed for mr du peyrou who desired long since to have my portrait and caused one to be painted in miniature which is not at all like me you were more fortunate in this respect than he but i am sorry that by your assiduity to serve me you deprived me of the pleasure of discharging the same friendly obligation with regard to yourself be so good my dear patron as to order the model to be sent to messrs guinand and hankey little st helens bishopsgatestreet in order to be transmitted to mr du peyrou by the first safe conveyance it has been a frost ever since i have been here the snow falls daily and the wind is cutting and severe notwithstanding all which i had rather lodge in the hollow trunk of an old tree in this country than in the most superb apartment in london good day my dear patron i embrace you with all my heart  j j r   mr rousseau and i having agreed not to lay each other under any restraint by a continued correspondence the only subject of our future letters was the obtaining a pension for him from the king of england which was then in agitation and of which affair the following is a concise and faithful relation  as we were conversing together one evening at calais where we were detained by contrary winds i asked mr rousseau if he would not accept of a pension from the king of england in case his majesty should be pleased to grant him one to this he replied it was a matter of some difficulty to resolved on but that he should be entirely directed by the advice of my lord marshall encouraged by this answer i no sooner arrived in london than i addressed myself to his majestys ministers and particularly to general conway secretary of state and general graeme secretary and chamberlain to the queen application was accordingly made to their majestys who with their usual goodness consented on condition only that the affair should not be made public mr rousseau and i both wrote to my lord marshall and mr rousseau expressly observed in his letter that the circumstance of the affairs being to be kept secret was very agreeable to him the consent of my lord marshall arrived as may readily be imagined soon after which mr rousseau set out for wooton while the business remained some time in suspense on account of the indisposition of general conway  in the mean time i began to be afraid from what i had observed of mr rousseaus disposition and character that his natural restlessness of mind would prevent his enjoyment of that repose to which the hospitality and security he found in england invited him i saw with infinite regret that he was born for storms and tumults and that the disgust which might succeed the peaceful enjoyment of solitude and tranquillity would soon render him a burden to himself and every body about him in forming the opinion of mr rousseaus disposition mr hume was by no means singular the striking features of mr rousseaus extraordinary character having been strongly marked in the criticisms on his several writings in the monthly review particularly in the account of his letters from the mountains in the appendix to the   st vol of that work where this celebrated genius is described merely from the general tenor of his writings and the outlines of his public conduct to be exactly such a kind of person as mr hume has discovered him from intimate and personal acquaintance english translator  but as i lived at the distance of an hundred and fifty miles from the place of his residence and was constantly employed in doing him good offices i did not expect that i myself should be the victim of this unhappy disposition  it is necessary to introduce here a letter which was written last winter at paris in the name of the king of prussia  my dear john james you have renounced geneva your native soil you have been driven from switzerland a country of which you have made such boast in your writings in france you are outlawed come then to me i admire your talents and amuse myself with your reveries on which however by the way you bestow too much time and attention it is high time to grow prudent and happy you have made yourself sufficiently talked of for singularities little becoming a truly great man show your enemies that you have sometimes common sense this will vex them without hurting you my dominions afford you a peaceful retreat i am desirous to do you good and will do it if you can but think it such but if you are determined to refuse my assistance you may expect that i shall say not a word about it to any one if you persist in perplexing your brains to find out new misfortunes choose such as you like best i am a king and can make you as miserable as you can wish at the same time i will engage to do that which your enemies never will i will cease to persecute you when you are no longer vain of persecution  your sincere friend frederic   this letter was written by mr horace walpole about three weeks before i left paris but though we lodged in the same hotel and were often together mr walpole out of regard to me carefully concealed this piece of pleasantry till after my departure he then showed it to some friends who took copies and those of course presently multiplied so that this little piece had been spread with rapidity all over europe and was in every bodys hands when i saw it for the first time in london  i believe every one will allow who knows any thing of the liberty of this country that such a piece of raillery could not even by the utmost influence of kings lords and commons by all the authority ecclesiastical civil and military be kept from finding its way to the press it was accordingly published in the st jamess chronicle and a few days after i was very much surprised to find the following piece in the same paper  mr rousseau to the author of the st jamess chronicle wooton april        sir you have been wanting in that respect which every private person owes to crowned heads in publicly ascribing to the king of prussia a letter full of baseness and extravagance by which circumstance alone you might be very well assured he could not be the author you have even dared to subscribe his name as if you had seen him write it with his own hand i inform you sir that this letter was fabricated at paris and what rends and afflicts my heart that the impostor has his accomplices in england  in justice to the king of prussia to truth and to myself you ought therefore to print the letter i am now writing and to which i set my name by way of reparation for a fault which you would undoubtedly reproach yourself for if you knew of what atrociousness you have been made the instrument sir i make you my sincere salutations  j j r   i was sorry to see mr rousseau display such an excess of sensibility on account of so simple and unavoidable an incident as the publication of this pretended letter from the king of prussia but i should have accused myself of a most black and malevolent disposition if i had imagined mr rousseau could have suspected me to have been the editor of it or that he had intentionally directed his resentment against me he now informs me however that this was really the case just eight days before i had received a letter written in the most amicable terms imaginable that of the   th of march  i am surely the last man in the world who in common sense ought to be suspected yet without even the pretense of the smallest proof or probability i am of a sudden the first man not only suspected but certainly concluded to be the publisher i am without further enquiry or explication intentionally insulted in a public paper i am from the dearest friend converted into a treacherous and malignant enemy and all my present and past services are at one stroke very artfully cancelled were it not ridiculous to employ reasoning on such a subject and with such a man i might ask mr rousseau why i am supposed to have any malignity against him my actions in a hundred instances had sufficiently demonstrated the contrary and it is not usual for favors conferred to beget ill will in the person who confers them but supposing i had secretly entertained an animosity toward him would i run the risque of a discovery by so silly a vengeance and by sending this piece to the press when i knew from the usual avidity of the newswriters to find articles of intelligence that it must necessarily in a few days be laid hold of  but not imagining that i was the object of so black and ridiculous a suspicion i pursued my usual train by serving my friend in the least doubtful manner i renewed my applications to general conway as soon as the state of that gentlemans health permitted it the general applies again to his majesty his majestys consent is renewed the marquis of rockingham first commissioner of the treasury is also applied to the whole affair is happily finished and full of joy i conveyed the intelligence to my friend on which mr conway soon after received the following letter  mr rousseau to general conway may         sir affected with a most lively sense of the favor his majesty has honored me with and with that of your goodness which procured it me it affords me the most pleasing sensation to reflect that the best of kings and the minister most worthy of his confidence are pleased to interest themselves in my fortune this sir is an advantage of which i am justly tenacious and which i will never deserve to lose but it is necessary i should speak to you with that frankness you admire after the many misfortunes that have befallen me i thought myself armed against all possible events there have happened to me some however which i did not foresee and which indeed an ingenuous mind ought not to have foreseen hence it is that they affect me by so much the more severely the trouble in which they involve me indeed deprives me of the ease and presence of mind necessary to direct my conduct all i can reasonably do under so distressed a situation is to suspend my resolutions about every affair of such importance as is that in agitation so far from refusing the beneficence of the king from pride as is imputed to me i am proud of acknowleging it and am only sorry i cannot do it more publicly but when i actually receive it i would be able to give up myself entirely to those sentiments which it would naturally inspire and to have an heart replete with gratitude for his majestys goodness and yours i am not at all afraid this manner of thinking will make any alteration in yours toward me deign therefore sir to preserve that goodness for me till a more happy opportunity when you will be satisfied that i defer taking the advantage of it only to render myself more worthy of it i beg of you sir to accept of my most humble and respectful salutations  j j r   this letter appeared both to general conway and to me a plain refusal as long as the article of secrecy was insisted on but as i knew that mr rousseau had been acquainted with that condition from the beginning i was the less surprised at his silence toward me i thought that my friend conscious of having treated me ill in this affair was ashamed to write to me and having prevailed on general conway to keep the matter still open i wrote a very friendly letter to mr rousseau exhorting him to return to his former way of thinking and to accept of the pension  as to the deep distress which he mentions to general conway and which he says deprives him even of the use of his reason i was set very much at ease on that head by receiving a letter from mr davenport who told me that his guest was at that very time extremely happy easy cheerful and even sociable i saw plainly in this event the usual infirmity of my friend who wishes to interest the world in his favor by passing for sickly and persecuted and distressed and unfortunate beyond all measure even while he is the most happy and contented his pretenses of an extreme sensibility had been too frequently repeated to have any effect on a man who was so well acquainted with them  i waited three weeks in vain for an answer i thought this a little strange and i even wrote so to mr davenport but having to do with a very odd sort of a man and still accounting for his silence by supposing him ashamed to write to me i was resolved not to be discouraged nor to lose the opportunity of doing him an essential service on account of a vain ceremonial i accordingly renewed my applications to the ministers and was so happy as to be enabled to write the following letter to mr rousseau the only one of so old a date of which i have a copy  mr hume to mr rousseau lislestreet leicesterfields    june      as i have not received any answer from you i conclude that you persevere in the same resolution of refusing all marks of his majestys goodness as long as they must remain a secret i have therefore applied to general conway to have this condition removed and i was so fortunate as to obtain his promise that he would speak to the king for that purpose it will only be requisite said he that we know previously from mr rousseau whether he would accept of a pension publicly granted him that his majesty may not be exposed to a second refusal he gave me authority to write to you on that subject and i beg to hear your resolution as soon as possible if you give your consent which i earnestly entreat you to do i know that i could depend on the good offices of the duke of richmond to second general conways application so that i have no doubt of success i am my dear sir  yours with great sincerity d h   in five days i received the following answer  mr rousseau to mr hume wooton june         i imagined sir that my silence truly interpreted by your own conscience had said enough but since you have some design in not understanding me i shall speak you have but ill disguised yourself i know you and you are not ignorant of it before we had any personal connections quarrels or disputes while we knew each other only by literary reputation you affectionately made me the offer of the good offices of yourself and friends affected by this generosity i threw myself into your arms you brought me to england apparently to procure me an asylum but in fact to bring me to dishonor you applied to this noble work with a zeal worthy of your heart and a success worthy of your abilities you needed not have taken so much pains you live and converse with the world i with myself in solitude the public love to be deceived and you were formed to deceive them i know one man however whom you can not deceive i mean yourself you know with what horror my heart rejected the first suspicion of your designs you know i embraced you with tears in my eyes and told you if you were not the best of men you must be the blackest of mankind in reflecting on your private conduct you must say to yourself sometimes you are not the best of men under which conviction i doubt much if ever you will be the happiest  i leave your friends and you to carry on your schemes as you please giving up to you without regret my reputation during life certain that sooner or later justice will be done to that of both as to your good offices in matters of interest which you have made use of as a mask i thank you for them and shall dispense with profiting by them i ought not to hold a correspondence with you any longer or to accept of it to my advantage in any affair in which you are to be the mediator adieu sir i wish you the truest happiness but as we ought not to have any thing to say to each other for the future this is the last letter you will receive from me  j j r   to this i immediately sent the following reply  mr hume to mr rousseau june         as i am conscious of having ever acted toward you the most friendly part of having always given the most tender the most active proofs of sincere affection you may judge of my extreme surprise on perusing your epistle such violent accusations confined altogether to generals it is as impossible to answer as it is impossible to comprehend them but affairs cannot must not remain on that footing i shall charitably suppose that some infamous calumniator has belied me to you but in that case it is your duty and i am persuaded it will be your inclination to give me an opportunity of detecting him and of justifying myself which can only be done by your mentioning the particulars of which i am accused you say that i myself know that i have been false to you but i say it loudly and will say it to the whole world that i know the contrary that i know my friendship toward you has been unbounded and uninterrupted and that though instances of it have been very generally remarked both in france and england the smallest part of it only has as yet come to the knowledge of the public i demand that you will produce me the man who will assert the contrary and above all i demand that he will mention any one particular in which i have been wanting to you you owe this to me you owe it to yourself you owe it to truth and honor and justice and to every thing that can be deemed sacred among men as an innocent man i will not say as your friend i will not say as your benefactor but i repeat it as an innocent man i claim the privilege of proving my innocence and of refuting any scandalous lie which may have been invented against me mr davenport to whom i have sent a copy of your letter and who will read this before he delivers it i am confident will second my demand and will tell you that nothing possibly can be more equitable happily i have preserved the letter you wrote me after your arrival at wooton and you there express in the strongest terms indeed in terms too strong your satisfaction in my poor endeavors to serve you the little epistolary intercourse which afterward passed between us has been all employed on my side to the most friendly purposes tell me what has since given you offense tell me of what i am accused tell me the man who accuses me even after you have fulfilled all these conditions to my satisfaction and to that of mr davenport you will have great difficulty to justify the employing such outrageous terms toward a man with whom you have been so intimately connected and whom on many accounts you ought to have treated with some regard and decency  mr davenport knows the whole transaction about your pension because i thought it necessary that the person who had undertaken your settlement should be fully acquainted with your circumstances lest he should be tempted to perform toward you concealed acts of generosity which if they accidentally came to your knowledge might give you some grounds of offense i am sir  d h   mr davenports authority procured me in three weeks the following enormous letter which however has this advantage that it confirms all the material circumstances of the foregoing narrative i have subjoined a few notes relative to some facts which mr rousseau has not truly represented and leave my readers to judge which of us deserves the greatest confidence  mr rousseau to mr hume wooton july  0      sir i am indisposed and little in a situation to write but you require an explanation and it must be given you it was your own fault you had it not long since but you did not desire it and i was therefore silent at present you do and i have sent it i will be a long one for which i am very sorry but i have much to say and would put an end to the subject at once  as i live retired from the world i am ignorant of what passes in it i have no party no associates no intrigues i am told nothing and i know only what i feel but as care has been taken to make me severely feel that i well know the first concern of those who engage in bad designs is to secure themselves from legal proofs of detection it would not be very advisable to seek a remedy against them at law the innate conviction of the heart admits of another kind of proof which influences the sentiments of honest men you well know the basis of mine  you ask me with great confidence to name your accuser that accuser sir is the only man in the world whose testimony i should admit against you it is yourself i shall give myself up without fear or reserve to the natural frankness of my disposition being an enemy to every kind of artifice i shall speak with the same freedom as if you were an indifferent person on whom i placed all that confidence which i no longer have in you i will give you an history of the emotions of my heart and of what produced them while speaking of mr hume in the third person i shall make yourself the judge of what i ought to think of him notwithstanding the length of my letter i shall pursue no other order than that of my ideas beginning with the premises and ending with the demonstration  i quitted switzerland wearied out by the barbarous treatment i had undergone but which affected only my personal security while my honor was safe i was going as my heart directed me to join my lord marshal when i received at strasburg a most affectionate invitation from mr hume to go over with him to england where he promised me the most agreeable reception and more tranquillity than i have met with i hesitated some time between my old friend and my new one in this i was wrong i preferred the latter and in this was still more so but the desire of visiting in person a celebrated nation of which i had heard both so much good and so much ill prevailed assured i could not lose george keith i was flattered with the acquisition of david hume his great merit extraordinary abilities and established probity of character made me desirous of annexing his friendship to that with which i was honored by his illustrious countryman besides i gloried not a little in setting an example to men of letters in a sincere union between two men so different in their principles  before i had received an invitation from the king of prussia and my lord marshal undetermined about the place of my retreat i had desired and obtained by the interest of my friends a passport from the court of france i made use of this and went to paris to join mr hume he saw and perhaps saw too much of the favorable reception i met with from a great prince and i will venture to say of the public i yielded as it was my duty though with reluctance to that eclat concluding how far it must excite the envy of my enemies at the same time i saw with pleasure the regard which the public entertained for mr hume sensibly increasing throughout paris on account of the good work he had undertaken with respect to me doubtless he was affected too but i know not if it was in the same manner as i was  we set out with one of my friends who came to england almost entirely on my account when we were landed at dover transported with the thoughts of having set foot in this land of liberty under the conduct of so celebrated a person i threw my arms round his neck and pressed him to my heart without speaking a syllable bathing his checks as i kissed them with tears sufficiently expressive this was not the only not the most remarkable instance i have given him of the effusions of an heart full of sensibility i know not what he does with the recollection of them when that happens but i have a notion they must be sometimes troublesome to him  at our arrival in london we were mightily caressed and entertained all ranks of people eagerly pressing to give me marks of their benevolence and esteem mr hume presented me politely to every body and it was natural for me to ascribe to him as i did the best part of my good reception my heart was full of him i spoke in his praise to every one i wrote to the same purpose to all my friends my attachment to him gathering every day new strength while his appeared the most affectionate to me of which he frequently gave me instances that touched me extremely that of causing my portrait to be painted however was not of the number this seemed to me to carry with it too much the affectation of popularity and had an air of ostentation which by no means pleased me all this however might have been easily excusable had mr hume been a man apt to throw away his money or had a gallery of pictures with the portraits of his friends after all i freely confess that on this head i may be in the wrong the fact was this my friend mr ramsay a painter of eminence and a man of merit proposed to draw mr rousseaus picture and when he had begun it told me he intended to make me a present of it thus the design of having mr rousseaus picture drawn did not come from me nor did it cost me any thing mr rousseau therefore is equally contemptible in paying me a compliment for this pretended gallantry in his letter of the   th of march and in converting it into ridicule here mr hume   but what appears to me an act of friendship and generosity the most undoubted and estimable in a word the most worthy of mr hume was the care he took to solicit for me of his own accord a pension from the king to which most assuredly i had no right to aspire as i was a witness to the zeal he exerted in that affair i was greatly affected with it nothing could flatter me more than a piece of service of that nature not merely for the sake of interest for too much attached perhaps to what i actually possess i am not capable of desiring what i have not and as i am able to subsist on my labor and the assistance of my friends i covet nothing more but the honor of receiving testimonies of the goodness i will not say of so great a monarch but of so good a father so good a husband so good a master so good a friend and above all so worthy a man was sensibly affecting and when i considered farther that the minister who had obtained for me this favor was a living instance of that probity which of all others is the most important to mankind and at the same time hardly ever met with in the only character wherein it can be useful i could not check the emotions of my pride at having for my benefactors three men who of all the world i could most desire to have my friends thus so far from refusing the pension offered me i only made one condition necessary for my acceptance this was the consent of a person whom i could not without neglecting my duty fail to consult  being honored with the civilities of all the world i endeavored to make a proper return in the mean time my bad state of health and being accustomed to live in the country made my residence in town very disagreeable immediately country houses presented themselves in plenty i had my choice of all the counties of england mr hume took the trouble to receive these proposals and to represent them to me accompanying me to two or three in the neighboring counties i hesitated a good while in my choice and he increased the difficulty of determination at length i fixed on this place and immediately mr hume settled the affair all difficulties vanished and i departed arriving presently at this solitary convenient and agreeable habitation where the owner of the house provides every thing and nothing is wanting i became tranquil independent and this seemed to be the wished for moment when all my misfortunes should have an end on the contrary it was now they began misfortunes more cruel than any i had yet experienced  hitherto i have spoken in the fullness of my heart and to do justice with the greatest pleasure to the good offices of mr hume would to heaven that what remains for me to say were of the same nature it would never give me pain to speak what would redound to his honor nor is it proper to set a value on benefits till one is accused of ingratitude which is the case at present i will venture to make one observation therefore which renders it necessary in estimating the services of mr hume by the time and the pains they took him up they were of an infinite value and that still more from the good will displayed in their performance but for the actual service they were of to me it was much more in appearance than reality i did not come over to beg my bread in england i brought the means of subsistence with me i came merely to seek an asylum in a country which is open to every stranger without distinction i was besides not so totally unknown as that if i had arrived alone i should have wanted either assistance or service if some persons have sought my acquaintance for the sake of mr hume others have sought it for my own thus when mr davenport for example was so kind as to offer my present retreat it was not for the sake of mr hume whom he did not know and whom he saw only in order to desire him to make me his obliging proposal so that when mr hume endeavors to alienate from me this worthy man he takes that from me which he did not give me mr rousseau forms a wrong judgment of me and ought to know me better i have written to mr davenport even since our rupture to engage him to continue his kindness to his unhappy guest mr hume  all the good that has been done me would have been done me nearly the same without him and perhaps better but the evil would not have been done me at all for why should i have enemies in england why are those enemies all the friends of mr hume who could have excited their enmity against me it certainly was not i who knew nothing of them nor ever saw them in my life i should not have had a single enemy had i come to england alone how strange are the effects of a disordered imagination mr rousseau tells us he is ignorant of what passes in the world and yet talks of the enemies he has in england how does he know this where did he see them he has received nothing but marks of beneficence and hospitality mr walpole is the only person who has thrown out a little piece of raillery against him but is not therefore his enemy if mr rousseau could have seen things exactly as they are he would have seen that he had no other friend in england but me and no other enemy but himself mr hume   i have hitherto dwelt upon public and notorious facts which from their own nature and my acknowledgment have made the greatest eclat those which are to follow are particular and secret at least in their cause and all possible measures have been taken to keep the knowledge of them from the public but as they are well known to the person interested they will not have the less influence toward his own conviction  a very short time after our arrival in london i observed an absurd change in the minds of the people regarding me which soon became very apparent before i arrived in england there was not a nation in europe in which i had a greater reputation i will venture to say was held in greater estimation the public papers were full of encomiums on me and a general outcry prevailed on my persecutors that a general outcry should prevail against mr rousseaus persecutors in england is no wonder such an outcry would have prevailed from sentiments of humanity had he been a person of much less note so that this is no proof of his being esteemed and as to the encomiums on him inserted in the public news papers the value of such kind of puffs is well known in england i have already observed that the authors of more respectable works were at no loss what to think of mr rousseau but had formed a proper judgment of him long before his arrival in england the genius which displayed itself in his writings did by no means blind the eyes of the more sensible part of mankind to the absurdity and inconsistency of his opinions and conduct in exclaiming against mr rousseaus fanatical persecutors they did not think him the more possessed of the true spirit of martyrdom the general opinion indeed was that he had too much philosophy to be very devout and had too much devotion to have much philosophy english translator  this was the case at my arrival which was published in the news papers with triumph england prided itself in affording me refuge and justly gloried on that occasion in its laws and government when all of a sudden without the least assignable cause the tone was changed and that so speedily and totally that of all the caprices of the public never was known any thing more surprising the signal was given in a certain magazine equally full of follies and falsehoods in which the author being well informed or pretending to be so gives me out for the son of a musician from this time mr rousseau knows very little of the public judgment in england if he thinks it is to be influenced by any story told in a certain magazine but as i have before said it was not from this time that mr rousseau was slightingly spoke of but long before and that in a more consequential manner perhaps indeed mr rousseau ought in justice to impute great part of those civilities he met with on his arrival rather to vanity and curiosity than to respect and esteem english translator  i was constantly spoken of in print in a very equivocal or slighting manner every thing that had been published concerning my misfortunes was misrepresented altered or placed in a wrong light and always as much as possible to my disadvantage so far was any body from speaking of the reception i met with at paris and which had made but too much noise it was not generally supposed that i durst have appeared in that city even one of mr humes friends being very much surprised when i told him i came through it  accustomed as i had been too much to the inconstancy of the public to be affected by this instance of it i could not help being astonished however at a change so very sudden and general that not one of those who had so much praised me in my absence appeared now i was present to think even of my existence i thought it something very odd that immediately after the return of mr hume who had so much credit in london with so much influence over the booksellers and men of letters and such great connections with them his presence should produce an effect so contrary to what might have been expected that among so many writers of every kind not one of his friends should show himself to be mine while it was easy to be seen that those who spoke of him were not his enemies since in noticing his public character they reported that i had come through france under his protection and by favor of a passport which he had obtained of the court nay they almost went so far as to insinuate that i came over in his retinue and at his expense all this was of little signification and was only singular but what was much more so was that his friends changed their tone with me as much as the public i shall always take a pleasure in saying that they were still equally solicitous to serve me and that they exerted themselves greatly in my favor but so far were they from showing me the same respect particularly the gentleman at whose house we alighted on our arrival that he accompanied all his actions with discourse so rude and sometimes so insulting that one would have thought he had taken an occasion to oblige me merely to have a right to express his contempt this relates to my friend mr john stewart who entertained mr rousseau at his house and did him all the good offices in his power mr rousseau in complaining of this gentlemans behavior forgets that he wrote mr stewart a letter from wooton full of acknowlegements and just expressions of gratitude what mr rousseau adds regarding the brother of mr stewart is neither civil nor true mr hume  his brother who was at first very polite and obliging altered his behavior with so little reserve that he would hardly deign to speak a single word to me even in their own house in return to a civil salutation or to pay any of those civilities which are usually paid in like circumstances to strangers nothing new had happened however except the arrival of j j rousseau and david hume and certainly the cause of these alterations did not come from me unless indeed too great a portion of simplicity discretion and modesty be the cause of offense in england as to mr hume he was so far from assuming such a disgusting tone that he gave into the other extreme i have always looked upon flatterers with an eye of suspicion and he was so full of all kinds i shall mention only one that made me smile this was his attention to have every time i came to see him a volume of elcisa upon his table as if i did not know enough of mr humes taste for reading as to be well assured that of all books in the world eloisa must be one of the most tiresome to him mr rousseau of flattery that he even obliged me when i could bear it no longer the reader may judge from the two first letters of mr rousseau which i published with that view on which side the slatteries commenced as for the rest i loved and esteemed mr rousseau and took a pleasure in giving him to understand so i might perhaps be too lavish in my praises but i can assure the reader he never once complained of it mr hume  to tell him my sentiments on that head his behavior was such as to render few words necessary yet i could have wished he had substituted in the room of such gross encomiums sometimes the language of a friend but i never found any thing in his which favored of true friendship not even in his manner of speaking of me to others in my presence one would have thought that in endeavoring to procure me patrons he strove to deprive me of their good will that he sought rather to have me assisted than loved and i have been sometimes surprised at the rude turn he has given to my behavior before people who might not unreasonably have taken offense at it i shall give an example of what i mean mr pennick of the museum a friend of my lord marshals and minister of a parish where i was solicited to refide came to see me mr hume made my excuses while i myself was present for not having paid him a visit doctor matty said he invited us on thursday to the museum where mr rousseau should have seen you but he chose rather to go with mrs garrick to the play we could not do both the same day i dont recollect a single circumstance of this history but what makes me give very little credit to it is that i remember very well we had settled two different days for the purposes mentioned that is one to go to the museum and another to the play mr hume  you will confess sir this was a strange method of recommending me to mr pennick  i know not what mr hume might say in private of me to his acquaintance but nothing was more extraordinary than their behavior to me even by his own confession and even often through his own means although my purse was not empty and i needed not that of any other person which he very well knew yet any one would have thought i was come over to subsist on the charity of the public and that nothing more was to be done than to give me alms in such a manner as to save me a little confusion i conceive mr rousseau hints here at two or three dinners that were sent him from the house of mr steward when he chose to dine at his own lodgings this was not done however to save him the expense of a meal but because there was no convenient tavern or chophouse in the neighborhood i beg the readers pardon for descending to such trivial particulars mr hume  i must own this constant and insolent piece of affectation was one of those things which made me averse to reside in london this certainly was not the footing on which any man should have been introduced in england had there been a design of procuring him ever so little respect this display of charity however may admit of a more favorable interpretation and i consent it should to proceed  at paris was published a fictitious letter from the king of prussia addressed to me and replete with the most cruel malignity i learned with surprise that it was one mr walpole a friend of mr humes who was the editor i asked him if it were true in answer to which question he only asked me of whom i had the information a moment before he had given me a card for this same mr walpole written to engage him to bring over such papers as related to me from paris and which i wanted to have by a safe hand  i was informed that the son of that quack we have not been authorized to suppress this affronting term but it is too gross and groundless to do any injury to the celebrated and respectable physician to whose name it is annexed french editors tronchin my most mortal enemy was not only the friend of mr hume and under his protection but that they both lodged in the same house together and when mr hume found that i knew it he imparted it in confidence assuring me at the same time that the son was by no means like the father i lodged a few nights myself together with my governante in the same house and by the air and manner with which we were received by the landladies who are his friends i judged in what manner either mr hume or that man who as he said who by no means like his father must have spoken to them both of her and me thus am i accused of treachery because i am a friend of mr walpole who has thrown out a little raillery on mr rousseau and because the son of a man whom mr rousseau does not like lodges by accident in the same house because my landladies who do not understand a syllable of french received mr rousseau coldly as to the rest and that i said to mr rousseau about the young tronchin was that he had not the same prejudices against him as his father mr hume   all these facts put together added to a certain appearance of things on the whole insensibly gave me an uneasiness which i rejected with horror in the mean time i found the letters i wrote did not come to hand those i received had often been opened and all went through the hands of mr hume the story of mr rousseaus letters is as follows he had often been complaining to me and with reason that he was ruined by postage at neufchatel which commonly cost him    or    louis dors a year and all for letters which were of no significance being wrote some of them by people who took that opportunity of abusing him and most of them by persons unknown to him he was therefore resolved he said in england to receive no letters which came by the post and the same resolution he reiterates in his letter to me dated the   d of march when he went to chiswick near london the postman brought his letters to me i carried him out a cargo of them he exclaimed desired me to return the letters and recover the price of postage i told him that in that case the clerks of the post office were entire masters of his letters he said he was indifferent they might do with them what they pleased i added that he would by that means be cut off from all correspondence with all his friends he replied that he would give a particular direction to such as he desired to correspond with but till his instructions for that purpose could arrive what could i do more friendly than to save at my own expense his letters from the curiosity and indiscretion of the clerks of the post office i am indeed ashamed to find myself obliged to discover such petty circumstances mr hume  if at any time any one escaped him he could not conceal his eagerness to see it one evening in particular i remember a very remarkable circumstance of this kind that greatly struck me it is necessary to explain this circumstance i had been writing on mr humes table during his absence an answer to a letter i had just received he came in very curious to know what i had been writing and hardly able to contain himself from desiring to read it i closed my letter however without showing it him when as i was putting it into my pocket he asked me for it eagerly saying he would send it away on the morrow being postday the letter lay on the table lord newnham came in mr hume went out of the room for a moment on which i took the letter up again saying i should find time to send it the next day lord newnham offered to get it enclosed in the french ambassadors packet which i accepted mr hume reentered the moment his lordship had enclosed it and was pulling out his seal mr hume officiously offered his own seal and that with so much earnestness that it could not well be refused the bell was rung and lord newnham gave the letter to mr humes servant to give it his own who waited below with the chariot in order to have it sent to the ambassador mr humes servant was hardly got out of the room but i said to myself i will lay a wager the master follows he did not fail to do as i expected not knowing how to leave lord newnham alone i staid some time before i followed mr hume i said nothing but he must perceive that i was uneasy thus although i have received no answer to my letter i doubt not of its going to hand but i confess i cannot help suspecting it was read first mr rousseau  as we were sitting one evening after supper silent by the fireside i caught his eyes intently fixed on mine as indeed happened very often and that in a manner of which it is very difficult to give an idea at that time he gave me a steadfast piercing look mixed with a sneer which greatly disturbed me to get rid of the embarrassment i lay under i endeavored to look full at him in my turn but in fixing my eyes against his i felt the most inexpressible terror and was obliged soon to turn them away the speech and physiognomy of the good david is that of an honest man but where great god did this good man borrow those eyes he fixes so sternly and unaccountably on those of his friends  the impression of this look remained with me and gave me much uneasiness my trouble increased even to a degree of fainting and if i had not been relieved by an effusion of tears i had been suffocated presently after this i was seized with the most violent remorse i even despised myself till at length in a transport which i still remember with delight i sprang on his neck embraced him eagerly while almost choked with sobbing and bathed in tears i cried out in broken accents no no david hume cannot be treacherous if he be not the best of men he must be the basest of mankind david hume politely returned my embraces and gently tapping me on the back repeated several times in a goodnatured and easy tone why what my dear sir nay my dear sir oh my dear sir he said nothing more i felt my heart yearn within me we went to bed and i set out the next day for the country  arrived at this agreeable asylum to which i have traveled so far in search of repose i ought to find it in a retired convenient and pleasant habitation the master of which a man of understanding and worth spares for nothing to render it agreeable to me but what repose can be tasted in life when the heart is agitated afflicted with the most cruel uncertainty and ignorant what to think of a man whom i ought to love and esteem i endeavored to get rid of that fatal doubt in placing confidence in my benefactor for wherefore from what unaccountable caprice should be display so much apparent zeal for my happiness and at the same time entertain secret designs against my honor among the several observations that disturbed me each fact was in itself of no great moment it was their concurrence that was surprising yet i thought perhaps that mr hume informed of other facts of which i was ignorant could have given me a satisfactory solution of them had we come to an explanation the only thing that was inexplicable was that he refused to come to such an explanation which both his honor and his friendship rendered equally necessary i saw very well there was something in the affair which i did not comprehend and which i earnestly wished to know before i came to an absolute determination therefore with regard to him i was desirous of making another effort and to try to recover him if he had permitted himself to be seduced by my enemies or in short to prevail on him to explain himself one way or other accordingly i wrote him a letter which he ought to have found very natural it appears from what he wrote to me afterward that he was very well satisfied with this letter and that he thought of it very well mr rousseau  if he were guilty but very extraordinary if he were innocent for what could be more extraordinary than a letter full of gratitude for his services and at the same time of distrust of his sentiments and in which placing in a manner his actions on one side and his sentiments on the other instead of speaking of the proofs of friendship he had given me i desired him to love me for the good he had done me my answer to this is contained in mr rousseaus own letter of the   d of march wherein he expresses himself with the utmost cordiality without any reserve and without the least appearance of suspicion mr hume  i did not take the precaution to preserve a copy of this letter but as he has done it let him produce it and whoever shall read it and see therein a man laboring under a secret trouble which he is desirous of expressing and is afraid to do it will i am persuaded be curious to know what kind of eclaircissement it produced especially after the preceding scene none absolutely none at all mr hume contented himself in his answer with only speaking of the obliging offices mr davenport proposed to do for me as for the rest he said not a word of the principal subject of my letter nor of the situation of my heart of whose distress he could not be ignorant i was more struck with this silence than i had been with his phlegm during our last conversation in this i was wrong this silence was very natural after the other and was no more than i ought to have expected for when one has ventured to declare to mans face i am tempted to believe you a traitor and he has not the curiosity to ask you for what all this hangs upon the fable he had so artfully worked up as i before observed mr hume  it may be depended on he will never have any such curiosity as long as he lives and it is easy to judge of him from these slight indications  after the receipt of his letter which was long delayed i determined at length to write to him no more soon after every thing served to confirm me in the resolution to break off all farther correspondence with him curious to the last degree concerning the minutest circumstance of my affairs he was not content to learn them of me in our frequent conversations but as i learned never let slip an opportunity of being alone with my governante i had only one such opportunity with his governante which was on their arrival in london i must own it never entered into my head to talk to her upon any other subject than the concerns of mr rousseau mr hume  to interrogate her even importunately concerning my occupations my resources my friends acquaintances their names situations place of abode and all this after setting out with telling her he was well acquainted with the whole of my connections nay with the most jesuitical address he would ask the same questions of us separately one ought undoubtedly to interest ones self in the affairs of a friend but one ought to be satisfied with what he thinks proper to let us know of them particularly when people are so frank and ingenuous as i am indeed all this petty inquisitiveness is very little becoming a philosopher  about the same time i received two other letters which had been opened the one from mr boswell the seal of which was so loose and disfigured that mr davenport when he received it remarked the same to mr humes servant the other was from mr divernois in mr humes packet and which had been sealed up again by means of a hot iron which aukwardly applied had burnt the paper round the impression on this i wrote to mr davenport to desire him to take charge of all the letters which might be sent for me and to trust none of them in any bodys hands under any pretext whatever i know not whether mr davenport who certainly was far from thinking that precaution was to be observed with regard to mr hume showed him my letter or not but this i know that the latter had all the reason in the world to think he had forfeited my confidence and that he proceeded nevertheless in his usual manner without troubling himself about the recovery of it  but what was to become of me when i saw in the public papers the pretended letter of the king of prussia which i had never before seen that fictitious letter printed in french and english given for genuine even with the signature of the king and in which i knew the pen of mr dalembert as certainly as if i had seen him write it see mr dalemberts declaration on this head annexed to this narrative   in a moment a ray of light discovered to me the secret cause of that touching and sudden change which i had observed in the public respecting me and i saw the plot which was put in execution at london had been laid in paris  mr dalembert another intimate friend of mr humes had been long since my secret enemy and lay in watch for opportunities to injure me without exposing himself he was the only person among the men of letters of my old acquaintance who did not come to see me mr rousseau declares himself to have been fatigued with the visits he received ought he therefore to complain that mr dalembert whom he did not like did not importune him with his mr hume  or send their civilities during my last passage through paris i knew his secret disposition but i gave myself very little trouble about it contenting myself with advising my friends of it occasionally i remember that being asked about him one day by mr hume who afterward asked my governante the same question i told him that mr dalembert was a cunning artful man he contradicted me with a warmth that surprised me not then knowing they stood so well with each other and that it was his own cause he defended  the perusal of the letter above mentioned alarmed me a good deal when perceiving that i had been brought over to england in consequence of a project which began to be put in execution but of the end of which i was ignorant i felt the danger without knowing what to guard against or on whom to rely i then recollected four terrifying words mr hume had made use of and of which i shall speak hereafter what could be thought of a paper in which my misfortunes were imputed to me as a crime which tended in the midst of my distress to deprive me of all compassion and to render its effects still more cruel pretended to have been written by a prince who had afforded me protection what could i divine would be the consequence of such a beginning the people in england read the public papers and are in no wise prepossessed in favor of foreigners even a coat cut in a different fashion from their own is sufficient to excite a prejudice against them what then had not a poor stranger to expect in his rural walks the only pleasures of his life when the good people in the neighborhood were once thoroughly persuaded he was fond of being persecuted and pelted doubtless they would be ready enough to contribute to his favorite amusement but my concern my profound and cruel concern the bitterest indeed i ever felt did not arise from the danger to which i was personally exposed i had braved too many others to be much moved with that the treachery of a false friend this false friend is undoubtedly myself but what is the treachery what harm have i done or could i do to mr rousseau on the supposition of my entering into a project to ruin him how could i think to bring it about by the services i did him if mr rousseau should gain credit i must be thought still more weak than wicked mr hume to which i had fallen a prey was the circumstance that filled my too susceptible heart with deadly sorrow in the impetuosity of its first emotions of which i never yet was master and of which my enemies have artfully taken the advantage i wrote several letters full of disorder in which i did not disguise either my anxiety or indignation  i have sir so many things to mention that i forget half of them by the way for instance a certain narrative in form of a letter concerning my manner of living at montmorency was given by the booksellers to mr hume who showed it me i agreed to its being printed and mr hume undertook the care of its edition but it never appeared again i had brought over with me a copy of the letters of mr du peyrou containing a relation of the treatment i had met with at neuschatel i gave them into the hands of the same bookseller to have them translated and reprinted mr hume charged himself with the care of them but they never appeared the booksellers have lately informed me that the edition is finished and will shortly be published this may be but it is too late and what is still worse it is too opportune for the purpose intended to be served mr rousseau  the supposititious letter of the king of prussia and its translation had no sooner made their appearance than i immediately comprehended why the other pieces had been suppressed it is about four months since mr becket the bookseller told mr rousseau that the publication of these pieces was delayed on account of the indisposition of the translator as for any thing else i never promised to take any change at all of the edition as mr becket can testify mr hume  and i wrote as much to the booksellers as to mr rousseaus suspicions of the cause of the suppression as he calls it of the narrative and letters above mentioned the translator thinks it incumbent on him to affirm they were entirely groundless it is true as mr becket told mr hume that the translator of the letters was indisposed about that time but the principal cause of the delay was that he was of his own mere motion no less indisposed to those pieces making their appearance in english at for so far were the booksellers from intending to suppress these pieces that they actually reprinted the french edition of peyrous letters and published it in london all and this not out of ill will to mr rousseau or good will to mr hume neither of which he ever saw or spoke to in his life but really out of regard to the character and reputation of a man whose genius he admired and whose works he had translated well knowing the publication of such squabbles could do mr rousseau no good in the opinion of the more judicious and sensible part of mankind with regard to the translation of the narrative of his manner of living at montmorency i never saw it till it was actually printed when mr becket put it into my hands and i frankly told him that i thought it a very unseasonable puerile affair and could by no means serve to advance mr rousseaus estimation in the eyes of the public it was certainly of great importance to the good people of england to know how mr rousseau amused himself   or   years ago at montmorency that he cooked his own broth and did not leave it to the management of his nurse for fear she should have a better dinner than himself yet this is one of the most remarkable circumstances contained in that narrative except indeed that we are told mr rousseau is a most passionate admirer of virtue and that his eyes always sparkle at the bare mention of that word  o virtue how greatly is thy name prostituted and how  from the teeth outward are thy nominal votaries english translator  i wrote several other letters also which probably were handed about london till at length i employed the credit of a man of quality and merit to insert a declaration of the imposture in the public papers in this declaration i concealed no part of my extreme concern nor did i in the least disguise the cause  hitherto mr hume seems to have walked in darkness you will soon see him appear in open day and act without disguise nothing more is necessary in our behavior toward cunning people than to act ingenuously sooner or later they will infallibly betray themselves  when this pretended letter from the king of prussia was first published in london mr hume who certainly knew that it was fictitious as i had told him so yet said nothing of the matter did not write to me but was totally silent and did not even think of making any declaration of the truth in favor of his absent friend no body could possibly be mistaken with regard to the letters being fictitious besides it was well known that mr walpole was the author of it mr hume  it answered his purpose better to let the report take its course as he did  mr hume having been my conductor into england he was of course in a manner my patron and protector if it were but natural in him to undertake my defense it was to less so that when i had a public protestation to make i should have addressed myself to him having already ceased writing to him mr rousseau forgets himself here it was but a week before that he wrote me a very friendly letter see his letter of the   th of march mr hume  however i had no mind to renew our correspondence i addressed myself therefore to another person the first slap on the face i gave my patron he felt nothing of it  in saying the letter was fabricated at paris it was of very little consequence to me whether it was understood particularly of mr dalembert or of mr walpole whose name he borrowed on the occasion but in adding that what afflicted and tore my heart was the impostor had got his accomplices in england i expressed myself very clearly to their friend who was in london and was desirous of passing for mine for certainly he was the only person in england whose hatred could afflict and rend my heart this was the second slap of the face i gave my patron he did not feel however yet  on the contrary he maliciously pretended that my affliction arose solely from the publication of the above letter in order to make me pass for a man who was excessively affected by satire whether i am vain or not certain it is i was mortally afflicted he knew it and yet wrote me not a word this affectionate friend who had so much at heart the filling of my purse gave himself no trouble to think my heart was bleeding with sorrow  another piece appeared soon after in the same papers by the author of the former and still if possible more cruel in which the writer could not disguise his rage at the reception i met with at paris i know nothing of this pretended libel mr hume  this however did not affect me it told me nothing new mere libels may take their course without giving me any emotion and the inconstant public may amuse themselves as long as they please with the subject it is not an affair of conspirators who bent on the destruction of my honest fame are determined by some means or other to effect it it was necessary to change the battery  the affair of the pension was not determined it was not difficult however for mr hume to obtain from the humanity of the minister and the generosity of the king the favor of its determination he was required to inform me of it which he did this i must confess was one of the critical moments of my life how much did it cost me to do my duty my preceding engagements the necessity of showing a due respect for the goodness of the king and for that of his minister together with the desire of displaying how far i was sensible of both add to these the advantage of being made a little more easy in circumstances in the decline of life surrounded as i was by enemies and evils in fine the embarrassment i was under to find a decent excuse for not accepting a benefit already half accepted all these together made the necessity of that refusal very difficult and cruel for necessary it was or i should have been one of the meanest and basest of mankind to have voluntarily laid myself under an obligation to a man who had betrayed me  i did my duty though not without reluctance i wrote immediately to general conway and in the most civil and respectful manner possible without giving an absolute refusal excusing myself from accepting the pension for the present  now mr hume had been the only negotiator of this affair nay the only person who had spoke of it yet i not only did not give him any answer though it was he who wrote to me on the subject but did not even so much as mention him in my letter to general conway this was the third slap of the face i gave my patron which if he does not feel it is certainly his own fault he can feel nothing  my letter was not clear nor could it be so to general conway who did not know the motives of my refusal but it was very plain to mr hume who knew them but too well he pretended nevertheless to be deceived as well with regard to the cause of my discontent as to that of my declining the pension and in a letter he wrote me on the occasion gave me to understand that the kings goodness might be continued toward me if i should reconsider the affair of the pension in a word he seemed determined at all events to remain still my patron in spite of my teeth you will imagine sir he did not expect my answer and he had none much about this time for i do not know exactly the date nor is such precision necessary appeared a letter from mr de voltaire to me with an english translation which still improved on the original the noble object of this ingenious performance was to draw on me the hatred and contempt of the people among whom i was come to reside i made not the least doubt that my dear patron was one of the instruments of its publication particularly when i saw that the writer in endeavoring to alienate from me those who might render my life agreeable had omitted the name of him who brought me over he doubtless knew that it was superfluous and that with regard to him nothing more was necessary to be said the omission of his name so impoliticly forgot in this letter recalled to my mind what tacitus says of the picture of brutus omitted in a funeral solemnity viz that every body took notice of it particularly because it was not there  mr hume was not mentioned but he lives and converses with people that are mentioned it is well known his friends are all my enemies there are abroad such people as tronchin dalembert and voltaire i have never been so happy as to meet with mr de voltaire he only did me the honor to write me a letter about three years ago as to mr tronchin i never saw him in my life nor ever had any correspondence with him of mr dalemberts friendship indeed i am proud to make a boast mr hume  but it is much worse in london for here i have no enemies but what are his friends for why indeed should i have any other why should i have even them why indeed except that sensible people in england are averse to affectation and quackery those who see and despise these most in mr rousseau are not however his enemies perhaps if he could be brought to think so they are his best and truest friends english translator  what have i done to lord littleton mr rousseau seeing the letter addressed to him in the name of voltaire advertised in the public papers wrote to mr davenport who was then in london to desire he would bring it him i told mr davenport that the printed copy was very faulty but that i would ask of lord littleton a manuscript copy which was correct this is sufficient to make mr rousseau conclude that lord littleton is his mortal enemy and my intimate friend and that we are in a conspiracy against him he ought rather to have concluded that the printed copy could not come from me mr hume  the piece above mentioned was shown to the translater before its publication and many absurd liberties taken with the original pointed out and censured at which time there did not appear from the parties concerned in it that mr hume could have had the least hand it or could have known any thing of the edition english translator    whom i dont even know what have i done to mr walpole whom i know full as little what do they know of me except that i am unhappy and a friend to their friend hume what can he have said to them for it is only through him they know any thing of me i can very well imagine that considering the part he has to play he does not unmask himself to every body for then he would be disguised to no body i can very well imagine that he does not speak of me to general conway and the duke of richmond as he does in his private conversations with mr walpole and his secret correspondence with mr dalembert but let any one discover the clue that has been unravelled since my arrival in london and it will easily be seen whether mr hume does not hold the principal thread at length the moment arrived in which it was thought proper to strike the great blow the effect of which was prepared for by a fresh satirical piece put in the papers i have never seen this piece neither before nor after its publication nor has it come to the knowledge of any body to whom i have spoken of it mr hume  the translator who has been attentive to every thing that has come out from or about mr rousseau knows also nothing of this piece why did not mr rousseau mention particularly in what paper and when it appeared english translator    had there remained in me the least doubt it would have been impossible to have harbored it after perusing this piece as it contained facts unknown to any body but mr hume exaggerated it is true in order to render them odious to the public  it is said in this paper that my door was opened to the rich and shut to the poor pray who knows when my door was open or shut except mr hume with whom i lived and by whom every body was introduced that i saw i will except one great personage whom i gladly received without knowing him and whom i should still have more gladly received if i had known him it was mr hume who told me his name when he was gone on which information i was really chagrined that as he deigned to mount up two pair of stairs he was not received in the first floor as to the poor i have nothing to say about the matter i was constantly desirous of seeing less company but as i was unwilling to displease any one i suffered myself to be directed in this affair altogether by mr hume and endeavored to receive every body he introduced as well as i could without distinction whether rich or poor it is said in the same piece that i received my relations very coldly not to say any thing worse this general charge relates to my having once received with some indifference the only relation i have out of geneva and that in the presence of mr hume i was not present when mr rousseau received his cousin i only just saw them afterward together for about a minute on the terrace in bucking hamstreet mr hume  it must necessarily be either mr hume or this relation who furnished that piece of intelligence now my cousin whom i have always known for a friendly relation and a worthy man is incapable of furnishing materials for public satires against me add to this that his situation in life confining him to the conversation of persons in trade he has no connection with men of letters or paragraphwriters and still less with satirists and libellers so that the article could not come from him at the worst can i help imagining that mr hume must have endeavored to take advantage of what he said and construed it in favor of his own purpose it is not improper to add that after my rupture with mr hume i wrote an account of it to my cousin  in fine it is said in the same paper that i am apt to change my friends no great subtlety is necessary to comprehend what this reflection is preparative to  but let us distinguish facts i have preserved some very valuable and solid friends for twentyfive to thirty years i have others whose friendship is of a later date but no less valuable and which if i live i may preserve still longer i have not found indeed the same security in general among those friendships i have made with men of letters i have for this reason sometimes changed them and shall always change them when they appear suspicious for i am determined never to have friends by way of ceremony i have them only with a view to show them my affection  if ever i was fully and clearly convinced of any thing i am so convinced that mr hume furnished the materials for the above paper  but what is still more i have not only that absolute conviction but it is very clear to me that mr hume intended i should for how can it be supposed that a man of his subtlety should be so imprudent as to expose himself thus if he had not intended it what was his design in it nothing is more clear than this it was to raise my resentment to the highest pitch that he might strike the blow he was preparing to give me with greater eclat he knew he had nothing more to do than to put me in a passion and i should be guilty of a number of absurdities we are now arrived at the critical moment which is to show whether he reasoned well or ill  it is necessary to have all the presence of mind all the phlegm and resolution of mr hume to be able to take the part he has taken after all that has passed between us in the embarrassment i was under in writing to general conway i could make use only of obscure expressions to which mr hume in quality of my friend gave what interpretation he pleased supposing therefore for he knew very well to the contrary that it was the circumstance of secrecy which gave me uneasiness he obtained the promise of the general to endeavor to remove it but before any thing was done it was previously necessary to know whether i would accept of the pension without that condition in order not to expose his majesty to a second refusal  this was the decisive moment the end and object of all his labors an answer was required he would have it to prevent effectually indeed my neglect of it he sent to mr davenport a duplicate of his letter to me and not content with this precaution wrote me word in another billet that he could not possibly stay any longer in london to serve me i was giddy with amazement on reading this note never in my life did i meet with any thing so unaccountable  at length he obtained from me the so much desired answer and began presently to triumph in writing to mr davenport he treated me as a monster of brutality and ingratitude but he wanted to do still more he thinks his measures well taken no proof can be made to appear against him he demands an explanation he shall have it and here it is  that last stroke was a masterpiece he himself proves every thing and that beyond reply  i will suppose though by way of impossibility that my complaints against mr hume never reached his ears that he knew nothing of them but was as perfectly ignorant as if he had held no cabal with those who are acquainted with them but had resided all the while in china how was it possible for me to guess at such chimerical suspicions mr davenport the only person of my acquaintance who then saw mr rousseau assures me that he was perfectly ignorant of them himself mr hume  yet the behavior passing directly between us the last striking words which i said to him in london the letter which followed replete with fears and anxiety my persevering silence still more expressive than words my public and bitter complaints with regard to the letter of mr dalembert my letter to the secretary of state who did not write to me in answer to that which mr hume wrote to me himself and in which i did not mention him and in fine my refusal without deigning to address myself to him to acquiesce in an affair which he had managed in my favor with my own privity and without any opposition on my part all this must have spoken in a very forcible manner i will not say to any person of the least sensibility but to every man of common sense  strange that after i had ceased to correspond with him for three months when i had made no answer to any one of his letters however important the subject of it surrounded with both public and private marks of that affliction which his infidelity gave me a man of so enlightened an understanding of so penetrating a genius by nature and so dull by design should see nothing hear nothing feel nothing be moved at nothing but without one word of complaint justification or explanation continue to give me the most pressing marks of his good will to serve me in spite of myself he wrote to me affectionately that he could not stay any longer in london to do me service as if we had agreed that he should stay there for that purpose this blindness this insensibility this perseverance are not in nature they must be accounted for therefore from other motives let us set this behavior in a still clearer light for this is the decisive point  mr hume must necessarily have acted in this affair either as one of the first or last of mankind there is no medium it remains to determine which of the two it has been  could mr hume after so many instances of disdain on my part have still the astonishing generosity as to persevere sincerely to serve me he knew it was impossible for me to accept his good offices so long as i entertained for him such sentiments as i had conceived he had himself avoided an explanation so that to serve me without justifying himself would have been to render his services useless this therefore was no generosity if he supposed that in such circumstances i should have accepted his services he must have supposed me to have been an infamous scoundrel it was then in behalf of a man whom he supposed to be a scoundrel that he so warmly solicited a pension from his majesty can any thing be supposed more extravagant  but let it be supposed that mr hume constantly pursuing his plan should only have said to himself this is the moment for its execution for by pressing rousseau to accept the pension he will be reduced either to accept or refuse it if he accepts it with the proofs i have in hand against him i shall be able completely to disgrace him if he refuses after having accepted it he will have no pretext but must give a reason for such refusal this is what i expect if he accuses me he is ruined  if i say mr hume reasoned with himself in this manner he did what was consistent with his plan and in that case very natural indeed this is the only way in which his conduct in this affair can be explained for upon any other supposition it is inexplicable if this be not demonstrable nothing ever was so the critical situation to which he had now reduced me recalled strongly to my mind the four words i mentioned above and which i heard him say and repeat at a time when i did not comprehend their full force it was the first night after our departure from paris we slept in the same chamber when during the night i heard him several times cry out with great vehemence in the french language je tiens j j rousseau i have you rousseau i know not whether he was awake or asleep i cannot answer for every thing i may say in my sleep and much less am i conscious whether or not i dream in french but pray as mr rousseau did not know whether i was asleep or awake when i pronounced those terrible words with such a terrible voice how is he certain that he himself was well awake when he heard them mr hume   the expression was remarkable coming from a man who is too well acquainted with the french language to be mistaken with regard to the force or choice of words i took those words however and i could not then take them otherwise than in a favorable sense notwithstanding the tone of voice in which they were spoken was still less favorable than the expression it is indeed impossible for me to give any idea of it but it corresponds exactly with those terrible looks i have before mentioned at every repetition of them i was seized with a shuddering a kind of horror i could not resist though a moments recollection restored me and made me smile at my terror the next day all this was so perfectly obliterated that i did not even once think of it during my stay in london and its neighborhood it was not till my arrival in this place that so many things have contributed to recall these words to mind and indeed recall them every moment  these words the tone of which dwells on my heart as if i had but just heard them those long and fatal looks so frequently cast on me the patting me on the back with the repetition of o my dear sir in answer to my suspicions of his being a traitor all this affects me to such a degree after what preceded that this recollection had i no other would be sufficient to prevent any reconciliation or return of confidence between us not a night indeed passes over my head but i think i hear rousseau i have you ring in my ears as if he had just pronounced them  yes mr hume i know you have me but that only by mere externals you have me in the public opinion and judgment of mankind you have my reputation and perhaps my security to do with as you will the general prepossession is in your favor it will be very easy for you to make me pass for the monster you have begun to represent me and i already see the barbarous exultation of my implacable enemies the public will no longer spare me without any farther examination every body is on the side of those who have conferred favors because each is desirous to attract the same good offices by displaying a sensibility of the obligation i foresee readily the consequences of all this particularly in the country to which you have conducted me and where being without friends and an utter stranger to every body i lie almost entirely at your mercy the sensible part of mankind however will comprehend that i must be so far from seeking this affair that nothing more disagreeable or terrible could possibly have happened to me in my present situation they will perceive that nothing but my invincible aversion to all kind of falsehood and the possibility of my professing a regard for a person who had forfeited it could have prevented my dissimulation at a time when it was on so many accounts my interest but the sensible part of mankind are few nor do they make the greatest noise in the world  yes mr hume you have me by all the ties of this life but you have no power over my probity or my fortitude which being independent either of you or of mankind i will preserve in spite of you think not to frighten me with the fortune that awaits me i know the opinions of mankind i am accustomed to their injustice and have learned to care little about it if you have taken your resolution as i have reason to believe you have be assured mine is taken also i am feeble indeed in body but never possessed greater strength of mind  mankind may say and do what they will it is of little consequence to me what is of consequence however is that i should end as i have begun that i should continue to preserve my ingenuousness and integrity to the end whatever may happen and that i should have no cause to reproach myself either with meanness in adversity or insolence in prosperity whatever disgrace attends or misfortune threatens me i am ready to meet them though i am to be pitied i am much less so than you and all the revenge i shall take on you is to leave you the tormenting consciousness of being obliged in spite of yourself to have a respect for the unfortunate person you have oppressed  in closing this letter i am surprised at my having been able to write it if it were possible to die with grief every line was sufficient to kill me with sorrow every circumstance of the affair is equally incomprehensible such conduct as yours has been is not in nature it is contradictory to itself and yet it is demonstrable to me that it has been such as i conceive on each side of me there is a bottomless abyss and i am lost in one or the other  if you are guilty i am the most unfortunate of mankind if you are innocent i am the most culpable and does it depend on an if after all mr rs positive conviction and absolute demonstrations english trans  you even make me desire to be that contemptible object yes the situation to which you see me reduced prostrate at your feet crying out for mercy and doing every thing to obtain it publishing aloud my own unworthiness and paying the most explicit homage to your virtues would be a state of joy and cordial effusion after the grievous state of restraint and mortification into which you have plunged me i have but a word more to say if you are guilty write to me no more it would be superfluous for certainly you could not deceive me if you are innocent justify yourself i know my duty i love and shall always love it however difficult and severe there is no state of abjection that a heart not formed for it may not recover from once again i say if you are innocent deign to justify yourself if you are not adieu for ever  j j r   i hesitated some time whether i should make any reply to this strange memorial at length i determined to write to mr rousseau the following letter  mr hume to mr rousseau lislestreet leicesterfields july         sir i shall only answer one article of your long letter it is that which regards the conversation between us the evening before your departure mr davenport had imagined a good natured artifice to make you believe that a retour chaise had offered for wooton and i believe he made an advertisement be put in the papers in order the better to deceive you his purpose only was to save you some expenses in the journey which i thought a laudable project though i had no hand either in contriving or conducting it you entertained however suspicions of his design while we were sitting alone by my fireside and you reproached me with concurring in it i endeavored to pacify you and to divert the discourse but to no purpose you sat sullen and was either silent or made me very peevish answers at last you rose up and took a turn or two about the room when all of a sudden and to my great surprise you clapped yourself on my knee threw your arms about my neck kissed me with seeming ardour and bedewed my face with tears you exclaimed my dear friend can you ever pardon this folly after all the pains you have taken to serve me after the numberless instances of friendship you have given me here i reward you with this ill humor and sullenness but your forgiveness of me will be a new instance of your friendship and i hope you will find at bottom that my heart is not unworthy of it  i was very much affected i own and i believe there passed a very tender scene between us you added by way of compliment that though i had many better titles to recommend me to posterity yet perhaps my uncommon attachment and friendship to a poor unhappy persecuted man would not altogether be overlooked  this incident sir was somewhat remarkable and it is impossible that either you or i could so soon have forgot it but you have had the assurance to tell me the story twice in a manner so different or rather so opposite that when i persist as i do in this account it necessarily follows that either you or i are a liar you imagine perhaps that because the incident passed privately without a witness the question will lie between the credibility of your assertion and of mine but you shall not have this advantage or disadvantage which ever you are pleased to term it i shall produce against you other proofs which will put the matter beyond controversy  first you are not aware that i have a letter under your hand which is totally irreconcilable with your account and confirms mine that of the   d of march which is entirely cordial and proves that mr rousseau had never till that moment entertained or at least discovered the smallest suspicion against me there is also in the same letter a peevish passage about the hire of a chaise mr hume   secondly i told the story the next day or the day after to mr davenport with a friendly view of preventing any such good natured artifices for the future he surely remembers it  thirdly as i thought the story much to your honor i told it to several of my friends here i even wrote it to mde de boufflers at paris i believe no one will imagine that i was preparing beforehand an apology in case of a rupture with you which of all human events i should then have thought the most incredible especially as we were separated almost for ever and i still continued to render you the most essential services  fourthly the story as i tell it is consistent and rational there is not common sense in your account what because sometimes when absent in thought i have a fixed look or stare you suspect me to be a traitor and you have the assurance to tell me of such black and ridiculous suspicions are not most studious men and many of them more than i subject to such reveries or fits of absence without being exposed to such suspicions you do not even pretend that before you left london you had any other solid grounds of suspicion against me  i shall enter into no detail with regard to your letter the other articles of it are as much without foundation as you yourself know this to be i shall only add in general that i enjoyed about a month ago an uncommon pleasure when i reflected that through many difficulties and by most assiduous care and pains i had beyond my most sanguine expectations provided for your repose honor and fortune but i soon felt a very sensible uneasiness when i found that you had wantonly and voluntarily thrown away all these advantages and was become the declared enemy of your own repose fortune and honor i cannot be surprised after this that you are my enemy adieu and for ever i am sir yours  d h   to all these papers i need only subjoin the following letter of mr walpole to me which proves how ignorant and innocent i am of the whole matter of the king of prussias letter  mr walpole to mr hume arlington street july         i cannot be precise as to the time of my writing the king of prussias letter but i do assure you with the utmost truth that it was several days before you left paris and before rousseaus arrival there of which i can give you a strong proof for i not only suppressed the letter while you staid there out of delicacy to you but it was the reason why out of delicacy to myself i did not go to see him as you often proposed to me thinking it wrong to go and make a cordial visit to a man with a letter in my pocket to laugh at him you are at full liberty dear sir to make use of what i say in your justification either to rousseau or any body else i should be very sorry to have you blamed on my account i have a hearty contempted of rousseau and am perfectly indifferent what any body thinks of the matter if there is any fault which i am far from thinking let it lie on me no parts can hinder my laughing at their possessor if he is a mountebank if he has a bad and most ungrateful heart as rousseau has shown in your case into the bargain he will have my scorn likewise as he will of all good and sensible men you may trust your sentence to such who are as respectable judges as any that have pored over ten thousand more volumes  yours most sincerely h w   thus i have given a narrative as concise as possible of this extraordinary affair which i am told has very much attracted the attention of the public and which contains more unexpected incidents than any other in which i was ever engaged the persons to whom i have shown the original papers which authenticate the whole have differed very much in their opinion as well of the use i ought to make of them as of mr rousseaus present sentiments and state of mind some of them have maintained that he is altogether insincere in his quarrel with me and his opinion of my guilt and that the whole proceeds from that excessive pride which forms the basis of his character and which leads him both to seek the eclat of refusing the king of englands bounty and to shake off the intolerable burden of an obligation to me by every sacrifice of honor truth and friendship as well as of interest they found their sentiments on the absurdity of that first supposition on which he grounds his anger viz that mr walpoles letter which he knew had been every where dispersed both in paris and london was given to the press by me and as this supposition is contrary to common sense on the one hand and not supported even by the pretense of the slightest probability on the other they conclude that it never had any weight even with the person himself who lays hold of it they confirm their sentiments by the number of fictions and lies which he employs to justify his anger fictions with regard to points in which it is impossible for him to be mistaken they also remark his real cheerfulness and gaiety amidst the deep melancholy with which he pretended to be oppressed not to mention the absurd reasoning which runs through the whole and on which it is impossible for any man to rest his conviction and though a very important interest is here abandoned yet money is not universally the chief object with mankind vanity weighs farther with some men particularly with this philosopher and the very oftentation of refusing a pension from the king of england an ostentation which with regard to other princes he has often sought might be of itself a sufficient motive for his present conduct  there are others of my friends who regard this whole affair in a more compassionate light and consider mr rousseau as an object rather of pity than of anger they suppose the same domineering pride and ingratitude to be the basis of his character but they are also willing to believe that his brain has received a sensible shock and that his judgment set afloat is carried to every side as it is pushed by the current of his humors and of his passions the absurdity of his belief is no proof of its insincerity he imagines himself the sole important being in the universe he fancies all mankind to be in a combination against him his greatest benefactor as hurting him most is the chief object of his animosity and though he supports all his whimsies by lies and fictions this is so frequent a case with wicked men who are in that middle state between sober reason and total frenzy that it needs give no surprise to any body  i own that i am much inclined to this latter opinion though at the same time i question whether in any period of his life mr rousseau was ever more in his senses than he is at present the former brilliancy of his genius and his great talents for writing are no proof of the contrary it is an old remark that great wits are near allied to madness and even in those frantic letters which he has wrote to me there are evidently strong traces of his wonted genius and eloquence he has frequently told me that he was composing his memoirs in which justice should be done to his own character to that of his friends and to that of his enemies and as mr davenport informs me that since his retreat into the country he has been much employed in writing i have reason to conclude that he is at present finishing that undertaking nothing could be more unexpected to me than my passing so suddenly from the class of his friends to that of his enemies but this transition being made i must expect to be treated accordingly and i own that this reflection gave me some anxiety in his letter of the   d of march he flatters me indirectly with the figure i am to make in his memoirs in that of the   d of june he threatens me these are proofs how much he is in earnest  a work of this nature both from the celebrity of the person and the strokes of eloquence interspersed would certainly attract the attention of the world and it might be published either after my death or after that of the author in the former case there would be no body who could tell the story or justify my memory in the latter my apology wrote in opposition to a dead person would lose a great deal of its authenticity for this reason i have at present collected the whole story into one narrative that i may show it to my friends and at any time have it in my power to make whatever use of it they and i should think proper i am and always have been such a lover of peace that nothing but necessity or very forcible reasons could have obliged me to give it to the public  perdidi beneficium numquid quae consecravimus perdidisse nos dicimus inter consecrata beneficium est etiamsi male respondit been collocatum non est ille qualem speravimus simus nos quales fuimus ei dissimiles seneca de beneficiis lib vii cap    declaration of mr dalembert relating to mr walpoles letter addressed to the french editors it is with the greatest surprise i learn from mr hume that mr rousseau accuses me of being the author of the ironical letter addressed to him in the public papers under the name of the king of prussia every body knows both at paris and london that such letter was written by mr walpole nor does he disown it he acknowleges only that he was a little assisted in regard to the style by a person he does not name and whom perhaps he ought to name as to my part on whom the public suspicions have fallen in this affair i am not at all acquainted with mr walpole i dont even believe i ever spoke to him having only happened to meet once occasionally on a visit  i have not only had not the least to do either directly or indirectly with the letter in question but could mention above an hundred persons among the friends as well as enemies of mr rousseau who have heard me greatly disapprove of it because as i said we ought not to ridicule the unfortunate especially when they do us no harm besides my respect for the king of prussia and the acknowledgments i owe him might i should have thought have persuaded mr rousseau that i should not have taken such a liberty with the name of that prince even though in pleasantry  to this i shall add that i never was an enemy to mr rousseau either open or secret as he pretends and i defy him to produce the least proof of my having endeavored to injure him in any shape whatever i can prove to the contrary by the most respectable witnesses that i have always endeavored to oblige him whenever it lay in my power  as to my pretended secret correspondence with mr hume it is very certain that we did not begin to write to each other till about five or six months after his departure on occasion of the quarrel arisen between him and mr rousseau and into which the latter thought proper unnecessarily to introduce me  i thought this declaration necessary for my own sake as well as for the sake of truth and in regard to the situation of mr rousseau i sincerely lament his having so little confidence in the probity of mankind and particularly in that of mr hume  dalembert   the end erratum the following note should have been inserted in page    line   after the words i was instantly stoken of in print in a very equivocal or slighting manner so then i find i am to answer for every article of every magazine and newspaper printed in england i assure mr rousseau i would rather answer for every robbery committed on the highway and i am entirely as innocent of the one as the other mr hume
