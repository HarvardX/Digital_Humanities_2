plan in few plain words he ran the fable through and without favor published all he knew an honest custom for the plan was clear the scene was simple and the muse sincere no tawdry fashions warped the public taste the times were candid and the stage was chaste can we expect in these enlightened days a courtly age should hold such vulgar ways or that a blabbing prologue should disclose scenes which

rites began and left me thus to sorrow to despair  orus daughter of grief sethona every hour changes the state of things to day the sea roused by the northern wind assails the sky and wears the face of ruin ever the morn unveils her eyes it smooths its ruffld brow and holds a mirror to the stars of heaven  sethona orus i owe this emblem of my fate to thy humanity what ray of joy can pierce the deep dark dwelling of my soul where menes lies entombed  orus time will unfold more than thy hopes could cherish know this night this present hour is pregnant with events to me in part revealed  sethona ha what events the dimest shade of hope in grief like mine fancy may work to comfort  orus as i stood before the altar of ammonian jove in fervent meditation i beheld the towers of memphis tottering and the nile rushing through all her gates i heard a sound as when the winds contending in their caves disturb the mountains saw the shadowy lines of bannerd armies closing in the air streaming with blood a headless trunk appeared grasping a scepter over him strode in steel the warlike form of menes last uprose dim through the gleam of arms a hoary head encircled with a gorgeous diadem it seemed thy father  sethona seraphis my father and menes hapless ghosts  orus peace to their shades twas but a vision of the mental eye the unbodied semblances of future things and not departed spirits  sethona hope begins to dawn upon me in thy words i feel the force of inspiration yet my grief succeeds like darkness to the transient gleam of some deluding meteor can the tomb give up its dead can menes hear my voice and rescue me from the detested arms of amasis can seraphis restore the long extinguished glories of his line can i forget my sorrow idle dreams  orus and yet such dreams may take substantial forms three days have not elapsed since from this fane menes was torn by amasis as yet no certain tidings of his fate are known though fame reports his death today his friend noble otanes by the kings command from sais came where he has governed long averse from courts with dignity and fame worthy his high desent from egypts kings  sethona oh might i see him ever the tyrants rage destroys his sacred life  orus fear not his rage the fate of menes has already raised a storm in memphis that may shake his throne otanes on his entrance has received the highest honors by a subject borne  enter myrtaeus orus retires to the altar myrtaeus prepare the nuptial rites the king approaches  sethona alas myrtaeus whither shall i fly who can protect me innocence is weak and tears like the cold crystal drops in caves can only serve to petrify the heart of amasis  myrtaeus his soul is fierce but love   sethona speak not of love from amasis nor think so meanly of my virtue of my faith and firm affection for departed menes though dead his image dwells within my soul and leaves no room for others  all my joys were grafted on him now the tree is fallen and i am left to wither on the ground  myrtaeus recall not thus the memory of the dead nor rend the veil which nature kindly draws between us and the tomb and yet my soul when thou complainst seems covetous of grief i could sit down and listen to thy tale devour each piteous circumstance of woe and mourn with thee for ever  sethona oh myrtaeus he was a friend most worthy of thy tears humane susceptible of the distress of others but unshaken by his own gentle in peace but terrible in war as the rude blast that from our desert pours dark with the fate of armies  myrtaeus ah forbear you pierce my very soul  sethona o could i fly to some brown desert far removed from man and in the shade of some poor lonely tree beside a lingering stream in silence sit and muse from morn to eve from eve to morn or tell my sister of the sky that wanes with me apace the story of my woe there undisturbed i might devour my grief like some sad ghost that nightly sits alone pale bending over the slowly twinkling flame of a decaying meteor flourish of trumpets myrtaeus it is the king  sethona whither shall i resort amid my foes i stand alone unpitied and forlorn exit sethona enter amasis attended amasis why flies sethona now the voice of mirth resounds through egypt and propitious stars combine to bless this hour  myrtaeus at thy approach she suddenly withdrew tears in her eyes her looks expressing anguish and despair  amasis the mere caprice of women still afraid or seemingly afraid of what they wish they fly but to delude   myrtaeus she sighs and talks of love and menes in such mournful strain as fills each eye with sympathetic tears she will not hear of comfort time perhaps and gentle means may sooth her mind to peace but force might now be fatal  amasis fear not that inform the princess we attend her presence  myrtaeus too well she knows it  exit myrtaeus orus descending from the altar sovereign of the nile let not my words offend  the gods forbid the solemn rites whilst in my hand i held the victims heart it burst and on the ground dissolved away  amasis then let another bleed  orus dare i advise the nuptials were delayed till some propitious idle hour of peace for whilst the ethiopian in his wrath threatens invasion fame and glory call for deeds of arms and do thou yield to love  amasis presumptious priest thy sanctity thy age and all those mystic symbols of thy god shall not protect thee  speak the omens fair  orus o king it is not for mortals to belie the sacred will of heaven the earth itself teems with uncommon births the tombs appear deserted by their dead the air is filled with sounds the streets with unsubstantial forms great ammons helmet nods upon his brow whilst he declares ambiguous oracles and frowns on egypt  amasis let him shroud the sun in tenfold darkness shake the solid earth subvert the broadbasd pyramids disclose the oozy bottom of the frighted nile my purpose stands unmoved then hence away let my commands be oracles to thee and ammon may be silent exit orus enter sethona and myrtaeus amasis how long sethona will thou arm those eyes with cold disdain against me thus how long at awful distance must i breathe my vows of love and constancy the hour is come the nuptial feast prepared and yet thou shunst my longing arms as if contagion sprung from every touch  sethona my looks have not deceived my soul detests thy person and thy name have thou not been the scourge of all my race the bane of all my joys and can thou hope returns of love for unexampld wrongs  amasis forgive the past the gods themselves forgive  i have been much to blame but if sincere repentance  if the pangs of keen remorse could ere atone for guilt i stand absolved and hope for thy forgiveness  hope for more thy love  for which alone i risqud my life and dared perdition  sethona ha it is a crime to listen to thy words  i will hear no more  my love is not for thee the guilty thought would shake this sacred temple and profane the presence of the gods  the shades of night the midnight hour of silence the dark tomb of seraphis my father the long line of ancestry that darkly rest in death within the sacred pyramids on these my melancholy soul delights to dwell there let me wander and indulge my woes  amasis can unavailing sorrow sooth the dead deep are their slumbers deaf their ear to woe or did their spirits hover round  can joy arise from our distress can those they loved afford them pleasure by incessant tears then weep no more  mount thou thy fathers throne egypt shall yield her scepter to thy hand and africks nations bend beneath thy sway  sethona could thou enthrone me midst the stars of heaven and say the world that rolls beneath thy feet and all these splendid orbs around are thine i would reject them as the price of guilt though pressed with all the miseries of life  amasis enough of argument know then this hour shall make thee mine shall bend thee to my arms shall change these haughty frowns and vain complaints to gentle smiles and murmurings of love  sethona then know my soul amidst my ruined state maintains the dignity of egypts kings looks down upon thee  threats to me are vain my soul contemns them all  amasis by egypts gods you are sovereign of my heart the full extent of all my wishes  high in regal state thou shall command the nations princes kings the nile the ocean to thy feet shall bring their yearly tribute still my soul shall dwell on thy perfections love shall crown our days with joy with transport  seizing her sethona spare me amasis i beg not for my life i wish to die but if my tears my prayers can move thy heart o let my wearied soul forsake the world in all its native innocence  amasis arise arise sethona do thou think my love a spark to be extinguished by a tear a flame to be blown out with sobs and sighs a soft impression melted by the breath of pity no  and would thou not despise such cold affection soon within my arms thy strange aversion shall be changed to love and thou shall wonder at thy own perverseness  sethona no  never never  amasis to the altar  sethona here  here let me perish   amasis thus i bear thee hence  sethona inhuman man tomorrow   amasis no  this hour  this moment  sethona tyrant  i will not betray my faith to menes  amasis menes is no more  sethona then grant this hour to grief   amasis thou pleadst in vain in vain thou strivst  away   sethona fainting o menes menes  amasis ha whence this paleness this is no deceit the blood retires a transitory death oerwhelms her senses  bear her to our halls amasis and attendants lead her out enter menes suddenly orus following orus menes forbear  menes it was sethonas voice  orus rash youth thy frenzy ruins all our hopes  menes as well thou might oppose the bolt of jove winged with his wrath away  lest in my rage thou too should perish  orus tread on my gray hairs i will not quit thee wherefore would thou rush on certain death and in an evil hour destroy the work of years the fruit of all our expectations let not rage prevail  a certain death without revenge attends thy rashness stay this night this very hour may crown thy hopes  menes this moment fills my soul with mortal anguish in a state like mine it were a crime to listen to the voice of prudence  wherefore thus obstruct my course since full revenge is my determined aim trust to my conduct  orus whilst this storm of rage darkens thy reason hence thou shall not stir do thou despise my council  have thou lost all reverence for my friendship for my age and sacred function is the life i saved unworthy of thy gratitude  thy care  young man this frenzy suits not with thy fame a nobler passion now demands thy sword egypt amidst her tears looks up to thee her only hope not amasis alone must perish tyranny itself must fall  menes what noble purpose labors in thy mind i stand prepared orus command my sword my life my fame but first let me behold sethona in this moment of despair she may be lost for ever  orus danger lies between thee and thy wishes yet to calm this tempest of thy soul a faithful slave at my request shall quickly guide thy steps through the deserted passage formed of old by kings who loved in secret to approach the gods but let not idle dreams of love ensnare thee by delay with speed return to hear to execute a great design  menes whatever thy wisdom plans is deemed by me the will of heaven  orus too long thou tarryst here this is no place of safety moeris soon shall lead thee to sethona in thy cell a moment wait by my command the slave shall there attend thee  menes nearest to the gods to thee i trust to save a dearer life than this which now i owe thee to direct my steps to glory to revenge to rouse the warlike genius of our native land armed with the wrath of heaven to crush the power of amasis and level in the dust those massy fabrics which his pride has raised  exit menes orus alone o that this night were past and seraphis again established on his ancient throne till then i must not tell this gallant youth his high descent that he as sethos son is nephew to the king and egypts heir his headlong fury breaks through my designs i must invent some scheme to check his rage and stop the progress of his illtimed love till from his throne usurped the tyrant falls why stays otanes thus conspiracies like thunder clouds should in a moment form and strike like lightning ere the sound is heard  end of the first act act ii scene sethona s apartment sethona entering in terror sethona he finds no rest in death it bore the form of menes dimly he arose through night he stood in silence he pursues my steps here i am left alone my voice of grief invades his dark repose again  he comes enter menes thou awful shade retire  menes away with fear  sethona it is he  it is he himself  menes my souls delight once more i clasp thee to my panting breast this this is more than joy  sethona where have thou been  menes compose thy mind a while   sethona since thou art safe why should i question farther  menes thou shall hear but let not grief affect thy tender mind or throw a damp upon this hour of joy  sethona of joy indeed that gives me back my love where have thou been oh menes tell me where i will be calm  but let me hear it all  menes that day on which we stood before the gods with willing vows to consecrate our loves the tyrants guards assaulted me unarmed and tore me from osiris and from thee through paths unknown they led me to a cell cast me in chains then raising from the floor a ponderous marble to my view disclosed a dark deep pit a dreary sepulcher headlong they threw me down to dwell with night famine and horror solitude and death  sethona o dreadful state  menes cold bruised disconsolate with fetters galled with mortal anguish torn i say resigned to destiny  sethona ye gods  menes then rising up i crept along the walls from place to place and often in my arms embraced the embalmed dead through many a cell i wandered cheerless when a hollow sound rolled murmuring through the tombs i wished again for silence  by degrees the noise approached   sethona approached  menes and soon a ray of livid light shot through the darkness then a form appeared that seemed not mortal clad in vestments pure as heavens meridian beam his beard was white and pale his aged visage faintly seen by the blue taper in his trembling hand towered me he moved then claspt me in his arms and welcomed me to liberty and life  i knew him then for orus  sethona happy sight what brought him thither  menes often at dead of night he visits his great ancestors released from all my chains i trod his cautious path through winding ways he led me to the fane of great osiris where i scarce had stood an hour concealed when by thy voice alarmed i rushed to save thee  sethona still my fears intrude upon my joys is amasis informed of thy escape from death  menes he knows it not  sethona how came thou hither did thou pass unseen unknown by all  menes my steps to thee were led by faithful maeris  sethona we are betrayed and lost he with the times has changed our sorrows all proceed from maeris when before the gods we pledged our vows of love to amasis he bore the grateful secret and received the price of perfidy while yet i speak thy late escape is to his ear conveyed this fatal hour the tyrants vengeance falls again upon thee menes thou must fly and leave me to my fate  menes thou do not mean to wound my honor in the tenderest part by the proposal of a deed so base it must not be  our fate has made us one and what but death can part us  sethona blame me not if my affection and my fears advised the only means of safety  menes trust the gods nor think of danger  sethona think not that i fear the utmost rage of stern adversity whilst thou art left with thee i could be blessed wrecked on a pointed solitary rock though loud through night the spirits of the storm howled on the hoary deep  menes that smile alone would calm the tempests rage wherever thou art there dwells my joy a ray divine is poured from heaven around thee sympathy of soul and finer feelings than the plant that shrinks from the light contact of an insects wing distinguish thee   enter an officer with a guard officer the king commands that menes may be seized for crimes of treason  sethona ruin death ensues  menes for treason hence or this my sword   sethona alas  officer put up thy sword thy rashness naught avails  menes it is better now to die in arms than fall defenseless unrevenged by bloody slaves that murder in the dark i will not yield retreat or perish  officer rush upon him   menes death awaits the man who dares advance   sethona o heaven o menes yield  officer why grasp ye thus your swords yet look so pale the orders of the king are death

cannot soar too high in this decisive moment of thy fate but amasis may come a while retire i must confer with menes banish fear our last resolves shall be conveyed to thee  sethona thy words restore me from the wild abyss of horror and despair may all the gods confirm thy hopes and prosper thy designs exit sethona otanes menes thou know that with paternal care i reared thy infancy and trained thy youth to arms with joy from year to year beheld thy ardent spirit kindling as it flew to deeds of glory often in the field i proved thy courage now the time is come to prove thy fortitude thou must resign sethona to the king or instant death awaits thy disobedience  menes ha what means otanes yield sethona prove at once false to my vows a traitor to my love detested lost dishonored he that once falls in his own opinion falls indeed but he that is conscious of his virtue stands unmoved the pressure of an adverse world  otanes menes in any other cause but this such noble sentiments i would approve but love awhile must give a place to deeds of death or fame this night i mean to raise a king in egypt and subvert the throne of the usurper  menes shall it be to night  otanes to night the
