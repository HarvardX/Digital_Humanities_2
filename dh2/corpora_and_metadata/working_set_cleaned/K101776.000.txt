poems upon several occasions  by mrs leapor of brackley in northamptonshire  london printed and sold by j roberts in warwick lane mdccxlviii  to the reader the author of the following poems was taken from the world at the time when she first began to meet with encouragement to print them and in compliance with her dying request they are now published for the benefit of her father who is desirous to make use of this opportunity of returning his humble thanks to the subscribers for the favor they have been pleased to show him  the short account which has been given of mrs leapor with the proposals for a subscription it is hoped will sufficiently apologize for the defects that shall be found in this collection had she lived to correct and finish these first productions of a young unassisted genius certainly they would have been greatly improved though as they now appear in their native simplicity they cannot surely but afford an agreeable entertainment to the reader and serve as a convincing proof of the common aphorism poeta nascitur non fit  mrs leapor from a child delighted in reading and particularly poetry but had few opportunities of procuring any books of that kind the author she most admired was mr pope whom she chiefly endeavored to imitate how far she succeeded in this or any other of her attempts must be left to the judgment of the public and indeed if the poems will not recommend themselves to the reader little advantage is to be expected from any thing that can be said of them here but in justice to the memory of the author as well as for the satisfaction of all those who have so cheerfully and generously contributed to improve the best legacy she could bequeath to her father we beg leave to inform them that her conduct and behavior entirely corresponded with those virtuous and pious sentiments which are conspicuous in her poems she was courteous and obliging to all cheerful goodnatured and contented in the station of life in which providence had placed her the generous and charitable spirit that appeared in her was exerted upon all occasions to the utmost of her ability and was such as would have been ornamental in a much higher sphere to which in all probability if it had pleased god to spare her life her own merit would have raised her  some of her papers a little time before her death were communicated to several persons of rank and of distinguished taste and judgment who were pleased to express a great satisfaction in the view they had of promoting a subscription for their being printed and by that means encouraging her to proceed in a science so agreeable to herself and entertaining to them but her friends are now left to lament her loss and that so great a part of a short and valuable life was spent

    poems on several occasions dorinda at her glass dorinda once the fairest of the train toast of the town and triumph of the plain whose shining eyes a thousand hearts alarmed whose wit inspired and whose follies charmed who with invention racked her careful breast to find new graces to insult the rest now sees her temples take a swarthy hue and the dark veins resign their beauteous blue while on her cheeks the fading roses die and the last sparkles tremble in her eye bright sol had drove the sable clouds away and cheered the heavens with a stream of day the woodland choir their little throats prepare to chant new carols to the morning air in silence wrapped and curtaind from the day on her sad pillow lost dorinda lay to mirth a stranger and the like to ease no pleasures charm her nor no slumbers please for if to close her weary lids she tries detested wrinkles swim before her eyes at length the mourner raised her aching head and discontented left her hated bed but sighing shunned the relics of her pride and left the toilet for the chimney side her careless locks upon her shoulders lay uncurld alas because they half were gray no magic baths employ her skilful hand but useless phials on her table stand she slights her form no more by youth inspired and loathes that idol which she once admired at length all trembling of herself afraid to her loved glass repaired the weeping maid and with a sigh addressed the altered shade say what art thou that wearst a gloomy form with lowering forehead like a northern storm cheeks pale and hollow as the face of woe and lips that with no gay vermilion glow where is that form which this false mirror told bloomed like the morn and should for ages hold but now a spectre in its room appears all scared with furrows and defaced with tears say come thou from the regions of despair to shake my senses with a meagre stare some straggling horror may thy phantom be but surely not the mimick shape of me ah yes  the shade its mourning visage rears pants when i sigh and answers to my tears now who shall bow before this withered shrine this mortal image that was late divine what victim now will praise these faded eyes once the gay basis for a thousand lies deceitful beauty  false as thou art gay and is it thus thy votries find their pay this the reward of many careful years of morning labors and of noonday fears the gloves anointed and the bathing hour and soft cosmeticks more prevailing power yet to thy worship still the fair ones run and hail thy temples with the rising sun still the brown damsels to thy altars pay sweetscented unguents and the dews of may sempronia smooths her wrinkled brows with care and isabella curls her grisled hair see poor augusta of her glass afraid who even trembles at the name of maid spreads the fine mechlin on her shaking head while her thin cheeks disown the mimick red soft silvia who no lovers breast alarms yet simpers out the evening of her charms and though her cheek can boast no rosy dye her gay brocades allure the gazing eye but hear my sisters  hear an ancient maid too long by folly and her arts betrayed from these light trifles turn your partial eyes it is sad dorinda prays you to be wise and thou celinda thou must shortly feel the sad effect of times revolving wheel thy spring is past thy summer sun declined see autumn next and winter stalks behind but let not reason with thy beauties fly nor place thy merit in a brilliant eye it is thine to charm us by sublimer ways and make thy temper like thy features please and thou sempronia trudge to morning prayer nor trim thy eyebrows with so nice a care dear nymph believe  it is true as youre alive those temples show the marks of fiftyfive let isabel unload her aching head of twisted papers and of binding lead let sage augusta now without a frown strip those gay ribbands from her aged crown change the laced slipper of delicious hue for a warm stocking and an easy shoe guard her swelled ancles from rheumatick pain and from her cheek expunge the guilty stain would smiling silvia lay that hoop aside twoud snow her prudence not betray her pride she like the rest had once her flagrant day but now she twinkles in a fainter ray those youthful airs set off their mistress now just as the patch adorns her autumn brow in vain her feet in sparkling laces glow since none regard her forehead nor her toe who would not burst with laughter or with spleen at prudo once a beauty as i ween but now her features wear a dusky hue the little loves have bid her eyes adieu yet she pursues the pleasures of her prime and vain desires not subdued by time thrusts in amongst the frolic and the gay but shuts her daughter from the beams of day the child she says is indolent and grave and tells the world ophelia cannot behave but while ophelia is forbid the room her mother hobbles in a rigadoon or to the sound of melting music dies and in their sockets rolls her blinking eyes or stuns the audience with her hideous squal while scorn and satire whisper through the hall hear this ye fair ones that survive your charms nor reach at folly with your aged arms thus pope has sung thus let dorinda sing  virtue brave boys  it is virtue makes a king why not a queen fair virtue is the same in the rough hero and the smiling dame dorindas soul her beauties shall pursue though late i see her and embrace her too come ye blessed graces that are sure to please the smile of friendship and the careless ease the breast of candor the relenting ear the hand of bounty and the heart sincere may these the twilight of my days attend and may that evening never want a friend to smooth my passage to the silent gloom and give a tear to grace the mournful tomb miras will imprimis  my departed shade i trust to heaven  my body to the silent dust my name to public censure i submit to be disposed of as the world thinks fit my vice and folly let oblivion close the world already is oerstockd with those my wit i give as misers give their store to those who think they had enough before bestow my patience to compose the lives of slighted virgins and neglected wives to modish lovers i resign my truth my cool reflection to unthinking youth and some goodnature give it is my desire to surly husbands as their needs require and first discharge my funeral  and then to the small poets i bequeath my pen let a small sprig true emblem of my rhyme of blasted laurel on my hearse recline let some grave wight that struggles for renown by chanting dirges through a market town with gentle step precede the solemn train a broken flute upon his arm shall lean six comic poets may the corse surround and all freeholders if they can be found then follow next the melancholy throng as shrewd instructors who themselves are wrong the virtuoso rich in sundryd weeds the politician whom no mortal heeds the silent lawyer chamberd all the day and the stern soldier that receives no pay but stay  the mourners should be first our care let the freed prentice lead the misers heir let the young relict wipe her mournful eye and widowed husbands over their garlic cry all this let my executors fulfill and rest assured that this is miras will who was when she these legacies designed in body healthy and composed in mind the friend in disgrace a dialogue lycander damon why so cold and serious wherefore that reluctant bow why so haughty and imperious say have you forgot me now tho arrayed in coarse attire you may read lycanders face for it is him my gentle squire justled in a homely case true no shining slaves surround me and my brows with sorrow bend fortune left me as she found me yet let damon own his friend  damon sir your servant and all that sir but indeed i am in haste surely pray keep on your hat sir i have somewhere seen your face  lycander am i grown so great a stranger yet it is hardly half a year since you vowed in every danger not your life was half so dear sure the court is mighty lulling not the streams of lethe more even the groom and dirty scullion know not those they loved before so on that fatal day you did the levee of his grace attend you of your memory was rid i of my fortune and my friend  damon it is business sir that fills my head believe me now i cannot stay i will order half a pint of red and if you will drink it sir you may  an ode on mercy in imitation of part of the    th psalm i it is mercy calls  awake my grateful string ye worlds of nature listen while i sing it is not his dire avenging rod i sing the mercies of a god hark ye warblers of the sky rivers glide serenely by or rather in the sacred chorus join till our united voices reach the seats divine ii where injured saints that used to mourn below find their glad breasts with joys eternal glow where thousand tongues incessant cry glory be to god on high dominion power praise and then mercy to the sons of men heaven hears delighted and the joyful sound swelled with celestial music spreads the regions round iii the lord though seated far beyond the sky yet sees the wretched with a pitying eye that power knows our secret fear the lonely sigh or silent tear he sees the widows streaming eye and hears the hungry orphans cry depending worlds his sacred bounty share all creatures find a part of their creators care iv his justice next employs the heavenly string and hymning angels tremble while they sing the lord is just and holy then o weep ye thoughtless sons of men for who can from his anger fly or shun the frown of god most high yet shall the sigh or penitential groan mount like the seraphs wing and reach the sacred throne v hear this ye pious but dejected minds whom errors darken or whom weakness binds lift from the dust your mournful eye and know the lord your help is nigh these sorrows from your breasts shall roll and comfort bless the humble soul let cheerful hope in every bosom spring for boundless mercy dwells with heavens immortal king vi come then ye worlds with mingled voices raise a song of mean but not ungrateful praise though the dull numbers rudely flow and our cold hearts but faintly glow our raptures own a less degree yet cherubs sing and so should we the almighty hears and gives us leave to call on him the judge the guide and sacred lord of all vii all you that bend beneath the stroke of time and you whose cheeks confess their healthy prime your maker and preserver praise for early and for length of days the pious and the grateful song shall lisp upon the infants tongue while heavenly mercy sooths the mourners care and bids the innocent rejoice the sinner not despair the beauties of the spring hall happy shades and hail thou cheerful plain where peace and pleasure unmolested reign where dewy buds their blushing bosoms show and the coll rivers murmur as they flow see yellow crowfoots deck the gaudy hills while the faint primrose loves the purling rills sagacious bees their labors now renew hum round the blossoms and extract their dew in their new livries the green woods appear and smiling nature decks the infant year see you proud elm that shines in borrowed charms while the curled woodbines deck her aged arms when the streaked east receives a lighter gray and larks prepare to meet the early day through the glad bowers the shrill anthems run while the groves glitter to the rising sun then phillis hastens to her darling cow whose shining tresses wanton on her brow while to her cheek enlivening colors fly and health and pleasure sparkle in her eye unspoild by riches nor with knowledge vain contented cymon whistles over the plain his flock dismisses from their nightly fold observes their health and sees their number told pleased with its being see the nimble fawn sports in the grove or wantons over the lawn while the pleased coursers frolic out the day and the dull ox affects unwieldy play then haste my friend to yonder sylvan bowers where peace and silence crown the blissful hours in those still groves no martial clamours sound no streaming purple stains the guiltless ground but fairer scenes our ravished eyes employ give a soft pleasure and a quiet joy grief flies from hence and wasting cares subside while winged with mirth the laughing minutes glide see my fair friend the painted shrubs are gay and round they head ambrosial odours play at sight of thee the swelling buds expand and opening roses seem to court thy hand hark the shrill linnet charms the distant plain and philomel replies with softer strain see those bright lilies shine with milky hue and those fair cowslips drop with balmy dew to thee my fair the cheerful linnet sings and philomela warbles over the springs for thee those lilies paint the fertile ground and those fair cowslips are with nectar crowned here let us rest to shun the scorching ray while curling zephyrs in the branches play in these calm shades no ghastly woe appears no cries of wretches stun our frighted ears here no glossd hate no sainted wolves are seen nor busy faces throng the peaceful green but fear and sorrow leave the careful breast and the glad soul sinks happily to rest damon and strephon a pastoral complaint damon say why these sighs that in thy bosom rise why from thy cheek the wonted crimson flies why on the ground are fixed thy streaming eyes  strephon still let this bosom swell with aching woe and from my eyes the streaming sorrows flow but oh the cause  see clouds are gathering round and zephyrs wait to catch the mournful sound the sickening trees all shed their blooming store why would thou hear it  sylvius is no more  damon is sylvius dead  then phillis rend thy hair and blot those features that were late so fair thou sun forbear to gild this fatal day nor you my lambkins dare to think of play  strephon no more alas  no more the tuneful swain shall with soft numbers charm the listening plain no more his flute shall greet the dawning spring nor to his hand rebound the trembling string  damon ah cruel death would none but sylvius do no meaner swain amongst the worthy few why did thou take and leave the baser tribe the flower of shepherds and the muses pride  strephon none knew like him the heavenly notes to swell and moral tales in pleasing numbers tell while sylvius sung none thought the day too long but all repined at the too hasty song  damon ye solemn winds that whistle through the glade or rudely bluster in the darker shade go bear our sorrows to the distant shore and tell them sylvius chears our plains no more  strephon vain are our sighs our tears as vainly flow and each sad bosom swells with fruitless woe as northern blasts destroy the autumn store so sylvius fell and shall return no more  damon enough of sorrow  now your garlands bring crop all the beauties of the early spring around his tomb these willing hands shall twine the choicest briers of sweet eglantine  strephon on his cold grave a laurel i bestow which late did in my fathers garden grow this wreath amyntas asked to shade her brow but to my sylvius i resign it now  damon the pensive swains shall strike their bosoms there and softeyd virgins drop a gentle tear may some good angel guard the sacred ground and flowers unfading shed their sweets around  a summers wish my guardian bear me on thy downy wing to some cool shade where infant flowers spring where on the trees sweet honysuckles blow and ruddy daisies paint the ground below where the shrill linnet charms the solemn shade and zephyrs pant along the cooler glade or shake the bullrush by a river side while the gay sunbeams sparkle on the tide o for some grot whose rustic sides declare ease and not splendour was the builders care where roses spread their unaffected charms and the curled vine extends her clasping arms where happy silence lulls the quiet soul and makes it calm as summer waters roll here let me learn to check each growing ill and bring to reason disobedient will to watch this incoherent breast and find what favorite passions rule the giddy mind here no reproaches grate the wounded ear we see delighted and transported hear while the glad warblers wanton round the trees and the still waters catch the dying breeze grief waits without and melancholy gloom come cheerful hope and fill the vacant room come every thought which virtue gave to please come smiling health with thy companion ease let these and all that virtues self attends bless the still hours of my gentle friends peace to my foes if any such there be and gracious heaven give repose to me an hymn to the morning i see the lovely morning rise see her glories paint the skies half over the reviving globe gaily spreads her saffron robe see the hills with flowers crowned and the valleys laughing round ii mira to aurora sings while the lark exulting springs high in air  and tunes her throat to a soft and merry note the goldfinch and the linnet join hail aurora nymph divine iii see cliones gilded car see it blazes from afar here the fair one bends her way balmy zephyrs round her play now she lights upon the vale fond to meet the western gale iv may this artless praise be thine soft clione half divine see her snowy hand she waves silent stand her waiting slaves and while they guard the silver reins she wanders lonely over the plains v see those cheeks of beauteous dye lovely as the dawning sky innocence that never beguiles lips that wear eternal smiles beauties to the rest unknown shine in her and her alone vi now the rivers smoother flow now the opening roses glow the woodbine twines her odorous charms round the oaks supporting arms lilies paint the dewy ground and ambrosia breathes around vii come ye gales that fan the spring zephyr with thy downy wing gently waft to miras breast health content and balmy rest far o far from hence remain sorrow care and sickly pain viii thus sung mira to her lyre till the idle numbers tire ah sappho sweeter sings i cry and the spiteful rocks reply responsive to the jarring strings sweeter  sappho sweeter sings colinetta it was when the fields had shed their golden grain and burning suns had seared the russet plain no more the rose nor hyacinth were seen nor yellow cowslip on the tufted green but the rude thistle reared its hoary crown and the ripe nettle showed an irksom brown in mournful plight the tarnishd groves appear and nature weeps for the declining year the sun too quickly reached the western sky and rising vapors hid his evening eye autumnal threads around the branches flew while the dry stubble drank the falling dew in this sick season at the close of day on lydias lap pale colinetta lay whose sallow cheeks had lost their rosy dye the sparkles languishd in her closing eye parched were those lips whence music used to flow nor more the flute her weary fingers know yet thrice to raise her feeble voice she tried thrice on her tongue the fainting numbers died at last revived on lydias neck she hung and like the swan expiring thus she sung farewell ye forests and delightful hills ye flowery meadows and ye crystal rills ye friendly groves to whom we used to run and beg a shelter from the burning sun those blasted shades all mournful now i see who droop their heads as though they wept for me the pensive linnet has forgot to sing the lark is silent till returning spring the spring shall all those wonted charms restore which colinetta must behold no more farewell ye fields my native fields adieu whose fertile lays my early labors knew where when an infant i was wont to stray and gather kingcups at the closing day how often has lydia told a mournful tale by the clear lake that shines in yonder vale when she had done i sung a cheerful lay while the glad goldfinch listened on the spray lured by my song each jolly swain drew near and rosy virgins thronged around to hear farewell ye swains ye rosy nymphs adieu though i unwilling leave the streams and you still may soft music bless your happy shore but colinetta you must hear no more o lydia thou if wayward tongues should blame my life and blot a harmless maidens name tell them if ever i found a straggling ewe although the owners name i hardly knew i fed it kindly with my fathers hay and gave it shelter at the closing day i never stole young pigeons from their dams nor from their pasture drove my neighbors lambs nor set my dog to hunt their flocks away that mine might graze upon the vacant lay when phillida by dancing won the prize or colin praised young marianas eyes when damon wedded ursla of the grange my cheek with envy never was seen to change wheneer i saw aminda cross the plain or walk the forest with her darling swain i never whispered to a standerby but hated scandal and abhorred a lie on sundays i as sister sue can tell was always ready for the sermonbell i honored both the teacher and the day nor used to giggle when he bid me pray then sure for me there is something good in store when colinetta shall be seen no more when i am gone i leave to sister sue my gown of jersey and my aprons blue my studded sheephook phillida may take likewise my hayfork and my hazel rake my hoarded apples and my winter pears be thine o lydia to reward thy cares these nuts that late were plucked from yonder tree and this strawbasket i bequeath to thee that basket did these dying fingers weave my boxen flute to corydon i leave so shall it charm the listening nymphs around for none like him can make it sweetly sound in our churchyard there grows a spreading yew whose dark green leaves distill a baneful dew be those sad branches over my grave reclined and let these words be graven on the rind  mark gentle reader  underneath this tree  there sleeps a maid old simons daughter she  thou too perhaps ere many weeks be over  like colinetta shall be seen no more here ends the maid  for now the seal of death closed her pale lips and stopped her rosy breath her sinking eye balls took their long adieu and with a sigh her harmless spirit flew the linnet and the goldfinch twas when the morn disclosed her rosy brow and newwakd heifers in the pastures low when little songsters in the gales respire to miras shades repaired the woodland choir perched on a bough that shone with morning dew the linnet thus addressed the feathered crew the linnet say my soft sisters say ye tuneful throng who now demands the tribute of a song who called us here who gave us leave to rove and warble in this late forbidden grove not long ago as mira mournful maid all pensive sat beneath the dusky shade just over her head i whistled on a bough but discontent sat frowning on her brow be gone thou too officious bird she cries and turned on me  on me her angry eyes go from my bowers lead the tuneful throng for artemisia hears no more your song these slighted shades can please the fair no more ye honysuckles shed your blooming store ye spreading trees now let your branches die and ye shrill warblers from those branches fly she said  the blossoms fell from every tree and we dejected from her arbours flee we fled all mournful to the distant plain then say who calls us to these groves again the goldfinch by miras order to this grove we came mira whose sonnets please the rural dame twas yesternight she waved her hand to me as i sat whistling on a chesnuttree come here she cried ye soft aerial choirs my ear no more your sprightly music tires now i can listen all the evening long for artemisia will attend your song she comes ye trees put on your best array and with fresh odours greet the rising day breathe sweet ye woodbines and with heads reclined court the soft whispers of the western wind ye friendly zephyrs dry the dewy ground shine bright thou sun and laugh ye meads around thus mira spoke  once more the blossoms glow and milder breezes over the mountains blow the smiling grove once more renews its charms and trees embracing twist their curling arms safely to shelter the expected fair from the hot sunbeams or the northern air here we attend and hop from spray to spray till the kind fates shall bring the wished for day when she of whom our mira daily sings whose name she whispers to the listening springs shall bless these shades  then ye melodious throng let each prepare em for the sprightly song let the shrill thrush begin her varied strain and the small wren in softer note complain the piercing linnet and the lark agree less loud the redbreast nightingale and me here ends the goldfinch and exulting springs her pleased companions clap their joyful wings the month of august sylvanus a courtier phillis a country maid sylvanus hail phillis brighter than a morning sky joy of my heart and darling of my eye see the kind year her grateful tribute yields and roundfacd plenty triumphs over the fields but to yon gardens let me lead thy charms where the curled vine extends her willing arms whose purple clusters lure the longing eye and the ripe cherries show their scarlet dye  phillis not all the sights your boasted gardens yield are half so lovely as my fathers field where large increase has blessed the fruitful plain and we with joy behold the swelling grain whose heavy ears toward the earth reclined wave nod and tremble to the whisking wind  sylvanus but see to emulate those cheeks of thine on yon fair tree the blushing nectrins shine beneath their leaves the ruddy peaches glow and the plump figs compose a gallant show with gaudy plumbs see yonder boughs recline and ruddy pears in you espalier twine there humble dwarfs in pleasing order stand whose golden product seems to court thy hand  phillis in vain you tempt me while our orchard bears longkeeping russets lovely cathrine pears pearmains and codlings wheaten plumbs enough and the black damsons load the bending bough no pruningknives our fertile branches teaze while yours must grow but as their masters please the grateful trees our mercy well repay and rain us bushels at the rising day  sylvanus fair are my gardens yet you slight them all then let us haste to you majestic hall where the glad roofs shall to thy voice resound thy voice more sweet than musicks melting sound now orions beam infests the sultry sky and scorching fevers through the welkin fly but art shall teach us to evade his ray and the forced fountains near the windows play there choice perfumes shall give a pleasing gale and orangeflowrs their odorous breath exhale while on the walls the wellwrought paintings glow and dazzling carpets deck the floors below o tell me thou whose careless beauties charm are these not fairer than a threshers barn  phillis believe me i can find no charms at all in your fine carpets and your painted hall it is true our parlour has an earthen floor the sides of plaster and of elm the door yet the rubbed chest and table sweetly shines and the spread mint along the window climbs an aged laurel keeps away the sun and two cool streams across the garden run  sylvanus can feasts or music win my lovely maid in both those pleasures be her taste obeyed the ransacked earth shall all its dainties send till with its load her plenteous table bend then to the roofs the swelling notes shall rise pierce the glad air and gain upon the skies while ease and rapture spreads itself around and distant hills roll back the charming sound  phillis not this will lure me for i would have you know this night to feast with corydon i go to night his reapers bring the gathered grain home to his barns and leave the naked plain then beef and coleworts beans and bacon too and the plumbpudding of delicious hue sweetspiced cake and applepies good store deck the brown board who can desire more his flute and tabor too amyntor brings and while he plays soft amaryllis sings then strive no more to win a simple maid from her loved cottage and her silent shade let phillis never ah never let her rove from her first virtue and her humble grove go seek some nymph that equals your degree and leave content and corydon for me  an epistle to a lady in vain dear madam yes in vain you strive alas to make your luckless mira thrive for tycho and copernicus agree no golden planet bent its rays on me it is twenty winters if it is no more to speak the truth it may be twenty four as many springs their pointed space have run since miras eyes first opened on the sun twas when the flocks on slabby hillocks lie and the cold fishes rule the watery sky but though these eyes the learned page explore and turn the ponderous volumes over and over i find no comfort from their systems flow but am dejected more as more i know hope shines a while but like a vapor flies the fate of all the curious and the wise for ah cold saturn triumphed on that day and frowning sol denied his golden ray you see i am learned and i shewt the more that none may wonder when they find me poor yet mira dreams as slumbring poets may and rolls in treasures till the breaking day while books and pictures in bright order rise and painted parlours swim before her eyes till the shrill clock impertinently rings and the soft visions move their shining wings then mira wakes  her pictures are no more and through her fingers slides the vanished ore convinced too soon her eye unwilling falls on the blue curtains and the dusty walls she wakes alas to business and to woes to sweep her kitchen and to mend her clothes but see pale sickness with her languid eyes at whose appearance all delusion flies the world recedes its vanities decline clorindas features seem as faint as mine gay robes no more the aching sight admires wit grates the ear and melting music tires its wonted pleasures with each sense decay books please no more and paintings fade away the sliding joys in misty vapors end yet let me still ah let me grasp a friend and when each joy when each loved object flies be you the last that leaves my closing eyes but how will this dismantld soul appear when stripped of all it lately held so dear forced from its prison of expiring clay afraid and shivering at the doubtful way yet did these eyes a dying parent see loosed from all cares except a thought for me without a tear resign her shortning breath and dauntless meet the lingering stroke of death then at the almightys sentence shall i mourn  of dust thou art to dust shall thou return or shall i wish to stretch the line of fate that the dull years may bear a longer date to share the follies of succeeding times with more vexations and with deeper crimes ah no  though heaven brings near the final day for such a life i will not dare not pray but let the tear for future mercy flow and fall resigned beneath the mighty blow nor i alone  for through the spacious ball with me will numbers of all ages fall and the same day that mira yields her breath thousands may enter through the gates of death the proclamation of apollo may artemisia hear my strain i quote the sages once again and should you ask the reason why  old authors fib and so may i proceed we then  old authors say apollo once made holiday and called the brethren of the quill to feast upon his tuneful hill from every nook and every wind they came for who would stay behind great was the crowd as may be guessed side grew to side and back to breast till the imperial prince of song who fearing something might be wrong sent forth a troop with caps and spears much like parnassian granadiers with surly eyes and sour faces to part the crowd and give em places now i have quite forgot i fear what names the people gave em there amongst the muses  but i trow men call em critics here below now when at last these sage reformers had drove the crew to heaps and corners they called them out by two and three and set em in a due degree that each his proper place should know on laurel benches all arow now you may think they all were happy as drunkard over his jug of nappy that every brow was smooth and clear but first i beg you would lend an ear the queen of love to grace the feast had sent a thousand pipes at least of smiling nectar neat and fine to whet the guests before they dine but when the cups had walked about some surly bards began to pout and wrinkle up their tiny faces and fret and fume about their places their giddy brains began to glow each thinking he was placed too low this vowed to make all creatures fear him and that could bear no creature near him one seemed to talk with mighty spirit of baffled worth and slighted merit another was in passion hurled and cursed the stupid senseless world till choler swelled in every vein and each no longer could contain but fairly went as i am a sinner to loggerheads before their dinner apollo was offended quite and all the muses in a fright then thundered out a proclamation  o ye  and all the rhiming nation  our king commands you to be still  and not disturb the sacred hill  if some refusing to be quiet  shall dare to aid this lawless riot  the statutes of parnassian tender  the stocks to every such offender  at this the riot seemed to cease  and with a murmur sunk in peace  when all was silent to a man  again the herald thus began  directed by your prince i bring  this message from the laureled king  who long has viewed with silent woe  your quarrels in the world below  how moral and satirick wits  and jingling pedants  rhiming cits  the gay the empty and the full  the soft the froward and the dull  wage endless wars with one another  and every blockhead hates his brother  but while you take a world of pains  in pelting at each others brains  while envy swells the little mind  you never consider that you find  to see you in the tempest hurled  diversion for the laughing world  and so you break all moral rules  to grow the mockingstock of fools  but now apollo begs you will  suspend your quarrels and be still  let wits shake hands with one another  and every dunce embrace his brother  from battered bards with never a shoe  to those who strut about with two  from poets doomed to whittle sticks  to rhimers in a coach and six  let none presume to fret and squabble  nor curse the dirty rhiming rabble  for see the beams of phoebus strike  the meadows hills and dales alike  so shines the muse on every creature  who tags his humble lines with meter he said  the children of the bays sent up a shout of mingled praise devoutly promising to pay obedience to the prince of day and now they see the tables spread with dainties and parnassian bread whose tiny loaves were nicely white and no french rolls were half so light the first bold course was brought along in dishes made of homers song next virgil on the table shines and then smooth ovids tender lines the gay desert exposed to view of modern authors not a few heroicks in the midst preside with elegy on either side here through transparent sonnets gleam whipsyllabubs and spiced cream there loaded epigrams appear and little mottos close the rear now dinner past their jolly souls cut capers to the nectar bowls till every bard had drank his fill and then they left the tuneful hill but ere they part the laureled king extracted from a wondrous spring a magic bath of mighty power whose virtues could in half an hour make proof against sharp satyrs pain the fibers of a dunces brain and give him confidence to push through the broad world without a blush apollo next upon the crew bestowed a greygoose quill or two with ink that into meter runs and charms against the fear of duns this done dismissed em as before with sirs your servant and no more the fall of lucia lucia was fair and bright as rising day sweet as arabia or the buds of may fresh as the winds that sweep the dewy hills or beds of roses washed by healthy rills whose soul was softer than a trembling dove nor knew a failing till she learned to love nor fraud nor scandal to her lips were known and thought each bosom guiltless as her own thus only armed with innocence and smiles she fell the victim of a tyrants wiles so lost from shepherd and its mourning dam through some lone desert roves a straggling lamb no danger fears but as he idly strays round every bush the heedless wanton plays till raging wolves the beauteous toy surround or foaming tigers rend the mossy ground then from his heart the guiltless purple flows a grateful morsel to his hungry foes thus wrapped in sorrows wretched lucia lies whose sighs still answer to her streaming eyes and damon still  ah faithless damon cries no more those lips like dewy roses glow her weary lids no peaceful slumbers know but left to strike her pensive breast in vain and curse the author of her lasting pain her soul of ease has took its long adieu hear this ye nymphs but hear and tremble too ye fair that lanch in pleasures tempting sea though fortune crowns you with a calmer day and joys soft gale salutes your nimble oar where lucias fame was shipwrecked on the shore yet let reflection mark your gliding days nor drink too deeply in the draught of praise for flattery is  so say the learned schools  the bane of virgins and the bait of fools how happy she whose purer spirit knows no thought less harmless than a saints repose whose guiltless charms pursue no greater end but to rejoice a parent or a friend whose care it is her passions to control and keep the steerage of a quiet soul then this shall grace her monumental page  in youth admired and beloved in age the crucifixion and resurrection an ode i what means the reeling earth o why these wonders in the dreadful sky the frighted sun withdraws its beams deep groans are heard and doleful screams o say what this convulsion means afflicted nature with a shriek replies a god expires a mighty savior dies ii the conscious stars their rays deny the moon receives a crimson dye the temple conscious of its fall now shakes its emblematick wall the ocean stagnates and the mountains bow and angels weep that never wept till now iii still tremble earth and still o sky thy everchearing lamps deny amazed still let the ocean stand but what remains for guilty man what groans what sorrows are for him decreed for man whose crimes have made perfection bleed iv but see o see the sun returns no more afflicted nature mourns the stars their vacant orbs regain and the moon sheds a silver beam while heavenly voices warble in the skies  behold your savior from his tomb arise v while saints attend the blessed morn he rose  the god in human form a form not made of vulgar clay which though it slept could not decay hail mortals hail transported seraphs cry redeemed and favored by the god most high vi in heaven let joys eternal flow and mercy in the worlds below the penitent shall peace obtain and not a tear shall fall in vain then join ye worlds in one glad chorus sing praise to messiah and the almighty king the third chapter of the wisdom of solomon from the first to the sixth verse thus sung the man for wisdom long renowned what mean these tears and mournful numbers round is death the cause ah then restrain your tears that stubborn monarch nor regard nor hears and the blessed shades for whom you vainly mourn to these dim regions would no more return wrapped in bright visions they no ills endure from sin from danger and from death secure it is past the parting struggles are no more they now are landed on the blissful shore where no pale fears nor sullen sorrows dwell but joys beyond what mortal tongues can tell where smiling hope for ever blooms around and growing pleasures that shall know no bound when thoughtless mortals by constraint attend on the last moments of their parting friend see the changed features wear a deathful hue the temples watered with a fainting dew the limbs that tremble with convulsive pain then stand aghast the ignorant and vain who shiver at the seeming stern decree but look no farther than their eyes can see the happy soul glides unobserved away to worlds of glory and eternal day the pains and sorrows which the virtuous know which long had bid the tears in secret flow shall not be lost nor buried in the ground but serve to brighten their immortal crown from that great being they shall find their pay who blessed the rising and the closing day when the pure spirit from its prison flies how joy the seraphs in their brighter skies around their guest the shining guards attend and heavenly harps with heavenly voices blend essay on happiness nothing dear madam nothing is more true than a short maxim much approved by you the lines are these we by experience know  within ourselves exists our bliss or woe though round our heads the goods of fortune roll dazzle they may but cannot cheer the soul content the fountain of eternal joy can riches purchase or can want destroy no born of heaven its birth it will maintain no slave to power nor the prize of gain say who can buy what never yet was sold no wealth can bribe her nor no bonds can hold sometimes she deigns to shine in lofty halls but found more frequent in a cottage walls her flight from thence too often is decreed then poverty is doubly cursed indeed content and bliss which differ but in name alike their natures and their end the same fast bound together in eternal chains this as the end  the other as the means will never divide but who enjoys the one must find the other ere the setting sun then where ah where do these fair sisters fly beneath the northern or the southern sky courts do they love the senate or the town or the still village and the healthful down say do they like humilos humble vest or the gay diamonds on belindas breast to none of these alas are they confined but the still bosom and the virtuous mind see glaro feated on his gilded car whose stubborn passions wage continual war who cannot call that ravaged heart his own where vice and virtue struggle for the throne see rage appearing in that hostile frown now fears distract him and now pleasures drown now turns to heaven with repentant tears but the next hour at his chaplain sneers this day a beast the next a reasoning man behold him right then envy if you can pale livia too  who pants beneath the weight of irksom jewels and afflicting state whose glass and pillow do her time divide at once oppressed with sickness and with pride the shapely stays her aching ribs confine and in her ears the sparkling pendents shine yet not a joy the tortured wretch can feel beyond ixion on his rolling wheel see restless cloe fond to be admired of joy impatient and as quickly tired when first her eyelids open on the day with eager haste she gobbles down her tea and to the park commands her rolling wheels yet sighs and wishes for the rural fields then back to cards and company she flies then for the charms of melting music dies at eve the play assembly or the ball she hates them singly yet would grasp em all with languid spirits and appald desires she to her closet and her book retires but solitude offends the sprightly fair reading she loathes and thought she cannot bear then to her chamber and her couch she flies where gilded chariots swim before her eyes in vain for sleep she folds her weary arms who would be cloe to enjoy her charms in yonder path sir thrifty we behold with beaver drooping and with garments old whose dirty linen shows no mark of pride nor sparkling laces deck his slender side whose heavy soul a saucy wit would swear was made exactly to his easy chair whose tasteless senses ask for nothing new whose meals are temperate and whose pleasures few  is this man blessed  he may be so  but when  why when his thousands rise to number ten  from ten to twenty and from twenty  hold  to one round million of bright sterling gold not there we stop for avarice will crave till it shall meet with its grand cure the grave lavinias blessed with all that man desires with eyes that charm and reason that inspires youth wealth and friends to gild her shining days the poor mans blessing and the rich mans praise with judgment sound and touched by no extreme speech gently flowing and a soul serene for ever pleasing and for ever true by all admired envied by a few then she is happy though beneath the sky hold not so hasty  let her husband die then who are happy twill be hard to say since undisturbed it seldom lasts a day for who in smiles beholds the morning sun may weed before his shortlived journeys done all pleasures satiate and all objects cloy we crave we grasp but loath the tasted joy nor wealth nor beauty friends nor fortunes smile can bless our moments though they may beguile nor wit with happiness can often grow a helpless friend if not an arrant foe where then o where shall happiness be found say shall we search the rolling world around on borrowed pinions travel through the sky or to the center drive our piercing eye cease busy fool is happiness thy care pierce thy own breast and thou will find it there drive thence the passions and the guilt expel and call fair virtue to the polished cell call soft content with all her smiling train peace for thy health and patience for thy pain then not till then o man thy heart shall know bliss so adored but seldom found below an essay on hope to you who never the willing verse refuse thus sings an humble but a grateful muse our theme is hope  but of a different kind the bane or blessing of the subject mind this dawning joy that to the soul was given as a short earnest of its future heaven to blame is not the purpose of my song but warn our sisters not to place it wrong shun trifling hope that bids your fancy roll the constant torment of a restless soul for two pale handmaids are for ever near sick disappointment and the secret tear it is this that makes the restless heart repine beneath the treasures of an indian mine much fortune gives  yet give us more they cry and some new prospect lures the dazzld eye like wanton babes they reach at something more and drop the gewgaws which they held before see the puffed tradesman strut before his door whose birth was humble and whose fortune poor yet you may see his roving thoughts depend on some bold venture or some wealthy friend till the lost bankrupt drops into the jaw of pale discredit and voracious law the gravefacd student better learned than fed with store of logic in his aching head sees pleasing pictures in his bosom drawn the deans soft cushion and the bishops lawn he dines with lords and takes the highest place and weds a countess cousin to his grace but soon his heart the lost delusion mourns and the proud prelate to a curate turns on some dark dome with thirty pounds perann he sips his liquors in a pewter cann young seizum fated to distract the law who talks of men and books he never saw now struts a counselor a sergeant now while the quick turns elate his scornful brow behold the judge in that commanding frown see then just then he strokd his ermind gown cecilia soft whose pleasing features shine bright in their wane and beauteous in decline still to her eyes recalls the scattered darts still hopes the conquest of a thousand hearts care stalks around vexation hovers nigh her friends bewail her and her children cry her wounded ears their hateful whinings tire whose fancy dwells upon a wealthy squire wrapped in soft visions on her couch she lies knights peers and garters swim before her eyes she rides in triumph through her husbands fields and hears the rattling of her chariot wheels till her charmed senses will contain no more then flies the vision through its ivory door see acamas with times sad burden bow guilt in his breast and wrinkles on his brow yet points out cloe for his charming bride and fain would tempt her to his frozen side at chapel where soft grace and virtue calls and pale vice trembles at the sacred walls where conscience warns the guilty wretch to pray and beg a blessing on his closing day the preacher reads but acamas the while grins at his cloe with a ghastly smile in their red orbs his waiting eye balls roll and charming cloe rushes on his soul but death will teach the silverbearded fool some other lesson in his gloomy school blank disappointment with its train attends in delias heart if delias heart depends on silias tongue so aptly hung with guile on cynthios friendship or on claras smile such courtly friends are like the showry bow tinged with false luster by reflection glow like its faint rays they hardly last an hour lost in a cloud or melted in a shower if trifling hope has any room to plead it is that where natures simple dictates lead so the wet hind who travels over the plain through the cold mire and afflicting rain though his low roofs with trickling showers run may hope next morn to see the cheerful sun or when keen hunger at the evening tide drives home the shepherd to his rustic bride his honest reason happily might not stray though he should dream of dumpling all the way see sad aemilia doomed by fatal vows to the harsh usage of a tyrant spouse to see his mistress in her woes rejoice her fortune wasted on his guilty choice to bear reproaches doubled on her ear yet only answer with a silent tear though patient wives must wait the fates good time yet she i think may hope without a crime but the grand hope that yields perpetual joy no trifles gave no trifles can destroy with mercy from the blessed abode it came its birth celestial and its end the same that bids our days in one smooth tenor roll its task to cheer and harmonize the soul on smarting want it pours a healing balm makes toil seem pleasant and affliction calm the moral vision tyrannick winters iron reign was done and the soft twins received the radiant sun the cheerful earth appeared in vernal pride and the clear waves did more serenely glide kind zephyrs played around the waving trees while opening roses caught the welcome breeze amid these scenes beneath a maple shade sat careless mira on her elbow laid while frolic fancy led the usual train of gaudy phantoms through her cheated brain till slumber seized upon her thoughtful breast and the still spirits sunk in balmy rest but while her eyes had bid the world farewell thus mira dreamed and thus her dreams we tell a seeming nymph like those of dians train came swiftly tripping over the flowery plain whose smiling face was as the morning fair a silver fillet tied her flaxen hair a golden zone her lovely bosom bound and her green robe hung careless on the ground sleep happy mortal with a smile she cries and turned on mira her farbeaming eyes still over thy own aerial mountains stray and in bright visions slumber out the day with gaudy scenes delude thy dazzld mind yet thou must wake and leave em all behind yes thou shall drop from that enchanted sky and wake to wisdom with a weeping eye while in a mist the shining prospects end then hear o mira thy immortal friend recall thy wandering thoughts and make em dwell in the small limits of their native cell to thine own heart confine thy chiefest care for mira know thy joys are planted there and as you manage and improve the soil twill punish your neglect or pay your toil here let your views and your ambition rest to reign the queen of a wellgoverned breast this point secured let heaven dispose the rest yet you may ask for what your state requires but not the gewgaws your caprice desires as thus o keep me from the reach of pain  from meagre famine and her mournful train  let not reproach assault my wounded ears  nor let my soul behold a friend in tears  secure from noise let my still moments run  and still be cheerful as the rising sun  or if a gloom my trembling heart invades  ah may it vanish with the nightly shades  through the crazed walls o may not reason fly  but if it does then let its mansion die  let not remorse of guilt the certain pay  blot my clea sun nor stain its parting ray  give me a lively but a guiltless mind  a body healthful and a soul resigned thus far o mira thou may ask of heaven how blessed the mortal to whom these are given if such thy lot let kings enjoy their crowns their pageant state and arbitrary frowns who though encircld by their shining slaves intriguing friends and well dissembled knaves are only wretched idols placed on high to bear the rage of a tempestuous sky and while the storms around his temples blow his fawning servants safely sneer below but now the sun brings on the noon of day rise mira rise and shun the scorching ray this said no more appeared the beauteous maid and mira waking found a lonely shade a prayer for the year      almighty wisdom at whose nod the stars shall cease to shine great natures father guide and god o let me call thee mine yet not for me and me alone thy mercies i implore no let that bliss to all be known that tremble and adore now fear that makes the sorrows flow even from the infants eyes oerwhelms in one promiscuous woe the ignorant and wise then hear o hear thy servants cry we beg thy saving hand to whom but heaven should we apply to raise a drooping land be thou the guard of helpless age the wretched orphans friend o smooth the face of hostile rage and spare its purple end restrain the hand of threatening pride assuage the cruel breast teach mercy to the victor side and patience to the rest and when the sword of conquest shall the trembling wretch arraign let justice guide the equal scale nor swerve the steady beam preserve the merciful and kind from violence and pain and let the meek and gentle mind rejoice and not complain nor let the barbarous steel invade the breast of hoary age nor give the unresisting babe a prey to purple rage amongst unnumberd worlds if i am worth my makers care then let me live and let me die unwounded by despair though want or peril pain or death assault this feeble clay let hope attend my latest breath and cheer the gloomy way preserve my parent and my friend from danger guilt or shame in peace their cheerful days extend to praise thy holy name forgive the errors of my youth if in my youth i fall or teach my age thy saving truth o hear me when i call thou mighty lord of all above and all beneath the sun thy servants humble suit approve if not thy will be done davids complaint ii samuel chap   mourn judab mourn beneath the silent sky and pierce the deserts with thy midnight cry see zion conscious of her failing powers heaves from her base and shakes the nodding bowers for their lost sires orphand babes complain and matrons strike their widowed breasts in vain from street to street the howling mourners fly fear on their brows and horror in their eye for why her peers are washed with purple gore her princes and her monarch is no more whom not the sacred diadem could shield but served to swell the horrors of the field but why amongst the heathen doomed to fall is this alas the end of mighty saul mourn mourn in silence lest philistia hear nor let our foes behold the streaming tear but o my friend  ah there my sorrows swell denied the blessing of a sad farewell whose ruddy cheeks confessed their early prime nor his smooth brows had felt the stroke of time he was my souls best pleasure while alive and is he blasted  then do i survive ah no it is death and aggravated woe o say my heart can thou sustain the blow ye nations mourn  if such a thing could be till nature too should learn to grieve like me ye smiling dames your gaudy robes resign and suit your garments and your griefs to mine go hide your slighted beauties from the sun while down your cheeks the streaming sorrows run still let your eye balls waste their humid store and still repeat  your monarch is no more be thou gilboa wrapped in endless night nor let thy hills behold the beams of light let the gay sun to thee his rays deny while rattling tempests over thy borders fly there judahs chief lay prostrate on the ground and there my friend received the mortal wound essay on friendship to artemisia  it is to her we sing for her once more we touch the sounding string it is not to cytheras reign nor cupids fires but sacred friendship that our muse inspires a theme that suits aemilias pleasing tongue so to the fair ones i devote my song the wise will seldom credit all they hear though saucy wits should tell them with a sneer that womens friendships like a certain fly are hatched in the morning and at evening die it is true our sex has been from early time a constant topic for satirick rhyme nor without reason  since we are often found or lost in passion or in pleasures drowned and the fierce winds that bid the ocean roll are less inconstant than a womans soul yet some there are who keep the moderate way can think an hour and be calm a day who never were known to start into a flame turn pale or tremble at a losing game run chloes shape or delias features down or change complexion at celindas gown but still serene compassionate and kind walk through lifes circuit with an equal mind of all companions i would choose to shun such whose blunt truths are like a bursting gun who in a breath count all your follies over and close their lectures with a mirthful roar but reason here will prove the safest guide extremes are dangerous placed on either side a friend too soft will hardly prove sincere the wits inconstant and the learned severe goodbreeding wit and learning all conspire to charm mankind and make the world admire yet in a friend but serve an under part the main ingredient is an honest heart by this can ursla all our souls subdue which wanting this not sylvias charms can do now let the muse who takes no courtiers fee point to her friend  and future ages see if this shall live till future ages be one line devoted to fidelias praise the loved companion of my early days whouse harmless thoughts are sprightly as her eyes by nature cheerful and by nature wise to have them last the social laws decree we choose our friendships in the same degree what mighty pleasure if we might presume to strut with freedom in arvidas room or share the table what supreme delight with some proud duchess or a scornful knight to sit with formal and assenting face for who shall dare to contradict her grace our freeborn nature hates to be confined where state and power check the speaking mind where heavy pomp and sullen form withholds that cheerful ease and sympathy of souls but yet the soul whatever its partner do must lift its head above the baser crew celestial friendship with its nicer rules frequents not dunghills nor the clubs of fools it asks to make this union soft and long a mind susceptible and judgment strong and then a taste but let that taste be given by mighty nature and the stamp of heaven possessed of these the justly tempered flame will glow incessant and be still the same not moved by sorrow sickness or by age to sullen coldness or distempered rage the soul unstained with envy or with pride pleased with itself and all the world beside unmoved can see gilt chariots whirling by or view the wretched with a melting eye discern a failing and forgive it too such artemisia we may find in you be seldom sour or your friends will fly from the hung forehead and the scornful eye nor like aurelia in the morning kind and soft as summer or the western wind but round ere night her giddy passions wheel she will clap the door against your parting heel an even temper will be sure to please with cool reflection and a cheerful ease but see armidas unfrequented rooms how vainly spread with carpets and perfumes all shun her like the cocatrices beams and for no other reason but her loathed extremes today more holy than a cloistered nun almost an atheist by tomorrows sun now speaks to heaven with a lifted eye now to her footman youre a rogue and lie o say from what strange principles begin these odd compounds of piety and sin a sickly fair may some excuses find what grieves the body will affect the mind but not the creatures who have learned to screen their own ill nature in the name of spleen what the black mists afflict the aching skull the spirits tremble and the heart be dull have you from thence a license to offend affront a patron or abuse a friend and ape the manners of a surly beast because it is cloudy and the winds in the east but all have failings not the best are free or in a greater or a less degree what follows then  forgive or unforgiven expect no passage at the gate of heaven kind nature gave in pity to mankind this social virtue to the human mind this gives our pleasures a more easy flow and helps to blunt the edge of smarting woe the souls relief with grief or cares oppressed is to disclose them to a faithful breast and then how lovely in a friend appear the mournful sigh and sympathizing tear when changing fortune with propitious ray gilds the brown evening or the smiling day the pleased companion shares the welcome tide and wrapped in joy the happy minutes glide grave authors differ  men of sense incline this way or that  opinions rarely join their thoughts will vary why because they are free but most in this and only this agree that our chief task is seldom to offend and lifes great blessing a wellchosen friend the mistaken lover strephon the sprightly and the gay loved celia fresh and fair as may none shone so brilliant in the mall the court the assembly and the ball none bare at wills the laureled prize but celia with the killing eyes twas at the drawing room or play but which our author cannot say as celia rolled her eyes around this youth received a mortal wound what should he do  commence the beau  for women often are caught by show the wounded strephon now behold arrayed in coat of green and gold of which we something might advance the sleeve was alamode de france we leave it here  and haste to tell how smartly round his temples fell the modish wig  yet we presume more graceful was the scarlet plume though some rude soldier doomed to bear the southern and the northern air and walk through every kind of weather might jeer at strephons scarlet feather and tell us such should never be wore unless you fought at marstonmoor his person finished now the care is to address and gain the fair he purchased all the songs of note and got the lovers cant by rote he bribed her footmen and her maids and with his nightly serenades her vaulted roofs and gardens rung for her he ogled danced and sung was often at her toilet seen with sonnets to the paphian queen then at her feet dejected lying praying weeping sighing dying  was celia kind it shall be known do you think our hearts are made of stone yes she was kind and to proceed the writings drawn and friends agreed grave hymens sacred knot was tied and celia fair commenced a bride but i shall pass the wedding day nor stay to paint the ladies gay nor splendour of the lighted hall the feast the fiddles nor the ball a lovely theme  it is true but then well leave it to a softer pen those transient joys will fade too soon well therefore skip the honymoon twas half a year  it might be more since celia brought her shining store five thousand pounds of sterling clear to bless the mansion of her dear some tell us wives their beauties lose when they have spoiled their bridal shoes some learned casuists make it clear a wife might please for half a year and others say her charms will hold as long as the suspended gold but that her bloom is soon decayed and withered when her fortunes paid now which of these was celias case though all are common to her race i shall not rack my brains about but leave the learned to pick it out this husband whimsical and gay loved music masquerades and play was one of those most happy elves that dote upon their charming selves who hating dull domestic walls fly here and there as fancy calls still in pursuit of something new nor even to their vices true mistaken strephon finds no more his celia charming as before her eyes  why they have lost their fire the roses on her cheek expire her shape  it is altered strangely sure her voice no mortal can endure then to the park where claudia rolls her eyes to fish for shallow souls or at the play he must appear for lovely lindamine is there no mortal bell so fair as she if wretched strephon was but free in the country he deludes the morn with ringwood and the hunting horn perhaps may with his dearest dine then hey for company and wine wine that would make an hermit gay with music intermixed and play for tables and for cards they call the dicebox rattles in the hall now all are happy nor give over till watches point to number four then see the face of dawning day here lucy where is your lady pray  she is gone to rest  there let her be  go make the crimson bed for me all this a while in silence passed the ladys patience failed at last one morning so the fates decree alone was sitting he and she not yet arrived the roaring band nor rake nor coxcomb was at hand this blessed occasion pleased the fair and with a mild and cheerful air she thus began my strephon say  why this dejected face to day  why art thou always cross and dull  unless the noisy rooms are full  black discontent and anger lies  close lurking in thy sullen eyes  those eyes that i with sorrow see  disgusted when they roll on me here ceased the greatly injured bride and strephon with a blush replied  why madam i must own that you  have merit give the del his due  and was the pleasure of my life  before you wore the name of wife  but mam the reason was i find  that while a lover i was blind  and now the fault is not in me  it is only this  that i can see i thought you once a goddess trim  the graces dwelt on every limb  but madam if you ever was such  methinks youre altered very much  as first i beg your pardon though  you hold your head extremely low  and though your shape is not awry  your shoulders stand prodigious high  your curling hair i durst have swore  was blacker than the sable moor  but now i find it is only brown  a color common through the town  it is true youre mighty fair  but now  i spy a freckle on your brow  your lips i own are red and thin  but there is a pimple on your chin  besides your eyes are gray  alack  till now i always thought em black  thus madam i the truth have told  it is true i thank you for your gold  but find in searching of my breast  that i could part with all the rest he ceased  and both were mute a while till celia answered with a smile  who would have thought my dear says she  that love was blind to this degree  but in my turn i will own it too  that i am as much deceived as you  from hence let our example show  the gay coquette and sprightly beau  that love like theirs will never hold  not though it is cemented with gold  let all the youths to you repair  for counsel  and to me the fair  twill help to make our strephons wise  and stop the growth of tender lies  and more than platos moral page  instruct the celias of the age  but now my dearest as you see  in mutual hatred we agree  methinks it is better we retreat  each party to a distant seat  and though we value each the other  just as one rush regards another  yet let us often send to hear  if health attend the absent dear  and though each other we would shun  as debtors do a hateful dun  nor mind the crossing of a street  yet let us be civil when we meet  and live in short like courtly friends  they part  and thus the story ends the way of the world some herbs there are whose deadly juices fill the heart with venom and directly kill some operate more slowly but as sure the dart less sudden but admits no cure yet there is a drug nor plain nor mountain yields not libyas deserts nor britannias fields destructive more than all the baneful kind it is flattery called  the poison of the mind this soft sir wealthy feeds on all the day this delia swallows with her soft bohea to this we owe sublimos scornful eye and thalias cheeks that blush with borrowed dye sublimo once could like his neighbors walk bow to his friends or with his tenants talk nor had been seized with this majestic fit if subtle florio had not praised his wit gray thalia too would now her arts give over and rest those eye balls that must slay no more nor would that face engross her mornings care did not philander tell her she is fair alcidas tells you with an artful smile that womens eyes were given them to beguile his way is cunning and mischievous too he will praise in others what he finds in you you hear delighted nor perceive the foe but drink in flattery ere you think it is so and when he is run the gay description through the smart conclusion is applied to you but turn your back  alcidas with a grin will vow youre ugly as a sooterkin how often you hear from a designing knave sir i am your servant madam i am your slave yet if youre blessed with penetrating eyes you will in his features read the villain lies see soft courtine whose hat with silver bound is so obsequious that twill kiss the ground whose actions point to some unworthy end and never was patron counselor or friend whose narrow views are to himself confined yet he is the humble slave of all mankind these fawning rogues are irksom creatures  true but then a clown is full as odious too the face unpracticed in the arts of guile need not be stretechd with an eternal smile nor yet affect the cynicks awful scowl screwed like the visage of minervas owl for some reject and hold it as a rule the crabfaced student for the tender fool the phrase unstudied flows with graceful ease and careless gesture never fails to please the heart instructs the features and the tongue let that be right and these will never be wrong ask cynthios judgment in some nice affair he will praise your conduct with a charming air extol your sense and prudence to the skies  and sure such merits were designed to rise his candid eyes can hidden beauties see even faults are useful or they cease to be and each nomeaning cynthio can explore but asks his friendship and he speaks no more but the worst flatterer that wears a tongue is him whose power aggravates the wrong to whose grand levee crowds of suppliants run and bow like persians to the rising sun where starved dependents linger out their days yet proud to share his snuff box and his praise grow stiff with standing and with staring thin to watch the dimple on their patrons chin who with a nod can make the wretch believe and smiles on hunger which he will never relieve surrounded thick with business and with gold yet dressed in smiles virginius you behold the expecting crowd around his table stand you ask a favor and he grasps your hand another comes with an obsequious air he winks and whispers  leave it to my care then to the next  oh i will remember you  sir trust my honor you shall find me true then bows a third  good sir your pardon  why  i saw you not  forgive my careless eye  next tuesday seennight let me see you pray  perhaps you will find it hundreds in your way the meagre wight departs with happier soul romantic visions in his bosom roll he fasts in rapture as of late in sorrow for who can eat that is to be rich tomorrow but tuesday see the joyful day is come now to his patron  but he is not at home  alas but then tomorrow morn will do  and i will be early  gentlemen adieu next day at six before the gate appears the wretch divided by his hopes and fears the haughty servants meet him with a frown i would see his honor  but he is not come down  your servant sir  i will stay then in the hall  but he is sick and cannot be spoke withal  i will wait with patience till another day  and for his honor and his health shall pray at last the knight his fate had ordered so was seized and boarded by the lurking foe and wisely thinking twas in vain to fly smoothed up his face and with a leering eye began oh mr whatdyecall is it you  i am glad to see you yet i am sorry too  sure some ill stars presided over your fate  i could have served you but youre come too late yet sure there is whose honest soul was made too grand a being for the soothing trade whose wit can neither flatter nor offend a gay companion yet a constant friend willing to please where honesty may win averse to slander though it was no sin with native manners as with sense endud not soft as cynthio nor as damon rude not basely humble yet a foe to pride whose tongue never promised what his heart denied whose satire charms nor mirth offends the ear though wife not froward just but not severe not swayed by interest nor in passion hurled but walks a calm spectator through the world whose breast where no unmanly vapors grow can feel compassion for anothers woe where courage mercy justice candor lie that shine celestial in the speaking eye this man is great whatever be his degree o bless him heaven if such a one there be may lifes best comforts on his days attend blessed in himself and happy in his friend far from his gate fly poverty and woe let not a sigh his quiet mansion know but the fair dome each roving eye allure with peace and plenty smiling at the door let him soft days and happy evnings find and live still blessed and blessing all mankind the fox and the hen a fable twas on a fair and healthy plain there lived a poor but honest swain had to his lot a little ground defended by a quickset mound twas there he milkd his brindled kine and there he fed his harmless swine his pigeons fluttered to and fro and baskd his poultry in a row much we might say of each of these as how his pigs in consort wheeze how the sweet hay his heifers chew and how the pigeons softly coo but we shall wave this motley strain and keep to one that is short and plain nor paint the dunghills feathered king for of the hen we mean to sing a hen there was a strange one too could sing believe me it is true or rather as you may presume would prate and cackle in a tune this quickly spread the pullets fame and birds and beasts together came all mixed in one promiscuous throng to visit partlet and her song it chanced there came amongst the crew of witty foxes not a few but one more smart than all the rest his serious neighbor thus addressed  what think you of this partlet here  it is true her voice is pretty clear  yet without pausing i can tell  in what much more she would excel  methinks she would eat exceeding well this heard the listening hen as she sat perched upon a mapletree the shrewd proposal galled her pride and thus to reynard she replied  sir youre extremely right i vow  but how will you come at me now  you dare not mount this lofty tree  so there i am pretty safe you see  from long ago or record lies  you foxes have been counted wise  but sure this story dont agree  with your device of eating me  for you dame fortune still intends  some coarser food than singing hens  besides ever you can reach so high  remember you must learn to fly  i own it is but a scurvy way  you have as yet to seize your prey  by sculking from the beams of light  and robbing henroosts in the night  yet you must keep this vulgar trade  of thieving till your wings are made  had i the keeping of you though  i would make your subtle worship know  we chickens are your betters due  not fatted up for such as you  shut up in cub with rusty chain  i would make you lick your lips in vain  and take a special care be sure  no pullet should come near your door  but try if you could feed or no  upon a kite or carrion crow here ceased the hen the baffled beast marched off without his promised feast the headache to aurelia aurelia when your zeal makes known each womans failing but your own how charming silvias teeth decay and celias hair is turning gray yet celia gay has sparkling eyes but to your comfort is not wise methinks you take a world of pains to tell us celia has no brains now you wise folk who make such a pother about the wit of one another with pleasure would your brains resign did all your noddles ach like mine not cuckolds half my anguish know when budding horns begin to grow nor battered skull of wrestling dick who late was drubbd at single stick not wretches that in fevers fry not sappho when her caps awry ever felt such torturing pangs as i nor forehead of sir jeffry strife when smiling cynthio kissed his wife not lovesick marcias languid eyes who for her simpring corin dies so sleepy look or dimly shine as these dejected eyes of mine nor claudias brow such wrinkles made at sight of cynthias new brocade just so aurelia you complain of vapors rheums and gouty pain yet i am patient so should you for cramps and headachs are our due we suffer justly for our crimes for scandal you and i for rhymes yet we as hardened wretches do still the enchanting vice pursue our reformation never begin but fondly hug the darling sin yet there is a mighty difference too between the fate of me and you though you with tottering age shall bow and wrinkles scar your lovely brow your busy tongue may still proclaim the faults of every sinful dame you still may prattle nor give over when wretched i must sin no more the sprightly nine must leave me then this trembling hand resign its pen no matron ever sweetly sung apollo only courts the young then who would not  aurelia pray enjoy his favors while they may nor cramps nor headachs shall prevail i will still write on and you shall rail stephon to celia a modern loveletter madam i hope you will think it is true i deeply am in love with you when i assure you the other day as i was musing on my way at thought of you i tumbled down directly in a deadly swoon and though it is true i am something better yet i can hardly spell my letter and as the latter you may view i hope you will think the former true you need not wonder at my flame for you are not a mortal dame i saw you dropping from the skies and let dull idiots swear your eyes with love their glowing breast inspire i tell you they are flames of fire that scortch my forehead to a cinder and burn my very heart to tinder your breast so mighty cold i trow is made of nothing else but snow your hands no wonder they have charms are made of ivory like your arms your cheeks that look as if they bled are nothing else but roses red your lips are coral very bright your teeth  though numbers out of spite may say they are bones  yet twill appear they are rows of pearl exceeding dear now madam as the chat goes round i hear you have ten thousand pound but that i as a trifle hold give me your person them your gold yet for your own sake it is secured i hope  your houses too ensurd i would have you take a special care and of false mortgages beware you have wealth enough it is true but yet you want a friend to manage it now such a friend you soon might have by fixing on your humble slave not that i mind a stately house or value money of a louse but your five hundred pounds a year i would secure it for my dear then smile upon your slave that lies half murdered by your radiant eyes or else this very moment dies  strephon  to artemisia dr kings invitation to bellvill imitated if artemisias soul can dwell four hours in a tiny cell to give that space of bliss to me i wait my happiness at three our tommy in a jug shall bring clear nectar from the bubbling spring the cups shall on the table stand the sugar and the spoons at hand a skilful hand shall likewise spread soft butter on the yielding bread and as you eat but mighty little and seem an arrant foe to vittle you will cry perhaps one bit may do but i am resolved it shall be two with you and your amanda blessed care flies away from miras breast over stubborn flax no more i grieve but stick the needle on my sleeve for let them work on holiday who will not be idle when they may if i must fret and labor too like caricus and lumberloo as well i might like simoneer be plagued with sixty pounds a year what nymph that is eloquent and gay but owes it chiefly to her tea with satire that supplies our tongues and greatly helps the failing lungs by that assisted we can spy a fault with microscopick eye dissect a prude with wondrous art and read the care of delias heart now to the company we fall it is me and mira that is all more would you have  dear madam then count me and mira over again the apparition from that inevitable shore wheer styxs tremendous waters roar thus winged with vengeance lo i fly and skim beneath the gloomy sky to you o false o faithless fair yet tremble do  and wildly stare to you this angry visits paid to you once loved but faithless maid perhaps too thin for mortal eyes you know me not in this disguise i never was numbered with your foes but what i am now shall not disclose my name esteemed by one or two was mira  while i lived like you till your unkindness cut the twine of life before its stated time and should you ask to know the end of her that once you called a friend whether of pleurisies she died or in a parching fever dried or pale consumption sure and slow or apoplexys sudden blow twas none of these  no common dart that struck my unresisting heart the dire distemper you shall hear then listen with attentive ear did you not ah did you not say that you would come the next fair day to miras dome  rejoiced to see at once the butterflies and me but now alas too late i find the promised joys of human kind inconstant as the flitting wind you came not  that i need not tell but then o then your mira fell that fatal day expecting you i swept my house and dined by two took off the nightcap from my brow o pride but i repent it now ambitious her i loved to please and ah too straightly laced my stays then silent sat twixt hopes and fears with beating heart and listening ears till the shrill clock had sounded four then wretched mira was no more her cheeks put on a deathlike hue her eye balls bid this world adieu and though untouched by cupids dart she perished with a broken heart but i have done  farewell for i from this corporeal world must fly so the relentless fates decree once more farewell  remember me the inspired quill occasioned by a present of crowpens to you dear madam i complain where wretches never sigh in vain but always find if not relief at least compassion for their grief but i should make my woes appear before i claim a gentle tear my tale is something odd it is true yet sure twill credit find with you the sage pythagoras you know asserted many years ago that when or man or woman dies the soul to some new mansion flies if so belinda now so fair may range the woods a sullen bear likewise the courtly bellamour the ladys darling to be sure though he in sparkling laces glow the pattern of a perfect beau when he puts off the human shape may strut a monkey or an ape for me who now to you indite whose talent chiefly is to write what form it was i do not know i wore two thousand years ago the being that i first remember was on a morning of december but not december last i ween no  many years have past between i found myself a wealthy squire and seated by a parlourfire a fine estate of mellow ground in cash full thirty thousand pound two hundred oxen in a stall and ten lean servants at my call an ancient house well built but low behind of oaks an ample row a court before  without much state and three gaunt mastiffs at the gate all these had i  a happy knave as you may think  but with your leave a wretched usurer was i with hagard jaws and eager eye that starved amidst unwieldy store and lost my life in search of more this pluto saw and bid me go into the carcass of a beau to taste of pleasure and of pains with slender purse and shallow brains my wig behind was smartly tied my silver box with snuff supplied on books i seldom loved to pore but sung and danced and aptly swore wherever i came the ladies smiled this called me pug  and the other child to please and to address the fair was all my business and my care but now my gold began to fly and sure destruction hovered nigh at last to limbo was i led from whence the struggling spirit fled almerias lapdog next i grew and wore a coat of glossy hue caressed and courted every day at evening by her side i lay her smiles were always bent on me the happiest days that ever i see but oh as by a riverside i walked along with shortlived pride a cruel footboy threw me in and laughed as though it was no sin once more to gain a human face i stepped into a lawyers case this station pleased me wondrous well and in a trice i learned to spell could read old coke with prying eyes explain distinguish and advise talk latin to a good degree as admittendo custode eject extendi and my fee it is true i scorned to rob or kill but not to cheat or forge a will in jointures i could split a hair and make it turn against the heir i spared no widow for her tears no orphan for his tender years my maxim was  get money man get money where and how you can thus through the stage of life i run for ah my race was quickly done and still preserved my ears and nose in spite of venial sins like those my next disguise too well you know degraded to a simple crow both cold and hunger doomed to bear and hover in the limpid air till on a day a spiteful hind with dreadful arms and bloody mind vowed quick destruction to my head and in a moment shot me dead then set my ghastly corse on high to fright my fellows from his rye i now grew out of plutos favor who grumbld at my late behavior and vowed when thus his sentence ran i should no more appear as man but that he would confine me still within the compass of a quill my fate is hard as you may guess yet i could bear it neertheless would you or fortune be so kind to comfort an afflicted mind and take me from the hated cell where yesterday you bid me dwell for oh i guess  nay more i know it that my new mistress is a poet then how shall i who still inherit a tincture of the lawyers spirit how shall i bear from time to time to scrawl unprofitable rhyme to live for years and never behold the presence of enchanting gold yet scribble on  besides alack i fear she will quickly break my back then since my pedigree you know dear madam ah some pity show and recommend me to a place for sure there is mercy in your face to some attorney let me go for there my talents suit you know heroicks i shall write but ill but i am a doctor at a bill at flights of fancy very dull but i can form receipts at full the favor that i ask of you have pity when the wretched sue is your good word or what is better a recommandatory letter and if i am happy in your grace i think i need not doubt a place the penitent occasioned by the authors being asked if she would take ten pounds for her poems when parthenissa talked today of profits and of miras lay and listening mira heard the sound of number ten with added pound the saucy minx betrayed her pride and turned her scornful head aside you doubtless madam wondered why and hardly could believe twas i but all have faults and twoud be vain to boast a heart that is free from stain this maxim mira proved was true no golden apples lay in view across her path  and yet she fell the cause  have patience and well tell you saw not  no to my surprise it escaped your penetrating eyes the wicked knot  twas new today the knot  what color was it pray so gay twoud make a hermit vain then wonder not at miras brain but now disrobed  with dirty shoes and apron ragged as the muse in nightcap tight and wrapping gown no more is seen the haughty frown the fatal topknot laid aside with its destructive daughter pride the vain chimeras all are flown and reason reassumes her throne now could you find an honest dealer as an attorney or a tailor who wants a muse that is not too dear send him directly you know where we for a trifle shall not part nor from an easy bargain start and that his purchase may not be hard i will add of packthread half a yard to satisfy the greedy lout and bind the papers round about song to cloe playing on her spinet when cloe strikes the trembling strings applauding cupids round her fly exulting clap their little wings baskd in the sunshine of her eye the graces too as others do in raptures stand to hear time stays his flagging wings and adds one hour to the rolling year keep off ye beaus for who but knows that cloes eyes can wound if those you miss  yet pray avoid the danger of enchanting sound amphion led the ravished stones they say  and as he would rise or fall bricks pebbles slats and marrowbones would form a steeple or a wall but this you know is long ago we fancy it is a whim o had they charming cloe heard they would surely not have stirred for him the thracian bard whose fate was hard and proserpine severe had brought eurydice back  alas but cloe was not there to grammaticus sir mira would with tears atone for all the mischief she has done sincerely mourns believe it true the sending of her rhymes to you the wound my verses gave your ear was undesignd it will appear nor in the least the fault of me as by this sorrow you may see and could i in our meadows find among the vegetable kind a healing simple that would cure those smarting pangs which you endure whose juice the matrons well esteem for cuts and bruises that are green i would send it with an heart most willing though it should cost me half a shilling yet i can serve you but in will for i have consulted doctor pill who tells me that a case like yours will not admit of common cures for that incisions made by rhymes are worse than ulcers fifty times he gives a reason that is clear because they always strike the ear and give unutterable pain to the small fibers of the brain yet as the doctor is my friend his worship ordered me to send this grand receipt which he has known to serve in cases like your own it is true the drug is something rare and yet i would not quite despair but hope the medicine may be found within the space of british ground this balsam then i would have you seek no matter for its name in greek but sure it is called or i am wrong goodnature in the english tongue the doctor swears by all his skill if this dont ease you nothing will to either ear be this applied the better if it is quickly tried then fill the hollow spaces full with aquavitoe dropped on wool and take a special care be sure no poets come about your door for you might keep the bench of law or hear the squeaking of a saw more safely by a hundred times than half a page of modern rhymes but when you gather strength a little can walk abroad and eat your vittle as you are mighty fond of verse let some with gentle voice rehearse how corn grows now where troy town stood or else the children in the wood these gentle numbers will compose your spirits and your eyelids close those slumbers will complete the cure now sir your servant and  no more the tenpenny nail twas past the date of savry noon and downwards rolled the radiant sun when all except us rhyming sinners had roasted boiled and eat their dinners in my great chair i sat to pout and beat my weary brains about about what did not much avail amandas riddle of the nail the question was this where was the first nail struck  when somnus took me by surprise and put his finger in my eyes twas he for poets never nod without the influence of a god i dreamed of what  why you shall hear good people all i pray draw near methought there lay before my eyes a nail of more than common size twas one that nails our garden door and often my petticoat has tore when sudden it is true my friend it reared itself and stood an end and though no mouth i could descry it talked as fast as you or i and thus began  as i am told  you poets seldom deal in gold  that is not the price of empty songs  but to sir thrifty gripe belongs  bright silver is sir warys claim  and copper for the laboring dame  if so that each may have their due  we rusty nails belong to you  i therefore ask as my desert  i hope you bear a grateful heart  you write my life  and be it shown  what strange adventures i have known  i must confess i was not made  so early quite as adams spade  yet many ages i have known  and double with my labors grown  i occupyd the first of all  a worthy post at gloomyhall  where i with seven hundred more  were hammered in the spacious door  and there had happily stuck till now  had not old simon broke his plough  who seeing none but us at hand  and knowing us a trusty band  me with the pincers sore oppressed  and drew me headlong from the rest  my lazy life alas was done  and now i toiled from sun to sun  none pity me and none relieve  till fortune gave me a reprieve  my master broke his plough again  and i from thence was dragged amain  to celias chamber next i came  and bore a glass with curious frame  to whom the lovely nymphs repair  there delia spread her shining hair  all smiling there was claudia seen  and thalia tied her ribbands green  at last my mistress drew too nigh  and some ill genius standing by  drove me directly in her eye  then i was banished from her train  hurled on a dunghill with disdain  but idle long i did not lie  for old sir gripus walking by  who held it was a crying sin  to trample over and slight a pin  and that they well deserve a jail  who proudly scorn a rusty nail  carried me home and made secure  with me  a stately oaken door  through the strong boards he made me go  to keep his daughter from a beau  but she what is it but love can do  with aquafortis eat me through  a cripple now and useless quite  i am banished from the cheerful light  and all folk despise me that behold  at last i to a smith was sold  who had compassion on my pain  and brought me to myself again  to jeffry bouze i next belong  where sparkling ale was clear and strong  one vault more precious than the rest  was stowed with hogsheads of the best  and having lately lost the key  he fastned up the door with me  i stood a faithful centry there  to guard the choice inspiring beer  from thirsty bacchanalian rage  till his son guzzle was of age  at length the youth an entrance found  though stoutly i maintained my ground  yet all my strength would not avail  for how could one poor single nail  maintain a dangerous post you know  against whole legions of the foe  who well considring lifes a bubble  and drinking is the cure of trouble  and more  that he again could brew  before the date of twenty two  while ever that time the present ale  might happen to be flat or stale  he came himself with fifty more  and wisely drank it out before  it would be tedious now to tell  what to your humble slave befell  amongst a rude mechanic band  till fortune gave me to your hand  now if a proper post i knew  i would gladly be of use to you  but you resolve to hide no pelf  and choose to walk abroad yourself  but mira these are dangerous times  i would have you fasten up your rhymes  and it is the best thing you can do  to nail up pens and paper too  do this and get thee gone to spinning  or wisely dearn your fathers linen this said  a cart with rumbling sound came by and shook the trembling ground the vision vanished from her sight and mira wakened in a fright the genius in disguise as i fidelia and my sire sat musing over a smoky fire we heard a knocking at the door rise something is the matter sure the little turret seemed to quake the shelves the chairs and tables shake fidelia cries o what is the matter and miras teeth began to chatter the frighted door as what could choose flew open pray believe the muse a hollow voice for entrance calls and soon  although the dirty walls were stained with ignorance and sin yet miras genius ventured in not in a cherubs form enshrined nor in the shape of human kind but locks and hinges round him glow in figure like a neat buroe like brambles in a thorny gap stood miras hair beneath her cap her frighted senses gone astray she bent her knees in act to pray but the presuming priest drew near as void of piety as fear and by its side undaunted stood and would persuade us it was wood with reverence then we did presume to place him in the little room the priest excluded with the rest the stranger mira thus addressed though shaking with surprise and fear  o say what power sent thee here  not fortune for i never could see  as yet her favors bent on me  nor chance although we often find  she governs most of human kind  or can against the maids desire  throw madams caudle in the fire  can light a candle or can miss  she never brought a thing like this this said pale mira gazing stood and thus replied the seeming wood  can thou behold me and not find  the picture of the givers mind  behold the lock and shining key  that never its mistress shall betray  not blemished with a spot of rust  and always faithful to its trust  the rest may be to you consigned  for in this narrow space you will find  no emblem large enough to fit  her bounty judgment and her wit  but mira since i have begun  the thread of my discourse shall run  explaining how i am to you  a monitor and table too  my hollow spaces you may fill  with all your verses good and ill  one small one for your wit may do  but then your faults will take up two  and from the rest i pray exclude  one sacred place for gratitude  and what our patron yours and mine  shall to my trusty care consign  for those loved strangers i will secure  the closet with its tiny door  and now i have prattld long my dear  yet you are listening still to hear  expecting that i should supply  at once advice and prophesy  but that is not right for me nor you  to dive so deeply  though it is true  without divining i can see  you will never deserve the gift of me  more would you know  why may be then  within these mornings nine or ten  propitious jet may tsudge before  and lead his mistress to your door  and when the sun whose distant wheels  but faintly warm the icy fields  shall gild your cot with brighter ray  i hope to see her every day  but turn away thy steadfast eyes  that stare so ghastly with surprise  go seek your pillow and be still  and dream of me or what you will  this said which mira hoped was true  the lid shut up and cries adieu then gave a crack and spoke no more and all was silent as before celadon to mira to thee o mira i these lines commend these from thy gentle and immortal friend though not to thee my airy form appears yet i have been often a witness to thy tears at night when lonely by the tapers flame in a still whisper thou have breathed my name and in thy eyes beheld the rising woe ah simple sorrows when for me they flow think not o mira not in me to find a friend like vido or like rosalind or like courtine to cheat thy dazzla eye and sooth thy weakness with a wellbred lie these are as thou will by the sequel find below a spirit of the blissful kind and was thy form as wanton helen gay or did thy eyes outshine the lamp of day these please not me  bright eyes in vain may roll i read no charms but in the purer soul by thy changed features i too often find the wild ideas of thy restless mind all serious now abstracted from the crew no prudent stoic more serene than you till in your brain some gaudy pictures spring all gay and careless then you laugh and sing these vanish like a painted cloud  and now pale discontent oershades thy mournful brow you form dark visions and at phantoms start these woes proceed from an illgovernd heart from a too thoughtless or too roving mind for these are strangers to a soul resigned can thou presume thy little bark may steer from griefs black eddy and the gulphs of fear or can thou hope to escape the gloomy land where disappointments crowd the rocky strand not so  nor let thy vanity pretend to hope for more than ever blessed thy friend in life i shone conspicuous over the rest while the pure beams malignant eyes oppressed sound judgment learning wisdom too was mine and piercing wit superior far to thine yet gaping rage stood ready to devour and dullness rained on me a leaden shower now stung with scoffs and now with flattery tired defamed applauded envied and admired this fate was mine  to hope can thou presume a milder passage and more easy doom deluded girl let not a thought so vain elate thy spirits nor ascend thy brain but hear o mira nor too late be wise from painted trifles turn thy longing eyes ask not for what will make thy prayer offend but ask content a parent and a friend ask bread and peace it is all that nature craves this kings acknowledge when they find their graves say why thy features lose their healthful dye and the tears tremble in the languid eye the mighty conflict i with pity see when thy rude passions struggle to be free and rack thy breast  the incoherent stage where grave and comic jar like youth and age now death appears all horrible and grim but the next moment none so fair as him and now you sigh  ah let me calmly die then shrinking trembling from the grave you fly such jarring tumults in your bosom roll ah what so various as a womans soul but thou beware and if thy fate has joined a sickly body to a roving mind be calm nor mourn at the supreme decree nor think the mandate shall be changed for thee but meet with patience what thou can not flee would thou repine to see thy form decay when spios eyelids are forbid the day might thou with us unbodied spirits fly from sphere to sphere and trace the boundless sky then would the lives of little mortals show like empty bubbles raised of morning dew all seem as trifles whether we behold a monarch banished or a sparrow sold a thoughtless insect trampled in the mire or a proud beauty in her bloom expire more noble scenes enraptured spirits view but the grand prospect is too large for you a closer bound best suits thy narrow mind a few examples of thy fading kind have thou forgot the soft iphenias name whose smiling face not spleen itself could blame scarce nineteen years her dawning beauties knew ever the young roses bid her cheeks adieu yet blessed with all could please a womans pride in this gay bloom the bright iphenia died her sire lifts to heaven his mournful eyes and her sad brother fills the air with cries her brother clodius who to grief resigned to fruitless passion all his manly mind what simple sorrow to the dead you pay who soon must follow the same dusky way for ever the transport of his grief was over fate gave the sign and clodius was no more still pero lived a yet surviving son a little space and peros race was done deaths icy hand his youthful limbs invades and bids him mingle with his kindred shades so quickly pero and narcissa fell scarce looking round them ever they bid farewell yet dangerous it is to wander here too long these went more willing as they fell more young but lauras name demands thy flowing tears whose doubts increasing with her lengthened years served not to clear but cloud the dusky way and gave new terrors to her final day the dreadful moment would have past as well at sixteen years had weeping laura fell let this o mira cheer thy drooping mind to bear the sentence past on all mankind i bore the same whose life was more desired more loved more known and justly more admired yet this grand fear is wove with natures laws is sometimes right and sometimes has no cause repent and mend  these vapors then will fly and the clouds brighten to a purer sky still look to heaven and its laws attend and next the lines of thy aerial friend on mr popes universal prayer ah thou whom nature and thy stars designed at once the joy and envy of mankind to thy loved memory this sigh i send to thee a stranger to thy lines a friend how blessed the muse could she like thine aspire so smooth her accent and sublime her fire with bright description make the bosom glow charm like thy sense and like thy numbers flow o teach my soul to reach the seats divine and praise her maker in a strain like thine ye careless ones who never thought before read this grand verse then tremble and adore let stern enthusiasts here be taught to know it is from the heart true piety must flow here hope content and smiling mercy shine and breathe celestial through the speaking line from the still mind its guilty passions roll and dawning grace awakes the fervent soul let angry zealots quarrel for a name the good the just the virtuous are the same grace to no sect nor virtue is confined they blend with all and spread amongst the kind and the pure flame that warms the pious breast those cannot merit who condemn the rest to the dark nations when religion came all dressed in smiles they saw the heavenly dame till some stern teachers of their office proud chose not to soften but affright the crowd with gloomy terrors filled the dusky age and veiled her beauties in the mask of rage then bid the handmaids of perdition rise black cruelty with fierce and flaming eyes distraction ravaged on the public weal and persecution wore the robe of zeal deluded faith espoused the stronger side and conquered justice gave her sword to pride this saw the surly discontented mind by nature haughty and to vice inclined and thence concluded all their systems vain the cant of schools and phrensy of the brain from hence the sect of libertines arose who scorn what reason or the priests impose who give to chance the worlds that round us roll and tear from man his everconscious soul but thou whose name immortal as thy rhymes shall live and brighten through succeeding times whose lines can wit and virtue both inspire whom future ages shall like me admire teach me between the two extremes to glide not brave the stream nor swim with every tide but more with charity than zeal possessed keep my own faith yet not condemn the rest the fields of melancholy and cheerfulness still were the groves and venerable night over half the globe had cast her gloomy veil when by a tapers solitary gleam sat musing mira pensive and alone in her sad breast officious memory revived the pictures of departed friends whose pleasing forms she must behold no more forgotten woe that for a time had slept rose into life and like a torrent poured on her faint soul which sunk beneath its rage at length soft slumber kindly intervened and closed those eyelids that were drenched in tears but restless fancy that was waking still led my deluded spirit on the wing to pictured regions and imagined worlds i seemed transported to a gloomy land whose fields had never known the cheerful sun a heavy mist hung in the frowning sky no feathered warblers cheered the mourning groves nor blushing flowers adorned the barren ground i gazed around the solitary coast when lo a nymph with solemn air approached whose dress was careless and her features grave her voice was broken and her hearing dull she spoke but seldom yet at last she told me in a whisper that her name was thought and more she offered with a friendly air to lead me safely through the dreary gloom we walked along through rough unpleasing paths over beds of nightshade and through groves of yew till we arrived within a dusky wood whose spacious bound was fenced with shagged thorn the trees were baleful cypress and a few tall pines that murmured to the rushing wind here dwelt the natives mournful as the place or sunk in real or imagined woe complaining sounds were heard on every side and each bewailed the loss of something dear some mourned a child that in its bloom expired and some a brothers or a parents fate lost wealth and honors many tongues deplored and some were wretched though they knew not why but as we reached the center of the place complaints were heard more piercing than before the gathering fogs grew thicker over our heads and a cold horror thrilled our wounded souls and thus we traveled pensive beyond measure through paths half covered with perplexing thorns at length we found two rows of aged firs whose tops were blasted by unwholsom winds this solitary vista opening wide disclosed the palace of its mournful queen before the gate was placed a frightful guard who served as porters to the gloomy dome here stretched upon a miserable couch lay pining sickness with continual groans and by her side arrayed in filthy weeds sat quaking poverty with ghastly stare his presence seemed to aggravate her pain for when she cast her languid eyes on him she hid her face and raised a fearful cry there disappointment like a statue stood with eyes dejected and with visage pale her heaving bosom seemed to swell with anguish and in her hand she grasped a broken reed here in the garb of piety we saw proud error frowning with a look severe doubt at his elbow bore a rod of snakes and held a cup filled to the brim with tears by these we passed into the dusky court oerrun with hemlock and with gloomy fern perpetual night hung over the dismal walls and from the ground unhealthy vapors rose through folding doors of ebony we came into a winding passage hung with black for ever dark  possessed by flitting shades by waking fancies and by frightful dreams this led us to a subterraneous cell where the sad empress melancholy reigned the musing matron sat upon a throne of mouldering earth  her footstool of the same and for her canopy an aged yew spread over her head its venerable arms her careless robe was of a sable hue and on her shoulders flowed her slighted hair her lips were closed with an eternal silence her arms were folded and her head reclined on either side her pale attendants stood two mournful maids dejection and despair the first attended with continual faintings seemed on the point to close her dying eyes a constant dew hung on her deathlike brow and her cold bosom half forgot to heave despair whose garments by herself were torn was marked with wounds that time can never heal with desperate hand she struck her bleeding breast and washed the ground with neverceasing tears with ghastly figures was the cave adorned and in the midst the effigies of death shocked at the place we hasted to return and left the horrid mansion far behind long time we traveled through untrodden paths where the brown forests cast an awful gloom at length the floating clouds began to part and left behind them streaks of cheerful azure our path grew smooth and widend to the view until it opened on a spacious field a field whose charms no painter ever could reach though he should borrow from the poets heaven the clime was temperate and the air was still the sprouting turf was of a beauteous green speckled with flowers of a delicious dye here crystal lakes were bordered round with trees where blossoms flourished in eternal spring for here the groves no blasting tempests know but still are blessed with fruits that never decay perpetual sunshine crowned the gaudy hills and the fair valleys were with plenty gay a path there was trod over the spicy field which led the wanderer to a blissful shade whose fence was made of balmy eglantine where the fair plane oerlookd the myrtle shrub and flowring orange that perfume the air here flew in throngs the soft aerial choir whose glittering necks like polished amber shone we passed delighted through ambrosial paths and bowers move with jessamine and rose joy seized the ravished spirits while we breathed in gales that tasted of immortal sweets at length the parting trees broke into form and with a circle bound a charming plain in the midst of which upon an ivory throne sat cheerfulness the genius of the place her mien was graceful and her features fair continual smiles dwelt on her dimpld cheeks her hair was bound beneath a shining crown her robes were azure bright with golden stars and in her hand she held a silver lute on either side her royal sisters sat both lovely as herself though not so gay the eldest had a face divinely fair calm was her look with lips prepared for smiling she often raised her thankful eyes to heaven her form was easy and her name content the other much the youngest was arrayed in virgin robes white as unsullied snow her thoughtless smiles would tame a tigers rage a lamb whose neck was circld with a band of new blown roses at her feet was laid a milkwhite dove upon her hand she bore thus ever blessed sat innocence the fair behind these sisters stood a shining train as maids of honor to the royal fair prosperity the first was climbing up a stately pyramid of painted marble from whose high top she reached a brilliant crowd then with an air that spoke a joyful heart looked down with pleasure on the plain below gay wealth the next in her embroidered vest shone like the entrails of the eastern mine her hair was platted thick with sparkling gems and in her hand she bore a golden wand health like a sylvan huntress clothed in green in her right hand a dapled palfry held her air was masculine and swift her motion a wreath of flowers just ravished from the meads bound up the ringlets of her sable hair her cheeks were ruddy and her large black eyes confessed the vigor of her sprightly soul these were the natives of this happy land the sight of whom so filled my glowing breast with ecstasy that i awoke and thus their glories vanished and were seen no more the libyan hunter a fable inscribed to the memory of a late admired author when merit rises like the prince of day pale envy turns her aching eyes away then sallow cheeks with rage are taught to glow and narrow souls to bloated furies grow old story tells us on an earthly plain once jove descended wrapped in golden rain now fate permits no such familiar powers but shoals of critics fall in leaden showers these gaze at wit as owls behold the sun and curse the luster which they fain would shun these beasts of prey no living worth endure nor are the regions of the dead secure yet shall the worthy over their spite prevail here lies the moral  follows next the tale once on a time on libyas thirsty land where showers seldom wet the burning sand lived happy sylvius as the morning gay a wellknown favorite of the prince of day whose hand unerring to the mark in view sent the swift arrow from the twanging yew the trembling panthers from his fury fly when the keen javelin hissed along the sky fierce were his eyes and dazzling as the sun his raven looks in mazy ringlets run a wellstord quiver at his back was tied a shining spear his better hand supplied thus rudely charming he was sure to please with graceful negligence and careless ease he breathed soft music from his tuneful tongue and the wild tiger listened to his song the woodland nymphs their dusky shades forego and the blue naiads left the deeps below none guard the flocks nor hunt the flying prey till he had finished the enchanting lay then sylvan dames with wreaths of laurel bound his cheerful temples and with roses crowned but grudging envy heard the just applause and the pale phantom writhed her hagard jaws now swelled the bosoms of repining swains and hissing scandals flew across the plains at length his fame the wondering sky invades and reached the muses in their sacred shades bright thalia viewed him with an envious eye and thus addressed her partners of the sky  ye tuneful maids give over the labored song  small are the praises to our share belong  look down and see on yonder sultry plain  our voices equaled by a libyan swain  give over the lay ye too officious fair  lay down the lyre and fruitless hymns forbear  nor hope to charm the partial prince of day  while heavenly accents breathe from mortal clay  in vain we keep our radiant seats on high  if rural swains shall with our music vie she said and rage possessed the beauteous ring some curse the youth and some their partial king the dame who saw the infectious murmurs run rolled her blue eyes and thus afresh begun  no more the bays shall to our share belong  nor charmed celestials shall attend our song  but all to sylvius shall their offerings pay  to sylvius favored by the prince of day  shall he exceed the muses sacred choir  not while revenge shall injured bosoms fire  but see my sisters on the plains below  swift cynthias hounds pursue the flying do  be mine the task to bear a fraudful tale  to the swift hunters in the libyan vale  as how her herds in vain from sylvius fly  his darts pursue them and the victims die  so delias rage shall stop his tuneful tongue  and we no more shall dread the rival song here ceased the dame  the smiling sisters join their loud applauses to her sly design now had the sun withdrawn his piercing eye and night assumed the empire of the sky lulled in her lap reposing nature lay and swains forgot the labors of the day the winds were hushed the ocean ceased to roar and softly murmured by the sandy shore when from parnassus flew the envious maid to seek the huntress of the lonely shade the fierce virago on a verdant plain she found encircld by her sleeping train where a cool river blessed the fertile ground its bank with trees and bending ofiers crowned beneath a shade the lovely dian stood with downcast eyes and viewed the rolling flood whose waves were bright with the reflected beams of her own orb that sparkld on the streams  hail delia hail began the artful dame  lives there a wretch who owns not delias name  lives there a slave whose daring hand defies  the awful empress of the nightly skies  yes haughty sylvius triumphs over the plain  though thy choice herds are by his arrows slain  the frighted fauns his wanton rage would fly  but the keen dart oertakes em and they die  his shining spear arrests the trembling do  and groaning stags the deadly weapon know  but if fair delia to the libyan swain  resigns the freedom of her sacred plain  let none dispute the license of her will  and i retire to our tuneful hill with flushing features and disordered charms the angry goddess seized her deathful arms  shall man with me dispute the plain she cries while kindling rage inflamed her rolling eyes  this hand shall well revenge my slaughtered deer she said and furious grasped the dreadful spear and over her shoulder flung the shining bow then breathing vengeance sought her guiltless foe the youth beneath a dusky shade she found thoughtless of ill and sleeping on the ground a deadly shaft deluded cynthia drew and to his heart the feathered vengeance flew the reaking blood came bubbling through the wound poured over his bosom and distained the ground then the freed spirit took her airy way to fields of pleasure and of endless day the redcheekd morning had now chased away nights sable curtain  and the dawning day called forth abroad the trusty bands  again to chase the tiger over the desert plain to search the caves where kingly lions roar and from thick shades dislodge the bristled boar sylvius they want for him they search they call they search the shades where crystal waters fall his wonted haunts then every voice they try in vain they call for none alas reply hear sylvius hear they cry and all around hear sylvius hear the hollow rocks resound at length a crew the basest of the plain approached the covert of the slaughtered swain glad they beheld him breathless on the ground and gazed with rapture on the purple wound when one began  now bless the friendly hand that swept off sylvius from the gazing land behold the day so often by us desired here lies the swain whom lately all admired this phoebus saw as from his blazing wheels with his broad eye he viewed the glittering fields behold the youth whom he had taught to throw the feathered arrow from the bounding bow beheld his sylvius to whose artful tongue he taught the numbers of enchanting song now cold and breathless on the dewy plain and his worst foes insulting over the slain then raged the god that wears the silver bow and his broad eyes with sparkling fury glow descended phoebus in a burning ray his beamy locks declares the prince of day and flashing glories round his temples play each on his face the trembling victims fall their stammering tongues would fain for mercy call but as all groveling on the dust they lie his shafts dispatch them to the darker sky learn hence he cried ye impious men to know and dread the power that wears the mortal bow for while i rule the blazing throne of day none wrong my servants but shall find their pay he said  and raised his favorite from the ground then smiled the features and the gaping wound was seen no more the glowing cheeks revive shake off the stamp of death and seem alive instead of cypress and a mournful shroud apollo wrapped him in a golden cloud and bore him thence but where there is none can say unless to his own regions of the day and from the ground where sylvius late was seen where the warm gore had stained the thirsty green a pleasing tree arose with slender stems that breathed ambrosia from its opening gems those opening gems the virgins used to wear on their fair bosoms and their shining hair now the gay shrub each happy climate knows by all admired and it is called the rose the temple of love when lonely night composed the drowsy mind and hushed the bosom of the weary hind pleased with plain nature and with simple life i read the scenes of shores deluded wife till my faint spirits sought the silent bed and on its pillow dropped my aching head then fancy ever to her mira kind prepared her phantoms for the roving mind behold a fabric rising from the ground to the soft timbrel and the citterns sound corinthian pillars the vast building hold of polished silver and peruvian gold in four broad arches spread the shining doors the blazing roofs enlighten all the floors beneath a sparkling canopy that shone with persian jewels like a morning sun wrapped in a robe of purest tyrian dye cytheras image met the ravished eye whose glowing features would in paint beguile so well the artist drew her mimick smile her shining eyes confessed a sprightly joy upon her knees reclined her wanton boy on the bright walls around her and above were drawn the statutes and the arts of love these taught the silent language of the eye the broken whisper and amusing lie the careless glance peculiar to the fair and vows for lovers that dissolve in air the graceful anger and the rolling eyes the practiced blush and counterfeit surprise the language proper for pretending swains and fine description for imagined pains the friendly caution and designing ease and all the arts that ruin while they please now entered followed by a splendid train a blooming damsel and a wealthy swain the gaudy youth in shining robes arrayed behind him followed the unthinking maid youth in her cheek like opening roses sprung her careless tresses on her shoulders hung her smiles were cheerful as enlivening may her dress was careless and her eyes were gay then to soft voices and melodious sound the board was spread the sparkling glasses crowned the sprightly virgin in a moment shines in the gay entrails of the eastern mines then pride comes in with patches for the fair and spicy odours for her curling hair rude riot in a crimson vest arrayed with smoothfaced flattery like a chambermaid soft pomp and pleasure at her elbow stand and folly shakes the rattles in her hand but now her feeble structure seemed to shake its basis trembled and its pillars quake then rushed suspicion through the lofty gate with heartsick loathing led by ghastly hate and foaming rage to close the horrid band with a drawn poniard in her shaking hand now like an earthquake shook the reeling frame the lamps extinguish in a purple flame one universal groan was heard and then the cries of women and the voice of men some roar out vengeance some for mercy call and shrieks and tumult fill the dreadful hall at length the specter vanished from my sight again the lamps resumed a feeble light but changed the place no splendour there was shown but gloomy walls that mirth had never known for the gay dome where pleasure used to dwell appeared an abbey and a doleful cell and here the sad the ruined nymph was found her robe disordered and her locks unbound while from her eyes the pearly drops of woe washed her pale cheek where roses used to blow her blue and trembling lips prepared to breathe the sighs that made her swelling bosom heave thus stupid with her grief she sat and pressed her lily hands across her pensive breast a group of ghastly phantoms stood behind whose task it is to wreck the guilty mind widemouthed reproach with visage rude and thin and hissing scandal made a hideous din remorse that darted from her deadly wings envenomed arrows and a thousand stings then with pale cheeks and with a ghastly stare peeped over her shoulder holloweyd despair whose hand extended bore a bleeding heart and death behind her shook his threatening dart these forms with horror filled my aching breast and from my eyelids drove the balm of rest i woke and found old night her course had run and left her empire to the rising sun advice to myrtillo since you myrtillo will devote your time to the lean study of delusive rhyme since youre content to slumber out your days to dream of dinners but to feed on praise receive this counsel ever your flights begin from one long practiced in the darling sin now fames broad ocean lies before your way yet friend be careful it is a dangerous sea where though some few may reach the happy land numbers are wrecked upon the treacherous sand then guard your spirits as you prize your ease nor once indulge em in a thirst of praise for fame like fortune proud yet wanton too is pleased to fly and make the wretch pursue frowns on her slaves but to the careless mind that slights her favors she is always kind would you the ladies should approve your song paint sylvias eyes or praise clarindas tongue describe the charms of cloes sprightly air or blooming daphne more divinely fair or venuss son that hurls the flaming dart and tag each stanza with a bleeding heart tell them of rocks where tears eternal flow dissolved to fountains by a lovers woe of icy bosoms that in summer freeze and sighs much stronger than a southern breeze perhaps the fair whom for a theme you choose must owe her beauties to your skilful muse has erring nature raissd her nose too high sunk down her cheeks or drawn her lips awry no matter how the twisted features stand they will grow divine beneath a poets hand though her dim eye balls roll within her head like two gray bullets in a verge of red you like promotheus must their rays inspire and fill their orbs with more than mortal fire do you the levee of his grace attend and like most poets should you want a friend make not his worth the measure of your song but learn his humor and you cannot be wrong perhaps this maxim may offend the wise but you must flatter if you mean to rise observe what passions in his bosom roll and watch the secret motions of his soul mind what false guard has left a breach within for some choice folly or some darling sin these you must hide  but draw his virtues nigh lest the rude picture shock the gazing eye the heraldsoffice you must search with care and look you find no pimps nor tailors there bring none to light but honorable knaves shut up the peasants in their moldy graves if knights are wanting in the dusky breed arthurs round table will supply your need no more  for i as many teachers do show my own folly by instructing you and you perhaps disdain my wholesome rules so saucy pupils count their masters fools but should your pride the common track refuse you will find small pensions for your haughty muse still you may scribble on and in the end be just as rich as  sir your humble friend on discontent to stella say dearest stella why this pensive air tell me o tell thy sorrows and thy care why thy lips tremble and thy cheeks are pale why heaves thy bosom with a mournful gale let not thy eyes for distant evils flow nor rack thy bosom with prophetic woe imagined ills deceive our aching eyes as lengthened shades appear of monstrous size when setting phoebus gilds the evening skies though pictured joy deludes our panting souls when round the heart its smiling phantom rolls the gay impostor mocks our reaching arms yet while it lasts the pleasing vision charms not so distrust her gloomy forehead rears she brings cold anguish and a crowd of fears ah lovely stella as you prize your rest expel this fury from your guiltless breast the wise and mighty guardian of mankind to each dividual has their draught assigned and though no pearls should in our potion fall let us be cheerful while he spares the gall unmeaning transports for a moment please yet peace alone can bless your equal days but coldly viewed or quickly thrown aside see cringing merit at the gates of pride see wit and wisdom that our fathers prized in youth neglected as in age despised behold the scorn as late the dread of all the politician from his glory fall he whose sly genius could a kingdom rule shall have his exit hissed by every fool with aching bosom and a streaming eye the hoary soldier sees his honor fly who in his age must to oppression bow and yield his laurels to a younger brow those laurels shall the proud successor wear a while then strip and leave em to his heir if these are wretched let not us repine whose meaner talents never were made to shine our good and ill our vice and virtue falls within the compass of domestic walls to those small limits be thy views confined and bless thy cottage with an humble mind look not at joys that dazzle from afar nor envy glaro on his gilded car for all degrees their days of anguish know and the most happy have a taste of woe then calmly take what providence ordains he swells the load who murmurs and complains for all things vary and who sits to day halfdrownd in tears tomorrow may be gay the proposal with aching fingers twinging nose and vexed dear madam well suppose to leave yourself and parlourfire trudged mira to her own good sire beneath a cold and gloomy sky walked cheek by jole the muse and i the listening gossip though unseen had watched the talk that passed between myself and you and much offended it seems at what was there intended  so cries the peevish maid and squinting  methinks i heard you talk of printing  have i bestowed a world of pains  to spirit up your blockish brains  to get from thence an idle rhyme  that made me blush to call it mine  and shall i see the crippld crew  discarded from their seat and you  turned out to skip from hand to hand  in dirty gazettes round the land  to grace the knee of every sot  and catch the droppings of his pot  while in a rage the drowsy swains  perhaps may curse you for your pains  protesting with a criticks spite  that none since durfey knew to write  but mira if you want a muse  to grace the page of weekly news  the task is much too low for me  yet i have a maid of less degree  with spirit suiting to her state  will serve you at an easy rate  whose voice though hoarse is loud and strong  an artist at a ranting song  can chaunt lampoons without much straining  or epigrams with double meaning  to join the tavernharp or viol  now if you will take her upon trial  to her deservings suit your pay  and then you take the safest way  perhaps you will prosper in the end  i will say no more but ask your friend  here ends the muse  dear madam say  shall i reject her or obey soto a character in sotos bosom you may find the glimmering of a worthy mind it is but a faint and feeble ray imperfect as the dawning day yet were the jarring passions tuned and the wild branches nicely pruned the soil from thorns and thistles clear some latent virtues might appear in the morning catch him early though your bird will else be flown i trow ever he has reached the bowzing can you will find the stamp of reasoning man then see the wretch whom none can rule ever night a madman and a fool the witty soto then you will find just level with the brutal kind

make you  he fain would walk but cannot stand and see a palsy in his hand and though his throat has swallowed down two gallons of october brown his greedy guts impatient roar and seem to call aloud for more more they shall have but hark within is heard a rude and lawless din wind ale and phlegm their powers wage and hickups call them to engage and now ah now incessant flows the frothy tide from mouth and nose no more is seen the covered ground but a huge river floating round down drops the youth his giddy head falls easy on the liquid bed so swam achilles fierce and brave on angry xanthuss

his ears and walks away the universal dream  give over your whims says my considerate friend  retrieve the fleeting hours you idly spend  blind to advice incorrigible vain  you follow fancy and her laughing train  your thoughtless days in swift delusion fly so let them go says unconverted i look round the globe my friend and then you will see the drowsy world is slumbering just like me see on soft beds the hero sleeps secure till war comes thundering at his trembling door in wiser dreams the politician prys through distant kingdoms with his halfshut eyes the lulled projector builds aerial towers and rolls smooth rivers through enchanted bowers the chemist slumbers over imagined gold so delias conquests in her dreams are told what monstrous phantoms in that trance are born through which amyntor sees his sprouting horn when purblind mortals sound the depths of fate or some lean poet aims at an estate or when the good believing man depends on the slight promise of his courtly friends should those awake they to their cost would find these are but shadows of a sleeping mind few real pleasures are on earth possessed and mortals only in their dreams are blessed then dream no longer my wellmeaning friend that miras follies with her muse shall end some younger vanity succeeds the first and the last folly often proves the worst no while the rest in fruitless cares are hurled let me enjoy my visionary world to this glad bosom hug the dear mistake if dreams are blessings who would wish to wake the sow and the peacock a fable in days of yore as authors tell when beasts and birds could read and spell no matter where in town or city there lived a swine exceeding witty and for the beauties of her mind excelling all her bristld kind but yet to mortify her pride she found at last her failing side philosophy she had good store had pondered seneca all over yet all precautions useless prove against the power of mighty love it happened on a sultry day upon her favorite couch she lay twas a round dunghill soft and warm oershadowd by a neighboring barn when lo her winking eyes behold a creature with a neck of gold with painted wings and gorgeous train that sparkld like the starry plain his neck and breast all brilliant shine against the sun the dazzld swine who never saw the like before began to wonder and adore but seeing him so fair and nice she left her dunghill in a trice and fond to please the grunting elf began to wash and prune herself and from the stinking wave she run to dry her carcass in the sun then rubbed her sides against a tree and now as clean as hogs can be with cautious air and doubtful breast the glittering peacock thus addressed  sir i a homely rural swine  can boast of nothing fair nor fine  no dainties in our troughts appear  but as you seem a stranger here  be pleased to walk into my sty  a little hut as plain as i  pray venture through the humble door  and though your entertainments poor  with me you shall be sure to find  an open heart and honest mind  and that is a dainty seldom found  on cedar flowers and city ground thus far the sow had preached by rule she preached alas but to a fool for this same peacock you must know had he been man had been a beau and had like them but mighty little to say so squirted out his spittle and with an air that testified he would got at least his share of pride he thus began why truly now  youre very civil mrs sow  but i am very clean do you see  your sty is not a place for me  should i go through that narrow door  my feathers might be soiled or tore  or scented with unsavry fumes  and what am i without my plumes the much offended sow replies and turns asquint her narrow eyes  sir youre incorrigibly vain  to value thus a shining train  for when the northern wind shall blow  and send us hail and sleet and snow  how will you save from such keen weathers  your merit  sir i mean your feathers  as for myself  to think that i  should lead an idiot to my sty  or strive to make an oaf my friend  it makes my bristles stand an end  but for the future when i see  a bird that much resembles thee  i will ever take it as a rule  the shining case contains a fool florimelia the first pastoral by mr newton of florimelia and her charms i sing fair as the blossoms of the smiling spring whose lovely temples wore a myrtle wreath that served to shade her glowing cheeks beneath how would that brow which never knew to frown become the splendour of an awful crown for by the luster of her shining eyes you would take her for an empress in disguise those graceful limbs though clad in humble green would suit a princess nor disgrace a queen yet a plain crook adorned her snowy hands fair as the fleeces of her tender lambs her task it was those tender lambs to lead over the tall mountain on the fertile mead where the clear fountains gently murmur by and sounding grottos to her flute reply her flute and song delude the tedious day and her soft hours calmly glide away in smiles the fair one viewed the rising sun in smiles beheld him when his race was done and when his beams had bid the fields adieu and the damp meadows shone with pearly dew pent in their fold she leaves her wanton care and to her home returns the happy fair twas a low cottage humble as their fate where an old father met her at the gate this hind was called asophus of the plain a name much valued by each honest swain on whose grave brow were seen the marks of time no more his cheeks confessed their healthy prime dim were his eyes those eye balls that had seen full fourscore springs arrayed in sprightly green child of his age was florimel the fair and she alone his comfort and his care their little house was placed beneath a hill whose verge was watered by a streaming rill the stranger here no gilded spires saw for this low roof was thatched with humble straw mosaic here nor fretwork there was none nor venice glass to sparkle in the sun its only window was of osier made full south it looked and seldom knew the shade where by the sun this careful peasant knew how over his head the swiftwingd minutes flew a little orchard too was planted nigh and the cool river rolled its waters by in whose clear stream the pendent willows lave and the weak bullrush trembled over the wave within the banks soft watercresses spring where the pleased heron prunes her dabbled wing thus dwelt asophus  happier far than he whose slaves approach him with a bending knee his willing eyelids in soft slumbers close no midnight revels break his loved repose no dark intrigue for open vengeance calls nor envy dwelt within his peaceful walls but his calm days in one smooth circle run he blessed the rising and declining sun a stranger both to sickness and to sin twas health without and happiness within while by his side his florimelia sung and his fond soul upon her music hung like him no parent loved his darling care no child like her so duteous and so fair him with crumbd milk both morn and eve she fed and smoothed the pillows for his weary head with her his moments gently glide away who dressed in smiles the evening and the day hear this ye great ones whose unwieldy store is still embitterd with a wish for more who strive to climb on fortunes slippery hill and swallow ruin in a golden pill but learn from hence that happiness can dwell with a plain peasant in his humble cell she loves the village and the harmless hind with a clear conscience and a cheerful mind and the gay wantons vainly search around for bliss which only is with virtue found florimelia the second pastoral by mr newton as florimelia watched her snowy fold soft florimelia with her locks of gold low in a vale beneath a spreading shade two ruddy youths that loved the beauteous maid to please the fair thus formed the rival song while the herds listened to each tuneful tongue philaster this morn i wandered through a poplar grove where a lone turtle mourned her absent love with pensive coo she well expressed her woe lulled by her voice the brooks more gently flow when lo the partner of her nest drew nigh with hovering wings and bid her sorrows fly all sprightly now with brisker note she sings prunes her soft breast and spreads her joyful wings no more the grove is witness to her woe such are the joys that faithful lovers know  chromis as yestereven while my sheep did feed on a soft bank i tuned my oaten reed twas there a single violet i spied that breathed its odours drooped its head and died when from the root a gay companion grew fair as the first and fresh as morning dew whose fragrant leaves perfumed the bordring plain then did the first its former beauties gain pleased with each other side by side they grow such are the joys that faithful lovers know  philaster as sweet as was the violet is my love  chromis and i as constant as the turtledove  philaster soft are the murmurs of a southern wind and the complainings of a lovesick mind soft are the breathings of an infants sleep but she is softer than her harmless sheep  chromis sweet are the gales that meet the rosy morn sweet are the flowers that yonder meads adorn sweet are the banks on which my lambkins play but my loved nymph is sweet as early day  philaster where walks my love  there opening roses bloom and yellow cowslips shed a choice perfume when she is gone the opening roses fade the sun himself laments the absent maid  chromis when smiles my love then smile the groves below and the clear skies with brighter luster glow but when she frowns those groves are glad no more and the sky lowers that was bright before  philaster while we prefer the spring to winter storms or goodly cedars to unseemly thorns while maples keep below the lofty pine shall my loved nymph before her sisters shine  chromis as we prefer the peacock to the crow as maidens fairer than their mothers show and as my voice above philaster swells so my loved nymph each other nymph excels  philaster you sung last night with more melodious air as you lay plaiting cloes yellow hair while the shrill pipe her slender fingers plied the pipe you gave her and your heart beside  chromis twas you i saw beneath a maple shade with blubbered cheeks you cursed the cruel maid who broke your cypress bowl on yonder plain and sent the willow to her slighted swain  philaster tell me at midnight where do mandrakes groan and blood fall dropping from the darkened moon tell this and i shall for thy learning yield a coalblack lamb that sports in yonder field  chromis tell me where oaks have tender medlars bore and shrubs yield apples that were crabs before and for thy knowledge i shall not refuse to give the best of all my speckled ewes  thus sung the shepherds while the listening maid praised both their songs and thus their songs repaid behold this lovely pineapple she cried and this twinchesnut once my chiefest pride these long were mine and these i give to you to both a prize a prize to both is due now nightly vapors taint the colder air they part the flocks and to the folds repair and the black clouds forbid their longer stay their feet unwilling tread their destined way at once farewell too lovely nymphs they cry and on the virgin cast a parting eye catharinas cave by mr newton beneath a mountains solitary shade lived catharina then an ancient maid an useful dame that every simple knew and from choice herbs exhaled a cordial dew rude was her dome and hid from prying eyes by lofty hills that seemed to reach the skies deep in a rock the winding cavern run a bending cypress skreend it from the sun from its rude side a fountain used to flow that poured incessant on the stones below this music lulled the pensive dame to rest and drew soft slumbers on her aching breast no sun was there nor scarce a dawning gleam no twinkling stars nor cynthias silver beam there naked elms and sapless oaks appeared with age grown rotten and by lightning seared there perched the raven and the grayeyd owl with his wise visage and his serious scowl no flowerets there bedeck the mossy ground but a thick forest spread its shade around where the smooth box and browner hasel grew the solemn pine tree and the baleful yew here no glad sound was heard nor human tongue not colins flute nor blouzelindas song these gloomy shades for grief were only made and howling wolves that scamperd through the glade here catharina spent her irksom days secluded both from envy and from praise not so her laughing moments used to run when her bright eyes were like a morning sun when to her flock repaired the gazing swains her flock was then the fairest of the plains and she no less  with veins of sprightly blue and cheeks like roses wrapped in morning dew the loves and graces round her features flew her mind was cheerful as the rising day mature as summer and as april gay yet fate too soon eclipsed her early joy she fell the victim of the winged boy the winged boy that bears the fatal darts henceforth may virgins better guard their hearts twas celadon twas he that caused her pain the fairest shepherd of the rural train whose careless beauty made her heart his prize and stole the slumbers from her wakeful eyes long time her pride and cooler reason strove against the power of encroaching love in vain  her cheeks and mournful eyes declare the smothered passion and the secret care while the dull youth whom beauty never could please who sought no more than indolence and ease ranged over the valleys with his darling tray or near some fountain slumberd out the day all nymphs he strove but mostly her to shun and to thick shades and distant pastures run there the soft flute his nimble fingers plied while his loved dog sat listening by his side then wept the fair with grief and rage oppressed strange passions labored in her pensive breast she lost her crook  her flocks no more were told and her lambs wandered from their nightly fold till to these shades she took her desperate way and vowed no more to see the beams of day here the gay roses on her cheek expired and from her eyes the laughing loves retired no flowery wreaths her faded temples knew her locks uncombd upon her shoulders flew no silken vestments on her limbs were rolled a russet mantle saved her from the cold a simple cordage round her waste she tied and a rude staff her better hand supplied here learned the dame the physic of the field and what the woods and what the mountains yield of sovereign balm to heal a rankling wound or ripen swellings where no sores are found to strengthen sinews and catarrhs expel and none for colicks could her art excel with magic herbs she drew out festring thorns her charms could banish toothache cramps and corns to her repaired from all the neighboring plains the sickly matrons and the wounded swains nor to one species was her art confined her skill was known amongst the fleecy kind her cordials strengthened the declining ewe and limping calves her healing plasters knew the enquiry in vain alas do lazy mortals cry in vain would wisdom trace the boundless sky where doubled wonders upon wonders rise and worlds on worlds confound our dazzld eyes better be still  let nature rest say they than err by guess and with opinion stray then tell me why our eyes were made to view those orbs that glister in the fluid blue why in our sight those shining wonders roll or why to man was given a thinking soul may i not ask how moves the radiant sun how the bright stars their pointed circuits run what warms those worlds that so remotely shine and what can temper saturns frozen clime who that beholds the fullorbd moon arise that cheerful empress of the nightly skies who would not ask could learned sages tell what kind of people on her surface dwell but there we pause  not newtons art can show a truth perhaps not fit for us to know how great the power who gave those worlds to roll the thought strikes inward and confounds the soul fall down o man  ah fall before the rod of this almighty allcreating god but hark  from heaven there came a chearing sound now man revives and smile the worlds around it is mercy  lo a golden ray descends and hope and comfort in the luster blends when from the stars we turn our aching eyes to earth we bend them where new wonders rise where life and death the equal scale suspend new beings rising as the former end who not surprised can trace each just degree from the swift eagle to the peevish be from the fierce lion that will yield to none to the weak mouse that hides her from the sun how near one species to the next is joined the due gradations please a thinking mind and there are creatures which no eye can see that for a moment live and breathe like me whom a small fly in bulk as far exceeds as you tall cedar does the waving reeds these we can reach  and may we not suppose there still are creatures more minute than those would heaven permit and might our organs bear to pierce where comets wave their blazing hair where other suns alternate set and rise and other moons light up the cheerful skies the ravished soul might still her search pursue still find new wonders opening on her view from thence to worlds in miniature descend and still press forward but should find no end where little forests on a leaf appear and drops of dew are mighty oceans there these may have whales that in their waters play and wanton out their age of half a day in those small groves the smaller birds may sing and share like us their winter and their spring pluck off you acorn from its parent bough divide that acorn in the midst  and now in its firm kernel a fair oak is seen with spreading branches of a sprightly green from this young tree a kernel might we rend there would another its small boughs extend all matter lives and shows its makers power there is not a seed but what contains a flower though unobserved its secret beauty lies till we are blessed with microscopick eyes when for blue plumbs our longing palate calls or scarlet cherries that adorn the walls with each plump fruit we swallow down a tree and so destroy whole groves that else would be as large and perfect as those shades we see behold you monster that unwieldly laves beneath the surface of the briny waves still as he turns the troubled sea divides and rolls in eddies from his slimy sides less huge the dolphin to the sun displays his scales and in the smoother ocean plays still less the herring and round mackrel sweep the shallow tide nor trust the roaring deep how far by gradual numberless degrees the senseless oyster is removed from these who follows nature through her mazy way from the mute insect to the fount of day where now she rises now her steps decline has need of judgment better taught than mine but on this subject we have talked too long where gravefacd wisdom may itself be wrong the rival brothers celia and i to share the vernal gales one evening wandered over the dewy vales still was the soul and every sense was pleased and the cool heart from care and business eased arm locked in arm with heedless steps we rove round the fair borders of a blooming grove reclined at ease within the secret shades a lovely bower held two fairer maids soft flavia one with cheeks of rosy dye and sylvia famous for her starlike eye sylvia whose wit was versed in charming wiles who often varied her discourse with smiles lovetales she told some fictious and some true the subject various and her stories new of innocence oppressed by mightier wrong and many proofs she drew from sacred song when flavia thus  behold the lingering day still paints you heavens with a silver gray and slothful night with gentler pace comes on as if she listened to thy charming tongue the rival brothers let my sylvia tell how cross they loved and who untimely fell her friend replied you shall not ask in vain although the story gives thy sylvia pain then on her cheek her ivory hand she laid and with a sigh began the lovely maid long time before our fathers lives began there lived an ancient and a worthy man was long the favorite of indulgent fame for wretches knew and blessed clytiphons name just without pride without reluctance kind for inborn goodness with soft pity joined to form the basis of his godlike mind his temperate soul was never disturbed with rage but graceful bore the reverend weight of age all bounteous heaven had to his share consigned a moderate fortune with a peaceful mind his dwelling seated on a rising hill was watered round with many a crystal rill gardens and groves the smothered buildings screen which looked the seat of some retired queen cythania tossed of the admiring land the fairest virgin of the shining band did to clytiphons honor trust her charms and gave her beauties to his faithful arms but cruel death whose business is to rend the paleeyd matron from her weeping friend had torn cythania from his widowed side and left her spouse to wail his constant bride heaven spared one child to crown his feeble age to cheer his spirits and his grief assuage sophinia precious to her fathers mind to her alone was every wish confined nor did the virgin less deserve his care her guiltless soul was like her person fair for heaven to form this matchless beauty joined her mothers features to her fathers mind not opening roses nor the bashful day blushed half so sweetly as sophinia gay her eyes were dazzling and her temples fair and every feature wore a smiling air for wit and learning she outstripd her kind nor could her sex debase her noble mind in search of knowledge she would spend the day and judgment walked before her guiltless way not many furlongs from those blissful plains where good clytiphon ruled the happy swains there lived a wealthy and a worthy peer loved by his friends and to his country dear laon the great in valor justly famed his sons lycander and polyphon named both noble youths and by their friends admired and thirst of glory both their hearts inspired lycanders form was fairer than his mind his shape was faultless and his brow sublime his jetty locks in mazy ringlets run and his bright eyes were like a morning sun rays quick and fierce their subtle lightenings fling his cheeks were fresher than the dawning spring but then as tempests over the ocean roll continual passion tore his boiling soul disdainful proud with an imperious will headlong he rushed on unsuspected ill reason in vain opposed her sacred shield and virtues self must to the whirlwind yield polyphons soul was of a gentler kind no rugged storms could shake his easy mind still calm and pleasant as the evening skies when not a breeze through the still region flies no gloomy frowns a sullen heart betray his brow was thoughtless and his air was gay these to clytiphons did their sire attend the pleasing mansion of their fathers friend with lovers eyes they both sophinia view as with her years her rising beauty grew with airy hopes they nursed the rival flame and sought with gifts to win the smiling dame but she too cautious to be soon betrayed their merit balanced and their tempers weighed lycanders fortune pleased the lovely dame his power titles and his rising fame and the gay maid beheld with early pride laons bright heir attending at her side that way would often her vanity incline but then her reason feared his base design still at her heart the sullen doubt remains and put a period to the golden dreams polyphons image on her fancy stole with thousand beauties in his taintless soul clear as his face and sprightly as his mien soft as his voice and like his brow serene polyphon now the wavering nymph admires nor thinks of castles towns and shining spires her changing thoughts prefer an easy home and dwell with patience on a younger son lycander once her favorite was but now he meets resentment and a frozen brow in vain to move the scornful nymph he tries with sprightly oaths and well dissembled lies his form no more can please sophinias eyes without concern he met the fairs disdain nor could her frown disturb the haughty swain conscious of merit he pursued her still and only thought her tongue belied her will for impudence to vice a trusty squire who bears her arms and fans her purple fire had taught lycander that affairs of love are not regarded in the realms above that oaths are licensed to address the fair and vows to virgins but the sport of air that maids are merchandise and may be sold for charming eloquence and mighty gold ii a grove there was a venerable shade no hostile iron durst her boughs invade whose lofty pines for several ages grew and reverend oaks a hundred winters knew a crystal river wandered halfway round the rest defended with a hasel mound twas here to shun lycanders jealous eye when sol departed to the western sky the sly sophinia used to leave her maids and meet polyphon in the balmy shades while the proud youth who found himself despised his person slighted and polyphon prized grew wild with love and desperate with despair and vowed destruction to the gentle pair no quiet hour his surly spirit knows nor rest by daylight or at night repose cold to his friends and if they ask his care he only answers with a fullen glare one evening when the sparkling sun withdrew and thirsty flowers sipd the grateful dew when this fair grove had put on all her charms and zephyrs played amidst her curling arms sophinia weary of the sultry day to the cool forest took her lonely way attentive only to the linnets song no ill she thought of and she feared no wrong pleased with the glories of the smiling year for guilty minds are only taught to fear the wellknown path her willing feet pursue through the brown shade where in the center grew a row of laurels crowned with lasting green and softer beech and flowring rose between here in a fatal hour sophinia came for proud lycander watched the lovely dame revenge and love at once his bosom fire his broad eyes flash with more than mortal fire then to his friends the raging hero flew his friends a thoughtless and a wanton crew whose slothful hands were backward as their will in virtues cause but resolute in ill to these the youth disclosed his rash design his glad companions in the adventure join that some well practiced in the ruffians trade should bear sophinia from the silent shade the mischief pleased yet none proposed the way though short the time and dangerous the delay in still suspense the listening heroes stand till with rude voice miranthus thus began  a castle has for many centries stood  within the confines of the neighbring wood  whose gloomy arches seem disposed to hide  offended subjects from a tyrants pride  and often she has lent her hostile towers  the guilty refuge of rebellious powers  here let your friends this peevish girl convey  and keep her secret from the face of day  those doors with iron eloquence shall plead  your mighty passion to the scornful maid  you have what my unready thought designed  the hasty dictates of a rustic mind  a mind inured to wars and rude alarms  unskilled in love and beautys softer charms he ceased  applause was seen in every eye and peals of laughter rent the troubled sky two favorite heroes singld from the crew with hostile feet that sacred path pursue whose winding maze betrayed the smiling bower that held sophinia in a baneful hour the heedless virgin on a bank they found where the faint primrose spreads her odours round and nodding poppies seemed to kiss the ground with frighted eyes the trembling fair one sees their surly figures through the parting trees but yet she rose collected in her fear twas vain to call and no assistance near then from the ground she raised her beauteous eyes and weeping turned them on the pitying skies assist me heaven and heavenly power she cries you saints that hover round celestial springs o take and wrap me in your sacred wings i see black violence come frowning on but may lycander mourn the dearbought wrong ah hear sophinia in this fearful hour and save o save me from a villains power but now a slave whom beauty never could charm drew nigh and seized her by the ivory arm through untrod paths they bore the struggling maid to those rude towers where lycander stayed a dismal dwelling hid by waving trees so thick they scarce admit the healthy breeze on whose black walls condensing vapors hung whose lofty spires hardly knew the sun his beams never entered here but in the room perpetual coldness and eternal gloom here the pleased youth his charming prey secures and round his prisoner shut the plated doors then left the virgin to herself nor stayed to bear reproaches from the injured maid fierce as he was he like a coward flies the rage that sparkld in her glowing eyes but when he thought the dangerous storm was over again he sought those eyes he fled before like some pale wretch impatient for his doom his fearful steps approached the hallowed room for rising conscience now her task began and guilty blushes through his features ran unusual horrors over his passage hung at every step the sounding portals rung before the door he took a silent stand and the pale taper trembled in his hand a hollow voice lycander seemed to call and shadows danced along the gloomy wall his haughty spirit was at this dismayed lycander trembled and was once afraid why beats my heart my coward heart he cries and why this mist before my dazzld eyes sophinias mine and i will seize my store if thousand specter guard the awful door then rushing in the lovely dame he found in fullen posture and in thought profound the wonted roses from her cheeks were fled on her fair hand reclined her beauteous head with flattery first he tipd his artful tongue and strove to palliate and excuse the wrong let not sophinia with a smile he cries think we have seized her as a hostile prize the fault we owe to this unconquered flame love was the aggressor and be his the blame trust not thy reason to a haughty guide nor call that honor which is only pride honor a pageant mistress of the vain the virgins tyrant and the heros chain if sparkling wealth can please thy brighter eyes the mines of persia at thy feet shall rise and when thy chariot marks the dusty fields full thirty slaves shall grace the shining wheels for thee the east shall yield her spicy bowers and sweeter baths distill from weeping flowers then smile my fair one and be timely wise the maid replied and rolled her scornful eyes hence fawning traitor why would thou be told how much i hate thy person and thy gold mistaken nature with too nice a care in vain has shaped thee in a mold so fair vice will be vice however it is polished over thou villain dare to meet my eyes no more those gloomy birds that love the midnight air and hover round the mansions of despair when to their shrieks the hollow roofs rebound and the hoarse raven aids the dreadful sound though howling wolves should with their voices join are less offensive to my ears than thine beyond my hate if yet a thought remain to make thy spirit curse the galling chain if with those thorns that loves soft empire bounds successful rivals give the deepest wounds i love thy brother and if that can be with passion equal to my hate for thee she said  and rage possessed lycanders soul his pale lips tremble and his eye balls roll three times he raised a dagger to her breast but mighty love his daring hand suppressed and now shrill cries invade his wondering ears the noise of battle and the clash of spears starting he turned nor staid to make reply though fury sparkld in his threatening eye to arms his friends in mingled voices call and danger hovered over the frowning wall iii in that sad hour when the frighted maid was drawn by villains from the mourning shade polyphon to the appointed forest came he reached the bower but he missed the dame through balmy paths with infant roses bound where blushing daisies strew the painted ground he roved impatient of the nymphs delay and often doubted to return or stay by chance he turned his mournful eye and sees his friend acanthus through the parting trees the youth drew nearer with an eager pace amazement hovered on his boding face and thus impatient to polyphon said where is sophinia where thy darling maid this evening restless though i know not why when setting phoebus stained the western sky to these sweet shades i took my heedless way to share the fragrance of declining day alone and pensive as i wandered here a womans voice surprised my listening ear to yon rude towers i traced the sinking sound till the stilled outcries were in distance drowned what think you now i fear some threatening ill from headstrong passion and imperious will i fear sophinia and yourself betrayed i know your brother loves the beauteous maid then hear my vow the frantic lover cries and turned his eye balls on the glimmering skies hear me ye powers whose sacred hands sustain these worlds of nature in a mighty chain if my fierce brother has presumed to bear and from her bowers force my injured fair these wakeful eyelids shall no more be closed this spirit rested nor these limbs reposed this vengeful rapier shall be sheathed no more till the rude traitor shall his prize restore he said and raging left the gloomy shade full of resentment for his injured maid acanthus summoned to a neighboring plain their friends a little but a martial train twice twenty youths their genrals voice attend and share the quarrel of their injured friend polyphon pleased to see the assembled powers led his small squadron to the hostile towers the frowning portals well secured they found the gloomy court with centries guarded round who spite of reason and their countrys laws were drawn to combat in a guilty cause the first of these cyrenus fair and young whose curling locks below his shoulders hung too rashly bold encountered hand to hand fierce polyarchus of polyphons band the pointed javelin sped beneath his chin and streaming purple stained his beauteous skin his very cheeks are washed with deeper dies and lasting slumber seals his swimming eyes this piteous sight enraged the vicious train but mostly iphis brother of the slain revenge he cried and hurled his deathful dart it hissed along but missed the heros heart despairing raging on the youth he flew while down his forehead rolled the sultry dew blows answer blows and round their temples sing the glancing weapons and the bucklers ring aloof they fight or now in circles wheeled each thought to conquer both disdain to yield till polyarchus with a sideway blow transpiercd the liver of his heedless foe he drew the weapon from his tortured side the gaping wound disgorgd a purple tide his eyes turned upward with a ghastly roll headlong he fell and sobd away his soul now joy transported the victorious throng with polyarchus all the welkin rung applause and clamor shook the trembling ground lycander heard and cursed the hated sound grieved for his friend he with the foremost pressed and all their lances glitter round his breast but the strong shield their points at distance holds where two fair eagles spread their wings in gold a weighty spear his better hand supplies and livid lightenings sparkle in his eyes vinario first sustained the warriors rage the beauteous darling of his fathers age his tender arm the deadly spear arrests and tore his shoulder from his ivory breast too late his friends to his assistance run for his black eyes no more behold the sun miranthus next did his bright lance extend a blustering soldier and lycanders friend him merias met old merianders heir the youthful husband of lycosia fair now born untimely from his fathers side his smiling fortunes and his lovely bride just at his hip the steel an entrance found and tore his bowels with a ghastly wound back fell the youth his tinkling arms reply loud shrieks and clamours rend the frighted sky polyphon now with deadly anguish stung his ready javelin at the victor flung the erring weapon with a whistling sound flew over his head and ploughd the distant ground enraged to see the bloodless point descend and miss the vengeance for his bleeding friend his shining eyes that did with fury glow he turned and thus defied the stronger foe hope not for conquest mighty clown he cries from thy stern visage and gigantick size a little arm if heaven direct the blow may send thee howling to the shades below slave cries miranthus with a stormy glare go wash thy face and curl thy waving hair thy coward heart belies thy daring tongue he spoke and drove his weighty spear along the failing mischief on the buckler sung not so polyphon sent his faithful dart the speedy vengeance reached the heros heart down fell the knight his clanging arms rebound and his proud soul came rushing through the wound lycander saw but turned his eyes away where in the dust the mighty soldier lay then like a whirlwind rushed the youth along and sought his brother in the hostile throng polyphons spear his frantic hand arrests and hurled the weapon at its owners breast the missive death deceived his bloody hand its thirsty point lay shivered in the sand suspense and horror held the martial crew and the sick moon received a paler hue the stars retired from the hated sight and wrapped their glories in the clouds of night polyphon cried o stay thy hostile arm the name of brother wears a potent charm our mother did in youths fair bloom expire and left us infants to our tender sire and till sophinia blew this deadly flame our fears were equal and our hopes the same the same our pleasures and the like our woes we slept together and as fondly rose then let o let not murderous rage divide our hearts but lay those threatening arms aside let rancrous hate possess our souls no more thou to her friends the beauteous maid restore then let her voice our rival cause decide and him she favors wed the smiling bride he said but rage had stopped lycanders ears base slave he cried thou child of puny fears not laons son thy soul disclaim her race my mother never produced a thing so base some fairy elf or treacherous nurse beguiled my sleeping parents of their lawful child then in his place her dunghill offspring laid and my young brother to her hut conveyed this was thy mother coarser than her fate and thou the son of her plebeian mate here ceased the youth  for actions spoke the rest and hurled a javelin at polyphons breast his shield received it with a smart rebound the missive weapon trembled on the ground now hand to hand the rival youths engage lycander burned with more than mortal rage black fury rolled in each relentless eye both fought to conquer or resolved to die but now lycander though with hate inspired by fits was fainting and by fits respird polyphons sword a fatal passage found beneath his arm a deep and ghastly wound staggring he dropped and grasped the bloody ground yet as he lived without a groan he fell nor drew a sigh but only cried it is well it is well my fury with my life shall end farewell my brother and at last my friend by our dear parent see me quickly laid be thine the conquest thine the beauteous maid he paused and then with feebler accent cries my friends farewell and closed his swimming eyes the mourning victor bending over the slain essayed to raise him but essayed in vain his failing arms resigned their feeble hold and drops of horror from his temples rolled from each cold cheek the blushing beauty flies and the ground danced before his dazzld eyes the weeping youth with friendly force divide the gentle mourner from his brothers side then friends and foes united gather round and lift the bleeding body from the ground some raise the drooping head and others pressed their careful arms around his manly breast though with black dust and hostile crimson stained its native fierceness still the face retained back on his shoulders fell his graceful hair and the grand features wore a scornful air now all too late the rash adventure blame pale conquest sighed and loathed her hated name from the black towers their solemn steps return and both the victors and the vanquished mourn the question occasioned by a serious admonition is mirth a crime instruct me you that know or should these eyes with tears eternal flow no let ye powers let this bosom find lifes one grand comfort a contented mind preserve this heart and may it find no room for pale despondence or unpleasing gloom too well the mischief and the pangs we know of doubtful musing and prophetic woe but now these evils for a moment rest and brighter visions please the quiet breast where sprightly health its blessed cordial pours and cheerful thought deceives the gliding hours then let me smile and trifle while i may yet not from virtue nor from reason stray from hated slander i would keep my tongue my heart from envy and from guilt my song natures large volume with attention read its god acknowledge and believe my creed through weakness not impiety offend but love my parent and esteem my friend if like the most my undistinguished days deserve not much of censure or of praise if my still life like subterraneous streams glides unobserved nor tainted by extremes nor dreadful crime has stained its early page to hoard up terrors for reflecting age let me enjoy the sweet suspense of woe when heaven strikes me i shall own the blow till then let me indulge one simple hour like the pleased infant over a painted flower idly it is true but guiltlesly the time is spent in trifling with a harmless rhyme heroic virtue asks a noble mind a judgment strong and passions well refined but if that virtues measured by the will it is surely something to abstain from ill the sacrifice an epistle to celia if you dear celia cannot bear the low delights that others share if nothing will your palate fit but learning eloquence and wit why you may sit alone i ween till youre devoured with the spleen but if variety can please with humble scenes and careless ease if smiles can banish melancholy or whimsy with its parent folly if any joy in these there be i dare invite you down to me you know these little roofs of mine are always sacred to the nine this day we make a sacrifice to the parnassian deities which i am ordered by apollo to show you in the words that follow as first we purge the hallowed room with soft utensil called a broom and next for you a throne prepare which vulgar mortals call a chair while zephyrs from an engine blow and bid the sparkling cinders glow then gather round the mounting flames the priestess and assembled dames while some inferior maid shall bring clear water from the bubbling spring shut up in vase of sable dye secure from each unhallowed eye fine wheaten bread you next behold like that which homer sings of old and by some unpolluted fair it must be scorched with wondrous care so far it is done and now behold the sacred vessels  not of gold of polished earth must they be formed with painting curiously adorned these rites are past and now must follow the grand libation to apollo of juices drawn from magic weeds and pith of certain indian reeds for flower of milk the priestess calls her voice reechoes from the walls with hers the sister voices blend and with the odorous steam ascend each fair one now a sibyl grows and every cheek with ardour glows and though not quite beside their wits are seized with deep prophetic fits some by mysterious figures show that celia loves a shallow beau and some by signs and hints declare that damon will not wed ziphair their neighbors fortunes each can tell so potent is the mighty spell this is the feast and this my friend are you commanded to attend yes at your peril but adieu i have tired both myself and you the power of beauty o goddess of eternal smiles bright cythera the fair who taught sabinas pleasing wiles by which she won bellair bellair the witty and the vain who laughed at beautys power but now the conquered humble swain adores a painted flower with delias art my song inspire whose lips of rosy hue can never the partial audience tire though wiser claudias do though claudias wit and sense refined flows easy from her tongue her soul but coarsly is enshrined so claudias in the wrong hark delia speaks  that blooming fair see crowds are gathering round with open mouths and wildly stare to catch the empty sound see lelia with a judgment clear with manly wisdom blessed wit learning prudence all appear in that unruffled breast but yet no beau for lelia dies no sonnets pave her way say muse from whence these evils rise why lelias teeth decay then why do reverend sages rail at womans wanton pride if wisdom wit and prudence fail let meaner arts be tried those arts to please are only meant but with an angry frown the queen of wisdom lately sent this proclamation down minerva with the azure eyes and thus the statute runs if you would have your daughters wise take care to mend your sons the death of abel when from the shade of edens blissful bowers its fruit ambrosial and immortal flowers our general mother who too soon rebelled was with the partner of her crime expelled to fields less fruitful  where the rugged soil with thorns and thistles often paid their toil where the pale flowers soon lost their cheerful hue and rushing tempests over the mountains flew two sons the matron in her exile bore unlike in feature but their natures more the eldest youth for husbandry renowned tore up the surface of the steril ground his nervous arms for rugged tasks were formed his cheek but seldom with a smile adorned drops raised by labor down his temples run his temples tarnishd by the midday sun robust of body and of soul severe unknown to pity and the like to fear not so his brother cast in fairer mold was he  and softer than his fleecy fold fair were his cheeks that blushed with rosy dye peace dwelt for ever in his cheerful eye nor guilt nor rage his gentle spirit knew sweet were his slumbers for his cares were few those were to feed and watch the tender lamb and seek fresh pasture for its bleating dam from burning suns his thirsty flocks to hide and seek the vales where limpid rivers glide twas ere rude hands had reaped the waving grain when plenty triumphed on the fertile plain that to the center of a pleasant down where half was pasture half a plenteous brown these youths repaired both emulous of fame and raised an altar to jehovahs name with heart elate and selfpresuming eye first to the pile unhappy cain drew nigh choice was his offering yet no sign appeared no flame was seen nor voice celestial heard astonished stood the late presumptuous man then came his brother with a trembling lamb his god accepts the sacrifice sincere the flames propitious round the slain appear the curling smoke ascended to the skies this cain beheld and rolled his glowing eyes stung to the soul he with his frantic hand a stone uprooted from the yielding sand nor spoke  for rage had stopped his failing tongue the heavy death impetuous whirled along this abel met  his heart received the wound amazed he fell and grasped the bloody ground the gentle spirit sprung to endless day and left behind her case of beauteous clay pale stood the brother  to a statue chilled a conscious horror through his bosom thrilled his frighted eyes abhorred the beams of light and longed to find a neverceasing night shocked at the sight of murder first begun down the steep heavens rolled the radiant sun old night assuming her appointed sway stretched her black mantle over the face of day now for their leader mourned the bleating lambs that roved neglected by their pensive dams the careful parents search the fields around they call  the woods roll back an empty sound within a forests solitary gloom slept gentle abel in a secret tomb and there beneath a cypress shade reclined cain breathed his sorrows to the rushing wind that in the branches made a doleful sound twas silence else and horrid darkness round when lo a sudden and a piercing ray oerspread the forest with a blaze of day and then descended on the hallowed ground a seraph with empyreal glory crowned afflicted cain that knew not where to fly gazed on the vision with distracted eye when thus the angel  why these mournful cries these loud complaints that pierce the nightly skies lie not to heaven but directly say where roves thy brother where does abel stray he said  and thus the guilty wretch returned o sacred guardian i for abel mourned i never beheld him since the day began  but why this visit to a simple man thus the celestial  wretch can thou presume thy brothers blood may slumber in its tomb or thou may ward off vengeance with a lie and dare attempt deceiving god most high but now thy doom o wretched mortal hear the fleeting hours nor the rolling year to thee nor joy nor cheerful ease shall bring alike to thee the winter and the spring still vexed with woe thy heavy days shall fly beneath a radiant or a gloomy sky cursed shall thou be amidst thy vagrant band and cursed the labors of thy guilty hand he ceased  but cain all prostrate on the ground still in his ears retained the dreadful sound at length he rose and trembling thus began this is too much  too much for mortal man the mighty debt o let me quickly pay and sweep me instant from the beams of day the yet unborn that i am cursed shall know and all shall hate me to augment the blow even my own sons if such are given to be the death of abel shall revenge on me thus he to change the dreadful sentence tried thus the seraphick messenger replied this mark o cain i fix upon thy brow and thus by heavens mighty monarch vow who sheds thy blood that criminal shall be cursed  sevn times cursed and wretched more than thee thus be that mortal who shall tear the rod of scorching vengeance from the hand of god that man may learn to fear the king of kings he said  and waving his immortal wings that instant mingled with the starry train and darkness wrapped the silent shades again jobs curse and his appeal taken out of job chap i and xxxi let not that day in circling moments run when first these eyes beheld the odious sun let his gay beams forsake the mourning fields and starting backward roll his flaming wheels let sulphurous hail descend in baneful showers and horrid darkness mix the jumbling hours let trembling mortals gaze in vain for light cursed be the day and doubly cursed the night thou my great judge these imprecations hear and rend her minutes from the rolling year to the sad skies be every star denied while scorching plagues on quivering meteors ride let the black air no melting music know but ring with horror and complaints of woe through the grim shade let grisly terrors run and weeping sorrows that abhor the sun let paleeyd specter burst their yawning tombs and dreadful echos shake the hideous gloom the lowering east pour down a lashing storm nor through her gates admit the struggling morn let the dark hours no lively breaking see because they gave these ceaseless tears to me as others have alas why could not i yield my short being and an infant die why was a mothers care indulged to me and why supported on her friendly knee why did i in her tender bosom grow a fostered subject of impending woe did friendly death my marble limbs enchain this bleeding heart would know no smarting pain then lasting sleep would seal my shaded eyes where frozen pride and conquered vengeance lies there weary slaves forgotten rest may find and injured orphans leave their tears behind tyrannick rage must in the grave subside where starving wretches find their wants supplyd thrice happy rest o why to me denied life still will hover round despairing slaves who slight her favors and would court their graves death gliding by us shows his grizly charms but the coy phantom mocks our reaching arms he flies the dungeons of entreating woe and strikes the prosperous with unwelcome blow to blooming youth his partial arrows fly over withered mendicants that vainly try to meet the fatal shaft and only wish to die when darkness sits as regent of the skies and round my bed redoubled horrors rise till night grows hideous with my constant cries my tortured limbs with ceaseless pangs are torn but yet i live to see returning morn the piercing sun thrusts in a spiteful ray to wound my eyelids with unwelcome day tyrannick death whom trembling mortals flee the prince of ills to every wretch but me plays with the torments of my struggling heart and over my bosom shakes his lingering dart o sacred judge when will thy wrath be done why do i live to scare the wondering sun let not thy mercy spare my wounded clay but strike and sweep me from offensive day my heart is vexed with consuming fears and nourished only with continual tears close at my heels pursue a meagre train of pining sickness and distorting pain paleeyd confusion with dishiveld hair and wild impatience leading on despair did i with crimes profane my days of rest did ever presumption swell my rising breast did guilty flame my tainted soul surprise or snares of beauty catch my wandering eyes if ever injustice swelled my spreading lands if ever oppression stained my guiltless hands then let my god his flaming vengeance throw renew my plagues and double every woe did ever my servants of their lord complain did humble rhetoric ever plead in vain in vain to me did helpless widows cry or at my gate neglected orphans lie no their glad eyes my plenteous table knew and with my own the fostered infants grew was ever my portals barred against the poor did not the stranger bless my friendly door though cold and hungry in my courts he mourned joyful and full the smiling wretch returned when every good obeyed my lordly will did i by fraud my glittering coffers fill did i by fraud increase the tempting store or dote too fondly on the shining ore did restless envy in my bosom roll or lurking malice blot my tainted soul no  this fond heart has bled for distant woe and learned compassion for a sinking foe did ever my soul from its creator run to painted idols or the beaming sun or to the moon my wavering senses yield when her pale rays adorned the glistring field yet stay presumptuous wretch nor urge too far thy doubtful sentence at the dreadful bar what melting rhetrick or what potent friend at heavens tribunal shall thy cause defend where smothered evils hid from mortal eye mature and open to omniscience lie the tale of cushi from ii samuel chap xviii how fares my son the trembling monarch cried why would thou ask afflicted cush replied a fate like his may all that hate thee feel whose blood alas has stained the guilty steel he fell beneath the hand of davids friend but to my story let my lord attend when the pale morning showed her languid face and the dim sun began his usual race whose sullen orb received a crimson dye and tempests hovered in the frowning sky as though the heavens wept a mortals fate and nature trembled at domestic hate within the shade of ephraims dusky wood in just array the meeting armies stood the frowning hosts with equal fury glow and each to death defied his meeting foe all tender thoughts were lost in horrid rage and with a shout the charging hosts engage then clouds of arrows hide the darkened sky and hissing lances lighten as they fly dreadful the sight and horrid was the cry here groaned a steed that felt its smarting wound and there a soldier pinioned to the ground at length proud israel began to fail our juster cause could over their strength prevail the vanquished army raised a fearful cry and through the wood their mighty numbers fly there horrid brambles tore their wounds anew and thousand deaths their flying heels pursue then raged our general through the dreadful gloom pale terror hovered on his waving plume from his known spear the shrieking numbers run and from his fury fled your conquered son grim danger urged him on with fatal speed and through black shades he lashed the weary steed in the dark center of this forest stood a lofty oak which overlooked the wood through its thick arms he ventured careless in they springing caught him by the beauteous chin his curling locks among the branches flew his spirit fails him and his foes pursue around in vain he cast a mournful eye and wished a friend for none alas was nigh but hostile shouts invade his frighted ears and soon beneath him shone a grove of spears now traitor fall  our mighty leader cries while glowing vengeance sparkld in his eyes then stepped a captain of the loyal band and vainly strove to stay his fatal hand that cruel arm impelled the flying dart and the keen weapon sunk within his heart then those fair cheeks resigned their rosy dye yet life a moment struggled in his eye as from so fair a mansion loath to fly till the red torrent stained his throbbing tide then with a groan the beauteous rebel died hold  stop thy story  cries the weeping king thy horrid tale has left a mortal sting my soul though practiced in the paths of woe grows sick and staggers at this mighty blow from its cold fountain life forgets to run oh absalom  oh absalom my son eternal shade has sealed thy cheerful eyes and on the ground thy breathless beauty lies cursed be the hand that all my hopes beguiled and left a parent to lament his child without a tear let none his story tell but curse the forest where my darling fell while these wan eyes with lasting sorrows run lost to the world and strangers to the sun let milder songs attend his noontide ray for mine will best become the closing day while round my lyre afflicted fathers throng and orphans listen to the mournful song proserpines ragout as once grave pluto drove his royal wheels over the large confines of the stygian fields with kingly port he sat and by his side rode his fair captive now his awful bride but from the lakes a sulfurous mist invades and strikes the fainting empress of the shades the trembling queen is seized with sickly yawns with griping colicks and with feverish qualms back to the palace was the general cry before the lash her sable coursers fly there rests the dame and sought her royal bed where the soft pillows raised her drooping head restoring lenitives were sought in vain to cool her vitals and assuage her pain on nothing would the peevish matron feed then useful mercury was called with speed and sent on earth some curious dish to frame of light digestion for the sickly dame to earth he posted where he quickly found proper ingredients on our fertile ground here first he seized as nonsubstantial foods the courtiers friendship and the zeal of prudes the sighs of widowers and blends with those the vows of lovers and the brains of beaux the misers charity the drunkards cares the wealth of poets and the tears of heirs philanders patience when his lord denies the frowns of celia when her heart complies then with a breath along the air he drives the love of husbands and the charms of wives where trifles dwell sagacious hermes knew the winged youth to lordly senates flew from thence debates and long harangues to cull and steeped them softly in a statesmans skull and now the frothy dish began to seem a proper viand for his sickly queen to crown the rest he met by lucky chance the wit of england and the truth of france the charms of anthony ye swains attend let every nymph be near be still ye rivers that the swains may hear ye winds be calm and brush with softer wing we mean the charms of anthony to sing see all around the listening shepherds throng o help ye sisters of immortal song lucy sing phebe sing what shepherd rules the plain young colins envy and amindas pain whom none can rival when he mows the field and to whose flute the nightingale must yield  phebe it is anthony  it is he deserves the lay as mild as evening and as morning gay not the fresh blooms on yonder codlingtree nor the white hawthorn half so fair as he nor the young daisy dressed in morning dew nor the pea blossom wears a brighter hue  lucy none knows like him to strew the wheaten grain or drive the ploughshare over the fertile plain to raise the sheaves or reap the waving corn or mow brown stubble in the early morn  phebe how mild the youth when on a sultry day in yonder vale we turned the fragrant hay how on his voice the listening shepherds hung not tuneful stella half so sweetly sung  lucy whether he binds the sheaf in twisted band or turns the pitchfork on his nimble hand he is sure to win a glance from every eye while clumsy colin stands neglected by  phebe his curling locks by far more lovely show than the white wig on squire foplings brow and when the shepherd on a rainy day weaves for his hat a wisp of flowery hay the scarlet feather not so gay appears which on his crown sir ambrose fino wears  lucy for anthony meriah leaves her cow and stands to gape at him upon the mow

him from the door i thought the damsel would have spoke no more  lucy me once he met twas when from yonder vale each morn i brought the heavy milking pail he took it from my head and with a smile reached out his hand and helped me over the style  phebe as i was dancing late amongst the crew a yellow pippin over my head he threw sue bit her lips and barbaretta frowned and phillis looked as though she would have swoond  thus sung the maids till colinet came by and rodrigo from weeding of the rye each took his lass and sped em to the town to drink cool cider at the hare and hound the damsels simper like the sparkling beer and colin shines till anthony is near on the death of a justly admired author when paleeyd winter rules the mourning fields and shivering nature to his scepter yields dejected earth is stripped of all her pride and sculking flowers in her bosom hide through naked groves afflicted warblers fly and storms of hail come rattling through the sky but when soft april lifts her downy wing and calls the blushing infants of the spring the verdant groves their wonted charms regain and laughing nature paints the gaudy plain sweetscented vilets take their usual blue and the fair primrose drinks the morning dew again revive their beauty and their smell but man once blasted takes a long farewell ah silly muse thy fond complaints give over departed sylvius shall return no more no charms of verse can win the heavenly mind back to the slighted case she left behind not though each line should make our bosoms glow like his grand numbers and as sweetly flow his name shall last to warm a distant age nor want the assistance of a title page for his bright lines are by their luster known even homer shines with beauties not his own unpolished souls like codrus or like mine filled with ideas that but dimly shine read over the charms of his instructive pen and taste of raptures never known till then ill nature listened and approved the song and blushing envy checked her burning tongue happy are those though grief their hours attend whom once he honored with the name of friend whose pleasing thoughts at least may ponder over the smiling days that shall return no more even we condemned at distance to admire bewail the hopes that with our guide expire ah who shall now our rustic thoughts refine and to grave sense and solid learning join wit ever sparkling and the sweets of rhyme farewell ye themes which none but he can sing and sylvan scenes that wear eternal spring fair nymphs that in his fairer paintings glow and ye smooth lines that sylvius taught to flow but hush sad muse thy dull complaint give over hence sigh in secret and his loss deplore who never o never shall grace our regious more an epitaph now triumph death for here lies slain more worth than crowns can buy celestial zephyrs waft her soul back to its native sky who now shall charm where flavia once her cheerful smiles bestowed when pleasing candor swelled her breast and in her aspect glowed now to that heaven where virtue shines with an eternal blaze her lofty soul has winged its flight and left this earthly maze so from the smiling infants hand we force the costly gem which he not knowing how to prize might to the dust condemn on winter what pictures now shall wanton fancy bring or how the muse to artemisia sing now shivering nature mourns her ravished charms and sinks supine in winters frozen arms no gaudy banks delight the ravished eye but northern breezes whistle through the sky no joyful choirs hail the rising day but the froze crystal wraps the leafless spray brown look the meadows that were late so fine and capd with ice the distant mountains shine the silent linnet views the gloomy sky sculks to his hawthorn nor attempts to fly then heavy clouds send down the feathered snow through naked trees the hollow tempests blow the shepherd sighs but not his sighs prevail to the soft snow succeeds the rushing hail and these white prospects soon resign their room to melting showers or unpleasing gloom the nymphs and swains their aching fingers blow shun the cold rains and bless the kinder snow while the faint travelers around them see here seas of mud and there a leafless tree no budding leaves nor honeysuckles gay no yellow crowfoots paint the dirty way the lark sits mournful as afraid to rise and the sad finch his softer song denies poor daggled ursla stalks from cow to cow who to her sighs return a mournful low while their full udders her broad hands assail and her sharp nose hangs dropping over the pail with garments trickling like a shallow spring and his wet locks all twisted in a string afflicted cymon waddles through the mire and rails at winfred creeping over the fire say gentle muses say is this a time to sport with poesy and laugh in rhyme while the chilled blood that has forgot to glide steals through its channels in a lazy tide and how can phoebus who the muse refines smooth the dull numbers when he seldom shines mira to octavia fair one to you this monitor i send octavia pardon your officious friend you think your conduct merits only praise but outlawed poets censure whom they please thus we begin  your servant has been told that you despising settlements and gold determine florio witty young and gay to have and hold for ever and for ay and view that person as your mortal foe who dares object against your charming beau but now to furnish meter for my song let us suppose octavia may be wrong it is true youre lovely yet the learned aver that even beauties like the rest may err i know to shun you hold it as a rule the arrant coxcomb and the stupid fool no such is florio he has wit  it is true enough octavia to impose on you yet such a wit you will by experience find worse than a fool that is complaisant and kind it only serves to gild his vices over and teach his malice how to wound the more i need not tell you most ingenious fair that hungry mortals are not fed with air but solid food and this voracious clay asks drink and victuals more than once a day now could your florio by his wit inspire the chilly hearth to blaze with lasting fire or when his children round the table throng by an allusion or a sprightly song adorn the board in the twinkling of an eye with a hot pasty or a warden pie there might be reason on octavias side and not a sage could blame the prudent bride yet or some authors often deal in lies lovers may live on nuts and blackberries for roving knights bewildered in their way who in black forests half a season stray unless they find provision on the trees must sup on grass and breakfast on the breeze but as you have long been used to nicer fare your constitution would but hardly bear such food as this and therefore i advise that you would consider for youre mighty wise if sober dusterandus would not make a better husband than your darling rake grave dusterandus he whose steadfast mind is yet untainted though not much refined whose soul never roves beyond his native fields nor asks for joys but what his pasture yields on lifes dull cares with patience can attend a gentle master and a constant friend who in soft quiet spends the guiltless days his servants blessing and his neighbors praise say would you in his happy mansion reign toast of the village and the rural plain with honest friends your cheerful days beguile while peace and plenty on your table smile or cold and hungry writhe your tired jaws and dine with florio upon hips and haws in troth i think there is little room to pause in spite of all romantic poets sing this gold my dearest is an useful thing not that i would have you hoard the precious store for not a wretch is like the miser poor enjoy your fortune with a cheerful mind and let the blessing spread amongst the kind but if there is none but florio that will do write ballads both and you may thrive  adieu the setting sun to silvia see silvia see the sparkling lamp of day from our fond eyes he draws the trembling ray the curling clouds pursue his shortning beams and catch new colors from the parting gleams from marshy vales unhealthy fogs arise and gloomy vapors fill the mourning skies a creeping mist oerspreads the silent field and drooping flowers their evening incense yield on every leaf the pearly drops appear and nature weeps an universal tear so will it be when those fair suns of thine by fate eclipsed their cheerful beams resign when the just heavens remand their beauteous store and silvias eyes must cheer the world no more death may forbid those dazzling orbs to roll but cannot strip the radiance from thy soul amid the stars in spite of fate or time the charms of silvia shall eternal shine an epitaph a heart to mercy as to zeal inclined as well a gentle as a prudent mind still free to pardon cautious to offend a tender parent and a faithful friend all parts performed she willingly withdrew turned from the world and bid her friends adieu ah thou if spirits or regard or know the sigh of friendship or a daughters woe mixed with those tears that wash the sacred shrine accept the tribute of a grateful line on sickness when heavens almighty king prepares the angry shaft to throw even fortitude itself despairs to bear the deadly blow cold tremors shake each fainting limb that weeps a sickly dew the features changed to pale and dim resign their cheerful hue no more soft eloquence shall flow nor dress the silent tongue but the dull heart refuse to glow though charmed by melting song those laughing eyes that lately shone so sprightly and so gay sunk down with sickness faint and wan decline the piercing day and scarcely bear a cheerful beam to light the drooping soul while round the weak afflicted brain romantic vapors roll deceitful earth and all its joys elude our grasping hands though nature all her skill employs to bind the failing bands death drives us to the horrid steep and while we vainly mourn he pointing shows thunmeasurd deep from whence we never return there the grim spectre with a smile his panting victim sees who fain would linger here a while to swallow nauseous lees who deaths great empire would dispute and hugs the gilded pill not knowing that his faithful mute whose business is to kill the lost the slippery hold to save to lenient arts we run they cast us headlong on the wave and we are twice undone the power who stamped the reasoning mind its partner can restore there we a lasting cordial find and learn to sigh no more but if the slowconsuming ill should lead us to the grave our faith persuades us that he will the trembling spirit save o thou whose bounty all things taste whose anger none can bear revive the melancholy breast nor let the wretch despair to a gentleman with a manuscript play as some grave matron bred on rural downs who at the mention of a topknot frowns and the proud minxes of the market towns whose humble senses are not much refined but used to labor with a cheerful mind clad in plain coifs and gown of russet hue with homespun aprons of a decent blue from the white curds extracts the greener whey nor dreams of fashion poetry or play from wicked verse she turns her cautious eyes and wonders people can delight in lies at length her landlord the right noble squire takes her young daughter at her own desire prefers the damsel to attend his spouse and she with joy resigns her brindld cows for london now prepares the smiling dame while her sad mother trembles at the name but o what griefs attend the parting leave no muse can paint em nor no heart conceive in vain her spouse or friendly neighbor tries to quell the sorrows in her streaming eyes rossell she fears will slight her jersey gown and wear white aprons in the sinful town on the pure ghost of winfred then she calls to guard her child within its guilty walls so this rude babe i to your mercy yield rough as the soil of some untillagd field can nature please  not till she is well refined reforming art should follow close behind but that proud dame with me disdains to dwell and far she flies  ah far from miras cell what then remains what hope for me or mine but the kind silence of forgetful time to save us from the sly buffooning leer the spiteful grimace and the scornful sneer the threatening critic with his dreadful rules the wits keen satire and the burst of fools the wretched villain pinioned up on high two hours pendent twixt the earth and sky with eggs and turnips whirling round his pate is but an emblem of an authors fate a dread example to the rhyming fry so poets tell me but i hope they lie the worlds goodnatured if it is not crossed but wits are often saucy to their cost though unassurd yet not in deep despair i trust this infant to its patrons care ah let your roofs the simple vagrants shield i ask no more than charity may yield some little corner in the friendly dome lest the loose varlet be induced to roam where the cold storms may hover round in vain the chilling snow or penetrating rain where the fierce rat all dreadful never climbs nor the sleek mouse sad foe to miras rhymes but i have done  for who implores a friend with long petitions justly may offend to no strait bounds goodnature is confined and who shall dictate to a generous mind which not content in narrow space to roll like the broad ocean spreads from pole to pole while the glad nations bless the ample tide and wafted treasures over its surface glide that still waves on regardless of their praise as you perhaps of miras idle lays silvia and the be as silvia in her garden strayed where each officious rose to welcome the approaching maid with fairer beauty glows transported from their dewy beds the new blown lilies rise gay tulips wave their shining heads to please her brighter eyes a be that sought the sweetest flower to this fair quarter came soft humming round the fatal bower that held the smiling dame he searched the opening buds with care and flew from tree to tree but silvia finding none so fair unwisely fixed on thee her hand obedient to her thought the river did destroy and the slain insect dearly bought its momentary joy but now too rash unthinking maid consider what you have done perhaps you in the dust have laid a fair and hopeful son or from his friends and senate wise have swept a valued peer whose life that you so lightly prize was to his country dear then silvia cease your anger now to this your guiltless foe and smooth again that gentle brow where lasting lilies blow soft cynthio vows when you depart the sun withdraws its ray that nature trembles like his heart and storms eclipse the day amintor swears a morning suns less brilliant than your eyes and though his tongue at random runs you seldom think he lies they tell you those soft lips may vie with pinks at opening day and yet you slew a simple fly for proving what they say believe me not a bud like thee in this fair garden blows then blame no more the erring be who took you for the rose the cruel parent a dream twas when the sun had his swift progress made and left his empire to the queen of shade bright cynthia too with her refulgent train shot their pale luster over the dewy plain sat lonely mira with her head reclined and mourned the sorrows of her helpless kind then to her fancy celias woes appear the nymph whose tale deserves a pitying tear whose early beauties met a swift decay a rose that faded at the rising day while grief and shame oppressed her tender age pursued by famine and a fathers rage till too much thought the aching heart oppressed and miras eyelids closed in silent rest then active fancy with her airy train composed the substance of the ensuing dream in a black shade my wandering self i found a wood encircld by a thorny bound where oaks upraisd their kingly heads on high and the pleased linnets through the branches fly there lofty elms the wondering skies invade and the dark cypress cast a browner shade grave laurels there the humbler shrubs oerlook there the pale ash and there the poplar shook here pliant elder whom her fruits adorn and the brown hasel wove with shagged thorn rude briers there their clasping tendrels twine whose rugged arms with useless roses shine beyond the confines of the dusky brake a plain was bounded with a putrid lake where planks of timber stretched on mouldering beams formed a weak passage over the standing streams whose slimy waters to its arches clung where wrapped in weeds the clodded vermin hung on this brown plain surrounded by the wood and the green lake  an aged castle stood whose iron gates were strictly shut to all and frowning roofs hung over the crumbling wall here perched revenge and everwasting care and melancholy with dishiveld hair before the portals wait a grisly band fraud with a pencil in her shaking hand long scrolls of parchment at her feet were laid behind her shoulder stood her ghastly maid oppreffion named  and stretched her filthy claw and next pale avarice with insatiate maw two cumbrous bags his twining arms infold of cankered silver and of useless gold grimly he stands and by his side appears fierce cruelty all drenched in orphans tears within attended by relentless hate suspicion squinted through the barbarous grate to these rude doors approached with bashful mien soft celia once the brightest of the plain but now the roses from her cheeks were flown nor could the fair one by her charms be known those charms are now in sable weeds arrayed her arm supported by a mournful maid from her wan eyes the tears incessant flow and all her form was penitence and woe but see lysegus her relentless sire whose eye balls sparkld with disdainful ire his potent hand the sounding locks obey with grating noise the horrid gates gave way then prostrate at his feet the damsel lay three times to speak the lovely mourner tried thrice on her lips the fainting murmurs died sigh follows sigh and tear succeeds to tear at length she cried  ah may lysegus hear if nature or if penitence may sue ah let my sorrows find relief from you the nightly stars my constant wailings know the rising sun is witness to my woe but who shall paint what wretched celia feels while shame and famine hunt her flying heels the fools deride me and the virtuous shun then to the fields and lonely shades i run yet find no comfort from the lonely shade at my approach the blossoms seem to fade i fly to wilds unknown to human kind but cannot leave my hated self behind and am  oh am i  by my parent cursed of all my woes the deepest and the worst she said  lysegus answered in a rage hence vile disturber of my luckless age think not by tears this stubborn heart to win nor jar my senses with thy hateful din go learn of vagrants fit companions go their arts of stealing and their whine of woe yet when before the gate of pride you stand and crave your morsel at the porters hand may some stern slave prevent the coming prize thrown to the dogs before thy longing eyes he ceased  but celia views no more the sun for now her sorrow with her life was done her eyes no more afford their lucid streams nor the pulse struggles in her quiet veins the tyrant viewed her with a ghastly look his heart beat heavy and his sinews shook when lo a spectre horrible to view rose quick as vapors of a morning dew whose presence cast unpleasing darkness round a cypress wreath his faded temples crowned strange forms were painted on his sable robe one hand extended bore a crystal globe where the pale sinner might his picture find yet not his features but his darker mind in vain to shun the faithful glass he tries it plays unasked before his aching eyes his quick left hand with this performed its part his right was dreadful with a poisoned dart then with a loud and horrid voice he cried lysegus mourn thy cruelty and pride from the fair court of equity i came called by thy sins and conscience is my name this venomed dart shall now thy entrails tear and teach thy eyes to know the melting tear prepare thy spirits for their weight of woe with celias name i arm the dreadful blow he said and struck  the visionary dart sought the dark bottom of lysegus heart he fell  and falling raised a fearful cry then mira woke and found the morning sky a request to the divine being i thou great and sacred lord of all of life the only spring creator of nunumberd worlds immensely glorious king ii whose image shakes the staggring mind beyond conception high crowned with omnipotence and veiled with dark eternity iii drive from the confines of my heart impenitence and pride nor let me in erroneous paths with thoughtless idiots glide iv whatever thy alldiscerning eye sees for thy creature fit i will bless the good and to the ill contentedly submit v with humane pleasure let me view the prosperous and the great malignant envy let me fly with odious selfconceit vi let not despair nor cursed revenge be to my bosom known oh give me tears for others woe and patience for my own vii feed me with necessary food i ask not wealth nor fame but give me eyes to view thy works and sense to praise thy name viii and when thy wisdom thinks it sit to shake my troubled mind preserve my reason with my griefs and let me not repine ix may my still days obscurely pass without remorse or care and let me for the parting hour my trembling ghost prepare finis
