an answer to some objections of a moderate enquirer robert snow we received a paper subscribed by thee and directed to the church or people of god called quakers etc which paper contains some objections which thou say thou have heard spoken against us and wherein thou desire to be satisfied to which we say it is no strange thing to us to be spoken against by the worlds teachers that being no more than befell the people of god in the first breaking forth of christianity in the world of whom it was said acts       as concerning this sect we know that every where it is spoken against but we are willing to endeavor thy satisfaction by answering the objections  the first is you own no day either the first or last as a sabbath to the gentiles  answer the sabbath which was the seventh or last day of the week was given to the jews ex       romans     not to the gentiles psalm         0 romans      and was to last as other typical ordinances were until the time of reformation heb    0 till the seed should come gal      which was christ ver    the lord of the sabbath mat      who in the fullness of time did blot out the handwriting of ordinances etc and took it out the way nailing it to his cross col      from whence the apostle thus infers let no man therefore judge you the saints and faithful brethren col     in meat or in drink or in respect of an holy day or of the new moon or of the sabbath days col      which says he are a shadow of things to come but the body is of christ ver    thus was that sabbath which was given by god to his people the jews ended and taken away by christ before the gentiles were called to be his people and as for the first day of the week we do not read in the holy scriptures that it is called the sabbath day or commanded to be kept and observed for a sabbath as the seventh day had been but on the contrary we find the apostle paul writing to the romans who were gentiles though not without some mixture of believing jews amongst them as appears acts      says one man esteems one day above another there was the believing jew another esteems every day alike there was the believing gentile well what then does he commend the former of these and condemn the latter no but he says let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind romans      and in the   th  0 th and    th verses disswades them from judging one another about the observing or not observing a day as well as about the eating or not eating of meats and seems to lay no more stress upon the one than the other and if the drift of the apostles discourse there be heedfully minded it will appear that as he sets him who believed he might eat all things with him that esteemed every day a like and him that esteemed one day above another with him that eat herbs so he imputes the weakness to the latter ver   and sets himself on the other side saying we then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak chap      and he tells the galatians which though a gentile chureh had also jewish believers in it i am afraid of you lest i have bestowed upon you labor in vain gal      why so ye observe days and months and times and years says he ver  0 so jealous was the apostle lest any that had been gathered from outward observations and from a shadowy state should imbondage themselves again in shadows and fall short of enjoying the substance which is the true gospel rest that remains to the people of god heb     which in the next verse is described to be their ceasing from their own works as god did from his into which rest we says the apostle that have helieved do enter ver   and in the    verse he presses others to labor to enter into that rest now when the apostle says there remains a rest it plainly implies that the former rest the outward sabbatical rest did not remain but was passed away and gone nor is it reasonable to suppose that the rest here mentioned which is said to remain to the people of god was an outward bodily resting from outward bodily labor on what soever day both as that would be but to change one type or figure for another and as the entering into this rest is set forth in the text as a matter of labor and difficulty ver    as it is indeed yet blessed be the lord he has enabled some that have believed in his name and subjected to his power to enter into this rest in this his day and many are pressing after it as the true abiding gospelrest which the legal sabbath was but a type or shadow of  the   objection is you deny the scriptures to be any rule for man or woman to walk by so as to direct them to the saving of their souls  answer in this we are misrepreented we sincerely own love and regard the holy scriptures believing with the apostle that they were given by inspiration of god and are profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of god may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works   timothy         and that they are able to make wise unto salvation through faith that is in christ jesus ver    and great benefit and delight we sind in them reading them in the openings of that divine spirit by which they were given forth we are so far from denying them to be any rule etc that we acknowledge them to contain many excellent rules precepts doctrines and instructions directing man and woman how to walk that they may obtain the salvation of their souls yet we do not say as some have done that the scriptures are the only rule or the chief and principal rule because we dare not give the honor and office of the holy spirit unto the scriptures for the scriptures themselves declare that it is the office of the holy spirit to guide believers into all truth john       and indeed the true meaning and benefit of the scriptures themselves is not attained to in the reading of them unless the spirit that gave them forth do open them and unseal the mysteries contained in them so that the holy spirit is greater than the scriptures and therefore we cannot but give the chief place unto him for he is able to manifest himself unto man and to lead man into the way of salvation either with and by the scriptures or without them as he pleases but the scriptures cannot do that without the operation of the holy spirit justly therefore do we affirm the spirit of god to be the chief rule and yet acknowledge the holy scriptures to be a true rule and proper instrument in the hand of the spirit to direct men and women how they ought to walk to obtain salvation to their souls as the spirit of the lord makes use of the scriptures to that end  the  d objection is you deny the resurrection of this mortal body that this mortal shall not put on immortality  answer in this also we are misrepresented we do not deny but own the resurrection of the dead believing with the apostle that this corruptible shall put on incorruption and this mortal shall put on immortality   cor       and indeed if we did not believe this we might well say as he did if in this life only we have hope in christ we were of all men most miserable ver    and why stand we in jeopardy every hour ver  0 but the lord knows and we have openly and sincerely declared that we believe and own the resurrection of the dead according as the holy scriptures testify concerning it which say thou sowest not that body that shall be but bare grain etc but god gives it a body as it has pleased him and to every seed his own body ver       it is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body ver    the reason of which follows ver  0 namely that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god neither does corruption inherit incorruption and as we firmly believe this so we take this to be sufficient without being so curiously inquisitive as he who would needs ask how are the dead raised up and with what body do they come ver    and was called fool for his pains ver     the  th objection is you suffer women to be your teachers that were forbid by the apostle for he says that they should keep silence  answer the jews of old had a strong persuasion grounded upon some misunderstood places of scripture that the salvation of god was confined to them and belonged not at all to the gentiles and this opinion had prevailed so far upon them that even those of them that received the gospel could not easily shake it off in so much that after peter had been with cornelius the centurion and was come back again to jerusalem he was called before the church for it they that were of the circumcision contending with him and saying thou went in to men uncircumcised and did eat with them act        to whom having related the occasion and particulars of that matter he concludes his defense thus for as much then as god gave them the like gift as he did unto us who believed on the lord jesus christ what was i that i could withstand god ver    and in the next verse it follows when they heard these things they held their peace and glorisied god etc this answer which the apostle gave in that case may be suitable we think for us to give in this case to such as from some misunderstood places of scripture are offended at us for suffering women to speak in our assemblies viz for as much as god has given them the like gift as he did unto us who believed on the lord jesus christ what are we that we should withstand god god by his servant joel in the time of the law had made this promise with relation to the times of the gospel viz and it shall come to pass afterward or in the last days as peter repeats it act      that i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophecy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in these days will i pour out my spirit joel         and they shall prophecy adds peter act      here was no distinction of sex made but this promise of pouring out the spirit and of prophesying thereby is extended as expressly and fully to the daughters as to the sons to the handmaids as to the servants and this the apostle peter does expressly apply to that great pouring forth of the spirit upon the church at the pentecost immediately after christs ascension saying this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel acts      now at that great and eminent pouring forth of the spirit it appears the women were not excluded for when after the ascension the apostles and disciples were returned from mount olivet to jerusalem it is said these all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication with the women and mary the mother of jesus etc acts      the number of the names together being about an hundred and twenty ver    and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one place chap     and in verse   it is said the cloven tongues sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance ver   here was no distinction made no shutting out the women but all were together all received the gift of the spirit and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance nor was it thus only at that time and upon that extraordinary occasion but continued in the church afterward for we read that philip the evangelist had four daughters that did prophesy acts        phebe a woman is recommended by the apostle paul to the church at rome not only as a sister but as a servant of the church romans      priscilla a woman is called by the same apostle my helper or fellow labourer in christ jesus ver   tryphena and tryphosa two godly women are saluted by him as laborers in the lord and of the beloved persis another holy woman he testifies that she labored much in the lord ver    the same apostle in his epistle to the philippians says i entreat thee also true yoke fellow help those women which labored with me in the gospel phil     which is the phrase by which the apostle does frequently express his own ministry and which he particularly applies to timotheus whom he calls our brother and minister of god and our fellow labourer in the gospel of christ   these     which is a clear evidence that those women that had received the gift of prophesy did minister therein to the edification of the church as well as the men nay the apostle paul in that very epistle wherein he is thought by some to discountenance womens preaching does give directions for the manner of their preaching or prophesying viz that they should do it with their heads covered for having first said every man praying or prophesying having his head covered dishonors his head   cor      he adds but every woman that prays or prophesyeth with her head uncovered dishonored her head ver   this puts it out of doubt that womens praying and prophesying in the church was at that time both lawful and usual as well as mens  now that by prophesying here is meant preaching not barely foretelling things to come may not only be inferred from the use of the same word in the verse foregoing where being spoken of men it is granted on all hands to intend preaching and from thence the general practice of mens preaching uncovered is defended but may also fairly be concluded from the explanation the apostle gives of it in chap    ver    where he tells that church in general we may all prophesy one by one that all may learn which manifests that by prophesying he intended preaching or teaching that being the proper way or means of learning and in the beginning of that chapter where he prefers prophesying before speaking whith tongues ver   and   he says he that prophesyeth speaks unto men to edification and exhortation and comfort ver   and he that prophesyeth edifieth the church ver   which plainly show that by prophesying he meant preaching or teaching that being the proper means or way of edifying and therefore seeing he not only allowed women to prophecy but directed and advised them how they should perform it chap      and that in this place prophesying and preaching appear to be one and the same thing it is unreasonable to suppose he denied them the liberty of preaching being gifted and called thereunto as for those words of his   cor       let your women keep silence in the churches sor it is not permitted unto them to speak but to be under obedience as also says the law observe first that those words  as also says the law relate only to the womens being under obedience not to their keeping silence in the church for that was never enjoined them in the law but they were permitted to speak in the congregation and both miriam who was a prophetess did sing the triumphs of the lord in the public congregation ex     0    and deborah who was a prophetess did recount the noble acts of the lord and celebrate his praises in a triumphant song judges   read also what hanna spoke in the house of the lord in shiloh   samuel   and anna who was a prophetess did not only give thanks unto the lord but spoke of christ to all them that looked for redemption in jerusalem luke      this was direct preaching and that in the temple so that the women were not enjoined silence under the law but were permitted to speak in the next place consider what speaking it was that was forbidden by the apostle in that place   cor       which from his following words will appear to be not a speaking of the words of life and salvation not a speaking as the spirit of god gives utterance but speaking disorderly asking questions unseasonably and out of place not speaking for the edification of others but speaking for their own information only for he immediately adds if they will learn any thing let them ask their husbands at home ver    these words  learn and ask plainly show that the speaking here condemned was not a speaking the doctrines of the gospel for the edification of the church but asking questions for their own satisfaction which they might have done at home but not there therefore he adds for it is a shame for women to speak in the church and so indeed it was in such a disorderly manner as they speak to interrogate or catechize either the minister or their husbands openly in the church to ask the meaning of this or call for an explanation of that which might look like a throwing off their obedience to their husband and must needs occasion disorders and confusion in the assembly which we may perceive was the thing that troubled the apostle and which he labored to reform for he said before god is not the author of confusion but of peace ver    and he concludes the chapter with this admonition let all things be done decently and in order so that it was the disorderly practice of some women in that church which he reproves who it seems when any thing was spoken which they did not understand would interpose and ask questions for information sake which was uncomely in them offensive and troublesome to the congregation this sort of speaking was not permitted them but was a shame to them and from which they ought to have kept silence in the church and if they will learn any thing says he let them ask their husbands at home of like import are those other words of the same apostle to timothy and probably on the same occasion let the woman says he learn in silence with all subjection but i suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man but to be in silence   timothy         for hence it appears still that the occasion they took of speaking was under pretense of learning wherein they took an undue liberty to ask questions as if they would catechize or teach their husbands but though the apostle would not suffer such sort of speaking in the church as might give occasion to any to think that the women did cast off the obedience they owed and did usurp authority over their husbands nor after such a manner as might breed confusion in the congregation for he was so watchful against that that he enjoins the man to be silent in that case as well as the woman if any man says he speak in an unknown tongue  let one interpret but if there be no interpreter let him keep silence in the church   cor          yet we have before showed that he allowed of women prophesying and that by prophesying he meant preaching we have also given many instances of women that labored in the work of the gospel in that day and could from a living and sure experience multiply instances of many women in this day whom the lord has committed the word of life and reconciliation unto and who in the quickening power and virtue thereof have sounded forth the same to the awakening of many that were a sleep in sin and turning of many from darkness to light and from the power of satan to god who are now become living seals of their ministry neither would this seem so strange as it does to some did they duly consider that god is no respecter of persons but that as in the old creation male and female were created in the image of god so in the new creation male and female are all one in christ jesus gal      but as they that contended with peter for conversing with the gentiles when they had heard his defense held their peace and glorified god saying then has god also to the gentiles granted repentance unto life acts       so we hope they that have taken offense at us for suffering women to speak in the church when they shall have duly and impartially weighed what is herein offered for their satisfaction will hold their peace as to any opposition thereunto and glorify god saying then has god committed unto women also the word of reconciliation  the fifth objection is you are a people that have gained health to your immortal souls and are sure of heaven when the scriptures say that the righteous man falls seven times a day and the apostle paul said that sin was still actually in him  answer we do not desire to boast of any seize yet we cannot but confess to the glory of god and the praise of his holy name that his saving health has appeared in this his day and we through his mercy have tasted of it christ the savior is manifested in spirit and we through grace have felt the healing virtue of his divine life and power through the tender mercy of our god the dayspring from on high has visited us and has given light to us that sat in darkness and in the shadow of death and has guided our feet into the way of peace and has helped us to make our calling and election sure as for the scripture thou mentionest we do not find that the scripture says the righteous man falls seven times a day but in prove       we find it thus written for a just man falls seven times and rises up again but the wicked shall fall into mischief and as the verse before shows the occasion of these words where it is said lay not wait o wicked man against the dwelling of the righteous spoil not his resting place so the latter part of this   th verse  but the wicked shall fall into mischief implies that the just man does not fall as the wicked man does into mischief and seeing all sin is mischief it seems as if the fall here spoken of the just man were not a falling into sin but into some outward calamity or exercise however the place speaks nothing of daily or continual falling nor do we remember that paul does use that very expression concerning himself viz that sin was still actually in him though we know that he does in diverse places run through as it were and open the various states and travels of the soul in some of which he cried out o wretched man that i am who shall deliver etc but he rested not there but quickly breaks forth into a rejoicing and cries out i thank god through jesus christ our lord romans         and then in the next chapter having said there is no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit he says expressly concerning himself for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death ver   and again thanks be to god which gives us the victory through our lord jesus christ   cor       this victory we press after this freedom from the law of sin and death we labor and travel to attain unto by a subjection through divine assistance to the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus  the  th objection is why your teachers persuade you that all other people are in a barren and desolate condition and are out of christ  answer our teachers do not persuade us so nor do we judge so of all other people for we our selves were gathered out of various professions states and conditions and some of us who had been seeking after the lord in other professions can remember that before we were thus gathered to this divine principle of light which the lord has set up in this his day as an ensign for the nations to be gathered unto and to walk in we were not wholly barren and desolate but had at seasons some touches and tastes of the virtue of that hidden life which we were then strangers to the lord having regard to the sincerity of our hearts and answering in some measure the breathings of our souls to him so far at least as to cherish and keep alive those good desires which were begotten in us and to beget in us a greater hunger and thirst after him and it is not hard to us to believe that so it may be with others at this day who have an integrity to the lord though not acquainted with his outgoings and manifestations of himself in this dispensation of light and life and both our prayers to god the father in and through his son jesus christ and our labor and endeavors in the openings of his love and life in our hearts are that all these in whatsoever profession may be drawn off from all the dry hills and barren mountains and gathered into the true sheepfold for we remember our savior said other sheep i have which are not of this fold them also i must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one shepherd joh  0    the lord grant that none of these may mistake his voice or disobey it  the last objection is you deny all outward ordinances as baptism and the six principles that were taught to the first primitive christians  answer the dispensation of the law was outward and the ordinances appertaining to that dispensation were outward also but the dispensation of the gospel is spiritual and inward and the ordinances appertaining to this dispensation are of a spiritual nature the baptism with water was johns and came up under the dispensation of the law nor did properly belong to the gospel dispensation though for a time by condescension continued as circumcision and some other legal rites were and this was that baptism which paul says christ sent him not to baptize with   cor      but the baptism of christ the true gospelbaptism that by which the true believer is baptized into jesus christ romans     and buried with him into death ver   the one baptism ephesians     is the baptism with the holy ghost and with fire and is plainly distinguished from the baptism with water both by john to whom the water baptism belonged and by christ to whom the spiritbaptism belonged for john said i indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that comes after me is mightier than i whose shoos i am not worthy to bear he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire mat      and christ as luke records a little before his ascension said john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence acts     which was the promise of the father ver   delivered by christ to his apostles and disciples just before his parting from them luke       let it therefore be fairly considered   that the dispensation of the gospel is spiritual and therefore the ordinances belonging to it should be so too   that in mat       from which place the commission for water baptism is usually fetched there is no mention of water   that baptism with water is no where in scripture called christs baptism   that baptism with water is frequently called johns baptism   that the baptism with the holy ghost is called christs baptism   that the apostle paul acknowledges but one baptism ephesians     which cannot be supposed to be that with water since then he must exclude the baptism of the spirit   that the apostle peter speaking of the baptism that saves says expressly it is not the putting away the filth of the flesh   pet      which it is the property of water to do as if he had said the baptism which now saves us is not water baptism   that baptism with water is no where expressly commanded in scripture as it would doubtless have been had it been intended by christ for a gospel ordinance   that though it was sometimes used after christs ascension yet that cannot authorize the use of it now any more than of circumcision and other legal ordinances which in condescension to the weakness of believers in that day were also used after christs ascension yet are confessed by all not to be in force now for john as himself said was to decrease joh    0 which related to his ministry or dispensation not to his person now a decreasing implies a growing less or wearing away by degrees not all on a sudden or at once and therefore no wonder if his water baptism was continued for a time even after christs baptism of the holy spirit took place but as christs baptism was to increase so johns was to decrease till christs came to be all in all and johns water baptism wholly to give place let these things we say be duly weighed and we hope we shall not be blamed for leaving the baptism of john and cleaving to the baptism of christ  as for the six principles thou mentionest seeing thou have not declared what they are it cannot be expected we should speak to them at this time but we recommend to thee that holy divine principle of light wherewith christ lights every man that comes into the world joh     in which light the nations of them that are saved shall walk rev       and we heartily desire thou may walk therein  t e  an account of tithes in general the only command from god that we read of in holy scripture for the payment of tithes was given by moses to the people of israel in the time of the levitical law then god first reserved to himself the tithe of the land of canaan lev     0 which he did for this reason that intending to take the tribe of levi more peculiarly into his service as he did numb     in stead of or in exchange for all the first born of israel ver       and    and chap   ver    having before reserved and appropriated the first born to himself ex      he might bestow those tithes on the levites for and toward the maintenance of that whole tribe as a reward for their service in the tabernacle of the congregation numb          and in lieu of and compensation for their part or share of and in the land of canaan which thereupon they were expressly cut off from ver  0          now although it was grounded on a principle of moral justice and equity that the levites thus engaged in a continual attendance on a public service and shut out from their share in the inheritance of the promised land should receive a sufficient maintenance from them for whom they performed that service and who enjoyed their part of the land yet the ascertaining of the quot a of that maintenance to the exact proportion of a tenth part of the increase of the land was not grounded on moral justice but had its dependence on the ceremonial law adapted and limited to the polity of that dispensation and people only and that it might not be extended beyond its appointed time and bounds it pleased the divine wisdom to subject it to such ceremonial circumstances as plainly rank it amongst those carnal ordinances rites or ceremonies which were imposed but till the time of reformation spoken of heb    0 for as god appointed the levites to be offered for a waveoffering by moses in the name and on the behalf of the children of israel when he said to moses thou shall bring the levites to the tabernacle of the congregation and thou shall gather the whole assembly of the children of israel together and thou shall bring the levites before the lord and the children of israel shall put their hands upon the levites and aaron shall offer in the margin wave the levites before the lord for an offering in the margin waveoffering of the children of israel that they may execute the service of the lord number      0    so the tithes which were assigned for the maintenance of the levites were to be first offered by the people as an heave offering unto the lord  the tithes of the children of israel which they offer as an heave offering unto the lord i have given to the levites etc numb       and even the tithes of those tithes which the levites were to yield unto the priests were to be offered by the levites as an heave offering to the lord before the priests might have them thus speak unto the levites said god to moses and say unto them when ye take of the children of israel the tithe which i have given you from them for your inheritance then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the lord even a tenth part of the tithe and this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you as though it were the corn of the threshing floor etc thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the lord of all your tithes which ye receive of the children of israel and ye shall give there of the lords heave offering to aaron the priest ver          this makes it evident beyond doubting that the tithes which were given by the people to the levites and by the levites to the priests under the law had their dependence on the ceremonial law as that priesthood had and were to stand no longer than that law and that priesthood stood which was but till shiloh came and by the offering of himself once for all had put an end to all the shadowy offerings under that law    this the author of the epistle to the hebrews did so well understand that he positively declared that the levitical priesthood being changed there was made of necessity a change also of the law of that law by which that priesthood and the maintenance of it had stood see heb      and it is also evident from scripture and primitive antiquity that neither the apostles themselves nor for some ages after them any of the christians did meddle with or at all concern themselves about tithes but let them totally fall as they did the other abrogated part viz offerings etc and of the ceremonial law of moses    but after that the mystery of iniquity which in the apostles time began to work   these     had wrought to that degree amongst some christians and had drawn them so far from the purity and simplicity of the gospel as to form and model the church in many things by and according to the jewish pattern amongst other ceremonial parts of the jewish religion which had been abolished by the coming and death of christ tithes were preached up again about the latter end of the fourth century and beginning of the fifth by some at first under the notion of alms and charity because part of the tithes under the levitical law were appointed for the maintenance of the fatherless the widow and the stranger deuteronomy          and by others as then still due by the mosaic law which had required them to be paid to the levitical priesthood which plea afterward corruptions increasing in the church and in those especially who were called the churchmen or clergy more and more prevailing the payment of tithes was reintroduced as due by those levitical laws which had been given to the israelites of old and upon that bottom tithes have stood been claimed and the claim defended unto this day    now not only he that thus claims and receives tithes but he that consents to and complies with such claim by paying tithes thus brought in and thus claimed does thereby implicitly and vertually at least deny that christ has put an end to the ceremonial law of moses and consequently that he is come and has suffered in his flesh for mankind and that this may appear as plain as is possible i shall draw the matter into an argument thus to uphold any thing as still in force which was to be taken away and cease at and by the death of christ is to deny that christ is come and has suffered in his flesh for mankind but to receive or pay tithes now is to uphold a thing as still in force which was to be taken away and cease at and by the death of christ therefore to receive or pay tithes now is to deny that christ is come and has suffered in his flesh for mankind the major must be granted and the minor i thus prove whatsoever was a part of the ceremonial law of moses was to be taken away and cease at and by the death of christ but tithes were a part of the ceremonial law of moses therefore tithes were to be taken away and cease at and by the death of christ the major here again is unexceptionable and the minor is thus proved every heave offering among the jews was a part of the ceremonial law of moses but tithes were an heave offering among the jews number       therefore tithes were a part of the ceremonial law of moses     by this it appears that without regard had of the person to whom or the use for which tithes are paid the paying of tithes as well as the receiving them being a part of the abrogated ceremonial law of moses imports a denial of the coming and death of christ hence it is that tithes have been and are commonly called antichristian or against christ and hence has risen that saying often used not only by our ancient friends but by some of the martyrs long before viz he that pays tithes does thereby deny that christ is come in the flesh that conclusion could not have been drawn from the paying of tithes to a wrong ministry or for a wrong use only though such payment be evil nor could any thing justify that inference but the consideration that tithes depending on the ceremonial law of moses which must of necessity and in course fall and cease when christ suffered the paying of tithes carries in it a supposal that that law is not yet ceased but is still in force and consequently that christ whose death must needs have ended it is not yet come nor has yet suffered in his flesh for mankind    that other objection not less weighty than common against paying tithes to the clergy so called viz the unlawfulness of upholding a false ministry to perform a false worship being it self so clear and plain that it needs no illustration i shall in this discourse no further meddle with than to observe in my way how far it may affect those tithes also which the impropriators claim wherefore having premised what is said before concerning tithes in general to what hand or for what use soever paid let us now inquire into those tithes which are called impropriate  of impropriate tithes that these tithes which are claimed by the impropriators are of the same nature and stand originally on the same root and ground on which the other tithes stand which are claimed and exacted by the priests is evident from hence that they were all heretofore these as well as those claimed by and paid to some or other of the romish clergy or their appendices the religious orders so called and upon the same foot that is these impropriate tithes were paid to those religious orders or houses as being due to god by virtue of the leviticlaw as well as the other tithes were paid to the parish priests on the same supposed right from the same law but how these ththes came to those religious houses first and how afterward from them to the impropriators is next to be inquired  until the lateran council so named because it was holden in the popes palace at rome called the lateran in the year      it was in the choice of every man to give his tithes to what church he pleased so he gave them to some church and even after that council the popes as heads of that church by their dispencing power did give leave to such as would sue and pay for it to give their tithes from the parish priest to such order of religious people whether monks friars or nuns as they were best affected to by which means the parish priests called seculars and those of the several religious orders called by a general title regulars being left to scramble as they could for maintenance the regulars mendicant friars and others swarming in all places and pretending at least to greater sanctity and austerity of life than the parish priests prevailed with the people either living or dying to give not only very considerable estates in lands but also the tithes of other lands and of whole parishes from the parish priests to their religious houses or convents  the tithes or parsonages so given were then called appropriations because they were appropriated to this that or the other religious house or convent and i have read that there were in england about      parsonages thus appropriated and as tithes were then held to be due to god and holy church and those religious orders were reputed a part of that church so the tithes as well as the lands thus given them were continued to them and possessed by them till that general storm arose in k henry   his time which overturned those religious houses and orders together and here by the way it may be noted that while those religious houses stood a great part of the lands which had been given to them were by papal authority exempted from paying tithes whence it is that many of those estates which had belonged to those religious houses remain discharged from the burden of tithes still  as tithes were set up here on the authority of the levitic law and in imitation of the jewish practice consonant to that law so while those religious houses stood and the popes power prevailed here not only the seculars or parish priests but all those regulars who received tithes were bound to pay the tenths out of the tithes they received to the head of their church the pope as the levites under the ceremonial law were required to do to the priests  but after that k hen   upon a quarrel between the pope and him about his divorce from his first queen catharine which he earnestly desired and the pope would not grant fell off from the pope though not from popery for after that he retained the most pernicious doctrines of the romish church contained in the six articles and burnt some for denying them he threw off the popes supremacy here and assumed it to himself declaring himself and being declared first by the clergy in their convocation and soon after by lords and commons in parliament the only supreme head in earth of the church of england this was done by the statute of    hen   c   and therein it is enacted that the king his heirs and successors kings of this realm shall be taken accepted and reputed the only supreme head in earth of the church of england and shall have and enjoy annexed and united to the imperial crown of this realm as well the title and style thereof as all honors dignities praeeminences jurisdictions privileges authorities immunities profits and commodities to the said dignity of supreme head of the same church belonging and appertaining and shall have full power and authority from time to time to visit repress redress reform order correct restrain and amend all such errors heresies abuses offenses contempts and enormities whatsoever they be which by any manner of spiritual authority and jurisdiction ought or may lawfully be reformed repressed ordered redressed corrected restrained or amended etc by which it is evident the intention of the parliament then was to transfer confer and settle unto and upon king henry all the powers profits and privileges which had been before supposed to be in or belong to or had been enjoyed or exercised by the pope while he was received as supreme head of the church    and therefore as the pope while he retained the supremacy here had the first fruits which are the profits of every spiritual or ecclesiastical living for one year upon the advancing of any ecclesiastical person to such a living and also the tenths that is the tenth part of all the tithes so these two revenues as appendant to that supremacy followed it being settled on the king in the same session of parliament wherein the supremacy was vested in him the words of the statute    h   c   relating to the first fruits are these that for the more surety of continuance and augmentation of his high ness royal estate being not only now recognized as he always indeed has heretofore been the only supreme head in earth next and immediately under god of the church of england but also their most assured and undoubted natural sovereign liege lord and king etc it may therefore be enacted and ordained by etc that the kings highness his heirs and successors kings of this realm shall have and enjoy from time to time to endure for ever of every such person and persons which at any time after the first day of january next shall be nominated elected perfected presented collated or by any other means appointed to have any archbishopric abbacy monastery priory college hospital archdeaconry deanery provostship prebend parsonage vicarage chauntry freechappel or other dignity benefice office or promotion spiritual within this realm or elsewhere within any of the kings dominions of what name nature or quality soever they be or to whose foundation patronage or gift soever they belong the first fruits revenues and profits for one year of every such archbishopric bishopric abbey monastery priory  parsonage vicarage etc then after provisions made for finding out the value of those spiritual livings and for paying receiving and recovering those first fruits the settlement of the tenths that other part of the popes revenue upon the king follows in the same statute in these words  and over this be it enacted by authority aforesaid that the kings majesty his heirs and successors kings of this realm for more augmentation and maintenance of the royal estate of his imperial crown and dignity of supreme head of the church of england shall yearly have take enjoy and receive united and knit to his imperial crown for ever one yearly rent or pension amounting to the value of the tenth part of all the revenues rents farms tithes offerings emoluments and of all other profits as well called spiritual as temporal now appertaining or belonging or that hereafter shall belong to any archbishopric bishopric abbacy monastery priory archdeaconry deanery hospital college housecollegiate prebend cathedral church collegiatechurch conventualchurch parsonage vicarage chauntry freechappel or other benefice or promotion spiritual of what name nature or quality soever they be within any diocese of this realm or in wales etc and so goes on to direct the time place and manner of payment of these tenths with the penalty for nonpayment  thus were these two great pillars of papal supremacy first fruits and tenths transferred from the pope the old head to the king the new head of the church to support and maintain that headship in him as they had done before in the pope which ecclesiastical headship the king was no sooner possessed of than he began to exercise it amongst those religious orders suppressing as herbert in his life p     relates the observant friars at greenwich canterbury richmond and other places and substituting the augustines in their places which he did says herbert there for the finding out how his people would take his design of putting down religious houses to which he proceeded the next year beginning with the lesser sort and suppressing all those monasteries priories and other religious houses of monks canons and nuns which had not in lands tenements rents tithes portions and other hereditaments above the clear yearly value of two hundred pounds by which means     of those religious houses being dissolved a revenue of above thirty thousand pounds a year beside an hundred thousand pounds in money raised yb sale at low rates of the goods and chattels of those houses a sum not small in that age came to the king for support of his ecclesiastical supremacy  the statute which countenanced this proceeding is the    of hen   cap    and a new court called the court of augmentations was then erected and settled by parliament for receiving and ordering these new accessional revenue the act for which in our printed statute books is set before that for the suppression of those lesser monasteries but though that for suppressing those monasteries be by an hysterosis set after that for establishing the court of augmentations yet it must have been made before it for it is recited in it  in that statute    hen      for suppressing those smaller monasteries mention is made of monasteries abbeys and priores which within one year before the making of that statute had been given and granted to the king by any abbot prior abbess or prioress under their conventseal or that otherwise had been suppressed or dissolved all which were by that statute confirmed to the king and to all those unto whom the king either then before had conveyed or then after should convey any part or parts thereof to hold to them in like manner form and conditions as the abbots priors abbesses prioresses and other chief governors of any religious houses which had the same might or ought to have had if they had not been suppressed for upon the kings falling as was noted before upon the observant friars at greenwich and other places some of the more considerate of the abbots priors etc seeing the storm arising which then threatened and soon after brought destruction on those orders thought it better policy to comply with the times and surrender upon terms in hopes to save something than hold out to the last as many did and lose all   0 and indeed the suppressing of those     lesser monasteries struck so great a fear into the greater that the statute made four years after    hen   cap    whereby the rest of the religious houses were given to the king recites that diverse and sundry abbots etc of their own free and voluntary mind since the fourth of feb in the    of his reign had by due order of law and by their sufficient writings of record under their convent and common seals severally given granted and confirmed to the king his heirs and successors for ever all their said monasteries abbeys priories etc and all the manors lordships lands tenements tithes etc to them belonging and had voluntarily renounced left and forsaken the same and therefore in the said statute it is enacted that the king shall have hold etc all such late monasteries etc and all the sites circuits manners lands tenements etc thereunto belonging in the ennumeration of the particulars whereof which are many tithes parsonages appropriate and vicarages are expressly mentioned all which as likewise all other religious houses with the revenues thereof which should there after be dissolved suppressed relinquished forfeited or given to the king and which by that statute are settled on him he was to hold and enjoy in as large and ample manner and form as the late abbots etc had held or of right ought to have held the same in right of their said late monasteries etc     from hence this observation arises that since those religious orders did hold the tithes which they possessed upon the supposed right of their being due to god and holy church which they held themselves and were by others holden to be a part of and the king received those tithes and parsonages amongst the rest of the revenues of the religious houses as well those that were resigned to him by the governors of those houses themselves as the rest which by act of parliament he took upon the same right on which those religious orders had holden them he also must hold them upon that supposed right of their being due to god and holy church which he then held himself and was holden by all both clergy and laity to be the only supreme head of here in england and as upon that supposed right of their being due to god and holy church on which the religious houses held them they passed them from those houses to the king as supreme head of the church so on the same supposed right of their being due to god and holy church they passed from the king as supreme head of the church to those whether spiritual or lay persons unto whom the king granted them for they stuck not long in the kings hand but he of his own mere motion liberality and benignity as the statute in the   d year of his reign cap    relates had by that time freely given and granted etc unto diverse and sundry of the lords and nobles as well spiritual as temporal and unto diverse and many other persons and bodies politic etc diverse and many sundry honors castles manors lands tenements and among the rest rectories etc     but great care was taken to retain and keep up the character of spirituality which had formerly been stamped upon those rectories parsonages and other revenues by tithes into what hands soever they were passed and therefore by the statute of    hen   cap   in case of withholding or denying to pay the tithes all persons claiming them impropriators as well as priests are restrained from suing in the temporal courts and limited to the ecclesiastical or spiritual courts only for the recovery of them  and that they might still have dependence upon the supremacy care was taken from the first by the statute of    hen   cap    that none of these estates which then had come or should come from any of those religious houses to the king should pass from him by grant to any person whatsoever without an express reservation of a tenth and in a subsequent statute    hen   cap    complaint being made that although out of those grants which the king had made to sundry persons of honors castles manors lands tenements rectories etc which were under the survey of the court of augmentations the tenths had been reserved yet the persons unto whom such grants had been made though they had quietly enjoyed and taken the issues and profits of those lands rectories etc had not paid the reserved rents to the king provision was made in that statute by several forfeitures and nominepoenaes to enforce the payment thereof  nor was care taken of the ecclesiastical head the king only but of the ecclesiastical members the clergy also many if not most of which had pensions or portions issuing out of those parsonages rectories or other spiritual benefices as they were counted which the religious orders held for besides that upon the increasing of those appropriations whereby the parish priests were pinched there had been provision made early in the time of k richard the second for the vicars as well as for the poor the statute of    ric     directing that upon the appropriation of such churches the diocaesian of the place or bishop of the diocese shall ordain according to the value of such churches a convenient sum of money to be paid and distributed yearly of the fruits and profits of the same churches to the poor parishioners and also that the vicar be well and sufficiently endowed which statute so far at least as concerned the vicars was afterward confirmed by another statue of   hen   cap    which expressly ordains that the statute of appropriation of churches and of the endowment of vicars in the same made the   th year of k ric the   d be firmly holden and put in due execution i say besides these the stat of    and    of hen   cap    takes notice that the archbishops bishops archdeacons and other ecclesiastical persons of both provinces of canterbury and york having formerly in right of their churches received out of the late monasteries etc diverse pensions and other profits had after the dissolution of those houses been disturbed and denied of the having receiving and gathering of the said pensions etc whereupon it is in the said statute enacted that if any person or persons being farmer or occupier of any manors lands tenements parsonges benefices or other hereditaments of any of the said late monasteries etc by the kings gift grant sale exchange or other wise out of which any such pensions etc have been heretofore lawfully going answered or paid to any of the archbishops bishops archdeacons and other ecclesiastical persons abovesaid do at any time after the first day of april next coming wilfully deny the payment thereof then it shall be lawful for the said archbishops bishops archdeacons or other ecclesiastical persons aforesaid being so denied to be satisfied and paid there of etc to proceed in the ecclesiastical courts for the recovery thereof     by which statute all pensions payable to archbishops bishops archdeacons or other ecclesiastical person that had been possessed thereof at or within ten years next before the time of the dissolution of the monasteries out of the parsonages rectories or tithes holden by the said monasteries etc are confirmed and assured to such archbishops bishops archdeacons and other ecclesiastical persons still     so that upon the whole besides what has been said of tithes in general with respect to the judaizing and denying of christ by the paying thereof which extends alike to all tithes those claimed by the impropriator as well as those claimed by the priest the impropriate tithes being generally charged either with some payment to the vicars for enlarging of their stipends or with pensions to the archbishops bishops archdeacons and other ecclesiastics all such of them as are so charged come under the same objection that is made against paying to the priest viz the upholding of a false ministry to perform a false worship and if any impropriation may be supposed to be free from all those charges yet all impropriators as well as priests being bound to pay the reserved tenths to the king as supreme head of the church which were wont before to be paid to the pope while he was owned for head of the church the paying of tithes to an impropriator is a recognizing and acknowledging of a man bad or good popish or protestant as it happens to be the only supreme head on earth of the church which is to set an human head to a spiritual body and to divest and deprive our lord jesus christ of his undoubted right who the apostle says expressly is the head of the body the church col      and that not of mans making or appointing but god says the apostle has given him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body ephesians          t e  finis
