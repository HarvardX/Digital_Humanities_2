excites a regret that the history of remote ages should always be so much involved in obscurity uncertainty and contradiction ingenious men possessed of leizure are apt to push their researches beyond the period in which literary monuments are framed or preserved without reflecting that the history of past events is immediately lost or disfigured when entrusted to memory or oral tradition and that the adventures of barbarous nations even if they were preserved could afford little or no entertainment to those born in a more cultivated age the convulsions of a civilized state usually compose the most instructive and most interesting part of its history but the sudden violent and unprepared revolutions incident to barbarians are so much guided by caprice and terminate so often in cruelty that they disgust us by the uniformity of their appearance and it is rather fortunate for letters that they are buried in silence and oblivion the only certain means by which nations can indulge their curiosity in researches concerning their remote origin is to consider the language manners and customs of their ancestors and to compare them with those of the neighboring nations the fables which are commonly employed to supply the place of true history ought entirely to be disregarded and if any exception be admitted to this general rule it can only be in favor of the ancient greek fictions which are so celebrated and so agreeable that they will ever be the objects of the attention of mankind neglecting therefore all traditions or rather tales concerning the more early history of britain we shall only consider the state of the inhabitants as it appeared to the romans on their invasion of this country we shall briefly run over the events which attended the conquest made by that empire as belonging more to roman than british story we shall hasten through the obscure and uninteresting period of saxon annals and shall reserve a more full narration for those times when the truth is both so well ascertained and so complete as to promise some entertainment and instruction to the reader  all ancient writers agree in representing the first inhabitants of britain as a tribe of the gauls or celtae who peopled that island from the neighboring continent their language was the same their manners their government their superstition varied only by those small differences which time or a communication with the bordering nations must necessarily introduce the inhabitants of gaul especially in those parts which lie contiguous to italy had acquired from a commerce with their southern neighbors some refinement in the arts which gradually diffused themselves northwards and spread but a very faint light over this island the greek and roman navigators or merchants for there were scarce any other travelers in those ages brought back the most shocking accounts of the ferocity of the people which they magnified as usual in order to excite the admiration of their countrymen the southeast parts however of britain had already before the age of caesar made the first and most requisite step toward a civil settlement and the britains by tillage and agriculture had there increased to a great multitude caesar lib    the other inhabitants of the island still maintained themselves by pasturage they were clothed with skins of beasts they dwelt in huts which they reared in the forests and marshes with which the country was covered they shifted easily their habitation when actuated either by the hopes of plunder or the fear of an enemy the convenience of feeding their cattle was even a sufficient motive for removing their seats and being ignorant of all the refinements of life their wants and their possessions were equally scanty and limited  the britains were divided into many small nations or tribes and being a military people whose sole property was their sword and their cattle it was impossible after they had acquired a relish of liberty for their princes of chieftains to establish any despotic authority over them their governments though monarchical diod sic l   mela lib   cap   strabo lib   were free as well as those of all the celtic nations and the common people seem even to have enjoyed more liberty among them don cassius lib     than among the nations of gaul caesar lib    from whom they were descended each state was divided into factions within itself tacit agr  it was agitated with emulation toward the neighboring states and while the arts of peace were yet unknown wars were the chief occupation and formed the chief object of ambition among the people  the religion of the britains was one of the most considerable parts of their government and the druids who were their priests possessed great authority among them besides ministering at the altar and directing all religious duties they presided over the education of youth they were endowed with an immunity from wars and taxes they enjoyed both the civil and criminal jurisdiction they decided all controversies among states as well as private persons and whoever refused to submit to their decree was exposed to the most severe penalties the sentence of excommunication was denounced against him he was forbid access to the sacrifices or public worship he was debarred all intercourse with his fellowcitizens even in the common affairs of life his company was universally shunned as profane and dangerous he was refused the protection of law caesar lib   strabo lib    and death itself became to him an acceptable relief from the misery and infamy to which he was exposed thus the bands of government which were naturally loose among that rude and turbulent people were happily corroborated by the terrors of their superstition  no species of superstition was ever more terrible than that of the druids besides the severe penalties which it was in the power of the ecclesiastics to inflict in this world they inculcated the eternal transmigration of souls and thereby extended their authority as far as the fears of their timorous votaries they practiced their rites in dark groves or other secret recesses plin lib    cap    and in order to throw a greater mystery on their religion they communicated their doctrines only to the initiated and strictly forbad the committing them to writing lest they should at any time be exposed to the examination of the profane vulgar human sacrifices were practiced among them the spoils of war were often devoted to their divinities and they punished with the severest tortures whoever dared to secret any part of the consecrated offering these treasures they preserved in woods and forests secured by no other guard than the terrors of their religion caesar lib    and this continued conquest over human avidity may be regarded as more signal than their prompting men to the most extraordinary and most violent efforts no idolatrous worship ever attained such an ascendant over mankind as that of the ancient gauls and britains and the romans after their conquest finding it impossible to reconcile these nations to the laws and institutions of their masters while it maintained its authority were at last obliged to abolish it by penal statutes a violence which had never in any other instance been practiced by these tolerating conquerors sueton in vita claudii   the romans the britains had long remained in this rude but independent state when caesar having overrun all gaul by his victories first cast his eye on their island he was not allured either by its riches or its renown but being ambitious of carrying the roman arms into a new world then wholly unknown he took advantage of a short interval in his gaulic wars and made an invasion on britain the natives informed of his intention were sensible of the unequal contest and endeavored to appease him by submissions which however retarded not the execution of his design anno ant c    after some resistance he landed as is supposed at deal and having obtained several advantages over the britains and obliged them to promise hostages for their future dutiful behavior he was constrained by the necessity of his affairs and the approach of winter to withdraw his forces into gaul the britains relieved from the terror of his arms neglected the performance of their stipulations and that haughty conqueror resolved next summer to chastise them for this breach of treaty he landed with a greater force and though he found a more regular resistance from the britains who had united under cassivelaunus one of their petty princes he discomfited them in every action he advanced into the country passed the thames in the face of the enemy took and burned the capital of cassivelaunus established his ally manubratius in the sovereignty of the trinobantes and having obliged the inhabitants to make him new submissions he again returned with his army into gaul and left the authority of the romans more nominal than real in this island  the civil wars which ensued and which prepared the way for the establishment of monarchy in rome saved the britains from that yoke which was ready to be imposed upon them augustus the successor of caesar content with the victory obtained over the liberties of his own country was little ambitious of acquiring same by foreign wars and being apprehensive lest the same unlimited extent of dominion which had subverted the republic might also overwhelm the empire he recommended to his successors never farther to enlarge the territories of the romans tiberius jealous of the fame which might be acquired by his generals made this advice of augustus a pretense for his inactivity tacit agr  the mad sallies of caligula in which he menaced britain with an invasion served only to expose himself and the empire to ridicule and the britains had now during almost a century enjoyed their liberty unmolested when the romans in the reign of claudius began to think seriously of redu ing them under their dominion tacit ann lib      notwithstanding these misfortunes the britains were not subdued and this island was regarded by the ambitious romans as a field in which military honor might still be acquired which was the center of their superstition and which afforded protection to all their baffled forces the britains endeavored to obstruct his landing on this sacred island both by the force of their arms and the terrors of their religion the women and priests were intermingled with the soldiers upon the shore and running about with flaming torches in their hands and tossing their dishevelled hair they struck greater terror into the astonished romans by their howlings cries and execrations than the real danger from the armed forces was able to inspire but suetonius exhorting his troops to despise the menaces of a superstition which they despised impelled them to the attack drove the britains off the field burned the druids in the same fires which they had prepared for their captive enemies destroyed all the consecrated groves and altars and having thus triumphed over the religion of the britains he thought his future progress would be easy in reducing the people to subjection but he was disappointed in his expectations the britains taking advantage of his absence were all in arms and being headed by boadicea queen of the iceni who had been treated in the most ignominious manner by the roman tribunes had already attacked with success several settlements of their insulting conquerors suetonius hastened to the protection of london which was already a flourishing roman colony but found on his arrival that it would be requisite for the general safety to abandon that place to the merciless fury of the enemy london was reduced to ashes such of the inhabitants as remained in it cruelly massacred the romans and all strangers to the number of  0000 put to the sword without distinction and the britains by rendering the war thus bloody seemed determined to cut off all hopes of peace or composition with the enemy but this cruelty was revenged by suetonius in a great and decisive battle where  0000 of the britains are said to have perished and boadicea herself rather than fall into the hands of the enraged victor put an end to her own life by poison tacit ann lib     nero soon after recalled suetonius from a government where by suffering and inflicting so many severities he was judged improper for composing the angry and alarmed minds of the inhabitants after some interval cerealis received the command from vespasian and by his bravery propagated the terror of the roman arms julius frontinus succeeded cerealis both in authority and reputation  this great commander formed a regular plan for subduing britain and rendering the acquisition useful to the victors he carried his victorious arms northwards defeated the britains in every encounter pierced into the inaccessible forests and mountains of caledonia reduced every thing to subjection in the southern parts of the island and chaced before him all the men of fiercer and more intractable spirits who deemed war and death itself less intolerable than servitude under the conquerors he even defeated them in a decisive action which they fought under galcacus their leader and having drawn a rampart and fixed a train of garrisons between the friths of clyde and forth he thereby cut off the ruder and more barren parts of the island and secured the roman province from the invasion of the barbarous inhabitants tacit agr   during these military enterprises he neglected not the arts of peace he introduced laws and civility among the britains taught them to desire and raise all the conveniences of life reconciled them to the roman language and manners instructed them in letters and science and employed every expeient to render those chains which he had forged both easy and agreeable to them tacit agr  the inhabitants having experienced how unequal their own force was to resist that of the romans acquiesced in the dominion of their masters and were gradually incorporated as a part of that mighty empire  this was the last durable conquest made by the romans and britain once subdued gave no farther inquietude to the victor caledonia alone defended by its barren mountains and by the contempt which the romans entertained of it sometimes infested the more cultivated parts of the island by the incursions of its inhabitants the better to secure the frontiers of the empire adrian who visited this island built a strong rampart between tyne and the firth of solway lollius urbicus under antoninus pius repaired that of agricola severus who made an expedition into britain and carried his arms into the most northern extremity of it added new fortifications to the wall of adrian and during all the reigns of the roman emperors such a profound tranquillity prevailed in britain that little mention is made of the affairs of that island by any historian the only incidents which occur are some seditions or rebellions of the roman legions quartered there and some usurpations of the imperial dignity by the roman governors the natives disarmed dispirited and submissive had lost all desire and even idea of their former liberty and independance  but the period was now come when that enormous fabric of the roman empire which had diffused slavery and oppression together with peace and civility over so considerable a part of the globe was approaching toward its final dissolution italy and the center of the empire removed during so many ages from all concern in the wars had entirely lost the military spirit and were peopled by an enervated race equally disposed to submit to a foreign yoke or to the tyranhy of their own rulers the emperors found themselves obliged to recruit their legions from the frontier provinces where the genius of war though languishing was not totally extinct and these mer enary forces careless of laws and civil institutions established a military government no less dangerous to the sovereign than to the people the farther progress of the same disorders introduced the bordering barbarians into the service of the romans and those fierce nations having now added discipline and skill to their native bravery could no longer be restrained by the impotent policy of the emperors who were accustomed to employ the one in the destruction of the other sensible of their own force and allured by the prospect of so rich a prize the northern barbarians in the reign of arcadius and honorius assailed at once all the frontiers of the roman empire and having first satiated their avidity by plunder began to think of fixing a settlement in the wasted provinces the more distant barbarians who occupied the deserted habitations of the former advanced in their acquisitions and pressed with their incumbent weight the roman state already unequal to the load which it sustained instead of arming the people in their own defense the emperors recalled all the distant legions in whom alone they could repose confidence and collected the whole military force for the defense of the capital and center of the empire the necessity of selfpreservation had superceded the ambition of power and the ancient point of honor of never contracting the limits of the empire could no longer be attended to in this desperate extremity  britain by its situation was removed from the fury of these barbarous incursions and being also a remote province not much valued by the romans the legions which defended it were carried over to the protection of italy and gaul but that province though secured by the sea against the inroads of the greater tribes of barbarians found enemies on its frontiers who took advantage of its present defenseless situation the picts and scots who dwelt in the northern parts beyond the wall of antoninus made incursions upon their peaceable and effeminate neighbors and besides the temporary depredations which they committed threatened the whole province with subjection or what the inhabitants more dreaded with plunder and devastation the former nation seem to have been a tribe of the native british race who having been chaced into the northern parts by the conquests of agricola had there intermingled with the ancient inhabitants the other were derived from the same celtic origin had first been established in ireland had sent over a colony to the northwest coasts of this island and had long been accustomed as well from their old as their new seats to infest the roman province by their pyracy and rapine these two tribes finding their more opulent neighbors exposed to invasion soon broke over the roman wall no longer defended by the roman arms and though a contemptible enemy in themselves met with no resistance from the unwarlike inhabitants the britains accustomed to have recourse to the emperors for defense as well as government made supplications to rome and one legion was sent over for their protection this force was an overmatch for the barbarians repelled their invasion routed them in every engagement and having chaced them into their ancient limits returned in triumph to the defense of the southern provinces of the empire gildas bid lib   cap    paull diacon alured beverl p    ex edit hearne  their retreat brought on a new invasion of the

with these distant expeditions informed the britains that they must no longer look to them for succor exhorted them to arm in their own defense and urged that as they were now their own masters it became them to protect by their valor that independence which their ancient lords had conferred upon them bid lib   cap    gul malm p   ann beverl p     that they might leave the island with the better grace the romans assisted them in erecting anew the wall of severus which was built entirely of stone and which the britains had not at that time artizans skilful enough to repair bid lib   cap

course of near four centuries  the britains the abject britains regarded this present of liberty as fatal to them and were in no condition to put in practice the prudent advice given them by the romans of arming in their own defense unaccustomed both to the perils of war and to the cares of civil government they found themselves incapable of forming or executing any measures for resisting the incursions of the barbarians gratian also and constantine two romans who had a little before assumed the purple in britain had carried over into the continent the flower of the british youth and having perished in their unsuccessful attempts on the imperial throne had despoiled the island of those who in this desperate extremity were best able to defend it the picts and scots finding that the romans had finally relinquished britain now regarded the whole as their prize and attacked the northern wall with redoubled forces the britains already subdued by their own fears found the ramparts but a weak defense for them and deserting their station left the country entirely open to the inroads of the barbarous enemy the invaders carried devastation and ruin along with them and exerted to the utmost their native ferocity which was not mitigated by the helpless condition and submissive behavior of the inhabitants gildas bid lib   ann beverl p     the unhappy britains had a third time recourse to rome which had declared its resolution for ever to abandon them aetius the patrician sustained at that time by his valor and magnanimity the toing ruins of the empire and revived for a

despair deserted their habitations abandoned tillage and flying for protection to the forests and mountains suffered equally from hunger and from the enemy the barbarians themselves began to feel the pressures of famine in a country which they had ravaged and being harassed by the dispersed britains who had not dared to resist them in a body they retreated with their spoils into their own country

humanity are commonly neglected kingly government even when established among the germans for it was not universal possessed a very limited authority and though the sovereign was usually chosen from amongst the royal family he was obliged to be directed in every measure by the common consent of the nation over whom he presided when any important affairs were transacted all the warriors of the nation met in arms the men of greatest authority employed persuasion to engage their consent the people expressed their approbation by rattling their armor or their dissent by murmurs there was no necessity for a nice scrutiny of votes among a multitude who were usually carried with a strong current to one side or the other and the measure thus suddenly chosen by general agreement was executed with alacrity and prosecuted with vigor even in war their princes governed more by example than by authority but in peace the civil union was in a great measure dissolved and the inferior leaders administered justice after an independent manner each in his particular district these were elected by the votes of the people in their great councils and though regard was paid to nobility in the

the germans tillage itself was almost wholly neglected they seem to have been even anxious to prevent any improvements of that nature and the leaders by annually distributing anew all the land among

several saxon adventurers have escaped the records of history the language spoke in these countries which is purely saxon is a stronger proof of this event than can be opposed by the imperfect or rather fabulous annals which are obtruded on us by the scots historians  the heptarchy thus was established after a violent struggle of near an hundred and fifty years the heptarchy or seven saxon kingdoms in britain and the whole southern part of the island except wales and cornwall had totally changed its inhabitants language customs and political institutions the britains under the roman dominion had made such advances toward arts and civil manners that they had built twentyeight considerable cities within their province besides a great number of villages and countryseats gildas bid lib    but the fierce conquerors by whom they were now subdued threw every thing back into ancient barbarity and those few natives who were not either massacred or expelled their habitations were reduced to the most abject slavery none of the other northern conquerors the franks goths vandals or burgundians though they overran the southern provinces like a mighty torrent made such devastations in the conquered territories or were inflamed into such a violent animosity against the ancient inhabitants as the saxons came over at intervals in separate bodies the britains however at first unwarlike were tempted to make resistance and hostilities being thereby prolonged proved more destructive to both parties especially to the vanquished the first invaders from germany instead of excluding other adventurers who must share with them the spoils and property of the ancient inhabitants were obliged to invite over fresh supplies from their own country and a total extermination of the britains became the sole expedient for providing a settlement and subsistence to the new planters hence there have been found in history few conquests more ruinous than that of the saxons and few revolutions more violent than that which they introduced  so long as the contest was maintained with the natives the several saxon princes preserved an union of councils and interests but after the britains were shut up in the barren countries of cornwall and wales and gave no farther inquietude to the conquerors the band of alliance was in a great measure dissolved among the princes of the heptarchy and though one prince seems still to have been allowed or to have assumed an ascendant over the whole his authority if it ought ever to be deemed regular or legal was extremely limited and each state acted as if it had been totally separate and independent of the rest wars therefore and revolutions and dissentions were unavoidable among a turbulent and military people and these events however intricate or confused should now become the objects of our attention but added to the difficulty of carrying on at once the history of seven independent kingdoms there is a great discouragement to a writer arising from the uncertainty at least barrenness of the accounts transmitted to us the monks who were the only annalists during those ages lived remote from public affairs considered the civil transactions as entirely subordinate to the ecclesiastical and besides partaking of the ignorance and barbarity which were then universal were strongly infected with credulity with the love of wonder and with a propensity to imposture vices almost inseparable from their profession and manner of life the history of that period abounds in names but is extremely barren of events or the events are related so much without circumstances and causes that the most profound or most eloquent writer must despair of rendering them either instructive or entertaining to the reader even the great learning and vigorous imagination of milton sunk under the weight and this author scruples not to declare that he esteems the skirmishes of kites or crows equally deserving of a particular narrative as the confused transactions and battles of the saxon heptarchy milton in kennet p  0  in order however to connect the events in some tolerable measure we shall give a succinct account of the successions of kings and of the revolutions in each particular kingdom beginning with that of kent which was the first established  the kingdom of kent escus succeeded his father hengist in the kingdom of kent but seems not to have possessed the military reputation enjoyed by that conqueror who first made way for the entrance of the saxon arms into britain all the saxons who sought the fame of valor or new establishments by arms flocked to the standard of aella king of sussex who was carrying on successful war against the britains and laying the foundations of a new kingdom escus was contented to possess in tranquillity the kingdom of kent which he left in     to his son octa in whose time the east saxons established their monarchy and dismembered the provinces of essex and middlesex from that of kent his death after twentytwo years reign made room for his son hermenric in     who performed nothing memorable during a reign of thirtytwo years except associating with him his son ethelbert in the government in order the better to secure the succession in his family and prevent such revolutions as are incident to a turbulent and barbarous monarchy  ethelbert revived the reputation of his family which had languished for some generations the inactivity of his predecessors and the situation of his country secured from all hostility with the britains seems to have much weakened the warlike genius of the kentish saxons and ethelbert in his first attempt to aggrandize his country and distinguish his own name met with very bad success chron sax p     he was twice discomfited in battle by ceaulin king of wessex and obliged to yield the superiority in the heptarchy to that ambitious monarch who preserved no moderation in his victory and by subjecting the kingdom of sussex excited jealousy in all the other princes an association was formed against him and ethelbert entrusted with the command of the allies fought him in a great battle and obtained a decisive victory   ceaulin died soon after and ethelbert succeeded as well to his ascendant among the saxon states as to his other ambitious and exorbitant projects he reduced all the princes except the king of northumberland to a strict dependence upon him and even established himself by force on the throne of mercia the most extensive of the saxon kingdoms apprehensive however of a dangerous league against him like that by which he himself had been enabled to overthrow ceaulin he had the prudence to resign the throne of mercia to webba the rightful heir the son of crida who had first founded that monarchy but governed still by ambition more than by justice he gave webba possession of the crown on such conditions as rendered him little better than a tributary prince under his artful benefactor  but the most memorable and most fortunate event which distinguished the reign of this great prince was the introduction of the christian religion among the english saxons the superstition of the germans particularly that of the saxons was of the grossest and most barbarous kind and being founded on certain traditional tales received from their ancestors not reduced to any system not supported by political institutions like that of the druids it seems to have made little impression on its votaries and to have easily resigned its place to the new doctrine promulgated to them woden whom they believed the ancestor of all their princes was regarded as the god of war and by a natural consequence became their supreme deity and the chief object of their religious worship they believed that if they obtained the favor of this divinity by their valor for they made less account of the other virtues they would be admitted after their death into his hall and reposing on couches would satiate themselves with ale from the skulls of their enemies whom they had slain in battle incited by this idea of paradise which gratified at once the passion of revenge and that of intemperance the ruling inclinations of barbarians they despised the dangers of war and increased their native ferocity against the vanquished by their religious prejudices we know little of the other theological tenets of the saxons we only learn that they were idolaters that they worshipped the sun and moon that they adored the god of thunder under the name of thor that they had images in their temples that they practiced sacrifices believed firmly in spells and enchantments  dmitted in general a system of doctrines which they held as sacred  the superstitions must bear the air of the wildest extravagance if propounded to those who are not familiarized to it from their earliest infancy  the constant hostilities which the saxons maintained against the britains would naturally indispose them from receiving the christian faith when preached to them by such inveterate enemies and perhaps the britains as is objected to them by gildas and bid were not over fond of communicating to their cruel invaders the doctrine of eternal life and salvation but as a civilized people however subdued by arms still maintain a sensible superiority over barbarous and ignorant nations all the other northern conquerors of europe had been already induced to embrace the christian faith which they found established in the empire and it was impossible but the saxons informed of this event must have regarded with some degree of veneration a doctrine which had acquired the ascendant over all their brethren however limited in their views they could not but have perceived a degree of cultivation in the southern counties beyond what they themselves possessed and it was natural for them to yield to that superior knowledge as well as zeal by which the inhabitants of the christian kingdoms were even at this time distinguished  but these causes might long have failed of operating their effect had not a favorable incident prepared the means of introducing christianity into kent

devotional exercises had supported the credit of her faith by an irreproachable conduct and had employed every art of insinuation and address to reconcile her husband to her religious principles her popularity in the court and her influence over ethelbert had so well paved the way for the reception of the christian doctrine that gregory surnamed the great the present roman pontiff began to entertain hopes of effectuating a project which he himself before he mounted the papal throne had once embraced for converting the british saxons  it happened that this prelate being then in a private station had observed in the marketplace of rome some saxon youths exposed to sale whom the roman merchants in their trading voyages to britain had bought of their mercenary parents struck with the beauty of their fair complexions and blooming countenances gregory asked to what country they belonged and being told they were angles he replied that they ought more properly to be denominated angels and it was a pity that the prince of darkness should enjoy so fair a prey and that so beautiful a frontispiece should cover a mind devoid of internal grace and righteousness enquiring farther concerning the name of their province he was informed that it was deiri a division of northumberland deiri replied he that is good they are called to the mercy of god from his anger de ira but what is the name of the king of that province he was told it was aella or alla alleluiah cried he we must endeavor that the praises of god be sung in their country moved by these allusions which appeared to him so happy he determined to undertake himself a mission into britain and having obtained the popes permission he prepared for that dangerous journey but his popularity at home was so great that the

controversy between the pagans and the christians was not entirely cooled in that age and no pontiff before gregory had ever carried to greater excesses his intemperate zeal against the former

entirely ignorant stopped some time in france and sent back augustine to lay the hazards and difficulties before the pope and crave his permission to desist from the undertaking but gregory exhorted

great joy to the romans who now exulted as much in those peaceful trophies as their ancestors had ever done in their most sanguinary triumphs and most splendid victories gregory wrote a letter to

liberty had indeed been formerly granted by the roman law but that experience had shown that no posterity could ever come from such marriages and he therefore prohibited them augustine asks whether a woman pregnant might be baptized gregory answers that he sees no objection how soon after the birth the child might receive baptism it was answered immediately if requisite how soon a husband might have commerce with his wise after her delivery not till she had given suck to her child a practice to which gregory exhorts all women how soon a man might enter the church or receive the sacrament after having had commerce with his wife it was replied that unless he had approached her without desire merely for the sake of propagating his species he was not free from sin but in all cases it was

gregory and his missionary if sympathy of manners have any influence were better calculated than men of more refined understandings for making a progress with the ignorant and barbarous saxons  the

allured to frequent the christian worship when they fund it celebrated in a place which they were accustomed to revere as sacred and as the pagans practiced sacrifices and feasted with the priests on

because they celebrated easter on the very day of the full moon in march if that day fell on a sunday instead of waiting till the sunday following and because they shaved their whole forehead from ear

distribution of the people and such a strict confinement in their habitation may not be necessary in times when men are more enured to obedience and justice and might perhaps be regarded as destructive of liberty and commerce in a polished state but were well calculated to reduce these fierce and licentious people under the salutary restraint of law and government but alfred took care to temper these rigors by other institutions favorable to the freedom and security of the citizens and nothing could be more popular and liberal than his plan for the administration of justice the borsholder summoned together his whole decennary to assist him in deciding any lesser differences which occurred among the members of this small community in affairs of greater moment in appeals from

the freeholders of the county who possessed an equal vote in the decision of causes the bishop presided in this court together with the alderman and the proper object of the court was the receiving appeals from the hundreds and decennaries and the deciding such controversies as arose between men of different hundreds formerly the alderman possessed both the civil and military authority but alfred sensible that this coalition of powers rendered the nobility dangerous and independent appointed also a sheriff in each county who enjoyed a coordinate anthority with the former in the judicial

to the practice of the other northern conquerors and to the saxon laws during the heptarchy prevents us from regarding alfred as the sole author of this plan of government and leads us rather to think that like a wise man he contented himself with reforming extending and executing the institutions which he found previously established but on the whole such success attended his legislation that every thing bore suddenly a new face in england robberies and iniquities of all kinds were repressed by the punishment or reformation of the criminals ingulf p     and so exact was the general police

was another useful branch of his legislation and tended to reform the english from their former dissolute and barbarous manners but the king was guided in this pursuit less by his political views than by his natural bent and propensity toward letters when he came to the throne he found the english sunk into the grossest ignorance and barbarism proceeding from the continued disorders in the government and from the ravages of the danes the monasteries were destroyed the monks butchered or dispersed their libraries burnt and thus the only seats of erudition in those ages were totally

encouragement of learning was his own example and the constant assiduity with which notwithstanding the multitude and urgency of his affairs he employed himself in the pursuits of knowledge he usually divided his time into three equal portions one was employed in sleep and the refection of his body by diet and exercise another in the d spatch of business a third in study and devotion and that he

transactions of this war anlaf on the approach of the english army thought that he could not venture too much to ensure a fortunate event and employing the artifice formerly practiced by alfred against the danes he entered the enemys camp in the habit of a minstrel the stratagem was for the present attended with a like success he gave such satisfaction to the soldiers who flocked about him that they introduced him to the kings tent and anlaf having played before that prince and his nobles during their repast was dismissed with a handsome reward his prudence kept him from refusing the present but his pride determined him on his departure to bury it while he fancied that he was unespied by all the world but a soldier in athelstans camp who had formerly served under anlaf had been struck with some suspicion on the first appearance of the minstrel and was engaged by curiosity to observe all his motions he regarded this last action as a full proof of anlafs disguise and he immediately carried the intelligence to athelstan who blamed him for not sooner giving him information that he might have seized his enemy but the soldier told him that as he had formerly sworn fealty to anlaf he could never have pardoned himself the treachery of betraying and ruining his ancient master and that athelstan himself after such an instance of his criminal conduct would have equal reason to doubt of his allegiance athelstan having praised the generosity of the soldiers principles reflected on the incident which he foresaw might be attended with important consequences he removed his station in the camp and as a bishop arrived that evening with a reinforcement of troops for the ecclesiastics were then no less warlike than the civil magistrates he occupied with his train that very place which had been left vacant by the kings removal the precaution of athelstan was found prudent for no sooner had darkness fallen than anlaf broke into the camp and hastening directly to the

the most violent and most insolent ambition taking advantage of the implicit faith reposed in him by the king this churchman imported into england a new order of monks who much changed the state of ecclesiastical affairs and excited on their first establishment the most violent commotions  from the time of the first introduction of christianity among the saxons there had been monasteries in england and these establishments had extremely multiplied by the donations of the princes and nobles whose superstition derived from their ignorance and precarious life and increased by remorses for the crimes into which they were so frequently betrayed knew no other expedient for appeasing the deity than a profuse liberality toward the ecclesiastics but the monks had hitherto been a species of secular priests who lived in the convents after the manner of the present canons or prebendaries and were both intermingled in some degree with the world and endeavored to render themselves useful to it they were employed in the education of youth osberne in anglia sacra tom   p     they had the disposal of their own time and industry they were not subjected to the rigid rules of an order they had made no vows of implicit obedience to their superiors osberne p     and they still retained the choice without quitting the convent either of a married or a single life see whartons notes to anglia sacra tom   p    gervas p      chron wint ms apud spell conc p      but a mistaken piety had produced in italy a new species of monks called benedictines who carrying farther the plausible principles of mortification secluded themselves entirely from the world renounced all claim to liberty and made a merit of the most inviolable chastity these practices and principles which superstition at first engendered were greedily embraced and promoted by the policy of the court of rome the roman pontiff who was making every day great advances toward an universal sovereignty over the ecclesiastics perceived that the celibacy alone of the clergy could break off entirely their connection with the civil power and depriving them of every other object of ambition engage them to promote with unceasing industry the grandeur of their own order he was sensible that so long as the monks were indulged in marriage and were allowed families they never could be subjected to a strict rule or reduced to that slavery under their superiors which was requisite to procure to the orders issued from rome a ready and zealous obedience celibacy therefore began to be extolled as the indispensible duty of priests and the pope undertook to make all the clergy throughout the western world renounce at once the privilege of marriage a fortunate policy but at the same time an undertaking the most difficult of any since he had the strongest propensities of human nature to encounter and found that the same connexions with the female sex which generally encourages devotion was here unfavourable to the success of his project it is no wonder therefore that this master stroke of art should have met with violent contradiction and that the interests of the hierarchy and the inclinations of the priests being now placed in this singular opposition should notwithstanding the continued efforts of rome have retarded the execution of that bold scheme during the course of near three centuries  as the bishops and parochial clergy lived apart with their families and were more connected with the world the hopes of success with them were fainter and the pretense for making them renounce marriage was much less plausible but the pope having cast his eye on the monks as the basis of his authority was determined to reduce them under strict rules of obedience to procure them the credit of sanctity by an appearance of the most rigid mortifications and to break off all their other connections which might interfere with his spiritual policy under pretense therefore of reforming abuses which were in some degree unavoidable in the ancient establishments he had already spread over the southern countries of europe the strict rules of the monastic life and began to form attempts toward a like innovation in england the favorable opportunity offered itself and it was greedily seized arising from the weak superstition of edred and the violent impetuous character of dunstan  dunstan was born of noble parents in the west of england and being educated under his uncle aldhelm then archbishop of canterbury had betaken himself to the ecclesiastical life and had acquired some character in the court of edmund he was however defamed to that prince as a man of licentious manners osberne p    math west p      and finding his fortune blasted by these suspicions his ardent ambition prompted him to repair his indiscretions by running into an opposite extreme he secluded himself entirely from the world he framed a cell so small that he could neither stand erect in it nor stretch out his limbs during his repose and he here employed himself perpetually either in devotion or in manual labor osberne p     it is probable that his brain became gradually crazed by these solitary occupations and that he framed chimeras which being believed by himself and his stupid votaries procured him the general character of sanctity among the people he fancied that the devil among the frequent visits which he paid him was one day more earnest than usual in his temptations till dunstan provoked at his importunity seized him by the nose with a pair of redhot pincers as he put his head into the cell and he held him there till that malignant spirit made the whole neighborhood resound with his bellowings this notable exploit was seriously credited and extolled by the public it is transmitted to posterity by one who considering his age may pass for a writer of some elegance osberne p     and it insured to dunstan a reputation which no real piety much less virtue could even in the most enlightened period have ever been able to procure him with the people  supported by the character obtained in his retreat dunstan appeared again at court and gained such an ascendant over edred who had succeeded to the crown as made him not only the director of his conscience but his counselor in the most momentous affairs of government he was placed at the head of the treasury osberne p  0  wallingford p      and being thus possessed both of power at court and of credit with the populace he was enabled to attempt with success the most arduous undertakings finding that his advancement had been owing to the opinion of his austerity he professed himself a partizan of the rigid monastic rules and after introducing that reformation into the convents of glastenbury and abingdon he endeavored to render it universal in the kingdom  the minds of men were already well prepared for this innovation the praises of an inviolable chastity had been carried to the highest extravagance by some of the first preachers of christianity among the saxons the pleasures of love had been represented as incompatible with christian perfection and a total abstinence from all commerce with the sex was deemed such a meritorious penance as was sufficient to atone for the greatest enormities the consequence seemed natural that those at least who officiated at the altar should be clear of this pollution and when the doctrine of transubstantiation which was now creeping in spell conc vol   p      was once fully established the reverence to the real body of christ in the eucharist bestowed on this argument an additional force and influence the monks knew how to avail themselves of all these popular topics and to set off their own character to the best advantage they affected the greatest austerity of life and manners they indulged themselves in the highest strains of devotion they inveighed bitterly against the vices and pretended luxury of the age they were particularly vehement against the dissolute lives of the secular clergy their rivals every particular instance of libertinism in that order was represented as a general corruption and where other topics of defamation were wanting their marriage became a sure object of invective and their wives received the name of concubines or other more opprobrious appellation the secular clergy on the other hand who were numerous and rich and possessed of the ecclesiastical dignities defended themselves with vigor and endeavored to retaliate upon their adversaries the people were thrown into agitation and few instances occur of more violent dissentions excited by the most material differences in religion or rather by the most frivolous since it is a general remark that the more affinity there is between thological parties the greater commonly is their animosity  the progress of the monks which was become considerable was somewhat retarded by the death of edred their partizan who expired after a reign of nine years chron sax p      he left children but as they were infants his nephew edwy son to edmund was placed on the throne  edwy h hunting lib   p      he would have been the favorite of his people had he not unhappily on the commencement of his reign been engaged in a controversy with the monks whose rage neither the graces of the body nor virtues of the mind could mitigate and who have pursued his memory with the same unrelenting vengeance which they exercised against his person and dignity during his short and unfortunate reign there was a beautiful princess of the royal blood called elgiva who had made impression on the tender heart of edwy and as he was of an age when the force of the passions begins first to be felt he had ventured contrary to the advice of his gravest counselor and the remonstrances of the more dignified ecclesiastics w malmes lib   cap    to espouse her though she was within the degrees of affinity prohibited by the canon law ibid  as the austerity affected by the monks made them particularly violent on this occasion edwy entertained a strong prepossession against them and seemed on that account determined not to second their project of expelling the seculars from all the convents and of acquiring to themselves possession of those rich establishments the war was therefore declared between the king and the monks and the former soon found reason to repent him of his provoking such dangerous enemies on the day of his coronation his nobility were assembled in a great hall and were indulging themselves in that riot and disorder which from the example of their german ancestors had become habitual to the english wallingford p      when edwy attracted by softer pleasures retired into the queens apartments and in that privacy gave reins to his fondness

he had gained an entire ascendant he burst into the apartment upbraided edwy with his lasciviousness probably bestowed on the queen the most opprobrious epithet which can be applied to her sex and

brompton p      and pursued with unrelenting vengeance but his death which happened soon after freed his enemies from all farther inquietude and gave edgar peaceable possession of the government there is a seeming contradiction in ancient historians with regard to some circumstances of the story of edwy and elgiva it is agreed that this prince had a violent passion for his second or third consin elgiva whom he married though within the degrees prohibited by the canons it is also agreed that he was dragged from a lady on the day of his coronation and that the lady was afterward treated with the singular barbarity abovementioned the only difference is that osberne and some others call her his strumpet not his wife as she is said to be by malmesbury but this difference is easily reconciled for if edwy married her contrary to the canons the monks would be sure to deny her to be his wife and would insist that she could be nothing but his strumpet so that on the whole we may esteem this representation of the matter as certain at least as by far the most probable if edwy had only kept a mistress it is well known that there were methods of accommodation with the church which would have prevented the clergy from proceeding to such extremities against him but his marriage contrary to the canons was an insult on their authority and called for their highest resentment   edgar this prince who mounted the throne in such early youth soon discovered an excellent capacity in the administration of affairs and his reign is one of the most fortunate which we meet with in the ancient

desired effect and that when the king and prelates thus concurred with the popular prejudices it was not long before the monks prevailed and established their new rules in almost all the convents  we may remark that the declamations against the secular clergy are both here and in all the historians conveyed in general terms and as that order of men are commonly restrained by the decency of their character not to mention superior motives it is difficult to believe that the complaints against their dissolute manners could be so universally just as is pretended it is more probable that the monks paid court to the populace by an affected austerity of life and representing the most innocent liberties taken by the other clergy as great and unpardonable enormities thereby prepared the way for the increase of their own power and influence edgar however like a true politician concurred with the prevailing party and he even indulged them in pretensions which though they might when complied with engage the monks to support royal authority during his own reign proved afterward very dangerous to his successors and gave disturbance to the whole civil power he seconded the policy of the court of rome in granting to some monasteries an exemption from episcopal jurisdiction he allowed the convents even those of royal foundation to usurp the election of their own abbot and he admitted their forgeries of ancient charters by which from the pretended grant of former kings they assumed like privileges and exemptions chron sax p     w malmes lib   cap   seldeni spicileg ad eadm p           these merits of edgar have procured him the highest panegyrics from tho monks and he is transmitted to us not only under the character of a great politician and an active prince praises to which he seems to have been entitled but under that of a great saint and a man of virtue but nothing could more betray both his own hypocrisy in inveighing against the licentiousness of the secular clergy and the interested spirit of his partisans in bestowing such elogies on his piety than the usual tenor of his conduct which was licentious to the highest degree and violated every law human and divine yet those very monks who as we are told by ingulf a very ancient historian had no idea of any moral or religious merit except chastity and obedience not only connived at his enormities but loaded him with the highest praises history however has preserved some instances of his amors from which as from a specimen we may form a conjecture of the rest  edgar broke into a convent carried off editha a nun by

leisure to employ courtship or address for attaining his purpose he went directly to her mother ceclared the violence of his passion and desired that the young lady might be allowed to pass that very night with him the mother was a woman of virtue and determined not to dishonor her daughter and her family by compliance but bring well acquainted with the impetuosity of the kings temper she thought it would be easier as well as safer to deceive than refuse him she feigned therefore a submission to his will but secretly ordered a waiting maid of no disagreeable figure to steal into the kings bed after all the company should be retired to rest in the morning before day break the damsel agreeable to the injunctions of her mistress offered to retire but edgar who had no reserve in his pleasures

hoped she had now inspired the king made probably but a faint resistance and the return of light discovered the deceit to edgar he had passed a night so much to his satisfaction that he expressed no

frequent panegyrics which he heard of elfrida and reflecting on her noble birth he resolved if he found her charms answerable to their fame to obtain possession of her on honorable terms he communicated his intention to earl ethelwold his favorite but used the precaution before he made any advances to her parents to order that nobleman on some pretense to pay them a visit and to bring him a certain account of the beauty of their daughter ethelwold when introduced to the young lady found general report to have fallen much short of the truth and being enflamed with the highest love he determined to sacrifice to this new passion all his sidelity to his master and to the trust reposed in him he returned to edgar and told him that the riches alone and high quality of elfrida had been the ground of the admiration paid her and that her charms far from being any wise extraordinary would have been overlooked in a woman of interior station when he had by this deceit turned the king from his purpose he took an opportunity after some interval of turning again the conversation on elfrida and he remarked that though the parentage and fortune of the lady had not produced on him as on others any illusion with regard to her beauty he could not forbear reflecting that she would on the whole be an advantageous match for him and might by her birth and riches make him a sufficient compensation for the homeliness of her person if the king therefore gave his approbation to the design he was determined to make proposals in his own benalf to the earl of devonshire and doubted not to obtain his as well as the young ladys consent to the marriage edgar pleased with an expedient for establishing his favourites fortune not only exhorted him to execute his purpose but forwarded its success by his recommendations to the parents of elfrida and athelwold was soon made happy in the possession of his mistress dreading however the detection of the artifice he employed every pretense

the advantages which the numerous enemies that always pursue a royal favorite would by its means be able to make against him edgar was soon informed of the truth but before he would execute vengeance on athelwolds treachery he resolved to satisfy himself with his own eyes of the certainty and full extent of his guilt he told him that he intended to pay him a visit in his castle and be introduced

people we ought perhaps to deem their acquaintance with foreigners rather an advantage as it tended to enlarge their views and to cure them of those illiberal prejudices and rustic manners to which islanders are often subject  another remarkable incident of this reign was the extirpation of wolves from england this advantage was attained by the industrious policy of edgar he took great pains in hunting and pursuing those ravenous animals and when found that they had all taken shelter in the mountains and forests of wales he changed the tribute of money imposed on the welsh princes by athelstan his predecessor w malmes lib   cap   brompton p      into an annual tribute of three hundred heads of wolves which produced such diligence in hunting them that the creature has been no more

and more southern coasts of europe he collected a body of troops which like that of all these ravagers was composed of norwegians swedes frisians danes and adventurers of all nations who being accustomed to a roving unsettled life took delight in nothing but war and plunder his reputation drew him associates from all quarters and a vision which he pretended to have appeared to him in his

freebooters in northumberland and having restored peace to his harrassed country had established the most excellent military as well as civil institutions among the english the prudent dane finding that no advantages could be gained over such a people governed by such a prince soon turned his enterprises against france which he found more exposed to his inroads gul gemet lib   cap    and during the reigns of eudes and usurper and of charles the simple a weak prince he committed the most destructive ravages on the inland as well as maritime provinces of that kingdom the french having no means

invaders a settlement in some of those provinces which they had depopulated by their arms duds p      the reason why the danes for many years pursued measures so different from those embraced by the goths vandals franks burgundians lombards and other northern conquerors was the great difference in the method of attack which was practiced by these several nations and to which the nature of their particular situations necessarily confined them the latter tribes living in an inland country made incursions by land upon the roman empire and when they entered far into the frontiers they were obliged to carry along with them their wives and families whom they had no hopes of soon revisiting and who could not otherwise participate of their plunder this circumstance quickly made them think of forcing a settlement in the provinces which they had overrun and these barbarians spreading themselves over the country found an interest in protecting the property and industry of the people whom they subdued but the danes and norvegians invited by their maritime situation and obliged to subsist themselves in their uncultivated country by fishing had acquired some experience of navigation and in their military excursions pursued the method practiced against the roman empire by the more early saxons they made descents in small bodies from their ships or rather boats and ravaging the coasts returned with the booty to their families whom they could not conveniently carry along with them in these hazardous enterprises but when they increased their armaments made incursions into the inland countries and found it safe to remain longer in the midst of the enemy they had been accustomed to crowd their vessels with their wives and children and having no longer any temptation to return into their own country they willingly embraced an opportunity of settling in the warm climates and cultivated fields of the south  affairs were in this situation with rollo and his followers when charles proposed to relinquish to them the province formerly called neustria and to purchase peace of them on these hard conditions after all the terms were fully agreed there appeared only one circumstance shocking to the haughty dane he was required to do homage to charles for his province and to put himself in that humiliating posture imposed on vassals by the rites of the feudal law he long refused to submit to this indignity but being unwilling to lose such important advantages for a mere ceremony he made a sacrifice of his pride to his interest and acknowledged himself in form the vassal of the french monarch ypod neust p      charles gave him his daughter gisla in marriage and that he might bind him faster to his interests made him a donation of a considerable territory besides what he was obliged to surrender to him by his stipulations when some of the french nobles informed him that in return for so generous a present it was expected that he should throw himself at the kings feet and make suitable acknowledgments for his bounty rollo replied that he would rather break off the whole treaty and it was with some difficulty they could persuade him to make that compliment by one of his captains the dane commissioned for this purpose full of indignation at the order and despising so unwarlike a prince caught charles by the foot and pretending to carry it to his mouth that he might kiss it overthrew him before all his courtiers the french nation sensible of their present weakness found it prudent to overlook this insult gul gemet lib   cap      rollo who was now in the

found as yet so little example of civilized manners among the english that they retained all their ancient ferocity and valued themselves only on their national character of military bravery the recent as well as more ancient achievements of their countrymen tended to sustain this idea and the english princes particularly athelstan and edgar sensible of that superiority had been accustomed to keep in pay bodies of danish troops who were quartered about the country and committed many violences upon the inhabitants these mercenaries had attained to such a height of luxury according to the old english writers wallingford p      that they combed their hair once a day bathed themselves once a week changed their clothes frequently and by all these arts of effeminacy as well as by their military character had rendered themselves so agreeable to the fair sex that they debauched the wives and daughters of the english and had dishonored many families but what most provoked the inhabitants instead of defending them against invaders they were ever ready to betray them to the foreign danes and to associate themselves with all the straggling parties of that nation the animosity between the inhabitants of english and danish race had from these repeated injuries risen to a great height when ethelred from a policy incident to weak princes embraced the cruel resolution of massacring the latter throughout all his dominions almost all the ancient historians speak of this massacre of the danes as if it had been universal and as if every individual of that nation throughout england had been put to death but the danes were almost the sole inhabitants in the kingdoms of northumberland and eastanglia and were very numerous in mercia this representation therefore of the matter is absolutely impossible great resistance must have been made and violent wars insued which was not the case this account given by walingford though he stands single must be admitted as the only true one we are told that the name lane lord dane for an idle lazy fellow who lives at other peoples expense came from the conduct of the danes who were put to death but the english princes

were dispatched to commence the execution every where on the same day and the festival of st brice which fell on a sunday the day on which the danes usually bathed themselves was chosen for that

inexperience was very unfit to oppose the pretensions of so popular and enterprising a rival the animosity which he had long borne earl godwin made him averse to the succession of his son and he could not without extreme reluctance think of an increase of grandeur to a family which had risen on the ruins of royal authority and which by the murder of alfred his brother had contributed so much to the

his temper appeared in a rigorous administration of justice and having found the happy effects of this plan of government without which the laws in those ages became totally impotent he established it as a fixed maxim that an inflexible conduct was the first duty of a sovereign  the tranquillity which he had established in his dominions had given william leisure to pay a visit to the king of

royal authority his steady duty to his prince and the little necessity there was after such an uniform trial of his obedience to keep any longer those hostages who had been required on the first

great an obligation he promised that the present grandeur of harolds family which supported itself with difficulty under the jealousy and hatred of edward should receive new increase from a successor

ambition suggested casuistry sufficient to justify to him the violation of an oath which had been extorted from him by fear and which if fulfilled might be attended with the subjection of his native country to a foreign power he continued still to practice every art of popularity to increase the number of his partisans to reconcile the minds of the english to the idea of his succession to revive their hatred of the normans and by an ostentation of his power and influence to deter the timorous edward from executing his intended destination in favor of william fortune about this time threw two incidents in his way by which he was enabled to acquire general favor and to increase the character which he had already obtained of virtue and capacity  the welsh though a less formidable enemy than the danes had been long accustomed to infest the western borders and after committing spoil on the low countries they usually made a hasty retreat into their mountains where they were sheltered from the pursuit of their enemies and were ready to seize the first favorable opportunity of renewing their depredations griffith their present prince had much distinguished himself in these incursions and his name had become so terrible to the english that harold found he could do nothing more acceptable to the public and more honorable to himself than the suppressing so dangerous an enemy he formed the plan of an expedition against wales and having prepared some light armed foot to pursue the natives into their fastnesses some cavalry to scour the open country and a squadron of ships to attack the seacoast he employed at once all these forces against the welsh prosecuted his advantages with vigor made no intermission in his assaults and at last reduced the enemy to such distress that in order to prevent their total destruction they made a sacrifice of their prince whose head they cut off and sent to harold and they were contented to receive as their sovereigns two welsh noblemen

morcar and edwin two brothers who possessed great power in those quarters and who were grandsons of the great duke leofric concurred in the insurrection and the former being elected duke advanced with an army to oppose harold who was commissioned by the king to reduce and punish the northumbrians before the armies came to action morcar well acquainted with the generous disposition of the english commander endeavored to justify his conduct and represented to him that tosti had behaved in a manner unworthy of the station to which he was advanced and no one not even a brother could support such tyranny without participating in some degree of the infamy attending it that the northumbrians accustomed to a legal administration and regarding it as their birthright were willing to submit to the king but required a governor who would pay regard to their rights and privileges that they had been taught by their ancestors that death was preferable to servitude and had come to the field determined to perish rather than bear a renewal of those indignities to which they had been so long exposed and they trusted that harold on reflection would not defend in another that violent conduct from which in his own government he had always kept at so great a distance higden p      this vigorous remonstrance was accompanied with such a detail of facts so well supported that harold found it prudent to abandon his brothers cause and returning to edward he persuaded him to pardon the northumbrians and to confirm morcar in the government chron sax p     w malm p    h hunt p     higden p

duke of normandy and william clearly perceived that he could no longer rely on the oaths and promises which he had extorted from him but the english nobleman thought himself now in such a situation that it was no longer necessary for him to dissemble he had in his conduct against the northumbrians given such a specimen of his moderation as had gained him the affections of his countrymen he saw that almost all england was under the command of himself or his friends while he possessed the government of wessex morcar that of northumberland and edwin that of mercia he now openly aspired to the succession and insisted that since it was necessary by the confession of all to set aside the royal family on account of the imbecility of edgar the sole surviving heir there was no one so capable of filling the throne as a nobleman of great power of mature age of long experience of approved courage and ability who being a native of the kingdom would effectually secure it against the dominion and tyranny of foreigners edward broken with age and infirmities saw the difficulties too great for him to encounter and though his inveterate prepossessions kept him from seconding the pretensions of harold he took but feeble and irresolute steps for securing the succession to the duke of normandy the whole story of the transactions between edward harold and the duke of normandy is told so differently by the ancient writers that there are few important passages of the english history liable to so great uncertainty i have followed the account which appeared to me the most consistent and probable it does not seem likely that edward ever executed a will in the dukes favor much less that he got it ratified by the states of the kingdom as is affirmed by some the will would have been known to all and would have been produced by the conqueror to whom it gave so plausible and really so just a title but the doubtful and ambiguous manner in which he seems always to have mentioned it proves that he could only plead the known intentions of that monarch in his favor which he was desirous to call a will there is indeed a charter of the conqueror preserved by dr hickes vol   where he calls himself rex hereditarius meaning heir by will but a prince possessed of so much power and attended with so much success may employ what pretenses he pleases it is sufficient to refute his pretenses to observe that there is a great diffidence and variation among the historians with regard to a point which had it been real must have been agreed upon by all of them  again some historians particularly malmesbury and matthew westminster affirm that harold had no intention of going over to normandy but that taking the air in a pleasureboat on the coast he was driven over by stress of weather to the territories of guy count of ponthieu but besides that this story is not probable in itself and is contradicted by most of the ancient historians it is refuted by a very curious and authentic monument lately discovered it is a tapestry preserved in the ducal palace of rouen and supposed to have been wrought by orders of matilda wife to the emperor at least it is of very great antiquity harold is there represented as taking his departure from k edward in execution of some commission and mounting his vessel with a great train the design of redeeming his brother and nephew who were hostages is the most likely cause that can be assigned and is accordingly mentioned by eadmer hoveden brompton and simeon of durham for a farther account of this piece of tapestry see histoire de lacademie de literature tom ix page        while he continued in this uncertainty he was surprised by sickness which brought him to his grave on the fifth of january  0   in the sixtyfifth year of his age and twentyfifth of his reign  this prince to whom the monks gave the title of saint and confessor was the last of the saxon line who ruled in england and though his reign was peaceable and fortunate he owed this prosperity less to his own ability than to the conjunctures of the times the danes employed in other enterprises attempted not those incursions which had been so troublesome to all his predecessors and fatal to some of them the facility of his disposition made him acquiesce under the government of godwin and his son harold and the capacity as well as the power of these noblemen enabled them while they were entrusted with authority to preserve domestic peace and tranquillity the most commendable circumstance of edwards government was his attention to the administration of justice and his compiling for that purpose a body of laws which he collected from the laws of ethelbert ina and alfred this compilation though now lost for the laws that pass under edwards name were composed afterward spelm in verbo bailiva  were long the objects of affection to the english nation  edward the confessor was the first who touched for the kings evil the opinion of his sanctity procured belief to this cure among the people and his successors regarded it as a part of their power and grandeur to uphold the same opinion it has been continued down to our time and the practice was first dropped by the present royal family who observed that it could no longer give amazement even to the populace and was attended with ridicule in the eyes of all men of understanding  harold january harold had so well prepared matters before the death of the king that he immediately stepped into the vacant throne and his accession was attended with as little opposition and disturbance as if he had succeeded by the most undoubted hereditary title the citizens of london were his zealous partisans the bishops and clergy had adopted his cause and all the most powerful nobility connected with him by alliance or friendship willingly seconded his pretensions the title of edgar atheling was scarce ever mentioned much less the claim of the duke of normandy and harold assembling the council received the crown from their hands without waiting for any regular meeting of the states or submitting the question to their free choice or determination g pict p

that edward left him his successor by will  if there were any malcontents at this resolution they were obliged to conceal their sentiments and the new prince taking a general silence for consent and founding his title on the supposed suffrages of the people which appeared unanimous was on the day immediately succeeding edwards death crowned and anointed king by aldred archbishop of york the whole nation seemed joyfully to swear allegiance to him  the first symptoms of danger which the king discovered came from abroad and from his own brother tosti who had submitted to a voluntary banishment in flanders enraged at the successful ambition of harold to which he himself had fallen a sacrifice he filled the court of baldwin with complaints of the injustice which he had suffered he engaged the interest of that family against his brother he endeavored to form intrigues with some malcontent nobility of england he sent his emissaries to norway in order to rouse to arms the freebooters of that kingdom and excite their hopes of reaping advantage from the unsettled state of affairs on the usurpation of the new king and that he might render the combination more formidable he made a journey to normandy in expectation that the duke who had married matilda another daughter of baldwin would in revenge of his own injuries as well as those of tosti second by his councils and forces the projected invasion of england order vitalis p       the duke of normandy when he first received intelligence of harolds intrigues and accession had been moved to the highest pitch of indignation but that he might give the better color to his pretensions he sent over an ambassy to england upbraiding that prince with his breach of faith and summoning him to resign immediately possession of the kingdom harold replied to the norman ambassadors that the oath with which he was reproached had been extorted by the well grounded fear of violence and could never for that reason be regarded as obligatory that he had had no commission either from the late king or the states of england who alone could dispose of the crown to make any tender of the successon to the duke of normandy and if he a private person had assumed so much authority and had even voluntarily sworn to support the dukes pretensions the oath was unlawful and it was his duty to seize the first opportunity of breaking it that he had obtained the crown by the unanimous suffrages of the people and should show himself totally unworthy of their favor did he not strenuously maintain those national liberties with which they had entrusted him and that the duke if he made any attempt by force of arms should experience the power of an united nation conducted by a prince who sensible of the obligations imposed on him by his royal dignity was determined that the same moment should put a period to his life and to his government w malm p    higden p     m west p     degest angl incerto auctore p       this answer was no other than william expected and he had previously fixed his resolution of making an attempt upon england consulting only his courage his resentment and his ambition he overlooked all the difficulties which must attend an attack of a great kingdom by such inferior force and he saw only the circumstances which would facilitate his enterprise he considered that england ever since the accession of canute had enjoyed a most profound tranquillity during a period of near fifty years and it would require time for its soldiers enervated by long peace to learn discipline and its generals experience he knew that it was entirely unprovided of fortified towns by which it could prolong the war but must venture its whole fortune in one decisive action against a veteran enemy who being once master of the field would be in a condition to overrun the kingdom he saw that harold though he had given proofs of vigor and bravery had newly mounted a throne which he had acquired by faction from which he had excluded a very ancient royal family and which was likely to totter under him by its own instability much more if shaken by any violent external impulse and he hoped that the very circumstance of his crossing the seas quitting his own country and leaving himself no hopes of retreat as it would astonish the enemy by the boldness of the enterprise would inspirit his soldiers from despair and rouse them to sustain the reputation of the norman arms  the normans as they had long been distinguished by valor among all the european nations had at this time attained to the highest pitch of military renown and glory besides acquiring by arms such a noble territory in france besides defending it against continual attempts of the french monarch and all its neighbors besides exerting many actions of vigor under their present sovereign they had about this very time revived their ancient fame by the most hazardous exploits and the most wonderful successes in the other extremity of europe

faction and rebellion excited the ambition of the haughty william who disdained after such examples of fortune and valor to be deterred from making an attack on a neighboring country where he could be supported by the whole force of his principality  the situation also of europe inspired william with hopes that besides his brave normans he might employ against england the flower of the military force which was dispersed in all the other states france germany and the low countries by the progress of the feudal institutions were divided and subdivided into many small principalities and baronies and the possessors enjoying the civil jurisdiction within themselves as well as the right of arms acted in many respects as independent sovereigns and maintained their properties and privileges less by the authority of laws than by their own force and valor a military spirit had universally diffused itself throughout europe and the several leaders whose minds were elevated by their princely situation greedily embraced the most adventurous enterprises and being accustomed to nothing from their infancy but recitals of the success attending wars and battles they were prompted by a natural ambition to imitate those adventures which they heard so much celebrated and which were so much exaggerated by the credulity of the age united however loosely by their duty to one superior lord and by their connexions with the great body of the community to which they belonged they desired to spread their fame each beyond his own district and in all assemblies whether instituted for civil deliberations for military expeditions or merely for show and entertainment to outshine each other by the reputation of strength and prowess hence their genius for chivalry hence their impatience of peace and tranquillity and hence their readiness to embark in any hazardous enterprise however little interested in its failure or success  william by his power his courage and his abilities had long maintained a preeminence among those haughty chieftains and every one who desired to distinguish himself by his address in military exercises or his valor in action had been ambitions of acquiring a reputation in the court and in the armies of normandy entertained with that hospitality and courtesy which distinguished the age they had formed attachments with the prince

removing many obstacles which it was natural for him to expect in an undertaking where all his neighbors were so deeply interested conan duke of britanny was his mortal enemy and in order to throw a

reigning french monarch was a minor and william having communicated his project to the council having desired assistance and offered to do homage in case of his success for the crown of england was indeed ordered to lay aside all thoughts of the enterprise but the earl of flanders his fatherinlaw being at the head of the regency favored underhand his levies and encouraged the enterprizing nobility to inlist under the standard of the duke of normandy  the emperor henry iv besides giving openly all his vassals permission to embark in this expedition which so much engaged the attention of europe promised his protection to the duchy of normandy during the absence of the prince and thereby enabled him to draw his whole force to the attack of england gul pict p      but the most important ally whom william gained by his negotiations was the pope who had a mighty influence over the ancient barons no less devout in their religious principles than valorous in their military enterprises the roman pontiff after an insensible progress during several ages of darkness and ignorance began now to lift his head openly above all the princes of europe to assume the office of a mediator or even an arbitrator in the quarrels of the greatest monarchs to interpose himself in all secular affairs and to obtrude his dictates as sovereign laws on his obsequious disciples it was a sufficient motive to alexander ii the reigning pope for embracing williams quarrel that he alone had made an appeal to his tribunal and rendered him umpire of the dispute between him and harold but there were other advantages which that pontiff foresaw must result from the conquest of england by the norman arms that kingdom though at first converted by romish missionaries though it had afterward advanced some farther steps toward subjection under rome maintained still a great independance in its ecclesiastical administration and forming a world within itself entirely separated from the rest of europe it had hitherto proved inaccessible to those exorbitant claims which supported the grandeur of the papacy alexander therefore hoped that the french and norman barons if successful in their enterprise might import into that country a more devoted reverence to the holy see and bring the english churches to a nearer conformity with those of the rest of europe he declared immediately in favor of williams claim w malm p  00 ingulf p    higden p     brompton p      pronounced harold a perjured usurper denounced excommunication against him and his adherents and the more to encourage the duke of

safely with the broad mantle of religion  but the greatest difficulty which william had to encounter in his preparations arose from his own subjects in normandy the states of the duchy were assembled at lislebonne and supplies being demanded for the intended enterprise which promised so much glory and advantage to their country there appeared a reluctance in many members both to grant sums so much beyond the common measure of taxes in that age and to set a precedent of performing their military service out of their own country the duke finding it dangerous to solicit them in a body conferred separately with the richest persons in the province and beginning with those whose affections he most relied on he gradually engaged all of them to advance the sums demanded the count of longueville seconded him in this negotiation the count of mortaigne odo bishop of baieux and especially william fitzosberne count of breteuil and constable of the duchy every person when he himself was once engaged endeavored to bring over others and at last the states themselves after stipulating that this concession should be no precedent for the future voted that they would assist their prince to the

regarded as the immediate cause of his ruin he lost many of his bravest officers and soldiers in the action and he disgusted the rest by refusing to distribute the danish spoils among them w walm p

probably occasioned he hastened by quick marches to reach this new invader but though he was reinforced at london and other places with fresh troops he found himself also weakened by the desertion of his old soldiers who from fatigue and discontent secretly withdrew from their colors his brother gurth a man of bravery and conduct began to entertain apprehensions of the event and remonstrated with the king that it would be better policy to prolong the war or at least to spare his own person in the action he urged to him that the desperate situation of the duke of normandy made it requisite for that prince to bring matters to a speedy decision and put his whole fortune on the issue of a battle but that the king of england in his own country beloved by his subjects provided of every supply had more infallible and less dangerous methods of ensuring to himself the victory that the norman troops elevated on the one hand with the highest hopes and seeing on the other no resource in case of a discomfiture would fight to the last extremity and being the flower of all the warriors of the continent must be regarded as formidable to the english that if their first fire and spirit which is always most dangerous were allowed to languish for want of action if they were harassed with small skirmishes straitened in provisions and fatigued with the bad weather and deep roads during the winterseason which was approaching they must fall an easy and a bloodless prey to their enemy that if a general action was delayed the english sensible of the imminent danger to which their properties as well as liberties were exposed from these rapacious invaders would hasten from all quarters to his assistance and would render his army invincible that at least if he thought it necessary to hazard a battle he ought not to expose his own person but reserve in case of disastrous accidents some resource to the liberty and independance of the kingdom and that having once been so unfortunate as to be constrained to swear and that upon the holy relics to support the pretensions of the duke of normandy it were better that another person should command the army who not being bound by these sacred

being elated with his past prosperity as well as stimulated by his native courage he resolved to give battle in person and for that purpose he drew near to the normans who had removed their camp and fleet to hastings where they fixed their quarters he was so confident of success that he sent a message to the duke promising him a sum of money if he would depart the kingdom without effusion of blood but his offer was rejected with disdain and william not to be behind with his enemy in vaunting sent him a message by some monks requiring him either to resign the kingdom or to hold it of him

morning the duke called together the most considerable of his chieftains and made them a speech suitable to the occasion he represented to them that the event which they and he had long wished for was approaching and the whole fortune of the war now depended on their sword and would be decided in a single action that never army had greater motives for exerting a vigorous courage whether they considered the prize which would attend their victory or the inevitable destruction which must ensue upon their discomfiture that if their martial and veteran bands could once break those raw soldiers who had rashly dared to approach them they conquered a kingdom at one blow and were jstly entitled to all its possessions as the reward of their prosperous valor that on the contrary if they remitted in the least their wonted prowess an enraged enemy hung upon their rear the sea met them in their retreat and an ignominious death was the certain punishment of their imprudent cowardice that by collecting so numerous and brave a host he had ensured every human means of conquest and the commander of the enemy by his criminal conduct had given him just cause to hope for the favor of heaven in whose hands alone lay the event of wars and battles and that a perjured usurper anathematized by the sovereign pontiff and conscious of his own breach of faith would be struck with terror on their

furious combat which remained long undecided the former overcome by the difficulty of the ground and hard pressed by the enemy began first to relax their vigor then to give ground and confusion was

restored the action the english were obliged to retreat with loss and the duke ordering his second line to advance renewed the attack with fresh forces and with redoubled courage finding that the enemy supported by the advantage of ground and animated by the example of their prince still made a vigorous resistance he tried a stratagem which was very delicate in its management but which seemed advisable in his desperate situation when if he gained not a decisive victory he was totally undone he ordered his troops to make a hasty retreat and to allure the enemy from their ground by the appearance of flight the artifice succeeded against these unexperienced troops who heated by the action and sanguine in their hopes precipitantly followed the normans into the plain w malm p  0  h

the hill where being rallied again by the bravery of harold they were able notwithstanding their loss to maintain the post and continue the combat the duke tried the same stratagem a second time with the same success but even after this double advantage he still found a great body of the english who maintaining themselves in firm array seemed determined to dispute the victory to the last extremity he ordered his heavy armed infantry to make the assault upon them while his archers placed behind should gall the enemy who were exposed by the situation of the ground and who were intent in defending them selves against the swords and spears of the assailants diceto p   0  by this disposition he at last prevailed harold was slain by an arrow while he was combating with great bravery at the head of

rules of proof  military force  public revenue  value of money  manners  the government of the germans and that of all the northern nations who established themselves on the ruins of rome was always extremely free and those fierce people accustomed to independance and enured to arms were more guided by persuasion than authority in the submission which they paid their princes the military despotism which had taken place in the roman empire and which previously to the irruption of these conquerors had sunk the genius of men and destroyed every noble principle of science and virtue was unable to resist the vigorous efforts of a free people and europe as from a new epoch rekindled her ancient spirit and shook off the base servitude to arbitrary will and authority under which it had so long labored the free constitutions then established however impaired by the encroachments of succeeding princes still preserve an air of independance and legal administration which distinguish the european nations and if that part of the globe maintain sentiments of liberty honor equity and valor superior to the rest of mankind it owes these advantages chiefly to the seeds implanted by those generous barbarians  first saxon government the saxons who subdued britain as they enjoyed great liberty in their own country obstinately retained that invaluable possession in their new settlement and they imported into this island the same principles of independance which they had inherited from their ancestors the chieftains for such they were more properly than kings or princes who commanded them in those military expeditions still possessed a very limited authority and as the saxons exterminated rather than subdued the ancient inhabitants they were indeed transplanted into a new territory but preserved unaltered all their civil and military institutions the language was pure saxon even the names of places which often remain while the tongue entirely changes were almost all affixed by the new conquerors the manners and customs were wholly german and the same picture of a fierce and bold liberty which is drawn by the masterly pencil of tacitus will apply to these founders of the english government the king so far from being entitled to an arbitrary power was only considered as the first among the citizens his authority depended more on his personal qualities than on his station he was even so far on a level with the other inhabitants that a stated price was affixed to his head and a legal fine was levied from his murderer which though proportioned to his station and superior to that paid for the life of a subject was a sensible mark of his subordination to the community  succession of the kings it is easy to imagine that an independent people so little restrained by laws and cultivated by science would not be very strict in maintaining a regular succession of their princes though they paid a great respect to the royal family and ascribed to them an undisputed superiority they either had no rule or none that was steadily observed in filling the vacant throne and present convenience in that emergency was more attended to than general principles we are not however to suppose that the crown was considered as altogether elective and that a regular plan was traced by the constitution for supplying by the suffrages of the people every vacancy made by the decease of the first magistrate if any king on his death left a son of an age and capacity fit for government the young prince naturally stepped into the throne if he was a minor his uncle or the next prince of the blood was promoted to the government and left the scepter to his posterity any sovereign by taking previous measures with the leading men had it greatly in his power to appoint his successor all these changes and indeed the ordinary administration of government required the express concurrence or at least the tacit consent of the people but present possession however obtained went far toward procuring their obedience and the idea of any right which was once excluded was but feeble and imperfect this is so much the case in all barbarous monarchies and occurs so often in the history of the anglo saxons that we cannot consistently entertain any other notion of their government the idea of an hereditary succession in authority is so natural to men and is so much fortified by the usual rule in transmitting private possessions that it must retain a great influence on every society who do not exclude it by the refinements of a republican constitution but as there is a sensible difference between government and private possessions and every one is not equally qualified for the one as for the other a people who are not sensible of the general advantages attending a fixed rule are apt to make great leaps in the succession and frequently to pass over the person who had he possessed the requisite years and abilities would have been thought entitled to the authority thus these monarchies are not strictly speaking either elective or hereditary and though the destination of a prince may often be followed in appointing his successor they can as little be regarded as wholly testamentary the suffrages of the states may sometimes establish a sovereign but they more frequently recognize him whom they find established a few great men take the lead the people overawed and influenced acquiesce in the government and the reigning prince provided he be of the royal family passes undisputably for the legal sovereign  the wittenagemot it is confessed that our knowledge of the anglosaxon history and antiquities is too imperfect to afford us means of determining with certainty all the prerogatives of the crown and privileges of the people or of giving an exact delineation of that government it is probable also that the constitution might be somewhat different in the different nations of the heptarchy and that it changed considerably during the course of six centuries which elapsed from the first invasion of the saxons till the norman conquest we know of one change not inconsiderable in the saxon constitution the saxon annals p    inform us that it is the prerogative of the king to name the dukes earls alderman and sheriffs of the counties affer a contemporary writer informs us that alfred deposed all the ignorant aldermen and appointed men of more capacity in their place yet the laws of edward the confessor    say expressly that the heretoghs or dukes and the sheriffs were chosen by the freeholders in the folkmote a county court which was assembled once a year and where all the freeholders swore allegiance to the king  but most of these differences and changes with their causes and effects are unknown to us it only appears that at all times and in all the kingdoms there was a national council called a wittenagemot or assembly of the wise men for that is the import of the term whose consent was requisite for the enacting laws and for ratifying the chief acts of public administration the preambles to all the laws of ethelbert ina alfred edward the elder athelstan edmond edgar ethelred and edward the confessor even those to the laws of canute though a kind of conqueror put this matter beyond controversy and carry proofs every where of a limited and legal government but who were the constituent members of this wittenagemot has not been determined with certainty by antiquarians it is agreed that the bishops and abbots sometimes abbesses were admitted at least they often sign the kings charters of grants spellm gloss in verbo parliamentum were an essential part and it is also evident from the tenor of these ancient laws that the wittenagemot enacted statutes which regulated the ecclesiastical as well as civil government and that those dangerous principles by which the church is totally severed from the state were hitherto unknown to the anglosaxons wilkins passim  it also appears that the aldermen or governors of counties who after the danish times were often called earls it appears from the ancient translations of the saxon annals and laws and from king alfreds translation of bid as well as from all the ancient historians that comes in latin alderman in saxon and ar in danosaxon were quite synonimous there is only a clause of a law of king athelstans see spelm conc p  0  which has stumbled some antiquarians and has made them imagine that an earl was superior to an alderman the weregild or the price of an earls blood is there fixed at   000 thrimsas equal to that of an archbishop whereas that of a bishop and alderman is only  000 thrimsas to solve this difficulty we must have recourse to seldens conjecture see his titles of honor chap   p  0   0  that the term of earl was in the age of athelstan just beginning to be of use in england and stood at that time for the atheling or prince of the blood heir to the crown this he confirms by a law of canute    where an atheling and an archbishop are put upon the same footing in another law of the same athelstan the weregild of the prince or atheling is said to be   000 thrimsas see wilkins p    he is therefore the same who is called earl in the former law  were admitted into this council and gave their consent to the public statutes but besides the prelates and aldermen there is also mention of the wites or wisemen as a distinct branch of the wittenagemot but who these were is not so clearly ascertained by the laws or the history of that period the matter would probably be of difficult discussion even were it examined impartally but as our parties have chosen to divide on this head the question has been disputed with the greater acrimony and the arguments on both sides have become on that account the more captious and deceitful our monarchical faction maintain that these wites or sapientes were the judges or men learned in the law the popular party assert them to be representatives of the boroughs or what we now call the commons  the expressions employed by all the ancient historians in mentioning the wittenagemot seem to contradict the latter supposition the members are almost always called the principes satrapae optimates magnates proceres terms which seem to suppose an aristocracy and to exclude the commons the boroughs also from the low state of commerce were so small and poor and the inhabitants lived in such dependence on the great men bradys treatise of english boroughs p       etc  that it seems nowise probable they would be admitted as a part of the national councils the commons are well known to have had no share in the governments established by the franks burgundians and other northern nations and we may conclude that the saxons who remained longer barbarous and uncivilized than these tribes would never think of conferring such an extraordinary privilege on trade and industry the military profession alone was honorable among all those conquerors the warriors subsisted by their possessions in land they became considerable by their influence over their vassals retainers tenants and slaves and it had need of strong proofs to convince us that they would admit any of a rank so much inferior as the burgesses to share with them in the legislative authority tacitus indeed affirms that among the ancient germans the consent of all the members of the community was required in every important deliberation but he speaks not of representatives and this ancient practice mentioned by the roman historians could only have place in small tribes where every citizen might without inconvenience be assembled upon any extraordinary emergency after principalities became more extensive after the differences of property had formed distinctions more important than those arising from personal strength and valor we may conclude that the national assemblies must have been more limited in their number and composed only of the more considerable citizens  but though we must exclude the burgesses or commons from the saxon wittinagemot there is some necessity for supposing that this assembly consisted of other members beside the prelates abbots aldermen and the judges or privy council for as all these excepting some of the ecclesiastics there is some reason to think that the bishops were sometimes chosen by the wittenagemot and confirmed by the king eddius cap   the abbots in the monasteries of the royal foundation were anciently named by the king though edgar gave the monks the election and only reserved to himself the ratification this destination was afterward frequently violated and the abbots as well as bishops were afterward all appointed by the court as we learn from ingulf a writer contemporary to the conquest  were anciently appointed by the king had there been no other legislative authority the royal power had been in a great measure despotic contrary to the tenor of all the historians and to the practice of all the northern nations we may therefore conclude that the more considerable proprietors of land were without any election constituent members of the national assembly and there is reason to think that forty hides or about four or five thousand acres was the estate requisite for intitling the possessor to this honorable privilege there is a passage of an ancient author hist eliensis cap     0 this passage is remarked by dugdale pref to his baron vol  and he draws the same inference from it from which it appears that a person of very noble birth even one allied to the crown was not esteemed a princeps the term usually employed by ancient historians when the wittenagemot is mentioned till he had acquired a fortune of that extent nor need we imagine that the public council would become disorderly or confused by admitting so great a multitude the landed property of england was probably in few hands during the saxon times at least during the latter part of that period and as men had small ambition of attending these public councils there was no danger of the assemblys becoming too numerous for the dispatch of the little business which was brought before them   it is certain that whatever we may determine concerning the constituent members of the wittenagemot in whom the legislature resided the anglosaxon government in the period preceding the norman conquest was become extremely aristocratical the royal authority was very limited the people even if admitted to that assembly were of little or no weight or consideration we have hints given us in the historians of the great power and riches of particular noblemen and it could not but happen after the abolition of the heptarchy when the king lived at a distance from the provinces that these great proprietors who resided on their estates would much augment their authority over their vassals and retainers and over all the inhabitants of the neighborhood hence the immeasurable power assumed by harold godwin leofric siward morcar edwin edric and alfric who controlled the authority of the kings and rendered themselves quite necessary in the government the two latter though detested by the people on account of their joining a foreign enemy still preserved their power and influence and we may therefore conclude that their authority was founded not on popularity but on family rights and possessions there is one athestan mentioned in the reign of the king of that name who is called alderman of all england and is said to be halfking though the monarch himself was a prince of great valor and ability hist rames   p      and we find that in the latter saxon times and in these alone the great offices went from father to son and became in a manner hereditary in the families roger hoveden giving the reason why william the conqueror made cospatric earl of northumberland says nam ex  sanguine  illius comitatus erat enim ex matro  see also sim dun p  we see in those initances the same tendency toward reing offices hereditary which took place during a more early period on the continent and which had already operated its full effect   the circumstances attending the invasions of the danes would also serve much to increase the power of the principal nobility these freebooters made unexpected inroads on all quarters and there was a necessity that each county should resist them by its own force and under the conduct of its own magistrates and nobility for the same reason that a general war managed by the united efforts of the whole state commonly increases the power of the crown these private wars and inroads turned to the advantage of the aldermen and nobles  among that military and turbulent people so averse to commerce and the arts so little enured to industry justice was commonly very ill executed and great oppression and violence seem to have prevailed these disorders would be increased by the exorbitant power of the aristocracy and would in their turn contribute to increase it men not daring to rely on the guardianship of the laws were obliged to devote themselves to the service of some chieftain whose orders they followed even to the disturbance of the government or the injury of their fellowcitizens and who afforded them in return protection from any insult or injustice by strangers hence we find by the extracts which dr brady has given us from domesday that almost all the inhabitants even of boroughs had placed themselves in the clientship of some particular nobleman whose patronage they purchased by annual payments and whom they were obliged to consider as their sovereign more than the king himself or even the legislature bradys treatise of boroughs       etc the case was the same with the freemen in the country see pref to his hist p      0 etc  a client

a sodalitium and which contains many particulars characteristical of the manners and customs of the times dissert epist p   the associates are there said to be all of them gentlemen of cambridgeshire and they swear before the holy relics to observe their confederacy and to be faithful to each other they promise to bury any of the associates who dies in whatever place he had appointed to contribute to his funeral charges and to attend at his interment and whoever is wanting to this last duty binds himself to pay a measure of honey when any of the associates is in danger and calls for the assistance of his fellows they promise besides flying to his succor to give information to the sheriff and if he be negligent in protecting the person exposed to hazard they engage to levy a fine of one pound from him if the president of the society himself be wanting in this particular he binds himself to pay one pound unless he has the reasonable excuse of sickness or of duty to his superior when any of the associates is murdered they are to exact eight pounds from the murderer and if he refuses to pay it they are to prosecute him for the sum at their joint expense if any of the associates who happens to be poor kills a man the society are to contribute by a certain proportion to pay his fine a mark apiece if the fine be  00 shillings less if the person killed be a clown or ceorle the half of that sum again if he be a welshman but where any of the associates kills a man wilfully and without provocation he must himself pay the fine if any of the associates kills a fellow in a like criminal manner besides paying the usual fine to the relations of the deceased he must pay eight pounds to the society or renounce the benefit of it in which case they bind themselves under the penalty of one pound never to eat or drink with him except in the presence of the king bishop or alderman there are other regulations to protect themselves and their servants from all injuries to revenge such as are committed and to prevent their giving abusive language to each other and the fine which they engage to pay for that offense is a measure of honey  it is not to be doubted but a confederacy of this kind must have been a great source of friendship and attachment when men lived in perpetual danger from enemies robbers and oppressors and received protection chiefly from their personal valor and from the assistance of their friends or patrons as animosities were then more violent connexions were also more intimate whether voluntary or derived from blood the most remote degree of propinquity was regarded an indelible memory of benefits was preserved severe vengeance was taken of injuries both from a point of honor and as the best means of future security and the civil union being weak many private confederacies were entered into to supply its place and to procure men that safety which the laws and their own innocence were not alone able to insure them  on the whole notwithstanding the seeming liberty or rather licentiousness of the anglosaxons the great body of the people in these ages really enjoyed much less true liberty than where the execution of the laws is the most severe and where subjects are reduced to the strictest subordination and dependence on the civil magistrate the reason is derived from the excess itself of that liberty men must guard themselves at any price against insults and injuries and where they receive not protection from the laws and magistrate they will seek it by submission to superiors and by herding in some inferior confederacy which acts under the direction of a powerful chieftain and thus all anarchy is the immediate cause of tyranny if not over the state at least over many of the individuals  the several orders of men the german saxons as the other nations of that continent were divided into three ranks of men the noble the free and the slaves nithard hist lib    this distinction they brought over with them into britain  the nobles were called thanes and were of two kinds the kings thanes and lesser thanes the latter seem to have been dependant on the former and to have received lands for which they paid rent services or attendance in peace and war spelm feuds and tenures p  0  we know of no other title which raised any one to the rank of thane except noble birth and the possession of land the former was always much regarded by all the german nations even in their most barbarous state and as the saxon nobility had few expensive pleasures to dissipate their fortune and the commons little trade or industry by which they could accumulate riches these two ranks of men even though they were not separated by positive laws might remain long distinct and the noble families continue many ages in opulence and splendour there were no middle rank of men who could mix gradually with their superiors and procure to themselves insensibly honor and distinction if by any extraordinary accident a mean person acquired riches a circumstance so singular made him be known and remarked he became the object of envy as well as indignation to all the nobles he would have great difficulty to defend what he had acquired and he would find it impossible to protect himself from oppression except by courting the patronage of some great chieftain and paying a large price for his safety  there are two statutes among the saxon laws which seem calculated to confound these different ranks of men that of athelstan by which a merchant who had made three long sea voyages on his own account was entitled to the quality of thane wilkins p     and that of the same prince by which a ceorle or husbandman who had been able to purchase five hides of land and had a chapel a kitchen a hall and bell was raised to the same distinction seldom titles of honor p     wilkins p  0  but the opportunities were so few by which a merchant or ceorle could thus exalt himself above his rank that the law could never overcome the reigning prejudices the distinction between noble and base blood would still be indelible and the wellborn thanes would entertain the highest contempt for those legal and factitious ones though we are not informed of any of these circumstances by ancient historians they are so much founded on the nature of things that we may admit them as a necessary and infallible consequence of the situation of the kingdom during those ages  the cities appear by domesdaybook to have been at the conquest little better than villages winchester being the capital of the west saxon monarchy was

also de gest angl p      that the great distinction between the anglosaxon nobility and the french or norman was that the latter built magnificent and stately castles whereas the former consumed their immense fortunes on riot and hospitality in mean houses we may thence infer that the arts in general were much less advanced in england than in france a greater number of idle servants and retainers lived about the great families and as these even in france were powerful enough to disturb the execution of the laws we may judge of the authority acquired by the aristocracy in england when earl godwin besieged the confessor in london he summoned together from all parts his huscarles or housecoerles and retainers and obliged his sovereign to accept of the conditions which he was pleased to impose upon him  the lower rank of freemen were denominated coerles among the anglosaxons and where they were industrious they were chiefly employed in husbandry whence a coerle and a husbandman became in a manner synonimous terms they cultivated the farms of the nobility or thanes for which they paid rent and they seem to have been removeable at pleasure for there is no mention of leases among the anglosaxons the pride of the nobility together with the general ignorance of writing must have rendered these contracts very rare and must have kept the husbandmen in a very dependant condition the rents of farms were then chiefly paid in kind ll inae  0 these laws fixed the rents for a hide but it is difficult to convert it into modern measures   but the most numerous rank by far in the community seems to have been the slaves or villains who were the property of their lords and were consequently incapable themselves of all property dr brady assures us from a survey of domesdaybook general preface to his hist p       etc  that in all the counties of england the far greater part of the land was occupied by them and that the husbandmen and still more the socmen who were tenants that could not be removed at pleasure were very few in comparison this was not the case with the german nations as far as we can collect from the account given us by tacitus the perpetual wars in the heptarchy and the depredations of the danes seem to have been the cause of this great alteration with the anglosaxons the prisoners taken in battle or carried off in the frequent inroads were reduced to slavery and became by right of war ll edg    apud spellm conc vol   p      entirely at the disposal of their lords great property in the nobles especially if joined to an irregular administration of justice naturally favors the power of the aristocracy but still more so if the practice of slavery be admitted and has become very common the nobility not only possess the influence

independent  there were two kinds of slaves among the anglosaxons household slaves after the manner of the ancients and praedial or rustic after the manner of the germans spellm gloss in verb servus

the hundred and the county were well calculated to defend general liberty and to restrain the exorbitant power of the nobles in the countycourts or shiremotes all the freeholders were assembled twice

which thus became a kind of register too sacred to be falsified it was not unusual to add to the deed an imprecation on all such as should be guilty of that crime hickes dissert epist   among a people who lived in so simple a manner as the anglosaxons the judicial power is always of greater importance than the legislative there were few or no taxes imposed by the states there were few statutes enacted and the nation was less governed by laws than by customs which admitted a great latitude of interpretation though it should therefore be allowed that the wittenagemot was altogether composed of the principal nobility the countycourts where all the freeholders were admitted and which regulated all the daily occurrences of life formed a very wide basis for the government and were no contemptible check on the aristocracy but there is another power still more important than either the judicial or legislative and that is the power of injuring or serving by immediate force and violence for which it is difficult to obtain redress in courts of justice in all extensive governments where the execution of the laws is feeble this power naturally falls into the hands of the principal nobility and the degree of it which prevails cannot be determined so much by the public statutes as by small strokes of history by particular customs and sometimes by the reason and nature of things the highlands of scotland have been long entitled by law to every privilege of british subjects but it was not till very lately that the common people could in fact enjoy these privileges  the powers of all the members of the anglosaxon government are disputed among historians and antiquarians and the extreme obscurity of the subject even though faction had never entered into the question would naturally have begot those controversies but the great influence of the lords over their slaves and tenants the clientship of the burghers the total want of a middling rank of men the total want also of lawyers who did not then form a separate profession the extent of the monarchy the loose execution of the laws the continued disorders and convulsions of the state all these circumstances evince that the anglosaxon government became at last extremely aristocratical and the events during the period immediately preceding the conquest confirm this inference or conjecture  both the punishments inflicted on crimes by the anglosaxon  cature and the methods of proof employed in all causes appear  gular and are very different from those which prevail at present among  lized nations  we must conceive that the ancient germans were very lile removed from the original state of nature the social confederacy among them was more martial than civil they had chiefly in view the means of attack or defense against public enemies not those of protection against their fellow citizens their possessions were so slender and so equal that they were not exposed to great danger and the natural bravery of the people made every man trust to himself and to his particular friends for his defense or vengeance this defect in the political union drew much closer the knot of particular consederacies an insult upon any man was regarded by all his relations and associates as a common injury they were bound by honor as well as by a sense of general interest to revenge his death or any violence which he had suffered they retaliated on the aggressor by like violences and if he was protected as was natural and usual by his own clan the quarrel was spread still wider and bred endless disorders in the nation  the frisians a tribe of the germans had never advanced beyond this wild and imperfect state of society and the right of private revenge still remained among them unlimited and uncontrouled ll fris tit   apud lindenbrog p      but the other german nations in the age of tacitus had made one step farther toward completing the political or civil union though it still continued to be an indispensible point of honor for every clan to revenge the death or injury of their fellow the magistrate had acquired a right of interposing in the quarrel and of accommodating the difference he obliged the person maimed or injured and the relations of one killed to accept of a present from the aggressor and his relations ll aethelb    ll aelf     as a compensation for the

to the rank of the person killed or injured and was commonly paid in cattle the chief property of those rude and uncultivated nations a present of this kind gratified the revenge of the injured clan by the loss which the aggressor suffered it satisfied their pride by the submission which it expressed it diminished their regret for the loss or injury of a kinsman by their acquisition of new property and thus general peace was for a moment restored to the society tacit de mor germ the author says that the price of the composition was fixed which must have been by the laws and the interposition of the magistrate   but when the german nations had been settled some time in the provinces of the roman empire they made still a new step toward a more cultivated life and their criminal justice gradually improved and refined itself the magistrate whose office it was to guard public peace and to suppress private animosities conceived himself to be injured by every injury done to any of his people and besides the compensation to the person who suffered or to his clan he thought himself entitled to exact a fine called the fridwit as an atonement for the breach of peace and as a reward for the pains which he had taken in accommodating the quarrel when this idea which is so natural was once suggested it was readily received both by magistrate and people the numerous fines which were levied augmented the profits of the king and the people were sensible that he would be more vigilant in interposing with his good offices when he reaped such immediate advantage by them and that injuries would be less frequent when besides compensation to the person injured they were exposed to this additional penalty besides paying money to the relations of the deceased and to the king the murderer was also obliged to pay the master of a slave or vassal a sum as a compensation for his loss this was called the manbote see spell gloss in verb fedam manbot   this short abstract contains the history of the criminal jurisprudence of the northern nations for several centuries the state of england in this particular during the period of the anglosaxons may be judged of by the collection of ancient laws published by lambard and wilkins the chief purport of these laws is not to prevent or suppress entirely private quarrels which the legislators knew to be impossible but only to regulate and moderate them the laws of alfred enjoin that if any one knows that his enemy or aggressor after doing him an injury resolves to keep within his own house and his own lands the addition of these last words in italics appears necessary from what follows in the same law  he shall not fight him till he require compensation for the injury if he be strong enough to besiege him in his house he may do it for seven days without attacking him and if the aggressor is willing during that time to surrender himself and his arms his adversary may detain him thirty days but is afterward obliged to restore him safe to his kindred and be contented with the compensation if the criminal fly to the temple that sanctuary must not be violated where the assailant has not force sufficient to besiege the criminal in his house he must apply to the alderman for assistance and if he refuses aid the assailant must have recourse to the king and he is not allowed to assault the house till after a refusal of assistance from this supreme magistrate if any one meets with his enemy and is ignorant that he was resolved to keep within his own lands he must before he attacks him require him to surrender himself a prisoner and deliver up his arms in which case he may detain him thirty days but if he refuses to deliver up his arms it is then lawful to fight him a slave may fight in his

demanded compensation and had been refused it ll inae     king edmond in the preamble to his laws mentions the general dissatisfaction occasioned by the multiplicity of private feuds and battles and he establishes several expedients to remedy this grievance he ordains that if any one murders another he may with the assistance of his kindred pay within a twelvemonth the fine of his crime and if they abandon him he shall alone sustain the deadly feud or quarrel with the kindred of the murdered person his own kindred are free from the feud but on condition that they neither converse with the criminal nor supply him with meat or other necessaries if any of them after renouncing him receive him into their house or give him assistance they are finable to the king and are involved in the feud if the kindred of the murdered person take revenge of any but the criminal himself after he is abandoned by his kindred all their property is forfeited and they are declared to be enemies to the king and all his friends ll edm   wilkins p     it is also ordained that the fine for murder shall never be remitted by the king ll edm    and that no criminal shall be killed who flies to the church or

spirit of the northern barbarians and were an advance toward a more regular administration of justice by the salic law any man might by a public declaration exempt himself from his familyquarrels but

saxon antiquity preserved by hickes there is indeed a law of alfreds making wilful murder capital ll aelf    wilkins p    it is probable that by wilful murder alfred means a treacherous murder

the anglosaxons appear singular the proofs were no less so and were also the natural result of the situation of these people whatever we may imagine concerning the usual truth and sincerity of men who live in a rude and barbarous state there is much more falsehood and even perjury among them than among civilized nations and virtue which is nothing but a more enlarged and more cultivated reason never flourishes to any degree nor is founded on steady principles of honor except where a good education becomes general and men are taught the pernicious consequences of vice treachery and immorality even superstition though more prevalent among ignorant nations is but a poor supply for the defects of knowledge and education and our european ancestors who employed every moment the expedient of swearing on extraordinary crosses and relics were less honorable in all engagements than their posterity who from experience have omitted those ineffectual securities this general proneness to perjury was much increased by the usual want of discernment in judges who could not discuss an intricate evidence and were obliged to number not weigh the testimony of the witnesses

absurd they were rather an improvement on the methods of trial which had formerly been practiced among these barbarous nations and which still prevailed among the anglosaxons  when any controversy about a fact became too intricate for these ignorant judges to unravel they had recourse to what they called the judgment of god that is to fortune and their methods for consulting this oracle were various one of them was the decision by the cross and it was practiced in this manner when a person was accused of any crime he first cleared himself by oath attended by eleven compurgators he next took two pieces of wood one of which was marked with the sign of the cross and wrapping both up in wool he placed them on the altar or on some celebrated relic after solemn prayers for the success of the experiment a priest or in his stead some unexperienced youth took up one of the pieces of wood and if he happened upon that marked with the figure of the cross the person was pronounced innocent

most terrible famine ever known insomuch that a quarter of wheat rose to sixtypennies or about fifteen shillings of our present money consequently it was as dear as if it now cost seven pounds ten shillings sterling this much exceeds the great famine in the end of queen elizabeth when a quarter of wheat was sold for four pounds money in this last period was nearly of the same value as in our time these enormous famines are a certain proof of bad husbandry  on the whole there are three things to be considered wherever a sum of money is mentioned in ancient times first the change of denomination by which a pound has been reduced to the third part of its ancient weight in silver secondly the change in value by the greater plenty of money which has reduced the same weight of silver to ten times less value compared to commodities and consequently a pound sterling to the thirtieth part of the ancient value thirdly the fewer people and less industry which were then to be found in every european kingdom this circumstance made even the thirtieth part of the sum more difficult to levy and caused any sum to have more than thirty times more weight and influence both abroad and at home than in our times in the same manner that a sum an hundred thousand pounds for instance is at present more difficult to levy in a small state such as bavaria and can operate greater effects on such a small community than on england this last difference is not easy to be calculated but allowing that england has now above five times more industry and three times more people than it had at the conquest and for some reigns after it we are upon that supposition to conceive taking all circumstances together every sum of money mentioned by historians as if it were multiplied more than an hundredfold above a sum of the same denomination at present  in the saxon times land was divided equally among all the malechildren of the deceased according to the custom of gavelkind entails were sometimes practiced in those times ll aelf  apud wilkins p     lands were chiefly of two kinds bockland or land held by book or charter which were regarded as full property and descended to the heirs of the possessor and folkland or the land held by the ceorles and common people who were removeable at pleasure and were indeed only tenants during the will of their lords  the first attempt which we find in england to separate the ecclesiastical from the civil jurisdiction was that law of edgar by which all disputes among the clergy were ordered to be carried before the bishop wilkins p     the

that fatal action was considerable it might easily have been repaired by a great nation where the people were generally armed and where there resided so many powerful noblemen in every province who could have assembled their retainers and have obliged the duke of normandy to divide his army and probably to waste it in a multitude of actions and rencounters it was thus that the kingdom had formerly resisted for many years its invaders and had been gradually subdued by the continued efforts of the romans saxons and danes and equal difficulties might have been apprehended by william in this bold and hazardous enterprise but there were several vices in the anglosaxon constitution which rendered it difficult for the english to defend their liberties in so critical an emergency the people had in a good measure lost all national pride and spirit by their recent and long subjection to the danes and as canute had in the course of his administration much abated the rigors of conquest and had governed them equitably by their own laws they regarded with the less terror the ignominy of a foreign yoke and deemed the inconveniences of submission less formidable than those of bloodshed war and resistance their attachment also to the ancient royal family had been much weakened by their habitude of submission to the danish princes and by their late election of harold or their acquiescence in his usurpation and as they had long been accustomed to regard edgar atheling the only heir of the saxon line as unfit to govern them even in times of order and tranquillity they could entertain small hopes of his being able to repair such great losses as they had sustained or to resist the victorious arms of the duke of normandy  that they might not however be altogether

diffused by his victory at hastings was so great that the garrison of dover though numerous and well provided of every thing immediately capitulated and as the normans rushing in to take possession of the town hastily set fire to some of the houses william who was desirous to conciliate the minds of the english by an appearance of lenity and justice made reparation to the inhabitants for their

most of the bishops and dignified clergymen were even then french or norman the popes bull by which his enterprise was avowed and consecrated was now openly insisted on as a reason for general submission the superior learning of these prelates by which during the confessors reign they had raised themselves above the ignorant saxons made their opinions be received with implicit faith and a

much exalt our idea of the opulence and cultivation of the people as the historian chiefly insists on the silver plate his panegyrics on the english magnificence shows only how incompetent a judge he was of the matter silver was then of ten times the value and was more than twenty times more rare than at present and consequently of all species of luxury place must have been the rarest  but though every thing bore the face of joy and festivity and william himself treated his new courtiers with great appearance of kindness it was impossible to prevent altogether the insolence of the normans and the english nobles received small pleasure from those entertainments where they considered themselves as led in triumph by their ostentatious conqueror  discontents of the english affairs in england took still a worse turn during the absence of the sovereign discontents and complaints multiplied every where secret conspiracies were entered into against the government hostilities were already begun in many places and every thing seemed to menace a revolution as rapid as that which had placed william on the throne the historian abovementioned who is a panegyrist of his master throws the blame entirely on the fickle and mutinous disposition of the english and highly celebrates the justice and lenity of odos and fitz osberns administration p      but other historians with more probability impute the cause chiefly to the normans who despising a people that had so easily submitted to the yoke envying their riches and grudging the restraints imposed upon their own rapine were desirous of provoking them to a rebellion by which they hoped to acquire new confiscations and forfeitures and to satisfy those unbounded hopes which they had formed in entering on this enterprise order vital p  0    it is evident that the chief reason of this alteration in the sentiments of the english must be ascribed to the departure of william who was alone capable of curbing the violence of his captains and of overawing the mutinies of the people nothing indeed appears more strange than that this prince in less than three months after the conquest of a great warlike and turbulent nation should absent himself in order to revisit his own country which remained in profound tranquillity and was not menaced by any of its neighbors and should leave so long his jealous subjects at the mercy of an insolent and licentious army were we not assured of the solidity of his genius and the good sense displayed in all other circumstances of his conduct we might ascribe this measure to a vain ostentation which rendered him impatient to display his pomp and magnificence among his ancient courtiers it is therefore more natural to believe that in so extraordinary a step he was guided by a concealed policy and that though he had thought proper at first to allure the people to submission by the semblance of a legal administration he found that he could neither satisfy his rapacious captains nor secure his unstable government without exerting farther the rights of conquest and seizing the possessions of the english in order to give a pretense for this violence he endeavored without discovering his intention to provoke and allure them into insurrections which he thought could never prove dangerous while he detained all the principal nobility in normandy while a great and victorious army was quartered in england and while he himself was so near to suppress any tumult or rebellion but as no ancient writer has ascribed this tyrannical purpose to william it scarce seems allowable from conjecture alone to throw such an imputation upon him  their insurrections but whether we are to account for that measure from the kings vanity or from his policy it was the immediate cause of all the calamities which the english endured during this and the subsequent reigns and gave rise to those mutual jealousies and animosities between them and the normans which were never appeased till a long tract of time had gradually united the two nations and had made them one people the inhabitants of kent who had first submitted to the conqueror were the first who attempted to

ancient saxon laws excused on account of the urgent necessities of the prince and those who were not involved in the present ruin hoped that they would thenceforth enjoy without molestation their possessions and their dignities but the successive destruction of so many other families convinced them that the king intended to rely entirely on the support and affections of foreigners and they foresaw new forfeitures attainders and violences as the necessary result of this destructive plan of administration they observed that no englishman possessed his confidence or was entrusted with any

notwithstanding these mighty advantages he did not think it safe to violate the reverence usually paid the primate but under cover of a new superstition which he was the great instrument of introducing into england  innovation in ecclesiastical government the doctrine which exalted the papacy above all human power had gradually diffused itself from the city and court of rome and was during this age much more prevalent in the southern than in the northern kingdoms of europe pope alexander who had assisted william in his conquest of england reasonably expected that the french and normans would import into england the same reverence for his sacred character with which they were imbued in their own country and would break the spiritual as well as civil independancy of the saxons who had hitherto conducted their ecclesiastical government with an acknowledgment indeed of primacy in the sea of rome but without much idea of its title to dominion or authority as soon therefore as the norman prince seemed fully established on the throne the pope dispatched ermenfroy bishop of sion as his legate into england and this prelate was the first who had ever appeared with that character in any part of the british islands the king though he was probably led by principle to pay this submission to rome determined as is usual to employ the incident as a means of serving his political purposes and of degrading those english prelates who were become obnoxious to him the legate submitted to become the instrument of his tyranny and naturally thought that the more violent the exertion of power the more certainly did it confirm the authority of that court from which he derived his commission he summoned therefore a council of the prelates and abbots at winchester and being

usurpations therefore of the church had come to such a maturity as to embolden her to attempt extorting the right of investitures from the temporal power europe especially italy and germany was thrown into the most violent convulsions and the pope and emperor waged implacable war against each other gregory even dared to fulminate the sentence of excommunication against henry and his adherents to pronounce him rightfully deposed to free his subjects from their oaths of allegiance and instead of shocking mankind with this gross incroachment on the civil authority he found the stupid people ready to second his most exorbitant pretensions every minister servant or vassal of the emperor who received any disgust covered his rebellion under the pretense of principle and even the mother of

wholly incredible a pound in that age as we have before observed contained three times the weight of silver that it does at present and the same weight of silver by the most probable computation would purchase ten times more of the necessaries of life though not in the same proportion of the finer manufactures this revenue therefore of william would be equivalent to at least nine or ten millions at present and as that prince had neither fleet nor army to support the former being only a casual expense and the latter maintained without any charge to him by his military vassals we must thence conclude that no emperor or prince in any age or nation was ever to be compared to the conqueror in opulence and riches this leads us to suspect a great mistake in the computation of the historian

vigor of mind which he displayed in all his conduct his spirit was bold and enterprising yet guided with prudence his ambition which was exorbitant and lay little under the restraint of justice and still less under that of humanity still submitted to the dictates of reason and sound policy born in an age when the minds of men were intractable and unacquainted with submission he was yet able to direct them to his purposes and partly from the ascendant of his vehement character partly from art and dissimulation to establish an unlimited authority though not insensible to generosity he was hardened against compassion and he seemed equally ostentatious and ambitious of eclat in his clemency and in his severity the maxims of his administration were austere but might have been useful had

infinitely odious to his english subjects he transmitted his power to his posterity and the throne is still filled by his descendants a proof that the foundations which he laid were firm and solid and

obliged to make of his inclination to his present policy scarce any of those revolutions which both in history and in common language have always been denominated conquests appear equally violent or have been attended with so sudden an alteration both of power and property the roman state which spread its dominion over europe left the rights of individuals in a great measure untouched and those civilized conquerors while they made their own country the seat of empire found that they could draw most advantage from the subject provinces by bestowing on the natives the free enjoyment of their own laws and of their private possessions the barbarians who subdued the roman empire though they settled in the conquered countries yet being accustomed to a rude uncultivated life found a small part of the land sufficient to supply all their wants and they were not tempted to seize extensive possessions which they neither knew how to cultivate nor employ but the normans and other foreigners who followed the standard of william while they made the vanquished kingdom the seat of empire were yet so far advanced in arts as to be acquainted with the advantages of a large property and having totally subdued the natives they pushed the rights of conquest very extensive in the eyes of avarice and ambition however narrow in those of reason to the utmost extremity against them except the former conquest of england by the saxons themselves who were induced by peculiar circumstances to proceed even to the extermination of the natives it would be difficult to find in all history a

feeble one of only obtaining such a moderate supply as acting under his command might enable him to repulse the enemy but he was extremely astonished to see his dominions overwhelmed on a sudden with such an inundation of licentious barbarians who though they pretended friendship despised his subjects as unwarlike and detested them as heretical by all the arts of policy in which he excelled he endeavored to divert the torrent but while he employed professions caresses civilities and seeming services toward the leaders of the croisade he secretly regarded those imperious allies as more dangerous than the open enemies by whom his empire had been formerly invaded having effectuated that difficult point of disembarking them safely in asia he entered into a private correspondence with soliman emperor of the turks and practiced every insidious art which his genius his power or his situation enabled him to employ for disappointing the enterprise and discouraging the latins from making thenceforward any such prodigious migrations his dangerous policy was seconded by the disorders inseparable from so vast a multitude who were not united under one head and were conducted by leaders of the most independent intractable spirits unacquainted with military discipline and still more enemies to civil authority and submission the scarcity of provisions the excesses of fatigue the influence of unknown climates joined to the want of concert in their operations and the sword of a warlike enemy destroyed the croises by thousands and would have abated the ardor of men impelled to war by less powerful motives their zeal however their bravery and their irresistible force still carried them forward and continually advanced them to the great end of their enterprises after an obstinate siege they took nice the seat of the turkish empire they defeated soliman in two great battles they made themselves masters of antioch and entirely broke the force of the turks who had so long retained these countries in subjection the sultan of egypt whose alliance they had hitherto courted recovered on the fall of the turkish power his former authority in jerusalem and informed them by his ambassadors that if they came disarmed to that city they might now perform their religious vows and that all christian pilgrims who should thenceforth visit the holy sepulcher might expect the same good treatment which they had ever received from his predecessors this offer was rejected the sultan was required to yield up the city to the christians and on his refusal the croises advanced to the siege of jerusalem which they regarded as the consummation of their labors by the detachments which they had made and the disasters which they had undergone they were diminished to the number of twenty thousand foot and fifteen hundred horse but these were still formidable from their valor their experience and the obedience which at the price of past calamities they had learned to pay to their leaders after a siege of five weeks they took jerusalem by assault and impelled by a mixture of military and religious rage they put the numerous garrison and inhabitants to the sword without

glory which their valor had acquired them in this popular and meritorious enterprise among these was robert duke of normandy who as he had abandoned the greatest dominions of any prince that attended

twelvemonth in that delicious climate and though his friends in the north looked every moment for his arrival none of them knew when they could with certainty expect it by this delay he lost the kingdom of england which the great fame he had acquired during the croisades as well as his undoubted title both by birth and by the preceding agreement with his deceased brother would had he been present have infallibly secured to him  accession of henry prince henry was hunting with rufus in the new forest when intelligence of that princes death was brought him and being sensible of the advantage attending the conjuncture he immediated galloped to winchester in order to secure the royal treasure which he knew to be a necessary implement for facilitating his designs on the crown he had scarcely reached the place when william de breteuil keeper of the treasure arrived and opposed himself to henrys pretensions this nobleman who had been engaged in the same party of hunting had no sooner heard of his masters death than he hastened to take care of his charge and he told the prince that this treasure as well as the crown belonged to his elder brother who was now his sovereign and that he himself for his part was determined in spite of all other pretensions to maintain his allegiance to him but henry drawing his sword threatened him with instant death if he dared to disobey him and as others of the late kings retinue who came every moment to winchester joined the princes party breteuil was obliged to withdraw his opposition and to acquiesce in this violence order vital p       henry without losing a moment hastened with his money to london and having assembled some noblemen and prelates whom his address or abilities or presents gained to his side he was suddenly elected or rather saluted king and immediately proceeded to the exercise of the royal dignity in less than three days after his brothers death the ceremonial of his coronation was performed by maurice bishop of london who was persuaded to officiate on that occasion chron sax p  0  order vital p      and thus by his courage and celerity he intruded himself into the vacant throne no one had sufficient spirit or sense of duty to appear in defense of the absent prince all men were seduced or intimidated present possession supplied the apparent deficiencies of henrys title which was indeed founded on plain usurpation and the barons as well as the people acquiesced in a claim which though it could neither be justified nor comprehended could now they found be opposed only through the perils of civil war and rebellion  but as henry easily foresaw that a crown usurped against all rules of justice would sit very unsteady on his head he resolved by fair professions at least to gain the affections of all his subjects besides taking the usual coronation oath to maintain the laws and execute justice he passed a charter which was calculated to remedy many of the grievous oppressions which had been complained of during the reign of his father and brother chron sax p  0  sim dunelm p     brompton p      he there promised that upon the death of any bishop or abbot he never would seize the revenues of the sea or abbey during the vacancy but would leave the whole to be reaped by the succescessor and that he would never let to farm any ecclesiastical benefice nor dispose of it for money after this concession to the church whose favor was of so great consequence he proceeded to enumerate the civil grievances which he purposed to redress he promised that upon the death of any earl baron or military tenant his heir should be admitted to the possession of his estate on paying a just and lawful relief without being exposed to such exorbitant exactions as had been required during the late reigns he remitted the wardship of minors and allowed guardians to be appointed who should be answerable for the trust he promised not to dispose of any heiress in marriage but by the advice of all the barons and if any baron intended to give his daughter sister niece or kinswoman in marriage it should only be necessary for him to consult the king who promised to take no money for his consent nor ever to refuse permission unless the person to whom it was proposed to marry her should happen to be his enemy he granted his barons and military tenants the power of bequeathing by will their money or personal estates and if they neglected to make a will he promised that their heirs should succeed to them he remitted the right of imposing moneyage and of levying taxes at pleasure on the farms which the barons retained in their own hands see appendix ii  he made some general professions of moderating fines he offered a pardon for all offenses and he remitted all debts due to the crown he required that the vassals of the barons should enjoy the same privileges which he granted to his own barons and he promised a general confirmation and observance of the laws of king edward this is the substance of the chief articles contained in that famous charter matthew paris p    hoveden p     brompton p  0   hagulstad p   0   to give greater authenticity to these concessions henry lodged a copy of his charter in some abbey of each county as if desirous that it should be exposed to the eyes of all his subjects and remain as a perpetual rule for the limitation and direction of his government yet is it certain that after the present turn was served he never once thought during his reign of observing one single article of it and the whole fell so much into neglect and oblivion that in the following century when the barons who had heard an obscure tradition of it desired to make it the model of the great charter which they exacted from king john they could only find one copy of it in the whole kingdom but as to the grievances here proposed to be redressed they were still continued in their full extent and the royal authority in all these heads lay under no manner of restriction reliefs of heirs so capital an article were never effectually fixed till the time of magna charta glanv lib   cap    what is called a relief in the conquerors laws preserved by ingulf seems to have been the herriot since reliefs as well as the other burdens of the feudal law were unknown in the age of the confessor whose laws these originally were  and it is evident that the general promise here given of accepting a just and lawful relief ought to have been reduced to more precision in order to give security to the subject the oppression of wardship and marriage was perpetuated even till the age of charles ii and it appears from glanville lib   cap    this practice was contrary to the laws of king edward ratified by the conqueror as we learn from ingulf p    but laws had at that time very little influence power and violence governed every thing  the famous justiciary of henry ii that in his time where any man died intestate an accident which must be very frequent when the art of writing was so little known the king or the lord of the fief pretended to seize all the movables and to exclude every heir even the children of the deceased a sure mark of a tyrannical and arbitrary government  the normans indeed settled in england were during this age so violent and licentious a people that they may be pronounced incapable of any true or regular liberty which requires such a refinement of laws and institutions such a comprehension of views such a sentiment of honor such a spirit of obedience and such a sacrifice of private interests and connexions to public order as can only be the result of great reflection and experience and must grow to perfection during several ages of a settled and established government a people so insensible to the rights of their sovereign as to disjoint without necessity the hereditary succession and permit a younger brother to intrude himself into the place of the elder whom they esteemed and who was guilty of no crime but being absent could not expect that that prince would pay any greater regard to their privileges or allow his engagements to fetter his power and debar him from any considerable interest or convenience they had indeed arms in their hands which prevented the establishment of a total despotism and left their posterity sufficient power whenever they should attain a sufficient degree of reason to acquire true liberty but their turbulent disposition prompted them frequently to make such use of their arms that they were more fitted to obstruct the execution of justice than to stop the career of violence and oppression the prince finding that greater opposition was often made to him when he enforced the laws than when he violated them was apt to render his own will and pleasure the sole rule of government and on every emergence to consider more the power of the persons whom he might offend than the rights of those whom he might injure the very form of this charter of henry proves that the norman barons for they rather than the people of england are chiefly concerned in it were totally ignorant of the nature of limited monarchy and were ill qualified to conduct in conjunction with their sovereign the machine of government it is an act of his sole power is the result of his free grace implies several articles which bind others as well as himself and is therefore unfit to be the deed of any one who possesses not the whole legislative power and who may not at pleasure revoke all his concessions  king henry farther to increase his popularity degraded and committed to prison ralph flambard bishop of durham who had been the chief instrument of oppression employed by his brother chron sax p  0  w malm p     matthew paris p    alur beverl p      but this act was followed by another which was a direct violation of his own charter and was a bad prognostic of his sincere intentions to observe it he kept the sea of durham vacant for five years and during that time retained possession of all its revenues sensible of the great authority which anselm had acquired by his character of piety and by the persecutions which he had undergone from william he

his journey to rome and gave the king an absolute refusal he objected the decrees of the council of bari at which he himself had assisted and he declared that so far from doing homage for his spiritual dignity he would not so much as communicate withh any ecclesiastic who paid that submission or who accepted of investitures from laymen henry who proposed in his present delicate situation to reap great advantages from the authority and popularity of anselm dared not to quarrel with him by insisting on his demand w malm p   he only desired that the controversy might be suspended and that messengers might be sent to rome to accommodate matters with the pope and to obtain his confirmation of the laws and customs of england  marriage of the king there immediately occurred an important affair in which the king was obliged to have recourse to the authority of anselm matilda daughter of malcolm iii king of scotland and niece to edgar atheling had on her fathers death and the subsequent revolutions of the scottish government been brought up to england and educated under her aunt christina in the nunnery of rumsey this princess henry proposed to marry but as she had worn the veil though never taken the vows doubts might arise concerning the lawfulness of the act and it behoved him to be very careful not to shock in any particular the religious prejudices of his subjects the affair was examined by anselm in a council of the prelates and nobles which was summoned at lambeth and matilda there proved that she had put on the veil not with a view of entering into a religious life but merely in imitation of a custom familiar to the english ladies who protected their chastity from the brutal violence of the normans by taking shelter under that habit eadmer p     which amidst the horrible licentiousness of the times was generally revered the council sensible that even a princess had otherwise no security for her honor admitted this reason as valid they pronounced that matilda was still free to marry ibid  and her espousals with henry were celebrated by anselm with great pomp and solemnity hoveden p      no act of the kings reign rendered him equally popular with his english subjects and tended more to establish him on the throne though matilda during the life of her uncle and brothers was not the heir of the saxon line she was become very dear to the english on account of her connexions with it and that people who before the conquest had fallen into a kind of indifference toward their ancient royal family had felt so severely the tyranny of

quarrel with anselm the primate a little after henry had completed the conquest of normandy and settled the government of that province he finished a controversy which had been long depending between him and the pope with regard to the investitures in ecclesiastical benefices and though he was here obliged to relinquish some of the ancient rights of the crown he extricated himself on easier terms than most princes who in that age were so unhappy as to be engaged in disputes with the apostolic see the kings situation in the beginning of his reign obliged him to pay great court to anselm and the advantages which he had reaped from the zealous friendship of that prelate had made him sensible how prone the minds of his people were to superstition and what an ascendant the ecclesiastics had been able to assume over them he had seen on the accession of his brother rufus that though the rights of primogeniture were then violated and the inclinations of almost all the barons opposed yet the authority of lanfranc had prevailed over all other considerations and his own case which was still more unfavourable afforded an instance in which the clergy could show more evidently their influence and authority these recent examples while they made him cautious not to offend that powerful body convinced him at the same time that it was extremely his interest to retain the former prerogative of the crown in filling offices of such vast importance and to check the ecclesiastics in that independance to which they evidently aspired the choice which his brother in a fit of penitence had made of anselm was so far unfortunate to the kings pretensions that that prelate was celebrated for his piety and zeal and austerity of manners and though his monkish devotion and narrow principles prognosticated no great knowledge of the world nor depth of policy he was on that very account a more dangerous instrument in the hands of politicians and retained a greater ascendant over the bigoted populace the prudence and temper of the king appear in nothing more conspicuous than in the management of this delicate affair where he was always sensible that it had become necessary for him to risque his whole crown in order to preserve the most invaluable jewel of it eadmer p      anselm had no sooner returned from banishment than his refusal to do homage to the king excited a dispute which henry evaded at that critical juncture by promising to send a messenger in order to compound the matter with pascal the second who then filled the papal chair the messenger as was probably foreseen returned with an absolute refusal of the kings demands w malm p      and that fortified by many reasons which were well qualified to operate on the understandings of men in those ages pascal quoted the scriptures to prove that christ was the door and he thence inferred that all ecclesiastics must enter into the church through christ alone not through the civil magistrate or any profane laymen eadmer p  0 this topic is farther enforced in p       w malm p      it is monstrous added the pontiff that a son should pretend to beget his father or a man to create his god priests are called

scripture is a forgery of his holiness for i have not been able to find it yet it passed current in those ages and was often quoted by the clergy at the foundation of their power see epist st thom p       but however convincing these agreements they could not persuade henry to resign so important a prerogative and perhaps as he was possessed of great reflection and learning he thought that the absurdity of a mans creating his god even allowing priests to be gods was not urged with the best grace by the roman pontiff but as he desired still to avoid or at least to delay the coming to any dangerous extremity with the church he persuaded anselm that he would be able by farther negotiation to attain some composition with pascal and for that purpose he dispatched three bishops to rome while anselm sent two messengers of his own to be more fully assured of the popes intentions eadmer p    w malm p      pascal wrote back letters equally positive and arrogant both to the king and primate urging to the former that by assuming the right of investitures he committed a kind of spiritual adultery with the church who was the spouse of christ and who must not admit of such a commerce with any other person eadmer p     and insisting with the latter that the pretensions of kings to confer benefices was the source of all simony a topic which had but too much foundation in those ages eadmer p         henry had now no other expedient than to suppress the letter addressed to himself and to persuade the three bishops to prevaricate and assert upon their episcopal faith that pascal had assured them in private of his good intentions toward henry and of his resolution not to resent any future exertion of his prerogative in granting investitures though he himself scrupled to give this assurance under his hand lest other princes should copy the example and assume a like privilege eadmer p    w malm p      anselms two messengers who were monks affirmed to him that it was impossible this story could have any foundation but their word was not esteemed equivalent to that of three bishops and the king as if he had finally gained his cause proceeded to fill the sees of hereford and salisbury and to invest the new bishops in the usual manner eadmer p    w malm p     hoveden p     sim dunelm p      but anselm who as he had good reason gave no credit to the

ensigns of their dignity hoveden p   0 chron st petri de burgo p    flor wigorn p      the quarrel every day increased between the king and the primate the former notwithstanding the great prudence and moderation of his temper threw out menaces against all such as should pretend to oppose him in exerting the ancient prerogatives of his crown and anselm sensible of his disagreeable and dangerous situation desired leave to make a journey to rome in order to lay the case before the sovereign pontiff eadmer p  0 w malm p      henry well pleased to rid himself without violence of so inflexible an antagonist readily granted him permission and anselm set out on his journey he was attended to the seacoast by insinite multitudes not only monks and clergymen but people of all ranks who scrupled not in this manner to declare for their primate against their sovereign and who regarded his departure as the final abolition of religion and true piety in the kingdom eadmer p     the king however confiscated all the revenues of his see and sent william de warelwast to negociate with pascal and to find some means of accommodation in this delicate affair w malm p    the english minister told

monastery at bec in normandy and henry besides restoring to him the revenues of his see treated him with the greatest respect and held several conferences with him in order to soften his opposition and bend him to submission hoveden p      the people of england who thought all differences now accommodated were inclined to blame their primate for absenting himself so long from his charge and he daily received letters from his partisans representing the necessity of his speedy return the total extinction they told him of religion and christianity was likely to ensue from the want of his fatherly care the most shocking customs prevail in england and the dread of his severity being now removed sodomy and the practice of wearing long hair gain ground among all ranks of men and these enormities openly appear every where without sense of shame or fear of punishment eadmer p      the policy of the court of rome has been commonly much admired and men judging by success have bestowed the highest eulogies on that prudence by which a power from such slender beginnings could advance without force of arms to establish an universal and almost absolute monarchy in europe but the wisdom of such a long succession of men who filled the papal throne and who were of such different ages tempers and interests is not intelligible and could never have place in nature the instrument indeed with which they wrought the ignorance and superstition of the people is so gross an engine of such universal prevalence and so little liable to accident or disorder that it may be successful even in the most unskilful hands and scarce any indiscretion can frustrate its operations while the court of rome was openly abandoned to the most flagrant disorders even while it was torn with schisms and factions the power of the church made daily a sensible progress in europe and the temerity of gregory and the caution of pascal were equally fortunate in promoting it the clergy feeling the necessity of protection against the violence of princes or vigor of the laws were well pleased to adhere to a foreign head who being removed from the fear of the civil authority could freely employ the power of the whole church to defend their ancient or usurped properties and privileges when invaded in any particular country the monks desirous of an independance on their diocesans professed still a more devoted attachment to the triple crown and the stupid people possessed no science nor reason which they could oppose to the most exorbitant pretensions nonsense passed for demonstration the most

metropolitan were entirely derived from the indulgence of the apostolic see the english princes and henry in particular who were glad to avoid any present contest of so dangerous a nature commonly acquiesced by their silence in these pretensions of the court of rome the legates a latere as they were called were a kind of delegates who possessed the full power of the pope in all the provinces committed to their charge and were very busy in extending as well as exercising it they nominated to all vacant benefices assembled synods and were anxious to maintain ecclesiastical privileges which never could be fully protected without encroachments on the civil power if there was the least concurrence or opposition it was always supposed that the civil power was to give way every deed which had the least pretense of holding of any thing spiritual as marriage testaments promissory oaths were brought into the spiritual court and could not be canvassed before a civil magistrate these were the established laws of the church and where a legate was sent immediately from rome he was sure to maintain the papal claims with the utmost rigor but it was an advantage to the king to have the

overawed by the sense of his dignity or of his wisdom and though he often indulged his facetious humor he knew how to temper it with discretion and ever kept at a distance from all indecent

respect even though it had been less supported by art and policy by his great progress in literature he acquired the name of beauclerc or the scholar but his application to these sedentary pursuits abated nothing of the activity and vigilance of his government and though the learning of that age was better fitted to corrupt than improve the understanding his natural good sense preserved itself

of the sovereigns weakness and obliged to provide each for his own defense against the ravages of the norman freebooters had assumed both in civil and military affairs an authority almost independent and had reduced within very narrow limits the prerogative of their princes the accession of hugh capet by annexing a great fief to the crown had brought some addition of power to the royal dignity but this fief though considerable for a subject appeared a narrow basis of force in a prince who was placed at the head of so great a community the royal demesnes consisted only of paris orleans estampes compiegne and a few places scattered over the northern provinces in all the rest of the kingdom the princes authority was more nominal than real the vassals were accustomed nay entitled to make war without his permission on each other they were even entitled if they conceived themselves to be injured to turn their arms against their sovereign they exercised all civil jurisdiction without appeal over their tenants and inferior vassals their common jealousy of the crown easily united them against any attempt on their exorbitant privileges and as some of them had attained the power and authority of great princes even the smallest baron was sure of immediate and effectual protection besides six ecclesiastical peerages which with the other immunities of the church cramped extremely the general execution of justice there were six laypeerages burgundy normandy guienne flanders toulouse and champagne which formed very extensive and puissant sovereignties and though the combination of all these princes and barons could on occasion muster a mighty power yet was it very difficult to set that great machine in movement it was almost impossible to preserve harmony in its parts a sense of common interest alone could for a time unite them under their sovereign against a common enemy but if the king attempted to turn the force of the community against any mutinous vassal the same sense of common interest made the others oppose themselves to the success of his pretensions lewis the gross the last sovereign marched at one time to his frontiers against the germans at the head of an army of two hundred thousand men but a petty lord of corbeil of puiset of couci was able at another time to set that prince at defiance and to maintain open war against him  the authority of the english monarch was much more extensive within his kingdom and the disproportion much greater between him and the most powerful of his vassals his demesnes and revenue were very large compared to the greatness of his state he was accustomed to levy arbitrary exactions from his subjects his courts of judicature exercised jurisdiction in every part of the kingdom he could crush by his power or by a judicial sentence well or ill founded any obnoxious baron and though the feudal institutions which prevailed in his kingdom had the same tendency as in other states to exalt the aristocracy and depress the monarchy it required in england according to its present constitution a great combination of the vassals to oppose their sovereign lord and there had not hitherto arisen any baron so powerful as of himself to make war against the prince and afford protection to the inferior barons  while such were the different situations of france and england and the latter enjoyed so great advantages over the former the accession of henry ii a prince of great abilities possessed of so many rich provinces on the continent might appear an event dangerous if not fatal to the french

superior in extent and opulence to those territories which were subjected to the immediate jurisdiction and government of the king the vassal was here more powerful than his liege lord the situation which had enabled hugh capet to depose the carlovingian princes seemed here to be renewed and that with much greater advantages on the side of the vassal and when england was added to so many provinces the french king had reason to apprehend from this conjuncture some great disaster to himself and to his family but in reality it was this circumstance which appeared so formidable that saved the capetian race and by its consequences exalted them to that pitch of grandeur which they at present enjoy  the limited authority of the prince in the feudal constitutions prevented the king of england from employing with advantage the force of so many states which were subjected to his government and these different members disjoined in situation and disagreeing in laws language and manners were never thoroughly cemented into one monarchy he soon became both from his distant place of residence and from the incompatability of interests a kind of foreigner to his french dominions and his subjects on the continent considered their allegiance as more naturally due to their superior lord who lived in their neighborhood and who was acknowledged to be the supreme head of their nation he was always at hand to invade them their immediate lord was often at too great a distance to protect them and any disorder in any part of his dispersed dominions gave advantages against him the other powerful vassals of the french crown were rather pleased to see the expulsion of the english and were not affected with that jealousy which would have arisen from the oppression of a covassal who was of the same rank with themselves by this means the king of france found it more easy to conquer these numerous provinces from england than to subdue a duke of normandy or guienne a count of anjou maine or poictou and after reducing such extensive territories which immediately coalited with the body of the monarchy he found greater facility of uniting to the crown the other great fiefs which still remained separate and independent  but as these important consequences could not be foreseen by human wisdom the french king remarked with terror the rising grandeur of the house of anjou or plantagenet and in order to retard its progress he had ever maintained a strict union with stephen and had endeavored to support the tottering fortunes of that bold usurper but after this princes death it was too late to think of opposing the succession of henry or preventing the performance of those stipulations which with the unanimous consent of the nation he had made with his predecessor

requisite to support his pretensions against potent antagonists and that nothing but a great army could maintain a claim which he had in vain asserted by arguments and manifestos  an army composed of feudal vassals was commonly very intractable and undisciplined both because of the independent spirit of the persons who served in it and because the commands were not given either by the choice of the sovereign or from the military capacity and experience of the officers each baron conducted his own vassals his rank was greater or less proportioned to the extent of his property even the supreme command under the prince was often attached to birth and as the military vassals were obliged to serve only forty days at their own charge though if the expedition was distant they were put to great expense the prince reaped very little benefit from their attendance henry sensible of these inconveniences levied upon his vassals in normandy and other provinces which were remote from thoulouse a

remark that the two kings had the year before met the pope at the castle of torci on the loir and they gave him such marks of respect that both dismounted from their horses to receive him and holding

england he had showed a fixed purpose to repress clerical usurpations and to maintain those prerogatives which had been transmitted to him by his predecessors during the schism of the papacy between alexander and victor he had determined for some time to remain neuter and when he was informed that the archbishop of rouen and bishop of mans had from their own authority acknowledged alexander as legitimate pope he was so enraged that though he spared the archbishop on account of his age he immediately issued orders for overthrowing the houses of the bishop of mans and archdeacon of rouen

authority over any of his dominions in england the mild character and advanced years of theobald archbishop of canterbury together with his merits in refusing to put the crown on the head of eustace

usurpations he was entirely master of his extensive dominions the prudence and vigor of his government attended with perpetual success had raised his character above that of any of his predecessors fitz steph p     the papacy was weakened by a schism which divided all europe and he rightly judged that if the present favorable opportunity were neglected the crown must from the prevalent superstition of the people be in danger of falling into an entire subordination under the mitre  the union of the civil and ecclesiastical powers serves extremely in every civilized government to the maintenance of peace and order and prevents those mutual encroachments which as there can be no ultimate judge between them are often attended with the most dangerous consequences whether the supreme magistrate who unites these powers receive the appellation of prince or prelate is not material the superior weight which temporal interests commonly bear in the apprehensions of men above spiritual renders the civil part of his character most prevalent and in time prevents those gross impostures and bigoted persecutions which in all false religions are the chief foundation of clerical authority but during the progress of ecclesiastical usurpations the state by the resistance of the civil magistrate is naturally thrown into convulsions and it behooves the prince both for his own interest and for that of the public to provide in time sufficient barriers against so dangerous and insidious a rival this precaution had been hitherto much neglected in england as well as in other catholic countries and affairs at last seemed to have come to a dangerous crisis a sovereign of the greatest abilities was now on the throne a prelate of the most inflexible and intrepid character was possessed of the primacy the contending powers appeared to be armed with their full force and it was natural to expect some extraordinary event to result from their rencounter  among their other inventions to obtain money the clergy had inculcated the necessity of penance as an atonement for sin and having again introduced the practice of paying them large sums as a commutation or species of atonement for the remission of these penance the sins of the people by these means had become a revenue to the priests and the king computed that by this invention alone they levied more money from his subjects than flowed by all the funds and taxes into the royal exchequer fitzsteph p     that he might ease his subjects of so heavy and arbitrary an imposition henry required that a civil officer of his appointment should be present in all ecclesiastical courts and should for the future give his consent to every composition which was made with sinners for their spir tual offenses  the ecclesiastics in that age had renounced all immediate subordination to the magistrate they openly pretended to an exemption in criminal accusations from a trial before courts of justice and were gradually introducing a like exemption in civil causes spiritual penalties alone could be inflicted on their offenses and as the clergy had extremely multiplied in england and many of them were consequently of very low characters crimes of the deepest dye murders robberies adulteries rapes were daily committed with impunity by the ecclesiastics it had been found for instance by enquiry that no less than an hundred murders had since the kings accession been perpetrated by men of that profession who had never been called to account for these offenses neubr p      and holy orders were become a full protection for all enormities a clerk in worcestershire having debauched a gentlemans daughter had at this time proceeded to murder the father and the general indignation against this

hold of so favorable a cause resolved to push the clergy with regard to all their privileges which they had raised to an enormous height and to determine at once those controversies which daily multiplied between the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdictions he summoned an assembly of all the prelates of england and he put to them this concise and decisive question whether or not they were willing to submit to the ancient laws and customs of the kingdom the bishops unanimously replied that they were willing saving their own order fitzsteph p    hist quad p    hoveden p     gervas p       a device by which they thought to elude the present urgency of the kings demand and yet reserve to themselves on a favorable opportunity the power of resuming all their past pretensions the king was

eye and berkham hist quad p    gervas p       the bishops were terrified and expected still farther effects of his resentment becket alone was inflexible and nothing but the interposition of the popes legate philip abbot of eleemosina who dreaded a breach with so powerful a prince at so unseasonable a juncture could have prevailed on him to retract the saving clause and give a general and absolute promise of observing the ancient customs hist quadr p    hoveden p     gervas p        but henry was not content with a declaration in these general terms he resolved ere it was too late to define expressly those customs with which he required compliance and to put a stop to clerical usurpations before they were fully consolidated and could plead antiquity as they already did a sacred authority in their favor the claims of the church were open and visible after a gradual and insensible progress through many centuries the mask had at last been taken off and several ecclesiastical councils by their canons which were pretended to be irrevocable and infallible had positively defined those privileges and immunities which gave such general offense and appeared so dangerous to the civil magistrate henry therefore deemed it necessary to define with the same precision the limits of the civil power to oppose his legal customs to their divine ordinances to determine the exact boundaries of the rival jurisdictions and for this purpose he summoned a general council of the nobility and prelates at clarendon to whom he submitted this great and important question   th january

them and the following laws commonly called the constitutions of clarendon were voted without opposition by this assembly fitz steph p     it was enacted that all suits concerning the advowson and presentation of churches should be determined in the civil courts that the churches belonging to the kings fee should not be granted in perpetuity without his consent that clerks accused of any crime should be tried in the civil courts that no person particularly no clergyman of any rank should depart the kingdom without the kings license that excommunicated persons should not be bound to give security for continuing in their present place of abode that laics should not be accused in spiritual courts except by legal and reputable promoters and witnesses that no chief tenant of the crown should be excommunicated nor his lands be put under an interdict except with the kings consent that all appeals in spiritual causes should be carried from the archdeacon to the bishop from the bishop to the primate from him to the king and should be carried no farther without the kings consent that if any lawsuit arise between a layman and a clergyman concerning a tenement and it be disputed whether the land be a lay or an ecclesiastical fee it should first be determined by the verdict of twelve lawful men to what class it belonged and if it be found to be a layfee the cause should finally be determined in the civil courts that no inhabitant in demesne should be excommunicated for nonappearance in a spiritual court till the chief officer of the place where he resides be consulted that he may compel him by the civil authority to give satisfaction to the church that the archbishops bishops and other spiritual dignitaries should be regarded as barons of the realm should possess the privileges and be subjected to the burdens belonging to that rank and should be bound to attend the king in his great councils and assist at all trials till the sentence either of death of loss of members be given against the criminal that the revenue of the vacant sees should belong to the king the chapter or such of them as he shall summon should sit in the kings chapel till they make the new election with his consent and that the bishopelect should do homage to the crown that if any baron or tenant in capite shall refuse to submit to the spiritual courts the king should employ his authority in obliging him to make such submissions if any of them throw off his allegiance to the king the prelates should with their censures assist the king in reducing him that goods forfeited to the king should not be protected in churches or churchyards that the clergy should no more pretend to the right of enforcing payment of debts contracted by oath or promise but should leave these

them in a body endeavored to prevent all future dispute with regard to them and by passing so many ecclesiastical ordinances in a national and civil assembly he fully established the superiority of the legislature above all papal decrees or spiritual canons and gained a signal victory over the ecclesiastics but as he knew that the bishops though overawed by the present combination of the crown

final and decisive victory over the other and that they had more to fear than hope from the duration of the controversy though the vigor of henrys government had confirmed his authority in all his

consternation and he was immediately sensible of the dangerous consequences which he had reason to apprehend from so unexpected an event an archbishop of reputed sanctity assassinated before the altar

cause so much calculated to work on the human passions and so peculiarly adapted to the eloquence of popular preachers and declaimers in vain would he plead his own innocence and even his total ignorance of the fact he was sufficiently guilty if the church thought proper to esteem him so and his concurrence in beckets martyrdom becoming a religious opinion would be received with all the implicit credit which belonged to the most established articles of faith these considerations gave the king the most unaffected concern and as it was extremely his interest to clear himself of all suspicion he took no care to conceal the depth of his affliction ypod neust p     m paris p    diceto p     gervas p       he shut himself up from the light of day and from all commerce with his

they employed every topic of consolation induced him to accept of nourishment and occupied his leisure in taking precautions against the consequences which he so justly apprehended from the murder of the primate  and submission of the king the point of chief importance to henry was to convince the pope of his innocence or rather to persuade him that he would reap greater advantages from the submissions of england than from proceeding to extremities against that kingdom the archbishop of rouen the bishops of worcester and evreux with five others of less quality were immediately dispatched to rome hoveden p     m paris p     and orders were given them to perform their journey with the utmost expedition though the name and authority of the court of rome were so terrible in the remote countries of europe which were sunk in profound ignorance and were entirely unacquainted with its character and conduct the pope was so little revered at home that his inveterate enemies surrounded the gates of rome itself and even controuled his government in that city and the ambassadors who from a distant extremity of europe carried to him the humble or rather abject submissions of the

privileges of the clergy and this peculiar merit challenged and not in vain a suitable acknowledgement to his memory endless were the panegyrics on his virtues and the miracles operated by his relicts

mortifying reflection to those who are actuated by the love of fame so justly denominated the last infirmity of noble minds that the wisest legislator and most exalted genius that ever reformed or enlightened the world can never expect such tributes of praise as are lavished on the memory of a pretended saint whose whole conduct was probably to the last degree odious or contemptible and whose industry was entirely directed to the pursuits of objects pernicious to mankind it is only a conqueror a personage no less entitled to our hatred who can pretend to the attainment of equal renown and glory  it may not be amiss to remark before we conclude this subject of thomas a becket that the king during his controversy with that prelate was on every occasion more anxious than usual to express his zeal for religion and to avoid all a pearance of a prosane negligence on that head he gave his consent to the imposing a tax on all his dominions for the delivery of the holy land now threatened

the standard of orthodoxy was still more subtle and minute they seem to have been the first that ever suffered for heresy in england  as soon as henry found that he was in no immediate danger from the

these countries seem to have been so many tribes of the celtae who derive their origin from an antiquity that lies far beyond the records of any history or tradition the irish from the beginning of time had been buried in the most profound barbarism and ignorance and as they were never conquered or even invaded by the romans from whom all the western world derived its civility they continued still in the most rude state of society and were distinguished only by those vices to which human nature not tamed by education nor restrained by laws is for ever subject the small principalities into which they were divided exercised perpetual rapine and violence against each other the uncertain succession of their princes was a continued source of domestic convulsions the usual title of each petty sovereign was the murder of his predecessor courage and force though exercised in the commission of crimes were more honored than any pacific virtues and the most simple arts of life even tillage and agriculture were almost wholly unknown among them they had felt the invasions of the danes and the other northern people but these inroads which had spread barbarism in the other parts of europe tended rather to improve the irish and the only towns which were to be found in the island had been planted along the coast by the freebooters of norway and denmark the other inhabitants exercised pasturage in the open country sought protection from any danger in their forests and morasses and being divided by the fiercest animosities against each other were still more intent on the means of mutual injury than on the expedients for common or even for private interest  besides many small tribes there were in the age of henry ii five principal sovereignties in the island munster leinster mead ulster and connaught and as it had been usual for one or the other of these to take the lead in their wars there was commonly some prince who seemed for the time to act as monarch of ireland roderic o connor king of connaught was then advanced to this d gnity hoveden p      but his government ill obeyed even within his own territory was not capable of uniting the people in any measures either for the establishment of order or for defense against foreigners the ambition of henry had very early in his reign been moved by the prospect of these advantages to attempt the subjection of ireland and a pretense was only wanting to invade a people who being always confined to their own island had never given any reason of complaint to any of their neighbors for this purpose he had recourse to rome which assumed a right to dispose of kingdoms and empires and not foreseeing the dangerous disputes which he was one day to maintain with that see he helped for present or rather for an imaginary convenience to give sanction to claims which were now become dangerous to all sovereigns adrian iii who was then pontiff was by birth an englishman and being on that account disposed to oblige henry he was easily persuaded to act as master of the world and to make without any hazard or expense the acquisition of a great island to his spiritual jurisdiction the irish had by precedent missions from the britains been imperfectly converted to christianity and what the pope regarded as the surest mark of their imperfect conversion they followed the doctrines of their first teachers and had never acknowledged any subjection to the sea of rome adrian therefore in the year      issued a bull in favor of henry in which after premising that that prince had ever shown an anxious care to enlarge the church of god on earth and to increase the number of his saints and elect in heaven he represents his design of subduing ireland as derived from the same pious motives he considers his care of applying previously for the apostolic sanction as a sure earnest of success and victory and having established it as a point incontestible that all christian kingdoms belong to the patrimony of st peter he acknowledges it to be his own duty to sow among them the seeds of the gospel which might in the last day fructify to their eternal salvation he exhorts the king to invade ireland in order to extirpate the vice and wickedness of the natives and oblige them to pay yearly from every house a penny to the sea of rome he gives him entire right and authority over the

vassalage of the crown of england henry whose views were already turned toward making acquisitions in ireland readily accepted the offer but being at that time embarassed by the rebellions of his french subjects as well as by his disputes with the sea of rome he declined for the present embarking in the enterprise and gave dermot no farther assistance than letters patent by which he empowered all his subjects to aid the irish prince in the recovery of his dominions girald cambr p   dermot supported by this authority came to bristol and after endeavoring though for some time in vain to engage adventurers in the enterprise he at last formed a treaty with richard surnamed strongbow earl of strigul this nobleman who was of the illustrious house of clare had impaired his estate by

with an hundred and thirty knights sixty esquires and three hundred archers but this small body being brave men not unacquainted with discipline and completely armed a thing almost unknown in ireland they struck a great terror into the barbarous inhabitants and seemed to menace them with some great revolution the conjunction of maurice de prendergast who about the same time brought over ten knights and sixty archers enabled fitzstephens to attempt the siege of wexford a town inhabited by the danes and after gaining a battle he made himself master of the place girald cambr p          soon

restored to his kingdom of leinster projected the dethronement of roderic and aspired to the sole dominion of the island  in prosecution of these views he sent over a messenger to the earl of strigul challenging the performance of his promise and displaying the mighty advantages which might now be reaped by a small reinforcement of warlike troops from england richard not satisfied with the general allowance given by henry to all his subjects went to that prince then in normandy and having obtained a cold or ambiguous permission prepared himself for the execution of his designs he first sent

leinster and prepared to extend his dominion over all ireland roderic and the other irish princes were alarmed with the danger and combining together besieged dublin with an army of thirty thousand men but earl richard making a sudden sally at the head of ninety knights with their followers put this numerous army to rout chaced them from the field of battle and pursued them with great slaughter nothing in ireland now dared to oppose themselves to the english girald camb p       henry jealous of the progress of his own subjects sent orders to recall all the english and he made preparations to attack ireland in person girald camb p   0  but richard and the other adventurers found means to appease him by making him the most humble submissions and offering to hold all their acquisitions in vassalage to his crown girald camb p      that monarch landed in ireland at the head of five hundred knights besides other soldiers and found the irish so dispirited by their late misfortunes that in a progress which he made through the island he had no other occupation than to receive the homages of his new subjects bened abb p       hoveden p  diceto p   he left most of the irish chieftains or princes in possession of their ancient territories bestowed some lands on the english adventurers gave earl richard the commission of seneschal of ireland and after a stay of a few months returned in triumph into england by these trivial exploits scarce worth relating except for the importance of the consequences was ireland subdued and annexed for ever to the english crown  the low state of commerce and industry during those ages made it impracticable for princes to support regular armies which might retain the conquered countries in subjection and the extreme barbarism and poverty of ireland could still less afford means of bearing this expense the only expedient by which a durable conquest could then be made or maintained was by pouring in a multitude of new inhabitants dividing among them the lands of the vanquished establishing them in all offices of trust and authority and thereby transforming the ancient inhabitants into a new people by this policy the northern invaders of old and of late the duke of normandy had been able to fix their dominion and to erect kingdoms which remained stable on their foundations and were transmitted to the posterity of the first conquerors but the present state of ireland rendered that island so little inviting to the english that only a few of desperate fortunes could be persuaded from time to time to transport themselves into it brompton p  0   neubrig p  0   and instead of reclaiming the natives from their uncultivated manners they were gradually assimilated to the ancient inhabitants and degenerated from the customs of their own nation it was also found requisite to bestow great military and arbitrary powers on the leaders who commanded a handful of men amidst such hostile multitudes and law and equity in a little time became as much unknown in the english settlements as they had ever been among the irish tribes palatinates were erected in favor of the new adventurers independent authority conferred the natives never fully subdued still retained their animosities against the conquerors their hatred was retaliated by like injuries and from these causes the irish during the course of four centuries remained still savage and untractable and it was not till the latter end of elizabeths reign that the island was fully subdued nor till that of her successor that it gave hopes of becoming a useful conquest to the english nation  besides that the easy and peaceable submission of the irish left henry no farther occupation in that island he was recalled from it by another incident which was of the last importance to his interests and safety the two legates albert and theodin to whom was committed the trial of his conduct in the death of archbishop becket were arrived in normandy and being impatient of delay sent him frequent letters full of menaces if he protracted any longer the making his appearance before them gerald camb p      he hastened therefore to normandy and had a conference with them at savigny where their first demands were so exorbitant that he broke off the negotiation threatened to return to ireland and bade them do their worst against him they perceived that the season was now past for taking advantage of that tragical incident which had it been hotly pursued by interdicts and excommunications was capable of throwing the whole kingdom into combustion but the time which henry had happily gained had contributed to appease the minds of men the event could not now have the same influence as when it was recent and as the clergy had every day looked for an accommodation with the king they had not opposed the pretensions of his partisans who had been very industrious in representing to the people his entire innocence in the murder of the primate and his ignorance of the designs formed by the assassins the legates therefore found themselves obliged to lower their terms and henry was so fortunate as to conclude an accommodation with them he declared upon oath before the relics of the saints that so far from commanding or desiring the death of the archbishop he was extremely grieved when he received intelligence of it but as the passion which he had expressed on account of that prelates conduct had probably given occasion to his murder he stipulated the following conditions as an atonement for the offense he promised that he should pardon all such as had been banished for their adherence to becker and should restore them to their livings that the sea of canterbury the kings accommodation with the court of rome should be reinstated in all its ancient possessions that he should pay the templars a sum of money sufficient for the subsistence of two hundred knights during a year in the holy land that he should himself take the cross at the christmas following and if the pope insisted on it serve three years against the infidels either in spain or in palestine that he should not insist on the observance of such customs derogatory to ecclesiastical privileges as had been introduced in his own time and that he should not stop appeals to the pope in ecclesiastical causes but should content himself with exacting sufficient security

 upon signing these concessions henry received absolution from the legates was confirmed in the grant made by pope adrian of ireland brompton p  0   liber nig scac p     and nothing proves more strongly the great abilities of this monarch than his extricating himself on such easy terms from so difficult a situation he had always insisted that the laws established at clarendon contained not any new claims but the ancient customs of the kingdom and he was still at liberty notwithstanding the articles of this agreement to maintain his pretensions appeals to the pope were indeed permitted by this treaty but as the king was also permitted to exact reasonable securities from the parties and might stretch his demands on this head as far as he pleased he had it virtually in his power to prevent the pope from reaping any advantage by this seeming concession and on the whole the constitutions of clarendon remained still the law of the realm though the pope and his legates seem so little to have conceived the kings power to lie under any legal limitations that they were satisfied with his departing by treaty from one of the most momentous articles of these constitutions without requiring any repeal by the states of the kingdom  henry freed from this dangerous controversy with the ecclesiastics and with the sea of rome seemed now to have reached the pinnacle of human grandeur and felicity and to be equally happy in his domestic situation and in his political government a numerous progeny of sons and daughters gave both luster and authority to his crown prevented the dangers of a disputed succession and repressed all pretensions of the ambitious barons the kings precaution also in establishing the several branches of his family seemed well calculated to prevent all jealousies among the brothers and to perpetuate the greatness of his family he had ordered henry his eldest son to be anointed king and had destined him to be his successor in the kingdom of england the duchy of normandy and the counties of anjou maine and touraine territories which lay contiguous and which by that means might easily lend to each other mutual assistance both against

obstacles to the croisade excommunicated richa d as the chief spring of discord but the sentence of excommunication which when it was properly prepared and was zealously supported by the clergy had often great influence in that age proved entirely ineffectual in the present case the chief barons of poictou guienne normandy and anjou being attached to the young prince and seeing that he had now received the investiture from their superior lord declared for him and made inroads into the territories of such as still adhered to the old king henry disquieted by the daily revolts of his mutinous subjects and dreading still worse effects from their turbulent disposition had again recourse to papal authority and engaged the cardinal anagni who had succeeded albano in the legateship to threaten philip with laying an interdict on all his dominions but philip who was a prince of great vigor and capacity despised the menace and told anagni that it belonged not to the pope to interpose in the temporal disputes of princes much less in those between him and his rebellious vassals he even proceeded so far as to reproach the cardinal with partiality and with receiving bribes from the king of

the archbishop of rheims interposed with their good offices and the intelligence which he received of the taking tours and which made him fully sensible of the desperate situation of his affairs so subdued his spirit that he submitted to all the rigorous terms which were imposed upon him he agreed that richard should marry the princess alice that that prince should receive the homage and oath of fealty of all his subjects both in england and his transmarine dominions that he himself should pay twenty thousand marks to the king of france as a compensation for the charges of the war that his

connexions with richard he was astonished to find at the head of them the name of his second son john hoveden p      who had always been his favorite whose interests he had ever anxiously at heart and

and thirtyfifth of his reign the greatest prince of his time for wisdom virtue and ability and the most powerful in extent of dominion of all those that had ever filled the throne of england his character both in public and private life is almost without a blemish and he seems to have possessed every accomplishment both of body and mind which makes a man either estimable or amiable he was of a middle stature strong and well proportioned his countenance was lively and engaging his conversation affable and entertaining his elocution easy persuasive and ever at command he loved peace but possessed both bravery and conduct in war was provident without timidity severe in the execution of justice without rigor and temperate without austerity he preserved health and kept himself from corpulency to which he was somewhat inclined by an abstemious diet and by frequent exercise particularly hunting when he could enjoy leisure he recreated himself either in learned conversation or in reading and he cultivated his natural talents by study above any prince of his time his affections as well as his enmities were warm and durable and his long experience of the ingratitude and infidelity of men never destroyed the natural sensibility of his temper which disposed him to friendship and society his character has been transmitted to us by many writers who were his contemparies petri bles epist       in bibltheca patrum vol  p         etc girald camb p  etc  and it resembles extremely in its most remarkable strokes that of his maternal grandfather henry i excepting only that ambition which was a ruling passion in both found not in the first henry such unexceptionable means of exerting itself and pushed that prince into measures which were both criminal in themselves and were the cause of farther crimes from which his grandsons conduct was happily exempted   this prince like most of his predecessors of the norman line except stephen passed more of his time on the continent than in this island he was surrounded with the english gentry and nobility when abroad the french gentry and nobility followed him when he resided in england both nations acted in the government as if they were the same people and on many occasions the legislatures seem not to have been distinguished as the king and english barons were all of them of french extraction the manners of that people acquired the ascendant and were regarded as the great models of imitation all foreign improvements therefore such as they were in literature and politeness in laws and arts seem now to have been in a good measure transplanted into england and that nation was become nowise inferior in all the fashionable accomplishments to any of its neighbors on the continent the more homely but more sensible manners and principles of the saxons were exchanged for the affectations of chivalry and the subtilties of school philosophy the feudal ideas of civil government the romish sentiments of religion had taken entire possession of the people by the former the sense of submission toward princes was somewhat diminished in the barons by the latter the devoted attachment to papal authority was much augmented among the clergy the norman and other foreign families established in england had now struck deep root and being entirely coalited with the people whom at first they oppressed and despised they no longer thought that they needed the protection of the crown for the enjoyment of their fortunes or considered their tenure as precarious and dependant they aspired to the same liberty and independance which they saw enjoyed by their brethren on the continent and desired to restrain those exorbitant prerogatives and arbitrary practices which the necessities of war and the violence of conquest had at first obliged them to indulge in their monarch that memory also of a more equal government under the saxon princes which still remained with the english diffused still farther the spirit of liberty and made the barons both desirous of more independance to themselves and willing to indulge it to the people and it was not long before this secret revolution in the sentiments of men produced first violent convulsions in the state and then an evident alteration in the maxims of government  the history of all the preceding kings of england since the conquest give evident proofs of the disorders attending the feudal government the licentiousness of the barons their spirit of rebellion against the prince and laws and of animosity against each other the conduct of the barons in the transmarine dominions of those monarchs afforded perhaps still more flagrant instances of these convulsions and the history of france during several ages consists almost entirely of narrations of this nature the cities during the continuance of this violent government could neither be very populous nor numerous and there occur instances which seem to prove that though these are always the first seat of law and liberty their police was in general very loose and irregular and exposed to the same disorders with those by which the country was generally infested it was a custom in london for great numbers to the amount of a hundred or more of the sons and relations of eminent citizens to form themselves into a licentious confederacy to break into rich houses and plunder them to rob and murder the passengers and to commit with impunity all sorts of disorder by these crimes it had become so dangerous to walk the streets anights that the citizens dared no more to venture abroad after sunset than if they were exposed to the incursions of a public enemy the brother of the earl of ferrars had been murdered by some of these nocturnal rioters and the death of a person of that noble birth which was much more regarded than that of many thousands of an inferior station so provoked the king that he swore vengeance against the criminals and became thenceforth much more rigorous in the execution of the laws bened abb p       there is another instance given by historians which proves to what a height such riots had proceeded and how open these criminals were in committing their robberies a band of them had attacked the house of a rich citizen with an intention of plundering it had broke through a stonewall with hammers and wedges and had already entered the house sword in hand when the citizen armed capapee and supported by his faithful servants appeared in the passage to oppose them he cut off the right hand of the first robber that entered and made such stout resistance that his neighbors had leizure to assemble and come to his relief the man who lost his hand was caught and was tempted by the promise of pardon to reveal his confederates among whom was one john senex esteemed among the richest and best born citizens of london he was convicted by the ordeal trial and though he offered five hundred marks for his life the king refused the money and ordered him to be hanged bened abb           henrys exactness in administering justice had gained him so great reputation that even foreign and distant princes made him an arbiter and submitted their differences to his judgment sanchez king of navarre having some controversies with alfonso king of castile was contented though alfonso had married the daughter of henry to choose that prince for a referee and they agreed each of them to consign three castles into neutral hands as a pledge of their not departing from his award henry made the cause be examined before his great council and gave a

been chosen by henry rymer vol   p    bened abb p     diceto p     brompton p    0   henry so far abolished the barbarous and absurd practice of forfeiting ships which had been wrecked on the coast that if one man or animal was alive in the ship the vessel and goods were restored to the owners rymer vol   p      the reign of henry was remarkable for an innovation which was afterward carried farther by his successors and was attended with the most important consequences to the government this prince was disgusted with the species of military force which was established by the feudal institutions and which though it was extremely burdensome to the subject yet rendered very little service to the sovereign the barons or military tenants came late into the field they were obliged to serve only for forty days they were unskilful and disorderly in all their operations and they were apt to carry into the camp the same refractory and independent spirit to which they were accustomed in their civil government henry therefore introduced the practice of making a commutation of their military service for money and he levied scutages from his baronies and knights fees instead of requiring the personal attendance of his vassals there is mention made in the history of the exchequer of these scutages in his second fifth and eighteenth year madox p                  and other writers give us an account of three more of them tyrrel vol   p     from the records  when the prince had thus obtained money he made a contract with some of those adventurers in which europe at that time abounded they found him soldiers of the same character with themselves who were bound to serve for a stipulated time the armies were much less numerous but more useful than when composed of all the military vassals of the crown the feudal institutions began to relax the kings became rapacious for money on which all their power depended the barons seeing no end of exactions sought to defend their property and as the same causes had nearly the same effect in the different countries of europe the several crowns either lost or acquired authority according to their different success in this struggle  this prince was also the first who levied a tax on the movables or personal estates of his subjects nobles as well as people their zeal for the holy wars made them submit to this innovation and a precedent being once obtained this taxation became in following reigns the usual method of supplying the necessities of the crown the tax of danegelt so generally odious to the nation was remitted in this reign  it was an usual practice of the kings of england to repeat the ceremony of their coronation thrice a year on assembling the states at the three great festivals henry after the first years of his reign never renewed this ceremony which was found to be very expensive and very useless none of his successors ever revived it it is deemed a great act of grace in this prince that he mitigated the rigor of the forestlaws and punished any transgressions of them not capitally but by fines imprisonments and other more moderate penalties  since we are here collecting some detached instances which show the genius of the age and which could not so well enter into the body of the history it may not be amiss to mention the quarrel between roger archbishop of york and richard

find a croisade less dangerous and attended with more immediate profit the prejudices of the age had made the lending of money on interest pass by the invidious name of usury yet the necessity of the

died in the tenth year of his reign and the fortysecond of his age and he left no issue behind him  and character of the king the most shining part of this princes character were his military talents no man even in that romantic age carried personal courage and intrepidity to a greater height and this quality gained him the appellation of the lionhearted coeur de lion he passionately loved glory chiefly military glory and as his conduct in the field was not inferior to his valor he seems to have possessed every talent necessary for acquiring it his resentments also were high his pride unconquerable and his subjects as well as his neighbors had therefore reason to apprehend from the continuance of his reign a perpetual scene of blood and violence of an impetuous and vehement spirit he was distinguished by all the good as well as the bad qualities which are incident to that character he was open frank generous sincere and brave he was revengeful domineering ambitious haughty and cruel and was thus better calculated to dazzle men by the splendour of his enterprises than either to promote their happiness or his own grandeur by a sound and well regulated policy as military talents make great impression on the people he seems to have been much beloved by his english subjects and he is remarked to have been the first prince of the norman line who bore a sincere affection and regard to them he passed however only four months of his reign in that kingdom the croisade employed him near three years he was detained about fourteen months in captivity the rest of his reign was spent either in war or preparations for war against france and he was so pleased with the fame which he had acquired in the east that he seems to have determined notwithstanding all his past misfortunes to have farther exhausted his kingdom and to have exposed himself to new hazards by conducting another expedition against the infidels   though the english pleased themselves with the glory which the kings martial talents procured them his reign was very oppressive and somewhat arbitrary by the high taxes which he levied on them and often without the consent of the states or great council in the ninth of his reign he levied five shillings on each hyde of land and because the clergy refused to contribute their share he put them out of the protection of law and ordered the civil courts to give them no sentence for any debts which they might claim hoveden p  tyrrel vol   p      twice in his reign he ordered all his charters to be sealed anew and the parties to pay fees for the

endured fourteen months captivity for not paying   0000 marks to the emperor and be obliged at last to leave hostages for a third of the sum the prices of commodities in this reign are also a certain proof that no such enormous sum could be levied from the people a hyde of land or a hundred and twenty acres was commonly let for twenty shillings a year money of that time the general and stated

well attended that no one durst accuse him or bear evidence against him and the primate finding the impotence of laws contented himself with exacting from the citizens hostages for their good behavior

introducing the right of primogeniture made such a distinction between the families of the elder and younger brothers that the son of the former was thought entitled to succeed to his grandfather preferably to his uncles though nearer allied to the deceased monarch but though this progress of ideas was natural it was gradual in the age of which we treat the practice of representation was

renounce the french alliance which had encouraged him to enter into enmity against all his family but the brave youth rendered more haughty from misfortunes maintained the justice of his cause asserted his claim not only to the french provinces but to the crown of england and in his turn required the king to restore the son of his elder brother to the possession of his inheritance ibid  john sensible from these symptoms of spirit that the young prince though now a prisoner might some time prove a most dangerous enemy determined to prevent all future peril by dispatching his nephew and arthur was never more heard of murder of arthur duke of brittany the circumstances which attended this deed of darkness were no doubt carefully concealed by the actors and are variously related by historians but the most probable account is as follows the king it is said first proposed to william de la braye one of his servants to dispatch arthur but william replied that he was a gentleman not a hangman and he positively refused compliance another instrument of murder was found and was dispatched with proper orders to falaise but hubert de bourg chamberain to the king and constable of the castle feigning that he himself would execute the kings mandate sent back the assassin spread the report that the young prince was dead and publicly performed all the ceremonies of his interment but finding that the bretons vowed vengeance for the murder and that all the revolted barons persevered more obstinately in their rebellion he thought it prudent to reveal the secret and to inform the world that the duke of brittany was still alive and in his custody this discovery proved fatal to the young prnce john first removed him to the castle of rouen and coming in a boat during the nightime to that place commanded arthur to be brought forth to him the prince aware of his danger and now more subdued by the continuance of his misfortunes and by the approach of death threw himself on is before his uncle and begged for mercy but the barbarous tyrant making him no reply stabbed him with his own hands and fastening a stone to the dead body threw it into the seine  the whole world was struck with horror at this inhuman deed and from that moment the king detested by his subjects retained a very precarious authority over both the people and the barons in his dominions the bretons enraged at this disappointment in their fond hopes waged implacable war against him and fixing the succession of their government put themselves in a posture to revenge the murder of their sovereign

chief vassals of the crown philip received their application with pleasure summoned john to stand a trial before him and on his nonappearance passed sentence with the concurrence of the peers upon

dismembered from it many of the other great vassals whose jealousy might have interposed and have obstructed the execution of this project were not at present in a situation to oppose it and the rest either looked on with indifference or gave their assistance to this dangerous aggrandizement of their superior lord the earls of handers and blois were engaged in the holy war the count of champagne

every enterprise easy and successful against him philip after taking several castles and fortresses beyond the loire which he either garrisoned or dismantled received the submissions of the count of alencon who deserted john and delivered up all the places under his command to the french king upon which philip separated his army in order to give them some repose after the fatigues of the campaign john suddenly collecting some troops laid siege to alencon and philip whose dispersed army could not be brought together in time to succor it saw himself exposed to the disgrace of suffering the oppression of his friend and confederate but his active and fertile genius found an expedient against this evil there was held at that very time a tournament at moret in the gatinois whither all the chief nobility of france and the neighboring countries had resorted in order to signalize their courage and address philip presented himself before them craved their assistance in his distress and pointed out the plains of alencon as the most honorable field in which they could display their generosity and martial spirit these valorous knights vowed that they would take vengeance on the base

every city opened its gates as soon as philip appeared before it rouen alone arques and verneuil determined to maintain their liberties and formed a confederacy together for mutual defense philip began with the attack of rouen and the inhabitants were so inflamed with hatred to france that on the appearance of his army they fell on all the natives of that country whom they found within their

hierarchy protected by the roman pontiff had already carried to an enormous height its usurpations upon the civil power but in order to extend them farther and render them useful to the court of rome

taxes at pleasure upon the clergy and in the first year of this century taking advantage of the popular fr nzy for croisades he sent collectors over all europe who levied by his authority the fortieth

consent the suffragan bishops of canterbury who were accustomed to concur in the choice of their primate were no less displeased at the exclusion given them in this election the elder monks of

superior tribunal where the interposition of royal authority in bestowing ecclesiastical benefices was very invidious where even the cause of suffragan bishops was not so favorable as that of monks he determined to make the new election entirely unexceptionable he submitted the affair wholly to the canons of christchurch and departing from the right claimed by his predecessors ventured no farther than to inform them privately that they would do him an acceptable piece of service if they chose john de gray bishop of norwich for their primate m paris p     m west p      the election of that prelate was accordingly made without a contradictory vote and the king to obviate all contests endeavored to persuade the suffragan bishops not to insist on their right of concurring in the election but these prelates persevering in their pretensions sent an agent to maintain their cause before innocent while the king and the convent of christ church dispatched twelve monks of that order to support before the same tribunal the election of the bishop of norwich  thus there lay three different claims before the pope whom all parties allowed to be the supreme arbiter of the contest the claim of the suffragans being so opposite to the usual maxims of the papal court was soon set aside the election of reginald was so obviously fraudulent and irregular that there was no possibility of defending it but innocent maintained that though this election was null and invalid it ought previously to have been declared such by the sovereign pontiff before the monks could proceed to a new election and that the choice of the bishop of norwich was of course as uncanonical as that of his competitor m paris p     chron de mailr p      advantage was therefore taken of this subtlety for introducing a precedent by which the sea of canterbury the most important dignity in the church after the papal throne should be ever after at the disposal of the court of rome  while the pope maintained so many fierce contests in order to wrest from princes the right of granting investitures and to exclude laymen from all authority of conferring ecclesiastical benefices he was supported by the united influence of the clergy who aspiring to independance fought with all the ardour of ambition and all the zeal of superstition under his sacred banners but no sooner was this point after a great effusion of blood and the convulsions of many states established in some tolerable degree than the victorious leader as is usual turned his arms against his own community and aspired to center all power in his person by the invention of reserves provisions commendams and other devices the pope gradually assumed the right of filling vacant benefices and the plenitude of his apostolic power which was not subjected to any limitations supplied all defects of title in the person on whom he bestowed preferment the canons which regulated elections were purposely rendered intricate and involved frequent disputes arose among candidates appeals were every day carried to rome the apostolic see besides reaping pecuniary advantages from these contests often exercised the power of setting aside both the litigants and on pretense of appeasing faction nominated a third person who might be more acceptable to the contending parties  the present controversy about the election to the sea of canterbury afforded innocent an opportunity of claiming this right and he failed not to perceive and avail himself of his advantage he sent for the twelve monks deputed by the convent to maintain the cause of the bishop of norwith cardinal langton appointed archbhop of canterbury and commanded them under the penalty of excommunication to choose for their primate cardinal langton an englishman by

put the kingdom under the sentence of interdict ibid  all the other prelates threw themselves on their knees before him and entreated him with tears in their eyes to prevent the scandal of this sentence by making a speedy submission to his spiritual father by receiving from his hands the new elected primate and by restoring the monks of christ church to all their rights and possessions he burst out into the most indecent invectives against the prelates swore by gods teeth his usual oath that if the pope presumed to put his kingdom under an interdict he would send to him all the bishops and clergy of england and would confiscate all their estates and threatened that if thenceforth he caught any romans in his dominions he would put out their eyes and cut off their noses in order to set a mark upon them which might distinguish them from all other nations ibid  amidst all this idle violence john stood on such bad terms with his nobility that he never dared to assemble the states of the kingdom who in so just a cause would probably have adhered to any other monarch and have defended with vigor the liberties of the nation against these palpable usurpations of the court of rome

the sentence of interdict was at that time the great instrument of vengeance and policy employed by the court of rome was pronounced against sovereigns for the lightest offenses and made the guilt of one person involve the ruin of millions even in their spiritual and eternal welfare the execution of it was artificially calculated to strike the senses in the highest degree and to operate with irresistible force on the superstitious minds of the people the nation was of a sudden deprived of all exterior exercise of its religion the altars were despoiled of their ornaments the crosses the relics the images the statues of the saints were laid on the ground and as if the air itself were profaned and might pollute them by its contact the priests carefully covered them up even from their own approach and veneration the use of bells entirely ceased in all the churches the bells themselves were removed from the steeples and laid on the ground with the other sacred utensils mass was celebrated with shut doors and none but the priests were admitted to that holy institution the laity partook of no religious rite except baptism to newborn infants and the communion to the dying the

archbishop anselm more rigorously executed in england the ecclesiastics gave almost universally and avowedly into the use of concubinage and the court of rome which had no interest in prohibiting this practice made a very slight opposition to it the custom was become so prevalent that some german synods before the reformation not only permitted but to avoid scandal enjoined the use of concubines to the younger clergy padre paolo hist conc trid lib    and it was usual every where for priests to apply to their ordinary and obtain from him a formal liberty for this indulgence the bishop commonly took care to prevent this practice from degenerating into licentiousness he confined the priest to the use of one woman required him to be constant to her bed obliged him to provide for her subsistence and that of her children and though the offspring was in the eye of the law deemed illegitimate this commerce was really a kind of inferior marriage such as is still practiced in germany among the nobles and may be regarded by the candid as an appeal from the tyranny of civil and ecclesiastical institutions to the more virtuous and more unerring laws of nature  the quarrel between the king and the sea of rome continued for some years and though many of the clergy from the fear of punishment obeyed the orders of john and celebrated divine service they complied with the utmost reluctance and were regarded both by themselves and the people as men who betrayed their principles and sacrificed their conscience to temporal regards and interests during this violent situation the

refractory monarch but as a sentence of this kind required an armed force to execute it the pontiff casting his eyes around pitched at last on philip king of france as the person into whose powerful

scene of this princes misfortunes still awaited him and he was destined to pass through a series of more humiliating circumstances than had ever yet fallen to the lot of any other monarch  discontents of the barons the introduction of the feudal law into england by william the conqueror had much infringed the liberties however imperfect enjoyed by the anglosaxons in their ancient government and had reduced the whole people to a state of vassalage under the king or barons and even the greatest part of them to a real state of slavery the necessity also of devolving great power into the hands of a prince who was to maintain a military dominion over a vanquished nation had engaged the norman barons to submit to a more rigorous and absolute authority than that to which men of their rank in other feudal governments were commonly subjected the prerogatives of the crown once raised to a high pitch were not easily reduced and the nation during the course of an hundred and fifty years had groaned under a tyranny unknown to all the kingdoms founded by the northern conquerors henry i that he might allure the people to give an exclusion to his elder brother robert had granted them a charter

highspirited barons they would vindicate the honor liberty and independance of the nation with the same ardour which they now exerted in defense of their own he wrote letters therefore to the prelates to the nobility and to the king himself he exhorted the first to employ their good offices in conciliating peace between the contending parties and putting an end to civil discord to the second he

them such of their demands as should appear just and reasonable rymer vol i p           the barons easily saw from the tenor of these letters that they must lay their account with having the pope as well as the king for their adversary but they had already advanced too far to recede from their pretensions and their passions were so deeply engaged that it exceeded even the power of superstition itself any longer to control them they also foresaw that the thunders of rome when not seconded by the efforts of the english ecclesiastics would be of small avail against them and they perceived that the most considerable of the prelaters as well as all the inferior clergy professed the highest approbation of their cause besides that these men were seized with the national passion for laws and liberty blessings of which they themselves expected to partake there concurred very powerful causes to loosen their devoted attachment to the apostolic see it appeared from all the late usurpations of the roman pontiff that he pretended to reap alone all the advantages accruing from that victory which under his banners though at their own hazard they had every where obtained over the civil magistrate the pope assumed a despotic power over all the churches their particular customs privileges and immunities were treated with disdain even the canons of general councils were set aside by his dispensing power the whole administration of the church was centered in the court of rome all preferments ran of course in the same channel and the provincial clergy saw at least felt that there was a necessity of limiting these exorbitant pretensions the legate nicholas in filling those numerous vacancies which had fallen in england during an interdict of six years had proceeded in the most arbitrary manner and had paid no regard in conferring dignities to personal merit to rank to the inclination of the electors or to the customs of the country the english church was universally disgusted and langton himself though he owed his elevation to an incroachment of the romish see was no sooner established in his high office than he became jealous of the privileges annexed to it and formed attachments with the country subjected to his jurisdiction thse causes though they opened slowly the eyes of men failed not to produce their effect they set bounds to the usurpations of the papacy the tide first stopped and then turned against the sovereign pontiff and it is otherwise inconceivable how that age so prone to superstition and so sunk in ignorance or rather so devoted to a spurious erudition could have escaped falling into an absolute and total slavery under the court of rome  insurrection of the barons about the time that the popes letters arrived in england the malecontent barons on the approach of the festival of easter when they were to expect the kings answer to their petitions met by agreement at stamford and they assembled a force consisting of above

then resided and they there received a message from the king by the archbishop of canterbury and the earl of pembroke desiring to know what those liberties were which they so zealously challenged from their sovereign they delivered to these messengers a schedule containing the chief articles of their demands which was no sooner shown to the king than he burst into a furious passion and asked why the barons did not also demand of him his kingdom swearing that he would never grant them such liberties as must reduce himself to slavery m paris p       no sooner were the confederated nobles

estates m paris p      in order to show them what they might expect from their prosperous arms they made incursions from london and laid waste the kings parks and palaces and all the barons who had hitherto carried the semblance of supporting the royal party were glad of this pretense to join openly a cause which they had always secretly favored the king was left at odiham in surrey with a poor

windsor and stains a place which has ever since been extremely celebrated on account of this great event the two parties encamped apart like open enemies and after a debate of a few days the king with a facility which was somewhat suspicious signed and sealed the charter which was required of him   th june this famous deed commonly called the great charter either granted or secured very important liberties and privileges to every order of men in the kingdom to the clergy to the barons and to the people  the freedom of elections was secured to the clergy the former charter of the king was confirmed by which the necessity of a royal conge delire and confirmation was superseded all check upon appeals to rome was removed by the allowance granted every man to depart the kingdom at pleasure and the fines upon the clergy for any offense were ordained to be proportional to their lay estates not to their ecclesiastical benefices  the privileges granted to the barons were either abatements in the rigors of the feudal law or determinations in points which had been left by that law or had become by practice arbitrary and ambiguous the reliefs of heirs succeeding to a military fee were ascertained an earls at an hundred pounds a barons at an hundred marks a knights at an hundred shillings it was ordained by the charter that if the heir be a minor he shall immediately upon his majority enter upon his estate without paying any relief the king shall not sell his wardship he shall levy only reasonable profits upon the estate without committing waste or hurting the property he shall uphold the castles houses mills parks and ponds and if he commit the guardianship of the estate to the sheriff or any other he shall previously oblige them to find surety to the same purpose during the minority of a baron while his lands are in wardship and are not in his own possession no debt which he owes to the jews shall bear any interest heirs shall be married without disparagement and before the marriage be contracted the nearest relations of the persons shall be informed of it a widow without paying any relief shall enter upon her dower the third part of her husbands rents she shall not be compelled to marry so long as she chooses to continue single she shall only give security never to marry without her lords consent the king shall not claim the wardship of any minor who holds lands by military tenure of a baron on pretense that he also holds lands of the crown by soccage or any other tenure scutages shall be estimated at the same rate as in the time of henry i and no scutage or aid except in the three general feudal cases the kings captivity the knighting his eldest son and the marrying his eldest daughter shall be imposed but by the great council of the kingdom the prelates earls and great barons shall be called to this great council each by a particular writ the lesser barons by a general summons of the sheriff the king shall not seize any barons land for a debt to the crown if the baron possesses as many goods and chattels as are sufficient to discharge that debt no man shall be obliged to perform more service for his fee than he is bound to by his tenure no governor or constable of a castle shall oblige any knight to give money for castleguard if he is willing to perform the service in person or by another ablebodied man and if the knight be in the field himself by the kings command he shall be exempt from all other service of this nature no vassal shall be allowed to sell so much of his land as to incapacitate himself from performing his service to his lord  these were the principal articles which were calculated for the interests of the barons and had the charter contained nothing farther national happiness and liberty had been very little promoted by it as it would only have tended to increase the power and independance of an order of men who were already too powerful and whose yoke might have become more heavy on the people than even that of an absolute monarch but the barons who alone drew and imposed on the prince th s memorable charter were necessitated to insert in it other clauses of a more extensive and more beneficent nature they could not expect the concurrence of the people without comprehending together with their own the interests of inferior ranks of men and all provisions which the barons for their own sakes were obliged to make in order to ensure the free and equitable administration of justice tended directly to the benefit of the whole community the following were the principal clauses of this nature  it was ordained that all the privileges and immunities above mentioned granted to the barons against the king should be extended by the barons to their inferior vassals the king bound himself not to grant any writ empowering a baron to levy aids from his vassals except in the three feudal cases one weight and one measure shall be observed throughout the whole kingdom merchants shall be allowed to transact all business without being exposed to any arbitrary tolls and impositions they and all free men shall be allowed to go out of the kingdom and return to it at pleasure london and all cities and burghs shall preserve their ancient liberties immunities and free customs aids shall not be required of them but by the consent of the great council no towns nor individuals shall be obliged to make or support bridges but by ancient custom the goods of every free man shall be disposed of according to his will if he die intestate his heirs shall succeed to them no officer of the crown shall take any horses carts or wood without the consent of the owner the kings courts of justice shall be stationary and shall no longer follow his person they shall be open to every one and justice shall no longer be bought refused or delayed by them the sheriffs shall be incapacitated to hold pleas of the crown and shall not put any person upon his trial from rumor or suspicion alone but upon the evidence of lawful witnesses no freeman shall be taken or imprisoned or dispossessed of his free tenement and liberties or outlawed or banished or any wise hurt or injured unless by the legal judgment of his peers or by the law of the land and all who suffered otherwise in this or the two former reigns shall be restored to their rights and possessions every freeman shall be fined in proportion to his fault and no fine shall be levied on him to his utter ruin even a villain or rustic shall not by any fine be bereaved of his carts ploughs and implements of husbandry this was the only article calculated for the interests of this body of men probably at that time the most numerous in the kingdom  it must be confessed that the former articles of the great charter contain such mitigations and explanations of the feudal law as are very reasonable and equitable and that the latter involve all the chief outlines of a legal government and provide for the equal distribution of justice and free enjoyment of property the great objects for which political society was at first founded by men which the people have a perpetual and unalienable right to recall and which no time nor precedent nor statute nor positive institution ought to deter them from keeping ever uppermost in their thoughts and attention though the provisions made by this charter might conformable to the genius of the age be esteemed too concise and too bare of circumstances to maintain the execution of its articles in opposition to the chicanery of lawyers supported by the violence of power time gradually ascertained the sense of all the ambiguous expressions and those generous barons who first extorted this concession still held their swords in their hands and could turn them against those who dared on any pretense to depart from the original spirit and meaning of the grant it is now easy from the tenor of this charter to determine what those laws were of king edward which the english nation during so many generations still desired with such an obstinate perseverance to have recalled and established they were these latter articles of magna charta and the barons who at the beginning of these commotions required the revival of the saxon laws undoubtedly thought that they had sufficiently satisfied the people by procuring them this concession which comprehended the chief objects to which they had so long aspired but what we are most to admire is the prudence and moderation of these haughty nobles themselves who were enraged by injuries enflamed by opposition and elated by a total victory over their sovereign they were contented even in this plenitude of power to depart from some articles of henry is charter which they made the foundation of their demands particularly from the abolition of wardships so important a point and they seem to have been sufficiently careful not to diminish too far the power and revenue of the crown if they appear therefore to have carried other demands to too great a height it can be ascribed only to the faithless and tyrannical character of the king himself of which they had long had experience and which they foresaw would if they provided no farther security lead him soon to infringe their liberties and recall his own concessions this alone gave birth to those other articles seemingly exorbitant which were added as a rampart for the safeguard of the great charter  the barons obliged the king to agree that london should remain in their hands and the tower be consigned to the custody of the primate till the   th of august

council of twentyfive who in conjunction with the great council were empowered to compel him to observe the charter and in case of resistance might levy war against him attack his castles and employ every kind of violence except against his royal person and that of his queen and children all men throughout the kingdom were bound under the penalty of confiscation to swear obedience to the five and twenty barons and the freeholders of each county were to choose twelve knights who were to make report of such evil customs as required redress conformable to the tenor of the great charter this seems a certain proof that the house of commons was not then in being otherwise the knights and burgesses from the several counties could have given in to the lords a list of the grievances without any new

throw off so ignominious a slavery m paris p      he grew sullen silent and reserved he shunned the society of his courtiers and nobles he retired into the isle of wight as if desirous to hide his

to him to build and destroy kingdoms to plant and overthrow he annulled and vacated the whole charter as unjust in itself as obtained by compulsion and as derogatory to the dignity of the apostolic see he prohibited the barons to exact the observance of it he even prohibited the king himself to pay any regard to it he absolved him and his subjects from all oaths which they had been constrained

richard had even by his last will declared him his successor they pretended that he was already legally deposed by sentence of the peers of france on account of the murder of his nephew though that sentence could not possibly regard any thing but his transmarine dominions which alone he held in homage to that crown on more plausible grounds they affirmed that he had already deposed himself by doing homage to the pope changing the nature of his sovereignty and resigning an independent crown for a see or vassalage under a foreign power and as blanch of castille the wife of lewis was

with the conjunctures of the times and he now undervalued as much all papal censures as he formerly pretended to pay respect to them his chief scruple was with regard to the fidelity which he might expect of the english barons in their new engagements and the danger of entrusting his son and heir into the hands of men who might on any caprice or necessity make peace with their native sovereign by sacrificing a pledge of so much value he therefore exacted from the barons twentyfive hostages of the most noble birth in the kingdom m paris p     chron dunst vol i p     and having obtained this security he first sent over a small army to the relief of the confederates and then more numerous forces who arrived with lewis himself at their head  the first effect of the young princes appearance

latter to entertain in their present situation w heming p   the viscount of melun too it is said one of his courtiers fell sick at london and finding the approaches of death he sent for some of his

road lay along the seashore which was overflowed at high water and not choosing the proper time for his journey he lost in the inundation all his carriages treasure baggage and regalia the affliction of this disaster and the vexation from the distracted state of his affairs increased the sickness under which he then labored and though he reached the castle of newark he was obliged to halt there and his distemper soon after put an end to his life in the fortyninth year of his age and seventeenth of his reign and freed the nation from the dangers to which it was equally exposed by his success or his misfortunes death and character of the king   the character of this prince is nothing but a complication of vices equally mean and odious ruinous to himself and destructive to his people cowardice inactivity folly levity licentiousness ingratitude treachery tyranny and cruelty all these qualities appear too evidently in the several incidents of his life to give us any room to suspect that the disagreeable picture has been anywise overcharged by the prejudice of the ancient historians it is hard to say whether his conduct to his father his brother his nephew or his subjects was most culpable or whether his crimes in these respects were not even exceeded by the baseness which appeared in his transactions with the king of france the pope and the barons his dominions when they devolved to him by the death of his brother were more extensive than have ever since his time been ruled by any english monarch but he first lost by his misconduct the flourishing provinces in france the ancient patrimony of his family he subjected his kingdom to a shameful vassalage under the sea of rome he saw the prerogatives of his crown diminished by law and still more reduced by faction and he died at last when in danger of being totally expelled by a foreign power and of either ending his life miserably in prison or seeking shelter as a fugitive from the pursuit of his enemies  the prejudices against this prince were so violent that he was believed to have sent an embassy to the miramoulin or emperor of morocco and to have offered to change his religion and become mohammedan in order to purchase the protection of that monarch but though that story is told us on plausible authority by matthew paris p      it is in itself utterly improbable except that there is nothing so incredible as may not become likely from the folly and wickedness of john  the monks throw great reproaches on this prince for his impiety and even infidelity and as an instance of it they tell us

by the normans in england our subject therefore requires that we should form a just idea of this law in order to explain the state as well of that kingdom as of all the other kingdoms of europe which during those ages were governed by similar institutions and though i am sensible that i must here repeat many observations and reflections which have been communicated by others lesprit des loix dr robertsons history of scotland dalrymple of feudal tenures  yet as every book agreeable to the observation of a great historian padre de paolo hist conc trid  should be as complete as possible within itself and should never refer for any thing material to other books it will be necessary in this place to deliver a short plan of that prodigious fabric which for several centuries preserved such a mixture of liberty and oppression order and anarchy stability and revolution as was never experienced in any other age or any other part of the world  origin of the feudal law after the northern nations subdued the provinces of the roman empire they were obliged to establish a system of government which might secure their conquests as well against the revolt of their numerous subjects who remained in the provinces as from the inroads of other tribes who might be tempted to ravish from them their new acquisitions the great change of circumstances made them here depart from those institutions which prevailed among them while they remained in the forests of germany yet was it still natural for them to retain in their present settlement as much of their ancient customs as was compatible with their new situation  the german governments being more a confederacy of independent warriors than a civil subjection derived their principal force from many inferior and voluntary associations which individuals formed under a particular head or chieftain and which it became the highest point of honor to maintain with inviolable fidelity the glory of the chieftain consisted in the number the bravery and the zealous attachment of his retainers the duty of the retainers required that they should accompany their chieftain in all wars and dangers that they should fight and perish by his side and that they should esteem his renown or his favor a sufficient recompense for all their services tacit de mor germ  the prince himself was nothing but a great chieftain who was chosen from among the rest on account of his superior valor or nobility and who derived his power from the voluntary association or attachment of the other chieftains  when a tribe governed by those ideas and actuated by those principles subdued a large territory they found that though it was necessary to keep themselves in a military posture they could neither remain united in a body nor take up their quarters in several garrisons and that their manners and institutions debarred them from using those expedients the obvious ones which in a like situation would have been employed by a civilized nation their ignorance in the art of finances and perhaps the devastations inseparable from such violent conquests rendered it impracticable for them to levy taxes sufficient for the pay of numerous armies and their repugnance to a slavish subordination with their attachment to rural pleasures made the life of the camp or garrison if perpetuated during peaceful times extremely odious and disgustful to them they seized therefore such a proportion of the conquered lands as appeared necessary they assigned a share for supporting the dignity of their prince and government they distributed other parts under the title of fiefs to the chieftains these made a new partition among their retainers the express condition of all these grants was that they might be resumed at pleasure and that the possessor so long as he enjoyed them should still remain in readiness to take the field for the defense of the nation and though the conquerors immediately separated in order to enjoy their new acquisitions their martial disposition made them readily fulfill the terms of their engagement they assembled on the first alarm their habitual attachment to the chieftain made them willingly submit to his command and thus a regular military force though concealed lay always ready to defend on any emergence the interest and honor of the community  we are not to imagine that all or even the greatest part of the conquered lands was seized by the northern conquerors or that the whole of the land thus seized was subjected to these military services this supposition is confuted by the history of all the nations on the continent even the idea given us of the german manners by the roman historian may convince us that that bold people would never have been contented with so precarious a subsistence or have fought to procure establishments which were only to continue during the good pleasure of their sovereign though the northern chieftains accepted of lands which being considered as a kind of military pay might be resumed at the will of the king or general they also took possession of estates which being hereditary and independent enabled them to maintain their native liberty and support without courtfavour the honor of their rank and family  progress of the feudallaw but there is a great difference in the consequences between the distribution of a pecuniary subsistence and the assignment of lands burdened with the condition of military service the delivery of the former at the weekly monthly or annual terms of payment still recalls the idea of a voluntary gratuity from the prince and reminds the soldier of the precarious tenure by which he holds his commission but the attachment naturally formed with a fixed portion of land gradually begets the idea of something like property and makes the possessor forget his dependant situation and the condition which was at first annexed to the grant it seemed equitable that one who had cultivated and sowed a field should reap the harvest hence fiefs which were at first entirely precarious were soon made annual a man who had employed his money in building planting or other improvements expected to reap the fruits of his labor or expense hence they were next granted during a term of years it would be thought hard to expel a man from his possessions who had always done his duty and performed the conditions on which he originally received them hence the chieftains in a subsequent period thought themselves entitled to demand the enjoyment of their feudal lands during life it was found that a man would in battle hazard his life more willingly if assured that his family should inherit his possessions and should not be exposed by his death to want and poverty hence fiefs were made hereditary in families and descended during one age to the son then to the grandson next to the brothers and afterward to more distant relations lib feud lib   tit    the idea of property stole in gradually upon that of military pay and each century made some sensible addition to the stability of fiefs and tenures  in all these successive acquisitions the chieftain was supported by his vassals who having originally a strong connection with him augmented by the constant intercourse of good offices and by the friendships arising from neighborhood and dependence were inclined to follow their leader against all his enemies and voluntarily in his private quarrels pay him the same obedience to which by their tenure they were bound in foreign wars while he daily advanced new pretensions to secure the possession of his superior fief they expected to find the same advantage in acquiring stability to their subordinate ones and they zealously opposed the intrusion of a new lord who would be inclined as he was fully entitled to bestow the possession of their lands on his own favorites and retainers the authority of the sovereign gradually decayed and the nobles fortified each in his own territory by the attachment of his vassals became too powerful to be expelled by an order from the throne and he secured by law what he had at first acquired by usurpation  during this precarious state of the supreme power a difference would immediately be experienced between those portions of territory which were subjected to the feudal tenures and those which were possessed by an allodial or free title though the latter possessions had at first been esteemed infinitely preferable they were soon found by the progressive changes introduced into public and private law to be of a much inferior condition to the former the possessors of a feudal territory united by a regular subordination under one chieftain and by the mutual attachments of the vassals had the same advantages over the proprietors of the other which a disciplined army enjoys over a dispersed multitude and were enabled to commit with impunity all injuries on their defenseless neighbors every one therefore hastened to seek that protection which he found so necessary and each allodial proprietor resigning his possessions into the hands of the king or of some nobleman respected for power or valor received them back with the condition of feudal services marculf form    apud lindenbr p       which though a burden somewhat grievous brought him ample compensation by connecting him with the neighboring proprietors and placing him under the guardianship of a potent chieftain the decay of the political government thus necessarily occasioned the extension of the feudal the kingdoms of europe were universally divided into baronics and these into inferior fiefs and the attachment of vassals to their chieftain which was at first an essential part of the german manners was still supported by the same causes from which it at first arose the necessity of mutual protection and the continued intercourse between the head and the members of benefits and services  but there was another circumstance which corroborated these feudal dependancies and tended to connect the vassals with their superior lord by an indissoluble bond of union the northern conquerors as well as the more early greeks and romans embraced a policy which is unavoidable to all nations that have made slender advances in refinement and they every where united the civil jurisdiction with the military power law in its commencement was not an intricate science and was more governed by maxims of equity which seem obvious to common sense than by numerous and subtle principles applied to a variety of cases by profound reasonings from analogy an officer though he had passed his life in the field was able to determine all legal controversies which could occur within the district committed to his charge and his decisions were the most likely to meet with a prompt and ready obedience from men who respected his person and were accustomed to act under his command the profit arising from punishments which were then chiefly pecuniary was another reason for his desiring to retain the judicial power and when his fief became hereditary this authority which was essential to it was also transmitted to his posterity the counts and other magistrates whose power was merely official were tempted in imitation of the feudal lords whom they resembled in so many particulars to render their dignity perpetual and hereditary and in the decline of the regal power they found no difficulty to make good their pretensions after this manner the vast fabric of feudal subordination became quite solid and comprehensive it formed every where an essential part of the political constitution and the norman and other barons who followed the fortunes of william were so accustomed to it that they could scarce form an idea of any other species of civil government the ideas of the feudal government were so rooted that even lawyers in those ages could not form a notion of any other constitution regnum says bracton lib   cap    quod ex comitatibus and baronibus dicitur esse constitutum   the saxons who conquered england as they exterminated the ancient inhabitants and were secured by the sea against new invaders found it less requisite to maintain themselves in a military posture and the quantity of land which they annexed to offices seems to have been of small value and for that reason continued the longer in its original situation and was always possessed during pleasure by those entrusted with the command these conditions were too precarious to satisfy the norman chieftains who enjoyed more independent possessions and jurisdictions in their own country and william was obliged in the new distribution of land to copy the tenures which were now become universal on the continent england of a sudden became a feudal kingdom coke comm on lit p     ad sect    and received all the advantages and was exposed to all the inconveniences incident to that species of civil polity  the feudal government of england according to the principls of the feudal law the king was the supreme lord of the landed property and all possessors who enjoyed the fruits or revenue of any part of it held these privileges either mediately or immediately of him and their property was conceived to be in some degree conditional summer of gavelk p  0  smith de rep lib   cap  0  the land was still apprehended to be a species of benefice which was the original conception of a feudal property and the vassal owed in return for it stated services to his baron as the baron himself did for his land to the crown the vassal was obliged to defend his baron in war and the baron at the head of his vassals was bound to fight in defense of the king and kingdom but besides these military services which were casual there were others imposed of a civil nature which were more constant and perpetual  the northern nations had no idea that any man trained up to honor or enured to arms was ever to be governed without his own consent by the absolute will of another or that the administration of justice was ever to be exercised by the private opinion of any one magistrate without the concurrence of some other persons whose interest might induce them to check his arbitrary and iniquitous decisions the king therefore when he found it necessary to demand any services of his barons or chief tenants beyond what was due by their tenures was obliged to assemble them in order to procure their consent and when it was necessary to determine any controversy among the barons themselves the question must be discussed in their presence and be decided according to their opinion or advice in these two circumstances of consent and advice consisted chiefly the civil services of the ancient barons and these implied all the considerable incidents of governments in one view the barons regarded this attendance as their principal privilege in another as a grievous burden that no momentous affairs could be transacted without their consent and advice was in general esteemed the great security of their possessions and dignities but as they reaped no immediate profit from their attendance at court and were exposed to great inconvenience and charge by an absence from their own estates every one was glad to exempt himself from each particular exertion of this power and was pleased both that the call for that duty should return seldom upon him and that others should undergo the burden in his stead the king on the other hand was usually anxious for several reasons that the assembly of the barons should be full at every stated or casual time of meeting this attendance was the chief badge of their subordination to his crown and drew them from that independance which they were apt to affect in their own castles and manors and where the meeting was thin or ill attended its determinations had less authority and were not followed by so ready an obedience from the whole community  the case was the same with the barons in their courts as with the king in the supreme council of the nation it was requisite to assemble the vassals in order to determine by their vote any question which regarded the barony and they sat along with the chieftain in all trials whether civil or criminal which occurred within the limits of their jurisdiction they were bound to pay suit and service at the court of their baron and as their tenure was military and consequently honorable they were admitted into his society and partook of his friendship thus a kingdom was only considered as a great barony and a barony as a small kingdom the barons were peers to each other in the national council and in some degree companions to the king the vassals were peers to each other in the court of barony and companions to their baron du cange gloss in verb par cujac common in lib feud lib   tit   p    spelm gloss in verb   but though this resemblance so far took place the vassals by the natural course of things universally in the feudal constitutions fell into a greater subordination under the baron than the baron himself under his sovereign and these governments had a necessary and infallible tendency to augment the power of the nobles the great chieftain residing in his countryseat or castle which he was commonly allowed to fortify lost in a great measure his connection or acquaintance with the prince and added every day new force to his authority over the vassals of the barony they received from him education in all military exercises his hospitality invited them to live and enjoy society in his hall their leizure which was great made them perpetual retainers on his person and partakers of his country sports and amusements they had no means of gratifying their ambition but by making a figure in his train his favor and countenance was their greatest honor his displeasure exposed them to contempt and ignominy and they felt every moment the necessity of his protection both in the controversies which occurred with other vassals and what was more material in the daily inroads and injuries which were committed by the neighboring barons during the time of general war the sovereign who marched at the head of his armies and was the great protector of the state acquired always some accession to his authority which he lost during the intervals of peace and tranquillity but the loose police incident to the feudal constitutions maintained a perpetual though secret hostility between the several members of the state and the vassals found no other means of security against the injuries to which they were continually exposed but by closely adhering to their chieftain and falling into a submssive dependence upon him  if the feudal government was so little favorable to the true liberty even of the military vss it was still more destructive of the independance and security of the other members of the state or what in a proper sense we call the people a great part of them were serfs and lived in a state of absolute slavery or villainage the other inhabitants of the country paid their rent in services which were in a great measure arbitrary and they could expect no redress of injuries in a court of barony from men who thought they had a right to oppress and tyrannize over them the towns were situated either within the demesnes of the king or the lands of the great barons and were almost entirely subjected to the absolute will of their master the languishing state of commerce kept the inhabitants poor and contemptible and the political institutions were calculated to render that poverty perpetual the barons and gentry living in rustic plenty and hospitality gave no encouragement to the arts and had no demand for any of the more elaborate produce of manufactures every profession was held in contempt but that of arms and if any merchant or manufacturer rose by industry and frugality to a degree of opulence he found himself but the more exposed to injuries from the envy and avidity of the military nobles  these concurring causes gave the feudal governments so strong a biass toward aristocracy that the royal authority was extremely eclipsed in all the european states and instead of dreading the growth of monarchical power we might rather expect that the community would every where crumble into so many independent baronies and lose the political union by which they were cemented in elective monarchies the event was commonly answerable to this expectation and the barons gaining ground on every vacancy of the throne raised themselves almost to a state of sovereignty and sacrificed to their power both the rights of the crown and the liberties of the people but hereditary monarchies had a principle of authority which was not so easily subverted and there were several causes which still maintained a degree of influence in the hands of the sovereign  the greatest baron could never lose view entirely of those principles of the feudal constitution which bound him as a vassal to submission and fidelity toward his prince because he was every moment obliged to have recourse to those principles in exacting fidelity and submission from his own vassals the lesser barons finding that the annihilation of royal authority lest them exposed without protection to the insults and injuries of more potent neighbors naturally adhered to the crown and promoted the execution of general and equal laws the people had still a stronger interest to desire the grandeur of the sovereign and the king being the legal magistrate who suffered by every internal convulsion or oppression and who regarded the great nobles as his immediate rivals assumed the salutary office of general guardian or protector of the commons besides the prerogatives with which the law endowed him his large demesnes and numerous retainers rendered him in one sense the greatest baron of his kingdom and where he was possessed of personal vigor and ability for his situation required these advantages he was commonly able to preserve his authority and maintain his station as head of the community and the chief fountain of law and justice  the first kings of the norman race were favored by another circumstance which preserved them from the encroachments of their barons they were generals of a conquering army which was obliged to continue in a military posture and to maintain great subordination under their leader in order to secure themselves from the revolt of the numerous natives whom they had bereaved of all their properties and privileges but though this circumstance supported the authority of william and his immediate successors and rendered them extremely absolute it was lost as soon as the norman barons began to coalesce with the nation to acquire a security in their possessions and to fix their influence over their vassals tenants and slaves and the immense fortunes which the conqueror had bestowed on his chief captains served to support their independancy and make them formidable to the sovereign  he gave for instance to hugh de abrincis his sisters son the whole county of chester

power of england was lodged in the king and great council or what was afterward called the parliament it is not doubted but the archbishops bishops and most considerable abbots were constituent members of this council they sat by a double title by prescription as having always possessed that privilege through the whole saxon period from the first establishment of christianity and by their right of baronage as holding of the king in capite by military service these two titles of the prelates were never accurately distinguished when the usurpations of the church had risen to such a height as to make the bishops affect a separate dominion and regard their seat in parliament as a degradation of their episcopal dignity the king insisted that they were barons and on that account obliged by the general principles of the feudal law to attend on him in his great councils spel gloff in verb baro  yet there still remained some practices which supposed their title to be derived merely from ancient possession when a bishop was elected he sat in parliament before the king had made him restitution of his temporalities and during the vacancy of a see the guardian of the spiritualities was summoned to attend along with the bishops  the barons were another constituent part of the great council of the nation these held immediately of the crown by a military tenure they were the most honorable members of the state and had a right to be consulted in all public deliberations they were the immediate vassals of the crown and owed as a service their attendance in the court of their supreme lord a resolution taken without their consent was likely to be but ill executed and no determination of any cause or controversy among them had any validity where the vote and advice of the whole body did not concur the dignity of earl or count was official and territorial as well as hereditary and as all the earls were also barons they were considered as military vassals of the crown were admitted in that capacity into the general council and formed the most honorable and powerful branch of it  but there was another class of the immediate military tenants of the crown equally numerous with the barons the tenants in capite by knights service and these however inferior in power or property held by a tenure which was equally honorable as that of the others a barony was commonly composed of several knights fees and though the number seems not to have been exactly defined seldom consisted of less than forty hydes of land four hydes made one knights fee the relief of a barony was twelve times greater than that of a knights fee whence we may conjecture its value spelm gloss in verb feodum  but where a man held of the king only one or two knights fees he was still an immediate vassal of the king and as such had a title to have a seat in the general councils but as this attendance was usually esteemed a burden and one too great for a man of slender fortune to bear constantly it is probable that though he had a title if he pleased to be admitted he was not obliged by any penalty like the barons to pay a regular attendance all the immediate military tenants of the crown amounted not fully to  00 when domesday book was framed and as the members were well pleased on any pretext to excuse themselves from attendance the assembly was never likely on any occasion to become too numerous for the dispatch of public business  the commons so far the nature of a general council or ancient parliament is determined without any doubt or controversy the only question seems to be with regard to the commons or the representatives of counties and boroughs whether they were also in more early times constituent parts of parliament this question was once disputed in england with great acrimony but such is the force of time and evidence that they can sometimes prevail even over faction and the question seems by general consent and even by their own to be at last determined against the ruling party it is agreed that the commons were no part of the great council till some ages after the conquest and that the military tenants alone of the crown composed that supreme and legislative assembly  the vassals of a baron were by their tenure immediately dependant on him owed attendance at his court and paid all their duty to the king through that dependence which their lord was obliged by his tenure to acknowledge to his sovereign and superior their land comprehended in the barony was represented in parliament by the baron himself who was supposed according to the fictions of the feudal law to possess the direct property of it and it would have been deemed incongruous to give it any other representation they stood in the same capacity to him that he and the other barons did to the king the former were peers of the barony the latter were peers of the realm the vassals possessed a subordinate rank within their district the baron enjoyed a supreme dignity in the great assembly they were in some degree his companions at home he the kings companion in the court and nothing can be more evidently repugnant to all feudal ideas and to that gradual subordination which was essential to those ancient institutions than to imagine that the king would apply either for the advice or consent of men who were of a rank or order so much inferior and whose duty was immediately paid to the mesne lord that was interposed between them and the throne spelm gloss in verb baro   if it be unreasonable to think that the vassals of a barony though their tenure was military and noble and honorable were ever summoned to give their opinion in national councils much less can it be supposed that the tradesmen or inhabitants of boroughs whose condition was still so much inferior would be admitted to that privilege it appears from domesday that the boroughs were at the time of the conquest scarce more than country villages and that the inhabitants lived in entire dependence on the king or great lords and were of a station little better than servile liber homo anciently signified a gentleman for scarce any one was entirely free spelm

so decisive in all disputes and controversies modoxs baron angl p      the great similarity among all the feudal governments of europe is well known to every man that has any acquaintance with ancient history and the antiquarians of all foreign countries where the question was never embarassed by party disputes have allowed that the commons were very late in being admitted to a share in the legislative power in normandy particularly whose constitution was most likely to be williams model in raising his new fabric of the english government the states were entirely composed of the clergy and nobility and the first incorporated boroughs or communities of that duchy were rouen and falaise which enjoyed their privileges by a grant of philip augustus in the year   0  norman du chesnii p  0   du cange gloss in verb commune  all the ancient english historians when they mention the great council of the nation call it an assembly of the baronage nobility or great men and none of their expressions though several hundred passages might be produced can without the utmost violence be tortured to a meaning which will admit the commons to be constituent members of that body sometimes the historians mention the people populus as a part of the parliament but they always mean the laity in opposition to the clergy sometimes the word communitas is found but it always means communitas baronii these points are clearly proved by dr brady  the magna charta of king john provides that no tax or scutage should be imposed but by the consent of the great council and for more security it enumerates the persons entitled to a seat in that council the prelates and immediate tenants of the crown without any mention of the commons an authority so full certain and explicit that nothing but the zeal of party could ever have procured credit to any contrary system  it was probably the example of the french barons which first emboldened the english to require greater independance from their sovereign it is also probable that the boroughs and corporations of england were established in imitation of those of france it may therefore be proposed as no unlikely conjecture that both the privileges of the peers and the liberty of the commons were originally the growth of that country  in ancient times men were very little solicitous to obtain a place in the legislative assemblies and rather regarded their attendance as a burden which was not compensated by any return of profit or honor proportioned to the trouble and expense the only reason of instituting those public councils was on the part of the subject that they desired some security from the attempts of arbitrary power and on the part of the sovereign that he despaired of governing men of such independent spirits without their own consent and concurrence but the commons or the inhabitants of boroughs had not as yet reached such a degree of consideration as to desire security against their prince or to imagine that even if they were assembled in a representative body they had power or rank sufficient to enforce it the only protection which they aspired to was against the immediate violence and injustice of their fellowcitizens and this advantage each of them looked for from the courts of justice or from the authority of some great lord to whom by law or his own choice he was attached on the other hand the sovereign was sufficiently assured of obedience in the whole community if he procured the concurrence of the nobles nor had he reason to apprehend that any order of the state could resist his and their united authority the military vassals could entertain no idea of opposing both their prince and their superiors the burgesses and tradesmen could much less aspire to such a thought and thus even if history were silent on that head we have reason to conclude from the known situation of mankind during these ages that the commons were never admitted as members of the legislative body  the

judicial power was ultimately in his hands and was exercised by officers and ministers of his appointment  judicial power the general plan of the anglonorman government was that the court of barony

attend the sheriffs in these courts and to assist him in the administration of justice by this means they received frequent and sensible admonitions of their dependence on the king or supreme magistrate they formed a kind of community with their fellowbarons and freeholders they were often drawn from their individual and independent state peculiar to the feudal system and were made members of a political body and perhaps this institution of countycourts in england has had greater effects on the government than has yet been distinctly pointed out by historians or traced by antiquaries

disobliging their superior by appealing from his court but the countycourts were much discredited and as the freeholders were found ignorant of the intricate principles and forms of the new law the lawyers gradually brought all business before the kings judges and abandoned the ancient simple and popular judicature after this manner the formalities of justice which though they appear tedious and cumbersome are found requisite to the support of liberty in all monarchical governments proved at first by a combination of causes very advantageous to the royal authority  revenue of the crown the

the possessors of land or the military tenants though they were better protected both by law and by the great privilege of carrying arms were from the nature of their tenures much exposed to the inroads of power and possessed not what we should esteem in our age a very durable security the conqueror granted by his laws that the barons should be obliged to pay nothing beyond their stated services ll will conq     except a reasonable aid to ransom his person if he were taken in war to make his eldest son a knight and to marry his eldest daughter what should on these occasions be deemed a reasonable aid was not determined and the demands of the crown were so far discretionary  the king could require in war the personal attendance of his vassals that is of all the landed proprietors and if they declined the service they were obliged to pay him a composition in money which was called a scutage the sum was during some reigns very precarious and uncertain it was sometimes levied without allowing the vassal the liberty of personal service gervase de tilbury p     and it was an usual artifice of the king to pretend an expedition that he might be entitled to levy the scutage from his military tenants danegelt was another species of land tax levied by the early norman kings arbitrarily and contrary to the laws of the conqueror madoxs hist of the exch p      moneyage was also a general land tax of the same nature levied by the two first norman kings and abolished by the charter of henry i matthew paris p     it was a shilling paid every three years by each hearth to induce the king not to use his prerogative of debasing the coin indeed it appears from that charter that though the conqueror had granted his military tenants an immunity from all taxes and tailliages he and his son william had never thought themselves bound to observe that rule but had levied impositions at pleasure on all the landed estates of the kingdom the utmost that henry grants is that the land cultivated by the military tenant himself shall not be so burdened but he reserves the power of taxing the farmers and as it is known that henrys charter was never observed in any one article we may be assured that this prince and his successors retracted even this small indulgence and levied arbitrary impositions on all the lands of all their subjects these taxes were sometimes very heavy since malmesbury tells us that in the reign of william rufus the farmers on account of them abandoned tillage and a famine ensued so also chron abb st petri de burgo p    knyghton p        the escheats were a great branch both of power and of revenue to the king especially during the first reigns after the conquest in default of descendants from the first baron his land reverted to the crown and continually augmented the kings possessions the prince had indeed by law a power of alienating these escheats but by this means he enjoyed an opportunity of establishing the fortunes of his friends and servants and thereby enlarging his authority sometimes he retained them in his own hands and they were gradually confounded with his royal demesnes and became difficult to be distinguished from them this confusion is probably the reason why the king acquired the right of alienating his demesnes  but besides escheats from default of heirs those which ensued from crimes or breach of duty toward the superior lord were very frequent in ancient times if the vassal being thrice summoned to attend his superiors court and do fealty neglected or refused obedience he forfeited all title to his lands hottom de feud disp cap    col      if he denied his tenure or refused his service he was exposed to the same penalty lib feud lib   tit   lib   tit        where he sold his estate without

and had the right of spoiling and destroying it unless the baron paid him a reasonable composition spelm gloss in verb felonia glanville lib   cap     we have not here enumerated all the species of felonies or of crimes by which forfeiture was incurred we have said enough to prove that the possession of feudal property was anciently somewhat precarious and that the primary idea was never entirely lost of its being a kind of fee or benefice  when a baron died the king immediately took possession of the estate and the heir before he recovered his right was obliged to make application to the crown to desire that he might be admitted to do homage for his land and to pay a composition to the king this composition was not at first fixed by law at least by practice the king was often very exorbitant in his demands and kept possession of the land till they were complied with  if the heir was a minor the king retained the whole profit of the estate till his majority and might grant what sum he thought proper for the education and maintenance of the young baron this practice was also founded on the notion that a fief was a benefice and that while the heir could not perform his military services the revenue devolved to the superior who employed another in his place it is obvious that a great proportion of the landed property must by means of this device be continually in the hands of the prince and that all the noble families were thereby held in continual dependence when the king granted the wardship of a rich heir to any one he had the opportunity of enriching a favorite or minister if he sold it he was thereby able to levy a considerable sum of money simon de mountfort paid henry iii  0000 marks an immense sum in those days for the wardship of gilbert de umfreville madoxs hist of the exch p       if the heir was a female the king was entitled to offer her any husband of her rank he thought proper and if she refused him she forfeited her land even a male heir could not marry without the royal consent and it was usual for men to pay large sums for the liberty of making their own choice in marriage id p   0  no man could dispose of his land either by sale or will without the consent of his superior the possessor was never considered as full proprietor he was still a kind of beneficiary and could not oblige his superior to accept of any vassal

of europe id p      england was not in this respect more barbarous than its neighbors  these iniquitous practices of the norman kings were so well known that on the death of hugh bigod in the reign of henry ii the best and most just of these princes the eldest son and the widow of this nobleman came to court and strove by proffering large presents to the king each of them to acquire possession of that rich inheritance the king was so equitable as to order the cause to be tried by the great council but in the mean time he seized into his own hands all the money and treasures of the deceased bened abb p   0      peter of blois a judicious and even an elegant writer for that age gives a pathetic description of the venality of justice and the oppressions of the poor under the reign of henry and he scruples not to complain to the king himself of these abuses petri bles epist  apud bibl patrum tom    p  0    we may judge what the case would be under the government of worse princes the

fines for crimes and trespasses were another considerable branch of the royal revenue madox chap xiv  most crimes were atoned for by money the fines imposed were not limited by any rule or statute and frequently occasioned the total ruin of the person even for the slightest trespasses the forestlaws particularly were a great source of oppression the king possessed sixtyeight forests thirteen chaces and seven hundred and eightyone parks in different parts of england spelm gloss in verbo foresta  and considering the extreme passion of the english and normans for hunting these were so many snares laid for the people by which they were allured into trespasses and brought within the reach of arbitrary and rigorous laws which the king had thought proper by his own authority to enact  but the most barefaced acts of tyranny and oppression were those practiced against the jews who were entirely out of the protection of law were extremely odious to the bigotry of the people and were abandoned to the immensurable rapacity of the king and his ministers besides many other indignities to which they were continually exposed it appears that they were once all thrown into prison and the sum of   000

considerable that there was a particular court of exchequer set apart for managing it id chap vii   commerce we may judge of the low state of commerce among the english when the jews notwithstanding all these oppressions could still find their account in trading among them and lending them money and as the improvements of agriculture were also much checked both by the immense possessions of the nobility and by the precarious state of feudal property it appears that industry of no kind could then have place in the kingdom we learn from the extracts given us of domesday by brady in his treatise of boroughs that almost all the boroughs of england had suffered in the shock of the conquest and had decayed extremely between the death of the confessor and the time when domesday was framed   it is asserted by sir harry spellman gloss in verb judicium dei  as an undoubted truth that during the reigns of the first norman princes every edict of the king issued with the consent of his privy council had the full force of law but the barons surely were not so passive as to entrust a power entirely arbitrary and despotic into the hands of the sovereign it only appears that the constitution had not fixed any precise boundaries to the royal power that the right of issuing proclamations on any emergence and of exacting obedience to them a right which was always supposed inherent in the crown is very difficult to be distinguished from a legislative authority that the extreme imperfection of the ancient laws and the sudden exigencies which often occurred in such turbulent governments obliged the prince to exert frequently the latent powers of his prerogative that he naturally proceeded from the acquiescence of the people to assume in many particulars of moment an authority from which he had excluded himself by express statutes charters or concessions and which was in the main repugnant to the general genius of the constitution and that the lives the personal liberty and the properties of all his subjects were less secured by law against the exertion of his arbitrary authority than by the independent power and private connexions of each individual it appears from the great charter itself that not only john a tyrannical prince and richard a violent one but their father henry under whose reign the prevalence of gross abuses is the least to be suspected was accustomed from his sole authority without process of law to imprison banish and attaint the freemen of his kingdom  a great baron in ancient times considered himself as a kind of sovereign within his territory and was attended with courtiers and dependants more zealously attached to him than the ministers of state and the great officers were commonly to their sovereign he often maintained in his court the parade of royalty by establishing a justiciary constable marshall chamberlain seneschal and chancellor and assigning to each of these officers a separate province and command he was usually very assiduous in exercising his jurisdiction and took such delight in that image of sovereignty that it was found necessary to restrain his activity and prohibit him by law from holding courts too frequently dugd jurid orig p     it is not to be doubted that the example set him by the prince of a mercenary and sordid extortion would be faithfully copied and that all his good and bad offices his justice and injustice were equally put to sale he had the power with the kings consent to exact talliages even from the freecitizens who lived within his barony and as his necessities made him rapacious his authority was usually found to be more oppressive and tyrannical than the sovereign madox h of exch p   0  he was ever engaged in hereditary or personal animosities or confederacies with his neighbors and often gave protection to all desperate adventurers and criminals who could be useful in serving his violent purposes he was able alone in times of tranquillity to obstruct the execution of justice within his territories and by combining with a few malcontent barons of high rank and power he could throw the whole state into convulsions and on the whole though the royal authority was confined within bounds and often within very narrow ones yet the  was irregular and often the source of great disorders and it was not derived from the liberty of the people but from the military power of many petty tyrants who were equally dangerous to the prince and oppressive to the subject  the church the power of the church was another rampart against royal authority but this defense was also the cause of many mischiefs and inconveniences the dignified clergy perhaps were not so prone to immediate violence as the barons but as they pretended to a total independance on the state and could always cover themselves with the appearances of religion they proved in one respect an obstruction to the settlement of the kingdom and to the regular execution of the laws the policy of the conqueror was in this particular liable to some exception he augmented the superstitious veneration for rome to which that age was so much inclined and he broke those bands of connection which in the saxon times had preserved an union between the lay and the clerical orders he prohibited the bishops to sit in the countycourts he allowed ecclesiastical causes to be tried only in spiritual courts char will apud wilkins p   0 spel conc vol ii p     and he so much exalted the power of the clergy that of  0    knights fees into which he divided england he placed no less than   0   under the church spel gloss in verb manus mortua we are not to imagine as some have done that the church possessed  in this proportion but only that they and their vassals enjoyed such a proportionable part of the lanced property   civil laws the right of primogeniture came in with the feudal law a practice which is hurtful by producing and maintaining an unequal division of private property but is advantageous in another respect by accustoming the people to a preference in  of the eldest son and thereby preventing a partition or disputed succession in the monarchy the normans introduced the use of sirnames which tend to preserve the knowledge of families and pedigrees as do also the distinction of coats of arms which came in vogue about the time of king richard they abolished none of the old absurd methods of trial by the cross or ordeal and they added a new absurdity that by single combat ll will cap     which became a regular part of jurisprudence and was conducted with all the order method devotion and solemnity imaginable spel gloss in verb campus the last instance of these duels was in the   th of eliz so long did that absurdity remain  the ideas of chivalry also seem to have been imported by the normans no traces of these fantastic notions are to be found among the plain and rustic saxons manners the feudal institutions by raising a set of men to a kind of sovereign dignity rendering personal strength and valor so requisite and making every knight and baron his own protector and avenger begot that military pride and sense of honor which being cultivated and embellished by the poets and romance writers of the age ended in chivalry the virtuous knight fought not only in his own quarrel but in that of the innocent the helpless and above all of the fair whom he supposed to be for ever under the guardianship of his valiant arm the uncourteous knight who from his castle exercised robbery on travelers and committed violence on virgins was the object of his perpetual indignation and he put him to death without scruple or trial or appeal wherever he met with him the great independance of men made personal honor and fidelity the chief tie among them and rendered it the capital virtue of every true knight or genuine professor of chivalry the solemnities of single combat as established by law banished the notion of every thing unfair or unequal in rencounters and maintained an appearance of courtesy between the combatants till the moment of their engagement the credulity of the age grafted on this stock the notion of giants

   and a thousand wonders which still multiplied during the times of the croisades when men returning from so great a distance used the liberty of imposing every fiction on their believing audience these ideas of chivalry infected the writings conversation and behavior of men during some ages and even after they were in a great degree banished by the revival of learning they left modern gallantry and the point of honor which still maintain their influence and are the genuine offspring of those ancient affections  the concession of the great charter or rather its full establishment for there was a considerable interval between the one and the other gave rise by degrees to a new species of government and introduced some order and justice into the administration the ensuing scenes of our history are therefore somewhat different from the preceding yet the great charter contained no establishment of new counts magistrates or senates nor abolition of the old it introduced no new distribution of the powers of the commonwealth and no innovation in the political or public law of the kingdom it only guarded and that merely by verbal clauses against such tyrannical practices as are incompatible with civilized government and if they become very frequent are incompatible with all government the barbarous license of the kings and perhaps of the nobles was thenceforth somewhat more restrained men acquired some more security for their properties and their liberties and government approached a little nearer to that end for which it was originally instituted the distribution of justice and the equal protection of the citizens acts of violence and iniquity in the crown which before were only deemed injuries to individuals and were hazardous chiefly in proportion to the number power and dignity of the persons affected by them were now regarded in some degree as public injuries and as infringements of a charter calculated for general security and thus the establishment of the great charter without seeming anywise to innovate in the distribution of political power became a kind of epoch in the constitution  the end of the first volume errata page   l  0
