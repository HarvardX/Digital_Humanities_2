family secrets literary and domestic  in five volumes  family secrets literary and domestic  by mr pratt  in five volumes  vol v  once more i ascend to urge the justice whose almighty word measures the bloody acts of impious men with equal penance chapman london printed for t n longman paternosterrow        to john fonblanque esquire common place satire and panegyric should be enumerated amongst the vulgar errors which more or less disfigure the goodsense and candor of every country a number of these more especially of the former attach to our own and of all common place censure that which is thrown in the lump upon professional men is the most illiberal and pernicious the very names of priest and lawyer  the one ordained to inculcate divine and eternal laws  the other appointed to administer a code of human justice founded upon those  can scarcely be mentioned without affixing thereto unmanly epithets these are extended even to modes of faith concerning which men are divided in opinion and as christian dog hypocritical catholic heretic protestant are retorted on the one hand knavish ifraelite sensual mahomedan are recriminated on the other the generous will look on it all as the dark shadow of prejudice the illustrious will dispel it as a vapor dissolved by the sun yet popular ideas are a kind of moral epidemies they may be classed amongst the catching disorders of our childhood the cradle is scarcely exempt the nursery breathes the contagion mixing with all that we see and hear and taste we imbibe false opinions even with our maternal nourishment the tender parent while supporting the life she gave infuses them with her kiss the infant lisps in prejudice and voice no sooner forms itself into language than it begins to express that prejudice in the parlour it gains strength and descending into the kitchen grows into a size so enormous that neither the discipline of schools nor the precepts of the written page can wholly root it out it is thus that the infant mind goes distempered into the world and collecting force as it goes from the power of habit and of example the spreading malady has infected the world itself hence prejudices are to be ranked in the number of our first impressions and like most of those are indelible for if intellect matured and sentiment liberalized efface some others will remain the parrot the pie and other imitative birds may be easily brought to run the routine of vulgar abuse  and with as little difficulty they may learn a chime of virtuous epithets but who shall teach them to forget either the one or the other the bad and the good mix in their senseless vocabulary yet form idioms and language nearly as wise and generous as those which are adopted by the chattering echoes of society who call knave and fool on a like parroted principle  in sincere hope that something may be added to the arguments against the unfair practice of involving large bodies of respectable men in the crimes of individual members the author has endeavored to paint the virtues of men of different persuasions and pursuits giving to each the force of a living instance  of the three brothers whose characters are amongst the most prominent objects of this work one has been discriminated by integrity firmness and philosophic energy of mind accompanied with tenderness of heart another by the aid of sterling talents and allsubduing perseverance distinguished himself for found principles a sound understanding and as a sound lawyer  as a member of that dignified profession which defines and maintains the rights of social beings and as a man  his private friends and the public are fully competent to decide how far the gentleman whose name appears at the head of this volume is properly chosen to illustrate the

something within that overturned all her pious arguments on that subject she then told him that as their lodger would not be at home till late in the day her mother thought it might be more agreeable to sit in the room above stairs which said patty is more pleasant as it looks into the street and if sir guise pleased she would show him the way adding that even if their lodger should happen to arrive he was so good a gentleman she was sure he would not be displeased  sir guise having few resources within himself to which he could apply with any hope of consolation accepted the proposal and followed his amiable guide into a spacious dining apartment which opened into a drawing room and that again into a more extensive bedroom than the front of the house seemed to promise nor is this the best part either sir said she for beyond this chamber there is another apartment as large again as this but our gentleman  it is all his own furniture you must know  has filled it so with goods of one sort or another that it is never used and i often say to myself what a pity it is such beautiful grand things as are in that room should be put out of sight  it is generally locked but i see the key is now in the door  sir guise feeling his curiosity excited by this eulogium expressed a desire to look at what had been so favorably described  patty ran hastily to open the door and begged he would walk in the baronet entered but in the next moment abruptly receded with every mark of horror as at the sight of some dreadful apparition of dreadful apparitions indeed we have been told with all the aweful pageantry of circumstances and those who have wished to affect our imaginations or agitate our passions by making us wish yet dread to approach the phantoms they have conjured up have at last wound up our hopes and fears to the expectation of something tremendous but without using any of these arts of heightening never surely has the human eye been struck with a sight nor the human soul appalled with a sensation more terrible than sir guise stuart experienced on beholding the objects now displayed to his view  in the apartment from which the baronet drew back were placed those very articles which we have already observed were saved from the general wreck of the abbey sale and sir guise saw a spacious room crowded with objects which though inanimate might rive the hardest heart here was the bridalbed which admitted him as an unworthy partner when the good and beautiful matilda became his wedded victim here also was deposited the familypiece that contained the portraits of her parents wreathing around her virgin form garlands of flowers ah little suspecting then they were ever to be displaced by thorny fetters the sacred couch too whereon after the points of those thorns festered in her heart she breathed her last  even the cradle which lulled awhile the cares that were in store for her unhappy children the illtreated charles and caroline how  how came these here asked sir guise in a voice that communicated the terrors it expressed to the trembling patty  i know not an please your honor she replied i was at school far away when they were brought and i never asked or heard where they came from but as they belong to our lodger my mother i dare say can tell  who then is your lodger  sir john fitzorton please your honor is his honors name  inasmuch as it was possible to augment the emotions of sir guise they were increased by this intelligence john fitzorton reiterated he in faultering accents is he the owner of these goods and the occupier of these apartments and where is he when does he come perhaps he may be even now in his way hither  hark hark child there is a knock at the door doubtless it is him  he must not see me go out open the window o if it be him where can i go will he stay long is there any other way out of the house o hide o hide me from the eye of john fitzorton  as he uttered these questions he was running wild as it were with dread about the rooms and it was in vain that patty assured him it was only her father come back but this information sir guise seemed not even to hear he continued to traverse the apartments and had got into the storeroom with an idea of seeking a hiding place but there yet more afflicting images smote his view and again drove him back in consternation and he exclaimed oh god those objects are more terrible even than john fitzorton i had rather brave the sight of him his whole family and hell itself than be closed in that place  without attending to the astonished patty who supposed that the madness he had exhibited the night before had returned he precipitated himself down stairs rushed in a disordered manner by robert and his wife and staring wildly at them without speaking got into the street  chapter ii the surprise which behavior of this kind produces in the spectators takes off for a while all power of action and sir guise had gained the pavement and was running along it at full speed like a man dreading pursuit before either the husband or wife could impart their suspicions to each other both however agreed when they recovered speech that his raving fits had returned and when the daughter came with an air scarcely less distraught than his own to give in her evidence by relating his strange demeanor in the rooms above they were unanimous not only in their sentiments but in their commiseration  and no wonder cried robert irwin what that poor man has upon his mind is enough to drive the devil himself out of his wits and if he had seen what i did just now in grosvenorsquare he would have been madder still behold ye when i got there his sine ladymadam had but just got into bed and some of the ringleaders of her gang were keeping it up over the diceboxes and the best wines out of poor sir guises cellar the porter whom i waked out of his great chair and who is the only man i knew told me that the servants men and women were asleep or dead drunk on chairs and sophas and carpets in the different rooms lying among one another pig fashion  o what a cursed thing it is to be a bad man especially a wicked father my patty  poor gentleman how i pity him said patty  but you have got something there for his honor observed the wife  you shall hear resumed irwin as nobody but the porter could speak he told me he was sorry for his masters misfortunes but it was more than that place was worth to disturb her ladyship so soon after she was gone to rest and to tell you the truth whispered he a little bit of a rumpus happened in course of our grand doing last night between our squire valley as we call him and a new spark madam has just taken a fancy to and so valley who is a desperatious man gave his rival who is a bit of a lord too they say a box on the ear whereupon the lord talked pretty much about swords and guns master nicky dabble who is mostly here of late seemed to think that lawyering him a little would be best but some how they hussled nick out of the house and as my lord  what a plague is his name  is a new visitor and just come to his estate  you understand me robert there was a confabulation betwixt vall and our madam tempest as we call her and the upshot of it was that she wheedled and he begged pardon and i fancy my lord and my lady agreed to settle the difference above stairs and valley and nick are as merry as grigs below there you may hear them laughing away now  well i am glad they have made it up however observed patty with the utmost innocence of thought only i wish her poor disturbed husband had been there when the quarrel was made up that he might have shared it too  that might not have been quite so well mayhap replied robert winking at margaret  but to finish my story the porter advised me to go as i came for most folks robert said he laughing go away empty from this house even if they come into it loaded  no matter for that said i then i will see if i cannot make a bit of a change in the old place i suppose the master of the house has got a corner of it above or below where he puts his things now as he wants some of them and has fallen into a bit of a scrape i shall thank you to show me where it is why how you talk robert said the porter this is not sir guises house nor madam tempests neither no nor vallys it is in short nobodys house and every bodys  properly to speak it belongs added he laughing to one king faro harder than his namesake of old for tempest and valley and nick and the otleys who are now at the top of the tree and fifty others are only his subjects and he plays the deuce with em all sometimes and as to sir guise he has been at peepbo with his and my ladys creditors some time and except a small bundle which was brought here late last night by one of nick dabbles chaps saying it belonged to sir guise who had given his chum the slip i dont think he has a rag belonging to him in the house if you think that will be of any service you may take it as nobody but i have seen it for they were all drinking dancing diceing and masquerading when the chap brought it for nick and i think it is as well saved out of old nicks hands as not whereupon the porter went to a closet in the great passage took out the bundle and gave it me and here it is wife and that is all i got for it so i came running off as fast as my legs could carry me just as if i had escaped from a den of thieves  i never heard such shocking doings in my life sighed patty but indeed father i cannot think but that mr dabble as you call him tells things that are not true of his master and mistress  but all this time poor sir guise is running distracted through the streets that is true child said robert here take this till i just step into the parlour margey give me the key of the bureau i must take a little cash with me for fear of accidents  chapter iii when robert had hastily furnished himself he saluted his wife and daughter bid them get something good and comforting for dinner and taking the bundle promised to return as soon as he could  two hours did poor robert irwin from the purest principles of compassion uninspired by one grain of esteem search in vain for his object at length slackening his pace and returning home with dejected looks and disappointed face the shouts of a mob attracted his attention and advancing to explore the cause he perceived a man harranguing the crowd with the utmost violence while he held another man by the collar and bawling forth that he would take his oath to the person being the one who had escaped from his brother officer the day before and that he was therefore his prisoner because they were in partnership and he would for that reason as soon part with his right hand as with the man  for to tell you the truth i suspect there has been a kind of collusion betwixt partner and prisoner aye for aught i know master justice too and d  n me if i find them out if i dont hang them all like so many onions on a string for if they cheat me they have but another to cheat i had a right to my thirds and never took a farthing  the face of the prisoner thus assailed was covered by his spread hands and the rest of his body was so encircled by the crowd that very few of those whom curiosity had drawn could discern their object at length a voice from the multitude called aloud who owns this velvet cap which the person speaking had placed at the end of a stick elevated above the heads of the people i do answered robert irwin working his way through the crowd  i own it at least i know the head it was upon a little while ago aye and there is part of the head now in that fellows hands  irwin elbowed on and recognized sir guise stuart the mob who had sided with the latter from the time the assailant had talked of collusion his thirds etc etc now began to take an active part in favor of the party assailed and soon disengaged the baronets hair from the gripe of the enemy while they were doing this robert held down the head of the assailant by a maneuver of the same kind rendering thereby the release of sir guise less difficult the assailant having soon enough to do to attend to his own head  meanwhile a gentleman riding through the street where the mob had gathered together stopped his horse and desired to know the nature of the affray the person of whom he made the enquiry answered why we hardly know what to make of it sir but it seems to be a false arrest and upon the person of a poor man out of his senses with great earnestness and a voice of command the gentleman signified that he was a magistrate and ordered the crowd to make way the prisoner first caught his eye and immediately muffled himself up in the flap of his coat with a trembling caution that would have justly marked him with suspicion had the action been generally observed by what authority fellow questioned the gentleman do you hold that person in custody  by that of the law i have a writ against him at the suit of mr nicholas dabble the attorney  the gentleman started and seemed ready to leap from his horse let me look at the writ  partner has it but i knows my man and i will have him to lockuphouse in shirelane and then to newgate if he do not pay the money and moreover clear up another little affair at this instant irwin seemed desirous to conceal himself also and going up as by stealth to sir guise he put the bundle into the baronets hand saying in a whisper take this sir it will bring you off but dont say any thing about robert after this irwin mixed in the thickest of the crowd  the gentleman now alighted from his horse went closer to the parties in his way to whom a general whisper had circulated touching the name and authority of the magistrate this whisper soon caught the bailiff the late furious assailant would have relinquished his prey conscious he could not legally hold it and gone quietly off but the gentleman who had an eye upon all his movements commanded him to tell his name and address together with that of his partner  now the commands of this gentleman though depending very little on the softer arts of persuasion were the least refusable in the world the trembling catchpole obeyed attaching to his obedience this curious defense on which he relied for future favor i am sure your honor if my partner in this business should turn out a rogue and if mr nicholas dabble should prove he has outwitted himself i must be an honest man i was looking for a coach while partner took hushmoney of the prisoner and boasted of it to my face yes and i went and left a bundle i had the care of at the prisoners house though i did not get a farthing of my dues out of the hushmoney for thought i if i can get the prisoner to swear bribery to partner betwixt us both partner may be hanged for taking money not to see and cheating me into the bargain thus your worship observes plainly what sort of an honest man i must be  i do answered the gentleman and you may go about your business  during this conversation the prisoner nestled himself as well and as long as he could amongst the mob but the gentleman who had hitherto considered the aggressor in this affray as the principal object had now leisure to advert to the aggrieved in whom he soon discovered the person of sir guise stuart  many we trust are the readers who judging from themselves will be able to conjecture what must have been the feelings of an honest man such as john fitzorton  for he was the magistrate on this discovery few we hope judging from themselves will know how to form any adequate idea of the sensations of the person discovered  they were however sufficiently expressed in his behavior concealment no longer possible humiliated by present and degraded by past circumstances all of which came with an overwhelming force upon his memory he bowed submissive to his protector as to the acknowledged virtue of a superior being he bent his eyes to the ground and as if dreading to be seen by those of john fitzorton he held the bundle which robert had put into his hand before his face and then slunk away  john fitzorton after he had received his horse from the person who had been walking him about remounted and rode on  robert irwin believing he had escaped unseen hastened home almost immediately after he had given the parcel to sir guise and on reaching his house related the adventure in the street to his wife and daughter observing that though his honor sir john would not be displeased at him for going of a message for an unfortunate man yet to be seen with sir guise stuart after the shocking thing that had happened at the castle might offend his honor heaven forbid ejaculated hiswife surely observed the daughter innocently if people knew what the world suffered from bad actions they would try very hard to be good but thank god father people who have been bad may live to be good again  i hope i shall be a proof of that patty said irwin with tears in his eyes all things they say are for the best love and perhaps sir guise having come to our house in this manner and seeing the judgment that is upon him may make me better all the rest of my life i am sure i will try patty i will indeed love  here robert most affectionately renewed his endearments and patty returned them yes said her mother whose apron had been to her eyes some time it is a long lane that has no turning you have but one fault in the world robert and as to that if you when you are in your passions would strike me and not hurt my child i should think nothing of it  i will not strike either and do nothing but love and cherish you both for the time to come as i do now in this manner  d  n me if i do said robert with increased emotion and poor dear pattys husband shall sleep in her arms to night  just as this peacerestoring discourse ended john fitzorton reached his lodgings and without discovering any thing particular in his air or manner of speaking went up to his apartments our little family therefore were completely happy in which state we will leave them to taste the joys of domestic reconciliation the crowning of which was the enlargement of pattys husband  chapter iv we will now follow the steps of one who knew no such comforts and who alas had no hope ever to enjoy them  sir guise stuart was thrown into such additional disorder by the unexpected sight of the man whose eye even in the proudest period of his life he most sought to avoid and whose family he had so irreparably injured that to meet him under such circumstances and to receive that service from his equity which could not have been expected from any other motive sunk deeper into his mind and seemed harder to bear than any thing that had attended him since he became an outcast his rescue from the gripe of the law so much wished before was now but a secondary object of felicitation it dwindled even to nothing in comparison of the grand escape from john fitzorton who indeed was armed with terrors no villainy could brave or endure  after long wandering about without any settled direction he found himself in monmouthstreet and as he surveyed the different dresses there hung out at every door a sudden thought induced him to accept the eager invitation of one of the traders to walk into a shop the trader seeing a bundle under his arm which more mechanically than from consciousness he had still carried supposed he was come rather to sell than to buy and desired to see his goods  sir guise thinking it might promote his plan favored the motion and instead of bartering his watch for something he wished to purchase he untied the bundle which he knew was the same that he had hastily packed at his lodgings in the minories and he supposed robert irwin had taken it from the bailiff it contained a change of those things of which sir guise stood much in need but on the parcel being opened a small packet loosely wrapped emptied its contents on the floor  good heavens exclaimed our baronet how came this money here now this exclamation and the disordered surprise with which it was made and the general air as well as the particular look of sir guise stuart and more than all his appearing without any covering on his head his velvet cap having been somehow purloined after robert owned it did not prepossess the tradesman in his favor indeed he imagined them to be neither more nor less than stolen goods which the thief wished to turn into money and that the money itself was amongst the plunder a few questions and particularly one touching his bare head and slipperd feet produced confirmations of this suspicion whereupon being a man of very nice honor as to stolen articles in cases where the odds were against his holding them with any security he said he saw plainly how that bundle had been obtained and unless a better account was given than had yet been offered he should feel himself called upon as an honest man to apprehend him as a rogue  for pray how came you to be so much surprised to find those five guineas if they were your property  because said the baronet very truly i knew no more of them than you did  that is rather singular too observed the clothier how they should get into an honest mans bundle without his knowledge secondly be so good to tell me where you came from and thirdly who you are  to neither of these questions could sir guise give any satisfactory reply in truth he did not even attempt it and his silence was interpreted into a tacit confession of his villainy  well come said the trader there is some shame in you however and as you may live to see your error i will let it pass as to the linen in that parcel it is out of my line nor should i choose to buy it if it were not it is a disagreeable thing to put things forth and have them owned but if you wish to purchase any articles you see in the shop or at the door  here the trader cast a longing eye at the five guineas which sir guise had picked up  why i will deal with you as if you were as honest a man as myself  sir guise wanted not sagacity to perceive that the laying out part at least of the money which had thus unexpectedly crept into his bundle would be the only thing to save him and he was glad the matter had taken that turn  i came into your shop sir not to fell but to purchase and though you have wronged me by your suspicions i will deal with you i have a particular occasion for a drab colored coat and waistcoat i noticed hanging at your door and the broad brimmed hat i perceived on a peg over it here they are but here is a snug brown bob goes with them  better have that and you will be all of a piece said the dealer who did not doubt but our adventurer was going to take refuge from his pursuers for the late or former offenses in the dress of a quaker sir guise approved of the wig extremely and what think you of these brown worsted stockings and as to shoes i can fit you in a trice  there sir i will be bound for their fitting as well as if they were made for you  but perhaps you had rather have boots observed the trader who had now got into the spirit of trade  i can suit you there too  i call my shop every bodys warehouse  lookee sir and here is a curious pair of stocking breeches just of the color  and now you are set up  unless you should like this horsemans coat which you perceive is just in the same style  the baronet agreed to the whole lot  well then said the proprietor i will be at a word  for i never make two prices  they are yours for the five guineas which so much surprised you just now  you may put them up said sir guise but i do not see how i shall carry them  could i not get somebody to take them as far as   o yes any where interposed the dealer  there is a fellow going by the door who will i dare say be glad of the job  shall i call him if you please answered sir guise the man expressed his readiness to attend the gentleman he said he was very poor and had been looking in vain all the day for employment the goods were soon packed so as to go into the bundle except the brimmed beaver which the dealer facetiously said would be most easily carried on the new owners head where added he smiling and thinking he might take any freedom with a gentleman as honest as himself where i perceive there is a peg for it the five miraculous guineas being paid into the long opened palm of the dealer the porter took up his load and the purchaser desiring him to follow the business ended not a little to the satisfaction of all parties  thus sir guise who within a few hours had been taken for a madman and a thief escaped by good luck from being carried into custody in either of those characters yet the last six and thirty hours had been the most disastrous of his life they were the first he had ever past in the school of adversity where he was taught the rudiments of what to such dispositions is only to be learned in that academy  chapter v the interesting objects which our adventurer saw at the hospitable robert irwins and the different impediments he had met with in his way had consumed so much time that the second day of his wanderings was far spent before he found himself extricated from the several ills which had annoyed and threatened him  at length the world was once more free before him yet he was no less perplexed and uncertain what road to take or what plan to pursue than at the first moment of his emigration in truth his embarrassment had considerably increased in each of the disasters that had overtaken him he collected something of the general and honest sense of mankind respecting his character this might be gathered from the discourse of the rabble at lady tempests fashionable rout and even from the reflections of the sons and daughters of riot in a common nighthouse even the bounty of his old servants the irwins was but the alms of charitable natures whose pity was excited on general principles while the impression of their abhorrence of him as an individual remained in full force in the neglect and malignity that he experienced from the friends and partners of his misdeeds he felt that vice cannot be faithful even to its chosen associates and in the accidental good office which had been afforded him by the superb john fitzorton he could not but perceive that the service rendered by the magistrate was distinct from the sentiment entertained by the man and that while the justice of the one bestowed official relief the other exhibited even in his silence the profound of contempt  it was indeed under this accumulated consciousness of his own unworthiness thus successively forced upon him that he went into the secondhand clothes shop the directing idea being simply to purchase some dress that might serve as a screen to veil him from general obloquy shame fear and we will hope something like regenration of virtuous emotion even though that emotion had been in a manner wrung from him went to the formation of this idea  behold then our baronet followed by his temporary squire sallying forth with as little arrangement what point of the compass to steer by as the squire or knight of cervantes in woefulness of countenance indeed there was some real resemblance betwixt the immortal quixote and our forlorn baronet but alas none either in their dispositions or motives of enterprise sir guise stuart had neither the knight of la manchas extravagance of honor nor his wish of acquiring fame by heroic deeds by the rescue of innocence oppressed or the voluntary encounter of dangers and of death indeed our baronets sole design in the purchasing his coat of mail was to escape the wounding eyes of those whom he himself had outraged and had the honest the misguided hero of the spanish story met him in his career and been previously made acquainted with his course of life he would have been thought a giant of guilt and necromancy more deserving of the avenging lance than any monster he had contended with in the progress of his adventures  his attendant squire indeed had no trace of the merryhearted sancho but followed the steps of his employer with gloomy fidelity from one place to another till the shades of evening and some more powerful circumstances induced him to ask our hero whither he was going this question received no answer because it was found unanswerable sir guise had been long ruminating what he should do with himself the adherent ventured at length what follows possibly sir you have lost your way or may be you overheard what the man said to me in the shop about you and so dont like to go into your old haunt wherever it may be lest i should run back and tell him now if this should be the case i will tell you a secret i am a distressed bit of a gentleman myself and when an odd thing lies in my way such as a stray bundle a few loose guineas or what not why i have no objection to it and for all i am in such a pickle now am as keen a fellow as you can be in a word i am one of the sort  and therefore you have nothing to fear from me for all that perhaps you dont like we should join forces  some in our line like doing business alone others are for partnership  if you prefer the latter we must take a loving pot or bottle together and say good luck to one another we are near to the sign of the handinhand where some of the sort meet it lies just cleverly for the great west road has good stabling a knowing ostler and aman may be in town or country horseback or on foot in five minutes  this discourse might have terrified a stouter heart than that of sir guise not perhaps on account of the thing itself for he had long associated with probably more guilty pests of society than the poor rogue then at his elbow indeed had our baronet been made of more courageous materials it is not impossible but that the slight hold which conscience yet had of him and an almost despairing situation might have then united him with the society to which his associate alluded but a certain dread that seized his joints and the fasting and fatigue which weighed upon his limbs extorted from him in a sort of half uttered and half repressed way this heartriving apostrophe o sir guise sir guise stuart that you should be brought to all this  to use the best and most apposite language of the inmost descriptions of the passions and emotions of nature as if that name shot from the deadly level of a gun had murdered him  great god apostrophised his astonished companion and is it possible i should again be in the same place with sir guise stuart i thought indeed i knew something of his face disfigured as it is by time and by that long beard  indeed the latter was then of three days growth being routed by the bailisss before the dressing hour and having had scarce a moment since that could be devoted to adornment  ah sir guise continued the follower if you are really he who had the great hall in somersetshire where i knew you and are owner of the abbey in the west of england you are the bitterest enemy i ever had in the world and have brought me to this pass  but as it appears you have brought yourself to nearly as bad i will not  no  d  n me i will not say any more  we must now both of us live as we can  and who are you faultered out sir guise scarcely articulating  see replied the other how things come about  dont you remember giles smith though that is not the name i go by now  dont you remember the combustible business that brought to the ground old master atwoods house and dont you remember smuggling off his daughter jenny a d  mnd affair that  my first devils work as i may say for you  and though you gave me all the work of the hall  i was a mason too you know in the next parish  i never throve since but took to thieving and if i show my face again at the oldbailey twill go hard with me i did but just nick it last time take care how you get there sir guise if you have been at the bar before they mark their men out of a set as sportsmen do a bird out of a whole covey they had winged me before  but mum  i will not do you any harm  walls have ears and this is a notorious part of the town we have got into  but what am i to call you you dont go by your own name of course  the shopman whispered he would make it worth my while if i would call and let him know where you took me to but i would be d  d first  though you have been my ruin  for as i see you are one of us  and upon the shift  i will not be the man to bring you up before your time if we cannot be true to one another it is very hard i dont ask what you have got in this bundle besides the clothes you bought of the monmouthstreet man i find you picked it up by the way of cheapside so perhaps you hardly know yourself but you see the condition i am in and if you can help me to a trifle for back and belly i hope you will for to tell you the truth i am as poor as a rat and as tired as a dog and what is worse have not broke my fast to day  nor have i scarcely said sir guise and if you have any place where we can stop without any danger of being disturbed i will added he with a heavy sigh do what little i can for you  as to that observed smith we cannot be better than at the handinhand at present it is just between the hours those who are for the country are off and the town chaps will not meet till midnight after all the public places are shut give me your hand this is the snug door lord how well i know him  but dont tremble so  though i am no better than i should be to be sure i am true to my set as you can be  chapter vi exhausted by what he had already undergone in body and mind sir guise felt for a moment an indifference to what became of him and suffered himself to be led into the house the ragged condition of the one and the shabby gentility of the other assisted by the broad brimmed hat assorted well enough with the different appearances assumed by the nimblefingered race and on calling for a bottle of port with biscuits and rusks they were shown into a private room when the wine was brought its price was to be paid on the spot a rule which may perhaps surprise you said smith to sir guise when the waiter was gone but if you consider the precarious situation of the customers who frequent this house many of whom are taken away to prison without a moments warning   to prison repeated sir guise  you will not wonder continued smith that every thing here is for ready money only are there no persons that frequent it but of the description you allude to asked the alarmed sir guise o yes answered smith but it is a rule of the house to set down every man as a rogue whether he be such or not but dont alarm yourself for at any rate we are safe i am an old customer and was once a leading member of a club held in the room above and you will of course be taken for my friend i see cried sir guise that circumstances have rendered me obnoxious to mistakes wherever i go i assure you smith pshaw dont vex yourself about that interrupted smith who was settled in his faith about sir guise and had begun on the wine and biscuits with great diligence we are liable to mistakes come come do as i do  while the baronet steeped his rusk in some wine smith adverted again to the contents of the bundle and asked for what purpose he had made a purchase of the quakersuit of clothes and the drab ridingcoat come sir guise open your heart at once added he you were always a cautious man a shy cock as we say you know  whatever prank you have played that dress will bring you through ha ha ha  a good thought  who will suspect a prim quaker to be a bundlestealer  sir guise not relishing this suspicion told smith the adventures of the last eight and forty hours  curious said his comrade a very curious story yes i always thought what would come of your marrying that termagant another supply of wine and biscuit was ordered apropos what say you to a slice of butter rusks and buiscuits are dry eating by themselves said he i see clearly now what you are upon you think you may have better luck in a new dress your old one i guess is too well known to tell you the truth i should like to adopt your plan suppose therefore said he as soon as the waiter again disappeared i cast this old skin of mine and put on yours while you make yourself into a simon pure  observe i can draw the bolt of the door and it is done in a twinkling  sir guise who anxiously wished an opportunity to put on his disguise agreed to the proposal strip then is the word said smith fastening the door and dropping his tatters with a dispatch yet with a composure that showed he was familiar with expedients but sir guise though no less dissolute had moved in the higher paths of dishonor had been accustomed to more splendid vicissitudes and could not easily divest himself of the external manners of a gentleman he was therefore more impeded in his progress and not a little embarrassed at making an entire change of apparel before the man whom in the proud day of authority he had made a subordinate instrument in the most atrocious actions an observation however from smith on hearing a noisy party coming into the next room and calling riotously for half a dozen bottles from the goodluckbin soon quenched the few blushes of ingenuous shame that stood in the way of our baronets dispatches and he was equipped in a few minutes at all points fit for the tabernacle i take it whispered smith there is one of the early gangs come in and by their spirits i judge have been pretty successful  ecod i like myself so well in this green coat and scarlet waistcoat that i am half tempted to make a little tour of my own across the country i do think i should have some luck in your coat my old friend especially if i stood in your shoes or slippers which is the same thing and redmorocco will not at all suit your dress these shoes of mine will set you on your legs famously well what say you shall we try our fortunes who knows  there is no moon  nice and dark we are just off the stones the lamps are never half lighted at the skirts of the town  at any rate we had better be off now unless you are determined on the third bottle  sir guise declared that he had not any more money and did not think till he had rummaged his pockets he could have found enough to pay for the two former no said smith incredulously what the deuce shall we do about the waiter  o i have it  stop let me do up your parcel  there it will be much lighter for you now  do you stay here and i will go and speak to scuttle the waiter who is a good natured fellow and when i have settled it with him i will come and fetch you for between ourselves some of the hueandcry gentry will be taking their rounds presently  sir guise felt uneasy at the thoughts of being left alone and as rogues are exactly as suspicious as honest men are confident he asked tremulously why they should not go and speak to scuttle together i will give him one of the handkerchiefs or cravats out of the bundle will not that do said the baronet no i will tell you how it shall be i should not have thought of giving that fellow a thing of that value  smith opened the door looked into the passage where not seeing any body he took the hand of sir guise who had indeed taken smith by the skirts of the coat and moving quietly they gained the street without any interruption and now said smith we must determine on something do we part or do we keep together  see people are pouring apace into the handinhand suppose we cross over the way and then we can think plaguey dark mind how you go and for fear we should miss one another when you get on the pavement cry hem  being arrived on the other side sir guise gave the signal paused a few minutes then repeated it to as little purpose and after a longer interval hemmed once more his companion who had in the first instance been kind enough to carry the bundle for sir guise stuart now carried it for himself in a word smith instead of crossing over figured into the very house which he affected to quit by stealth and left his associate from whom he had nothing more to expect to go where he thought proper perfectly satisfied he would never either think or dare to look for him the said smith in the handinhand hotel  thus was sir guise after having made another discovery of the extent of his wide spreading seductions again driven unprotected into the street what is far worse that conscience which had it been clear might have darted a cheerful ray of light from within told him his lot though hard was merited incapable of choice he took the path in the direction it lay from where he had crossed an afflicting sight broke from his heart and he continued his route in one undeviating line for many hours during which he was so abforbed in an abyss of reflection on the events of the past and present time that his fearful nature had no leisure to yield to any apprehensions from solitude and darkness  the fate of sir armine the exile of charles caroline dennison and the monk the flaming cottage of the attwoods the plots upon jane the treachery of miles dabble and their banditti the tyranny of lady tempest and the scorn of john fitzorton all haunted his midnight path and impelled him forward almost without knowing that his feet were in motion  at day break he perceived himself on a road he had often traversed under all the smiling auspices of fortune and of power by mere accident he had struck into the broad high way that led to the county in which stood the abbey  yet to what end should he go farther in that road to what purpose should he take any other was there in any part of the town or country a being of either sex whose eye would gladden or whose heart would bound to greet him to whom either his prosperity would be welcome or his misfortunes endearing should he pursue his present track even to the abbey that venerable mansion he thought was now a miserable ruin like himself and even that ruin not at his command although henry and olivia might be at the castle would they afford him succor it was madness to suppose it should they be absent was not an indelible mark set upon him by every member of their household could he return to the hospitable house of the irwins there the terrifying furniture of his dismantled abbey rose to his view and there yet more tremendous was john fitzorton  such were the questions he put to himself and such their replies while both served but to point the forlorn state of his character and condition whither then shall i go and what will become of me said he smiting his breast  but all this time he went rapidly on and having neither the wish nor the means to stop he outtravelled in the course of the day all that had partially got the start of him for a while  toward evening the western coaches passed him and stopped to change horses at about an hundred yards after they left him behind as soon as he came up with them one of the coachmen as he was going by exclaimed egad master you have got a brave driving coat there which you dont seem to know what to do with have you any inclination for it answered sir guise who had found it unwieldy to bear on his back and intolerable to carry under his arm you will ask too much for my pocket i fear but i will tell you what i will do with you i know you quakers dont use many words i will give you his majesltys picture in gold and a ride any where on this side plymouth if you are going that way i have but one passenger who i believe is in his first sleep what say you friend  our adventurous baronet approved the first part of the proposal very well for though the great coat might at some future period be useful the offered guinea would be so immediately he did not see the advantage of the offered ride and yet it being necessary to go somewhere he thought he should during that ride have a better opportunity to think and come to some conclusion especially as it was likely to be a stormy night in a coach than on foot well friend said the coachman facetiously as he was coming out of the house where he had been taking his dram shall thee and i shake hands upon it a spike and span new guinea looke and as easy a coach as ever man slept in if you have a mind for a nap you will think yourself swinging in a commodores cot there is no bed to be had here sir said the landlord of the inn we have been obliged to turn some of our customers away and so i think you cannot do better than accept the coachmans offer it shall be so then said sir guise delivering the coat the driver opened the door and helped our quakerseeming hero into the coach where he was scarcely seated though it was too dark to make any use of his eyes when a most violent snoring assailed his ears perhaps said the landlord the gentleman would like to take something please to bring me a roll or a crust of bread and a glass of brandy said the baronet but while they were gone to fetch them he regretted his having given the order reflecting he had no money to pay for it and he could not press for the guinea so abruptly when it was brought he asked with some hesitation whether the landlord could give him change no d  n it dont change for a crust and a glass of brandy and water said the coachman i hate dry bargains i always think they never thrive with a body  set it up to me landlord sir guise asked if he would partake of it enough is as good as a feast friend warm your own inside with it and let me warm my outside by hanselling the coat for it begins to mizzle while the coachman folded himself up in his new purchase sir guise finished his repast which was in truth much wanted and after the usual adieus the vehicle continued its journey  chapter vii for the first three or four miles sir guise thought intently but the very intensity of that thought his former violent exercise both of body and mind and the lulling motion of the coach disposed him at length to imitate his unknown fellowtraveller by falling asleep  how long he remained in this comfortable oblivion of himself and of his misfortunes cannot be known but ere it was yet day a sudden jerk of the vehicle shattered one of the side glasses from the frame and both our slumberers awoke at the same instant this brought on a short conversation between the passengers one of whom said he was happy on waking out of a nap to find he had got a companion not added he that i am properly an inside passenger only as there was not any one in the stage and as i am an acquaintance of the coachmans and twas likely to be an ugly night he gave me a lift but if you have any objection sir as i am but a servant and in a manner out of my place  if you will pardon the joke i will turn out and get upon the box  sir guise whom recent events had taught something of humility told his fellowtraveller there was no occasion whereupon the former speaker continued going into devon i hope sir as i shall then have more of your good company i stop a few miles on this side dartmouth if you are of those parts i dare say you may know either me or some of my masters god bless their honors and all the family  such a family as would do your heart and soul good to know them the fitzortons sir i mean a brave old house their castle we shall see it a few miles on this side dartmouth a noble park too and as fine gardens as you shall wish to look at but what are they nothing  not worth thinking about in comparison of the family they belong to a house park and a garden are fine things and god gave them and god be praised for it but where they are placed or built there they stand like stocks but good people who can move about to find people who have only a cottage and bit of garden at the end of it are better to my thoughts than all the gardens and castles in the world  a profound and audible sigh now caught the ear of the person who had been speaking and a pause ensued on both sides in the course of which the sigh was repeated  i dont know why but it is a shocking thing to hear any body sigh observed the other passenger it always makes me sigh too may be your honor may be uneasy at something that is on your mind and do not like to hear talking some do and some dont our mr sir john cannot bear to hear a word spoken by man woman or child when he is vexed or uneasy but must have it all to himself though it lasts for a week if you do but say a word he will frown and growl at you and go and lock himself up but squire henry god love his dear tender heart the more kind things you say to him the more he loves you and though he may sometimes be too heartfull to make you any answer when he comes to himself he will speak to you so kindly and thank you for your love and trouble that it would make you cry like a child i am sure it has me a thousand times to hear him now as i dont know which of these ways is your way sir if i offend or make you worse by talking only say so and i will not speak another word all the way  the generous speaker having waited some time without receiving any check imagined conversation might amuse and relieve his fellow traveller on which idea he proceeded ah good sir we have all our sorrows and the best often the most as i dare say you know by yourself why even most of our family at the castle have had terrible trials to begin with sir armine all the world has heard of his goodness for all that he had his enemies and one who i fear shortened his life  i fear so too faultered a voice that startled the ear of the observer  you have heard of the story then and no doubt resumed the other speaker know many more sad stories that go along with that affair if so you can be no stranger to the shocking doings amongst some neighbors of ours  thank god almighty the storm is pretty well blown over now but there will be a long account for somebody to settle by and by doubtless then you know the abbeyfamily  i do answered the person addressed  aye i dont wonder at your sighing observed the other they have made my heart ach many and many a time then i dare say you are no stranger to sir guise stuart  there is a monster of a man for you i do not think there is man woman or child in the whole world that cares whether he is dead or alive  o yes there is continued the person heavily sighing more than one  may be you know miss caroline his daughter sir as kindly dutiful and pretty a creature as ever broke the bread of life god knows where she is now and i am acquainted with another as good and handsome as she who wishes this monster of a man well but i find it has all come home to him at last such a story did i hear of him yesterday in london at an old servants of his one robert irwin where i went to take orders for the castle from our mr sir john who has lodgings at roberts  such a story  ah good sir the wicked never prosper long together this very sir guise is i find gone all to ruins turned out of house and home and with five guineas which robert out of pure charity put into his bundle is now roaming about god knows where there is a change for you sir yet how could he expect any better  a change indeed cried his auditor with pathetic energy  yes resumed the relater i would not have a a a  friend of mine told of it for the world nay i would not wish any of our family to know of it speciously squire henry and i am sure mr sir john will not mention it to him for reasons good the wicked man is going about under gods judgments i should not at all wonder if we should hear in a little time he were hanged should you sir  and yet continued the narrator poor man i cannot help pitying him if i had not received orders from my master mr sir john and you know sir when a servant has got his orders he has only to do them outright in town or country i should have tried to hunt him up for though i think him the worst creature that lives i have my reasons why i would not let him want a mouthful of bread and a drop of drink and a bed to lie upon while i had it of my own to give he is now with the almightys angry finger upon him for it is not us but he you know sir to punish people to my thoughts such a wicked man as sir guise stuart is more to be pitied than an honest man in the time of his trouble because you know sir conscience says such comforting things to the one while the other can find nothing but taunts and torments within and without and now i will say no more about him for you must know we never mention his name nor have not done a long while at the castle and for my part i sometimes wish the abbey was sunk under ground that none of our folks might look at it then we might be happier even than we were indeed i should not have run on thus now for i am no very great talker but as i heard you sigh and as i think a man had better sigh for the distress and wickedness of another man than for his own and as i imagined you liked to hear rather than speak i have gone on see sir day is beginning to break come good sir we shall have the sun up presently and then we shall be able to look about us  chapter viii it is not easy to conceive any mortal man in a more comfortless situation than sir guise stuart during the time this harangue was carrying on by the speaker with a most sincere hope of affording him relief in all the simple truth of an honest heart he here heard himself at once commiserated and despised the cause and effect of all he had suffered was placed in natural order before him and all this from a man who avowed himself in a state of servitude but whom he knew at the same time to be arrayed in all the majesty of virtues which made the once lofty baronet shrink in the comparison the only favorable circumstance was the darkness which had veiled him from the eye of his accuser and that darkness was passing away  the morn had no sooner rendered objects distinct than it appeared to the companion of sir guise that he had been addressing himself to a quaker this accounted at once for the little that had been said in reply and that little expressed with so much energy of pity for the guilty wanderer moreover the disguise was more friendly than the wearer of it had conjectured for the haranguer even when the deciding beams of the sun shone full upon every thing had not the most remote suspicion that he was in company with the man he had delineated the case was reversed with respect to the delineator who not having an atom of disguise about him body or mind was instantly discovered to be true george who had upon the whole more reason to quarrel with the conduct of sir guise than any of those whom its crookedness had involved but who was perhaps amongst those that most compassionated him  about an hour after the sun had risen the vehicle made its usual stop to breakfast george opened the door leaped out and with the respectful manners that marked his character took off his hat and offered his arm to his companion then directed a waiter to show the gentleman into a parlour and modestly betook himself into the kitchen  our unfortunate knight now meditated an escape from his fellowtraveller by insinuating that he was arrived near the end of his journey and that he would perform the little that remained on foot  as he was projecting this over the first cup of tea the coachman made his appearance with the purchasemoney of the coat which he laid upon the table and then said pointing to a small packet of letters tied together and i suppose friend these are your property at least they were found in the greatcoat pocket and are of no service to me  sir guise on receiving them read on the superscription of the outer letter his own name and address and remembered shifting them from the dress he gave to smith at the handinhand very well observed he with an air of attempted indifference you may lay them down there they are of no consequence that you know best friend george the young man who rode with you said he thought they were and talked of coming in to ask you whether you can give him any tidings of the person they are directed to you know him no doubt or else you would not have so many of his letters to keep he is but a bad bargain be where he will and i wonder you quakerfolks should have any thing to do with him but that is none of my affair friend your servant the horses will soon be ready  i will keep my word  you may ride as far as you like i wanted george to read one of the letters to us but the devil a bit i dont suppose that fellow would read a word now of a letter that had not his name at top on it an though it were all against himself i never seed such a chap well make haste wi breakfast we have a long pull yet and all up hill so i will now go and take a sup with george and then jehu  the moment the coachman departed the baronet who had been groaning in spirit at the mention of the letters turned to a large glass that hung on one side of the room and thought he could place the wig and hat to much greater advantage to which end he took them hastily off and was just folding his own hair so as to make it lie smoother under the wig when with nimble yet respectful steps true george came running in and saw the very man he was going to make so many enquiries after so that instead of asking the supposed quaker what was become of sir guise it would have been more in point to have enquired of sir guise what he had done with the quaker  the dismay of sir guise was not inconsiderable but the person by whom he had been detected had not talent or at least no relish for that sort of ridicule which exposes misfortune however merited and to inflict pain was as opposite to his nature as to deserve its infliction on himself bless god then said he you are found without looking for you any further as to your dressing like a quaker sir i can easily guess you would wish to be any thing but sir guise and as to what i have said of you sir i wish it was not true with all my heart but we may as well pretend to say it is night when it is broad day truth is truth  for god sake leave me said sir guise powerfully moved let me stop here  no not here no no get into the coach again and then if i may ride with you something may be thought of  see sir the horses are put to and the coachman will be here in a moment come i will help to put your head to rights again so  that is good so much for the wig  there  now for the hat  now you are as good a quaker again as ever you was  the goodnatured fellow had just made him up when the coachman came with his summons coachee said he the gentleman is so kind as to permit me to keep my seat in the inside a little longer and so with your leave i will  aye that you shall mr george and welcome though i were to pay for you an inside from london to plymouth george gave him his hand in thanks then out of that abundant lovingkindness with which his blameless heart overflowed he opened the coachdoor to sir guise as he had done before and got in after him  whether attracted unawares by the charm of integrity and worth as it was conspicuous in this estimable young man or whether urged by motives of despair arising from a survey of his own situation brought about by varied duplicity or whether his heart was pressed by a load that impelled him in mere relief to disburthen itself sir guise at length treated george with a candor to which that heart had long been a stranger o mr true said he after what has past it would be vain to conceal my deplorable state any longer and i will therefore in this desolation of my affairs ask you what course you think i can pursue to save me from the world and from myself  he then unfolded the whole of his disastrous adventures and concluded by observing that to undergo again all that he had seen heard and endured for the three past days would be worse than death since every moment of that time had proved to him he had not a friend on the face of the earth and convinced him he did not deserve one  the degree of self abasement to which a human being must be reduced before such a forlorn declaration can be extorted from him cannot easily be imagined it presupposes a condition so destitute that perhaps before the idea of it can gain admission into the mind of man all that sustains or elevates his nature must have taken its flight yet the confession could not have been trusted to a heart more full of good faith and charity than that of the honest creature who heard and who could not but believe it was as sincere in the feeling as he had but too many reasons to know it was true as to fact  a more daring offender or more properly to express ourselves a man with like abandoned principles but sustained by more constitutional audacity than sir guise stuart as in the case of his compeer valentine miles might have resisted the rapacious tyranny of a prostitute exalted into a wife he might have contended with all the viprous train that envenomed that alliance possessed of more animal courage he might have answered force by force foiled stratagem by stratagem and by uniting the spirit of the tiger with the wiles of the fox he might have struggled for his rights such as they were and perhaps regained them but finding himself beset on all hands and strongly pursued even by the beasts of prey that had fed upon his honor peace and fortune his heart died within him and he fled  true george was for many a mile as taciturne as he had been before loquacious at length he fervently ejaculated  the lord have mercy upon all miserable sinners oh sir guise i would not be you for all that is on the face of the earth or at the bottom of the sea  to this another long pause succeeded which made sir guise suppose that even this genuine child of pity had abandoned him but the same principles that induced the worthy adherent of the fitzortons to attempt the relief of a supposed stranger in distress by conversation that might beguile the way led him to preserve silence now that person was known lest he might advert to any thing which could increase affliction  he did not again break silence till he knew by contiguous objects that he was approaching scenes which must greatly increase the shame of his convicted fellow traveller a little to the left stood the hall of the good partington and the comfortable farmhouse of the bountyguarded atwoods  the family of the injured jane were almost in view  i think sir observed george drawing a green blind before the window of the coach at the side on which these objects lay  i think sir the light may be rather troublesome and the country to your right just where we now are is more open than this to the left in this remark the good creature had no view whatever but to prevent the infliction of pain to a heart already overcharged for every lineament of the baronets countenance the former comeliness of which we have before particularized denoted beyond all question variety of suffering but the design of the goodnatured george being thus answered another long silence took place at length leaping at an idea that made him stand almost upright in the coach he exclaimed i have it sir i have it and then a fourth pause as if to shape and arrange this new idea good heaven thought george and is this poor sinful being without house home money or friends and not any body to speak to him but his conscience which must needs be angry with him why he has nothing for it but to knock himself on the head to get out of his own way and that would not answer his purpose either for he is no more fit to die than to live yet if he should lay violent hands on himself now that all the world frowns on him as to be sure he deserves i should never rest in my bed nor perhaps would somebody else either and she might even hate me for letting a poor wretch die in his wickedness when by a little christian charity i might have made him live to repent  chapter ix such were some of the reflections that occupied the mind of george during those stops in conversation which the conscience of the person who was the cause of them translated so differently  but the journey was now almost performed and some decisive measure was to be pursued sir guise said george it does not signify talking while a man is in the world he must live whether he is good or bad i am but a servant and you are a baronet but as you dont seem to know what to do with yourself at this present sitting will you be ruled by me  sir guise assured him he would but that he did not care what happened to him  truly to speak the baronet was sunk to a degree so extreme that fear and hope equally forsook him and he might have been led about at the pleasure of enemy or friend  no sooner therefore had george who had been watching the mile stones with his head out of the window gained the spot than he called to the coachman to stop jumped out of the vehicle hat in hand as before and when sir guise had followed him will says he to the driver i find the quakerly gentleman does not cleverly know the road he is to go and may lose his way except he is with somebody that can help him out a little we shall go together and if we strike into the foot path at the end of that lane we shall save near two miles and as the gentleman is rather sick with his ride a little walking may do us both good so i wish you a good journey will and many thanks for your kindness our castle has always some good ale in it you know goodday though it is getting dark enough to say goodnight  while george was talking to the coachman sir guise had an opportunity to look about him and however fatigued it was not without considerable anxiety that he perceived he was at a point that conducted both horse and footman by a bridle way or a cut across the fields either to that parish which was once his own or to that which still appertained to the fitzortons his apprehensive nature caught alarm at this and he fearfully asked george if he was going to discover him condemning his own absurd feelings for suffering him to be drawn so near the place in the world he would most avoid  as to that sir observed george i take it all places are pretty much alike to you just now only i have my reasons why i think that where i am going to take you to will be the best as to discovering you in that dress i dont think that your own poor dear banished child miss caroline nor somebody else i know in the world could make you out in that dress if you keep your hat and wig on for added he you are no more like what you was in any shape than you are like my squire henry god love his heart and besides you promised me for once you would be ruled by me and so i will sighed out sir guise following george who had been getting through the lane all the time he conversed only one thing i have to observe sir resumed george as soon as i have housed you where i mean you must let me run off to deliver mr sir johns orders at the castle and when i have done there for i am but a servant as i said i will come and see you settled better  as you think fit answered the humiliated baronet   then please to take hold of my coat and pull at it as much as you will i will get you on  hark we shall now hear how time goes  is that your clock or ours  i beg pardon  is that from the abbey or castle but that is no matter it is six oclock you hear how short the days get another quarter of an hour and our noses will smell the fire i hope and see the faggot sparkle and hear the kettle sing to make us a dish of tea  all you have to do is to mind your wig and hat leave the rest to george od save us if all men that ant so good as they should be were to be kicked into the streets to starve i dont for my part know what would become of the best of us the more wicked a man is the more time he wants god knows very well what he is doing and throws a man a plank when the man himself thinks he must go to the bottom mayhap now i may be one of those planks and so catch hold of me sir guise and let us jog on one thing is for certain you cannot be worse off than you are and you must own you may be a great deal better  mind that i will call you  i will call you  what shall i call you we must have no more sir guises at present and yet what signifies lying  i will call you nothing only say sir and the quakering gentleman who traveled with me though it is ten to one if we see any body tonight but a person who cannot know you and her servantmaid who is a newcomer and who dont know you from our father adam  this ambulatory discourse was accompanied by such encouraging tones that the drooping spirit of our helpless adventurer could not but be cheared even in the midst of the most cutting humiliations  there sir now get over this style and you are on your own  no i beg pardon  on the abbey ground  but we must leave that and turn more to the right  aye aye come out mrs luna as my squire henry calls you though he has many more fine names for you madam cynthia miss phoebe and the like  he is one of your poet gentlefolks you know sir and so i believe is his lady madam olivia come out then and we shall see our path plainer keep always to the right  looke the castle is all to the right there is the lights about it  bless its old face i have not been away but four days and long to see it again  look look how the lights are moving about the rooms dont you see them through the dear brave old windows that yonder is madam my ladys apartment and that just over it is a room where  where another of the family sleeps  heigh ho hark how the dogs begin to bark  dont be afraid most of them are fast but if they were all loose they all love me bless you and therefore whoever is along with me that is georges friend they will think poor fools by the same token dont you remember poor little fitz the old castle to my thoughts always looks gay at nighttime just as if twere full of luminations but what a sad figure the poor old abbey cuts of late years  see not a farthing candle  hang it what am i saying  i am talking like a fool  but the sight of home always puts me in such spirits they run away with me  but do you see a candle through that copse  that is blind goody brabsons one of our madam olivias fathers old servants past work now so lives easy in one of madams cottages the squire and she have a round dozen often there altogether six for men they are squire henrys and three for women those are madams  with a servant a piece to tend them and a spare bed for a friend  pray step on sir  yes as i was observing a spare bed  for as madam olivia said to the builder  all my cottagers must have a bed room for a friend how lucky twas i thought of that pray sir dont you think god almighty puts these things in our head just when we want them for my part i as much believe he put it into my head to take you to goody brabson for a night or so till we could turn about as if i had heard his voice it does ones heart good and specially when one lies in bed of a dark night to think you hear god almightys voice i hope you will hear it one time or other i mean in the way i speak of not as they say wicked people often do o then a clap of thunder must be nothing to it even though nobody else can hear it  chapter x such conversation carried them over the flowery meads and along the moonlight paths of fitzorton with the usual expedition of true george who bore the halffainting burden of the passive sir guise at his skirts and they soon arrived at the little neighborhood of cottages which were amongst the many good works of henry and olivia to employ their fortune and their time since their union that these cottages might be under the immediate eye of their founders they had been erected only a quarter of a mile distance from the castle and received either from their patron or patroness a smiling visit almost every day  this is goody brabsons sir whispered george it was not her having no eyes but her having a good old heart got her here she was good to some folks when they were burnt  by some folks  out of house and home and she saved  she saved  somebodys cat from the flames and i know who has got a kitten of that cat now but lord how i run on see we have got into goodys garden  there is such a like slippikin of garden as this to all you see  and for that reason its called edenplace eden was one of gods gardens you know sir when the two people he gave it to were good and madam never puts any but good people in our eden well here is the little door how sweet the jessamy and honey suckles smell that grow round it i know who set some of these with her own pretty hands  not a soul stirring  all as still as the moonshine i told you we should see nobody  step in step in they all know me this little parlour is our plan mind hat and wig that is all o here is sally the maid  so sally where is goody and how does she here is a gentleman traveled down with me who ant so well as he should be and cannot go farther to night for fear of getting worse so i have brought him here to have goodys spare bed he can have that mr george but goody is in bed and she has been in bed these two days madam and the squire have been here to see her but now and were to send something which i expect every minute poor goody i hope she will be better tomorrow said george i must go home now with my orders but i will be here betimes in the morning  this whispering dialogue was held in the passage and sally was just desiring the stranger to step into the parlour while she aired a pair of sheets as the latch of the house door was lifted up and in came two persons who brought their wellcome in their hands for each bore a basket of the good things of this world as sally advanced with the light to meet them the one proved to be a fellow servants of true georges and the other the object of his first and last pure affection jenny atwood  o my good gracious exclaimed the latter resigning her share of the pleasing burden to sally how glad i am to see you come back which asseveration was confirmed by her throwing out both her hands to george who on his part was hurried out of all things else  indeed out of himself by that assurance and the sudden sight of the sole object of his heart but how is it you did not come first to the castle what does this mean hey mrs sally questioned jane smiling perhaps you can answer me that question  yes yes i see how it is mr george likes a cottage better than a castle  this playfulness which sincere and unexpected satisfaction called forth was soon checked by sympathizing enquiries after goody brabson for whom she said the lady olivia had sent a little of every good and would herself repeat her visit in the morning  all this time george was drawing jane and her companion nearer the door well then said he we had better make the best of our way home now as i have orders to deliver from mr sir john  hope squire henry and my lady are well jenny  charmingly said the latter thank heaven  well and happy  god keep them so answered george  by this time in the garden sally following with the light  goodnights were now plentifully exchanged and after george had desired sally to remember what he had said to her and to make things as comfortable as she could for the sick  pronouncing the last words very emphatically  he set off with the two messengers of bounty for the castle  the beams of the moon have seldom shone on three worthier persons for the servant who made the third was one who had from his earliest youth lived in the family of the clares and had been amongst the most select of those who had been transferred to the castle for his good behavior on which account there had long subsisted a friendship betwixt him and true george  when our loving trio therefore had gained the stepladder kind of style that led by a back way to the castle do you know said george that the first thing i did when i got within sight of our house was to give a look at your chamber window mrs jane and i could not help saying to  a  a  person that was with me  a person questioned jane you had company then  one of the neighbors i suppose   no  no  yet twas a neighbor too  that is  hoity toity cried jenny resuming her sportive suspicion why you seem in a flurry george  if poor goody brabson had not been sick in bed i should have thought that pretty mrs sally had taken a moon shiny walk to meet you  george laughed aye you may laugh mr george observed the fellow servants but lads even though they have been in london like a pretty country lass by the light of the moon as the song says specially when they are new faces but i can tell you friend george if you go moonlighting to goody brabsons sally you will stray upon my grounds  o ho is that the case said george repeating his laugh  these little rebounds of jocularity which were rare indeed with jane atwood but which were excited by returning health somewhat better spirits the benevolence of her late errand the unexpected sight of her preserver and the continuance of comfort at the castle which they were now approaching henry and olivia fitzorton attracted by the mild beauty of the evening and yet more by the ardour of their generous hearts had walked forth arm in arm to meet the messengers of their loving kindness  scarcely had the enquiries respecting the health of goody brabson been made and answered when a discovery of theirfavourite domestic  whose return they did not expect for some weeks as he had been lent to their brother john for a month  brought on interrogatories sevenfold these also being answered with only a little mental reservation in george touching his delay  which was set down by the querists to the account of love though the reader knows it proceeded from a less selfish nature  the whole party went satisfied into the house henry and olivia to peruse the despatches john had sent them and the fellow servants to regale themselves in janes sittingroom  chapter xi how far the wretched object of our good samaritans bounty was capable of enjoying the comforts thus procured may be easily conjectured as well as with what emotion he must have arisen at the return of day he beheld from the chamber window of the widow womar that mansion the very path to which had by one atrocity or another been formerly watered with the tears of his victims and the mansion itself converted into a house of mourning nor did the misery of these sensations yield to those which must scourge his heart at the prospect of his own ruins goody brabson occupying a cornerhouse of the building her spare bedroom had a remote view of the abbey particularly of those invidious screens of clay and blank walls which abject malice had reared as has been noticed in the early part of this history to destroy the prospect of the worthy dwellers of the castle this memorial of his miserable mind had been left either from neglect or inattention even since part of the premises had undergone the benevolent and reforming hand of the excellent olivia and the sight of it brought thus morally under his eye struck him as a monument which his own hand had erected to the discredit of his unmanly character but perhaps the acutest smart he had yet felt from the sting of adversity was the sight of the innocent girl he had attempted to destroy in return for the pure virgin heart she gave him to see her too recovered from his snare and likely to give happiness to the very man on whose charity her betrayer was thrown for bread  but while the prospects of sir guise were thus dark and cloudy those of the compassionate youth who had taken pity on him were scarcely less perplexed and involved his night was not less interrupted than that of sir guise though from far different causes and while his ruminating head yet pressed his pillow what after all he should do with the man to whom he had been induced by resist less circumstances to promise protection was the great question to mention him to any persons of the parish as a proper object of their bounty would he knew be madness to discover him to henry fitzorton would be perhaps to revive images which it had been the labor of years to keep under to breathe an accent that should possess jane atwood with the secret would be wild and rash yet some active measure must be pursued and that without delay  he cannot remain where he is now said george more than a few hours he remembered that olivia had promised goody brabson a morning visit  he knew besides that the former was an early riser while autumn had a flower to bestow toward the making up her henrys breakfast bouquet  a custom she had never forsaken when health and the season permitted since the exchange of the flowers of henrys fancy for those of the garden on the memorable anniversary of her birth  all these considerations drove george from his bed at the dawn of day by which he gained nothing more than the being in readiness to follow up any favorable plan that might offer itself to his revolving mind  the worst of it is that i could not said he have picked up and brought home any man but this in all the world whom our family would not have been willing to keep out of trouble but for sir guise stuart  i dont know a soul  except indeed one who must not know of it  who would not as soon see almost the devil  god forgive me  in their house as he  heigho i dont know what is to be done with him that is the truth of it and yet one man should not let another man starve or drive him on to more wickedness neither there is something shocking in that  here succeeded a cogitating fit of another hour when the castle clock striking seven startled him for the condition of sir guise who would think himself neglected and perhaps be thrown into despair o what shall i do with him where shall i hide this poor miserable sinner money i could give and food i could buy but a house  what shall i do for a house to put his head in  as he asked himself this last question he had sat down at his window from whence he observed olivia already in the garden it was her custom on a beautiful morning such as then it was to glide from her apartment without disturbing any body for the comfort of her whole household  in all which that word of the greatest importance in family arrangements was the point which both she and her husband desired to gain  and is indeed one of the most rare to be seen in the annals of domestic life  namely superiority of station but equality in happiness  chapter xii after olivia had taken two or three turns up and down the shrubbery nearest the house and had marked the fragrant objects of her morningoffering she struck into the path that led to her cottages george no sooner perceived this than he left his room pursued her steps with incredible speed and having overtaken her followed the impulse of the moment and with fainting eagerness addressed her thus god knows my lady whether i have done right or done wrong  right i dare say my good fellow answered olivia a little startled but what is the matter right or wrong my lady it cannot be helped now i have met with one of my dear master the squires enemies and your ladyships enemy and mr sir johns enemy  my enemy  jane atwoods enemy and i believe every bodys enemy upon earth  but i met him my lady unawares  the sight of him took away my breath almost my senses  and scarcely knowing what i said or did i  i  heavens what demanded olivia what did you do not murder him i hope no my lady not murder him though that i suppose is what a true servant ought to have done  instead of which i never touched a hair of his head but contrarywise as i found he was just at deaths door no food to eat nothing to drink and no bed to lie on  all his fortune gone and his heart ready to break  that though i knew him to be one of the worst wretches that lives and told him so twenty times over i could not bear to leave him as i found him  and so  pray pray my lady forgive me i even brought him home with me got him into a bed i know he had not been in one for several nights before and  do pray forgive me upon my soul i could not help it  i  i  i have him on the premises at this moment  thank god and thank you my good george for it  but who can you mean  i have no notion of any of the persons you have mentioned having an enemy upon earth  except him my lady or his gang i dont think they have but for all that as i said before i have brought him among us and used him as if he was a friend  well then such treatment will i hope make him one but you observed he was found in a distressful condition and it could not be wrong to afford him your pity i will justify you by adding mine  if he had been the devil my lady and i had heard such sighs and groans as i did i should have done as i have not that i want to make him a burden to any body twas i brought him and i will take care of him i only want a little houseroom somewhere at hand and nobody to know of it my lady  after this exordium george related according to his manner every circumstance of the case from his first meeting with sir guise in the stagecoach to the introduction of him at goody brabsons with the contingent adventures of encountering jane atwood therefore do pray my lady excuse my boldness in taking such a kind of a person into your eden you may think it is as bad as the devil thrusting himself in eden of old but god help us my lady if all wicked sinners were to be hunted from one place to another and then were to be lest to roam about the world why they would run at us like mad bulls for want of a resting place and something to eat  for hunger will break through stone walls  no no much better to my thoughts give them wherewithal to lay their head and a little victuals to eat and as they are not sit for better company let them sway themselves and though to be sure my lady you cannot as the saying is make a silkenpurse out of a sowsear yet if by a little kindness under gods assistance we could get but some of the devil out sir guise before he gives up the ghost why that would be no small matter you know some folk who were once a little out of the right path have come into it again you and i my lady know somebody who is now a pattern for any lady in the land to cut out by heigho  and though this wicked abandoned sinner whom i cannot tell you half what i think of never can be fit to touch the hem of that somebodys garment  you know who i mean my lady  he may take up a little and a christian should try to do good or else what signifies their being christians and we are bid every sunday your ladyship knows to raise up them that fall god knows sir guise is fallen low enough o do do then my lady let you and i try to raise old sir guise up without a soul being the wiser for after all is said and done god knows what help the best of us may want before we go out of the world  olivia chilled and glowed at various passages in our child of natures account and at the comments his simple and upright heart made on it and although she did not know all the dark and deadly offenses of sir guise she knew more than sufficient to engrave his name even on her forgiving heart in characters never to be erased abhorrence of the sin but by no means to the exclusion of pity for the sinner she therefore assured george that she so entirely approved of all he had done not only in regard to the relief he had offered but in the secrecy of it that she should readily join him in all his worthy endeavors the only matter observed she that will diminish our satisfactions is the impossibility of calling in on my part my beloved henry or the amiable jane on yours as though i am convinced they would both assist and take delight in a benevolence of this kind you are sensible there are reasons why we must at present refuse ourselves and them this satisfaction to see the father of his dear charles stuart and of my caroline degraded and reduced would shock too much my dear husbands gentle nature and alas you know though blessed be god in general much restored he has not strength to bear surprises of any sort  as to that interrupted george i know my lady that only the thought of what this wicked creature may one of these days come to has often been too much for mrs jane and if she should know that day was come already and that he was but the day before yesterday without a bit of bread in the world or a bed to lie on and now on these premises i should fear worse would come of it than even what happened in the wood do you know my lady if it had not been for staying on my errand i should have taken him back to london where i first met with him in this miserable way and put him out to board and nurse just as one would a baby but thinks i what is to be done with my orders from mr sir john they may or may not be of consequence that is nothing to a servant an order is an order it ant his business to stop and if he is sent sometimes on a fools errand that is nothing to him he is not the fool had it not been for this can any body go to think i would have let him come here betwixt two fires as a body may say the abbey and the castle i am sure when jane came in with your ladyships comforts for goody  lord love your heart though i am always so glad i could cry like a child to see the face or to hear the pretty voice of jane atwood  dont you always think she has a nice way of speaking my lady  i was frighted almost out of my wits lest she should find out the makebelieve sick quaker for all his brown wig and slouched hat though to be sure as i told your ladyship i could never have hit them off myself if they had been on no not if i had been a year in his company which god forbid i ever should be for if he could have gone about the world without falling into the clutches of some of his own gang even though he had not a farthing in the world dont think my lady i would have brought him even within fifty miles of either the castle or the abbey  no my lady i would have given him what money i had to spare and kicked him out of my company as i would a football or a nuisance or what not  my good george exclaimed olivia your mention of the abbey has put a thought into my head about a place for this poor wretch you know the abbey is now ours on lease and though henry and i have made a point of delicacy and feeling not to go into it and as seldom as possible to walk near it which could only revive the thoughts of its former state when graced by caroline and charles and though i have ever locked up the key to keep it out of the sight of the friends who loved those dear unhappy wanderers whom my continual researches could never find there were sent you remember some few beds and other general conveniences into the upper part of the building by way of temporary hospital when the smallpox raged so cruelly in ours and some neighboring parishes and the particular apartments which were fitted up for our apothecary the worthy mr burton whom we engaged to inoculate as many as friends or parents chose to send were directed to be proper for the reception of a gentleman i have an hundred times had it in my mind to order this furniture to be turned to some use had not the dread that attaches to every idea of the unfortunate abbey made me lay aside the thought but i shall now be very glad if you imagine they might answer our present purpose for it will be easy to get one of the cottagers who does not know sir guise to attend him i only mean this for a short time till we can think and consult each other about a less exposed situation my only fear is that the dreadful change he will find in every thing from the day alas when a good and dutiful family surrounded him may grievously oppress his heart yours and mine it would break in a moment nevertheless if we are the authors of our miseries and disgraces we must try to bear them the matter is will this temporary abode do  do please my lady ejaculated george who had been shaving off the excesses of his eager nature upon his nails buttons and neckloth and twitching every thing in his way since the idea was started do my lady yes it will do wonders let me have the key  let me have the key i will abbey him toss up his bed boil his kettle throw him on a faggot open a sash or two give him the bible and testament lock him up again put the key in my pocket and so feed him and leave him and leave him and feed him just as i would an old fox or a sick kite or any other wild wicked thing i had picked up and did not like to knock on the head as to his finding a great change that is what he should do for if he were to be made as gay and great as he was before i should fear he would get to his old pranks again no no i will tell him to bless god and your ladyship it is no worse and then if he growls i will say mend yourself wherever you can for god knows you want mending bad enough and even if he should be seen as i will always take care to leave him wigged and hatted quakerfashion why should he not pass for a sad sick sorry poor man who has as much occasion for an hospital as another i am sure there will be no story in all that  long before our benevolent domestic had got to the end of his speech olivia had turned her light steps toward the castle george pursuing her track and his remarks which latter finished just as the walkers had gained the spacious stone entrance into the great hall there desiring george to wait a few moments olivia ascended the lofty staircase that led to the upper apartments those few moments were employed by the hermesfooted george to collect the history of the morning he heard that henry had not yet come down he saw that jane atwood was pleasingly busied in the nursery with olivias children her own little one of unfortunate memory was perhaps luckily among the victims to the ravages of the very disorder which occasioned the converting part of the abbey into an hospital that was now to become a charityhouse  he got back into the hall just as his lady was coming down stairs and smilingly delivering what she went for wrapped up loosely in a paper she begged he would remember her name was not to be on any account mentioned to the quaker but whenever necessary to be consulted she would be ready and now said she i must go make up my slowery tribute for the best and dearest of men and i said george  reflecting a playful air and sentiment from his mistress must go and put out of sight my bundle of weeds for i think  an please you my lady  so we may call our shamquaker whom to my thoughts is just as bad as squire henry is good  pray tell goody brabson said olivia as she and george were separating i will call on her after breakfast and indeed this fair morning i mean to make the tour of edens buildings and pay a howdoye visit to all my dear cottagers i hope added she my husband and our children will accompany me my henry looks so very happy when we are on these strolls and i wish to make the little ones as like their father as possible adieu george i shall keep henry and jane atwood to myself at least for an hour to come so you will have time to put your stray sheep into the fold  the smile with which the speaker accompanied this just as she took her way again into the flowergardens and the tear which the hearer dropped in her path are two of the many things in this world to be felt and not described we can only offer it as our firm belief that as the one was sweeter than the fairest of the flowers olivia fitzorton could hope to cull the other was foster than the dews that wait upon and increase their fragrance  chapter xiii sir guise stuart meanwhile a prisoner in the chamber was literally a partaker of the widows mite which indeed like here is of sacred story was supplied by a source that would never suffer her cruse of oil to waste nor her morsel to fail he had for some hours experienced all the horrors of suspense and apprehension superadded to the misery of surrounding prospects and the severe reviews of his own mind upon them he had seen from the western window of his apartment true george and olivia fitzorton the wife of the man who had so many reasons to execrate his tyranny they were in earnest conversation walking backwards and forwards with what to his sickly fancy appeared angry and complotting steps and having no rule to judge by in the measure of generous actions he did not doubt but that he was to be given up to the malignant triumph of a family whose honest disdain he had so often experienced and he now rebuked his own credulity for having thus suffered himself to be trepanned into the custody of even more powerful enemies than his wife and her associates  in the midst of these injurious contemplations true george coming in with a basket under his arm changed their direction from the persons accused to the illiberal accuser and yet there were some gleams of returning grace in the latter observing i am afraid mr george i have wronged you o yes replied george that you have sir guise and every body else in our family often enough but that is nothing good for evil you know is best so if you wish to have a snug birth in your own house that was and there live quiet and be seen only by me till we find what can be done and how matters turn why you will come along with me  hat and wig close though or we shall have all the parish about your ears and about mine too for bringing you amongst them nay now dont stand thinking about it needs must you know sir guise when the devil drives and i am sure he is driving you hard enough and now if i can but put you in the way of preventing his carrying you clear off to the otherworld and there casting you into a much worse place than i am going to take you to why i think i shall have done a pretty tight job but it gets late and i must house you before people are abroad if you should once be seen it will be all over with us  independently of other reasons this latter suggestion was allsufficient to quicken the baronet he repaired his disguise while george went down with the lady olivias message to goody brabson who in answer to kind enquiries said she was much recovered and in a very few minutes after sir guise stuart once possessor of the rich domain through which he was now to pass set forward under the patronage of a servant and that the servant of a man he had irreparably injured for the mansion which in two successive periods of his life had been the seat of his tyranny and of his disgrace and was now to be his refuge from penury and despair  these last evils however the commiserating george notwithstanding at some moments his honest indignation at the remembrance of past vice got the better of his pity for present wretchedness did all he could to blunt the edge of on the way he explained to sir guise as much as he could without committing olivia the arrangement which had been made for his uninterrupted security and for his support george acquainted him that though he must consent for the sake of his being safe to be his sole and absolute prisoner yet that by the time he had amused himself with what he had brought in that basket he would be forth coming again in a few days the weather will i suppose cried george make us look about us for a good fire and that you shall not want you will be lonely to be sure but then that is better than wicked company and you know you could not have even that now if you had all the world before you so that in the main you are to my thoughts better here than any where else so try sir guise to make it sit easy and as i have a hundred things to call me away i wish you good thoughts till i see you again but i must not forget to tell you i have put a good book or two in the basket  notwithstanding all these alleviations and the comfort to be derived from a comparison of the present with the past the situation of sir guise was truly forlorn he eluded it is true the haunts of his robberwife and of all her loose companions the wiles of the bailiff were no longer to be dreaded the day no more exhausted in wandering or the night spent in the public streets or in commixture with those who infest them the apprehension of famine and the terror of meeting in every face a foe were also at an end all these he had escaped but his seclusion from the species offered him full leisure to become acquainted with himself  in the dusk of the evening george paid his prisoner a second visit and mentioned more particularly the plan of his establishment being in a hurry however he said little of the internal furniture of the abbey except to observe that though sir guise would doubtless find great alterations in it the whole range of it would be at his command and what it might want in other respects would be made up in perfect security you are safe observed george not only because i shall always have the key of you in my pocket but because you must know there is not a man woman or child in the three parishes who could be persuaded to put their heads into this house besides myself even if the doors were left wide open for the story goes that the house is haunted by the troubled spirit of your dead lady who comes from the little chapel where she is buried and walks all over the rooms every night and has been seen go in from the tower at the top and so get down one of the chimneys though as to that they can as easily fly in at a key hole as if the sash was left up on purpose  but that is nothing  you would not be afraid of your dead wife if you were to see her she never did you any harm when she were living in this very abbey and i dare say if she might be permitted for i am told sir apparitions have their orders and may not do always what they like  she would if she were here this moment rather pity and moan over you and do something to show you she forgave you and wished you well than to hurt or frighten you see sir continued george i have brought you some candles and a tinderbox we will have a light in a minute  aye and i have a bottle of wine for you as good as any in fitzorton cellar and here is a pair of sheets for your bed as fine as my lady herself lies on i can tell you i have had a good look out to bring them off without being seen there  we have got a light you see but the wind does so scud about these old apartments there is no keeping in a candle i think it feels dampish too to morrow i will get in some wood and you can have a fire it is a blustering night is not it sir but what is this to the nights you have made squire henry and i pass in the woods about this estate bad as you may think the room where you are i would have given ten years wages to have got my poor master into it instead of which there has he stood for hours in the middle of the night in hail rain or snow to look at the place where his hearts first love was o sir guise sir guise sir guise  but we must not think of these things he is very happy now but where is she poor thing  o sir guise sir guise well i will say no more you look sadly pale do take a glass of wine it will cheer you up abit there sir  and looke here are sweet biscuits o if you knew who made them and a cold fowl and a neatstongue and in short a little of every thing and a nice clean cloth too i will make you up a supper in a minute and you may either eat it while i go put the sheets on the bed or you may take it after i am gone  stay as long as you can george sighed the baronet i will sir replied george and am sorry i cannot be oftener with you or longer at a time for indeed sir guise i am very sorry to see you in this way and to leave you in it all to yourself i could hardly keep from crying as i went away from you in the morning after all said i it must go very hard with a gentleman who has lived as he has lived and had once a house full of good people about him to come to this  but i will get a good bed ready that is always a comfort to a man have you found one that suits you sir  no answered sir guise dejectedly i have scarcely stirred from this room since you left me  there is a good one somewhere i am told and i will find him out as soon as i have lighted another candle but you have not yet drank the wine i poured out do pray sir there  i know it will do you good for it is madeira and older than i am  so now for the bed  the different movements of sir guises soul during this discourse and the reflections that preceded and followed it had so destroyed every bodily consideration that the unhappy man sat abstracted from all thoughts of sustenance though for many days past he had not been composed enough to enjoy one comfortable meal on georges return he saw for the first time the cheeks of sir guise stuart bathed in a torrent of tears his worthy attendant  forgetting that the object of his care had ever offended either god or man  felt his pure heart shake within him at the sight and as he gazed on the quivering lip streaming eye and diminished figure of the baronet o good dear sir he cried dont be cast down dont be disheartened pray pray dont god is very merciful and brings light out of darkness only look in that book sir i brought you this morning particularly where he says that he desires not the death of a sinner but rather that he should turn from his wickedness and live and moreover that the sinner who repents is better than ninety and nine persons who have never been guilty how comfortable that is would to heaven good father arthur were here now  have you found any bed questioned sir guise i do not feel very well  i am afraid sir you are very ill but with the blessing of god i hope you will be better tomorrow perhaps you would like to get into bed before i go sir  if you please answered sir guise rising with difficulty  take my arm sir but pray one more glass of wine  at any rate well take the bottle with us  you may wish for a little in the night i have got you a decanter of nice water fresh from your own pump and made out things as well as i could all this is womans work you know sir i am but an awkward chamberman  but i will do the best i can i will indeed and will help you to pray to god with all my soul to make you better every way  george had in the course of this speech and the intermediate pauses which he made conducted or rather carried sir guise through many apartments to that where he had prepared the bed being the room fitted up for mr burton at the time of the inoculation and which olivia had mentioned at the moment of entrance sir guise drew back  i wish you had not happened to fix on this chamber said he  none of the others have so good a bed replied george  i should have preferred them nevertheless said sir guise in broken accents  but it is no matter  george retired till the baronet got into bed then asked sir guise if he could do any thing more for him assuring him that he would remain with him all night but that it would be noticed at the castle and spoil all he then desired to know whether he chose to have the candle left burning or be put out o put it out answered sir guise i can change my room tomorrow  i will put the sheets on another bed if you think you shall sleep more comfortably i think nothing of the trouble said george  it does not matter for tonight answered sir guise perhaps it is better as it is  then good rest to you sir and may god hear your prayers as i hope he will mine your name will be in all of them i do assure you sir  the good creature drew the curtain repeating his greeting but did not leave the chamber or the house till he had put all things in order  so that in case sir guise should rise before he could return in the morning he might not want any accommodation the situation and circumstances afforded  chapter xiv the apartment hinted at by sir guise was that in which he had first received the blooming form and last observed the pallid corpse of lady stuart his wife and to which the bed and furniture he had seen at robert irwins formerly appertained and it was the impression made by this latter circumstance associated with other affecting ideas which produced his reluctance to sleep there  a thousand promiscuous and polluting scenes might have passed in that apartment since when the sons and daughters of dissipation held their midnight revels at the abbey but confederate guilt derives confidence from example imitation and numbers the terrors of the individual are silenced or put to flight by general audacity far removed from these sir guise stuart was now thrown upon himself in the abode of his former enormities he was left to pass the night where dreadful sights had been seen and tremendous sighs had been heard  even in that chamber where all that was lovely and interesting in life had felt his cruel arm encountered his furious eye and assailed his unpitying ear  such is the sympathy of painful as of pleasing ideas that with these seemed to assemble in the mind of sir guise a thousand others no less afflicting memory brought forward in terrible array the most oppressive images of his atrocious hypocrisy and the different yet dire events of the little chapel of the inn at adsell of edgecombehall and of the atwoods came hurrying into the retrospect  at once the figures of all those whom he had wronged  a numerous band  poured upon his affrighted fancy the wind had arisen and howled with more than usual violence through the almost empty apartments sir guise regretted that the candle had been extinguished heavy pauses of deathlike silence were succeeded by vehement bursts of the hurricane in which the loosened tiles fell into the areas the casements rattled and some of the doors slapped to and fro amidst the chaos of sounds he imagined he could distinguish human voices at one moment loud and menacing at another in moaning and whispered complainings to these his fears his fancy and his conscience gave appropriate persons it was now the faultering accent of the dying matilda then of the injured sir armine now the groans of charles and then again the swoonings of caroline exhausted by continued exertion he sunk into a momentary doze out of which he seemed to be aroused by a legion of furies that bore to his distempered mind the shapes of valentine miles and his colleagues led on by the furious lady tempest in the midst of a conflicting struggle with these he thought he distinctly heard footsteps paceing along an adjoining apartment unable to support the shock of this idea he leaped from his bed and opening a door that led from the sound he ran through the rooms which lay in the eastern direction of the abbey where stopping awhile and every noise seeming to cease he sought about for something whereon to repose after traversing the place in vain several minutes he perceived he had got into a part of the abbey which had always been left unfurnished but he at last found a seat which projected from the window and sat down the wind had much abated and a heavy shower of rain falling soon after sank it to a perfect calm  all was still without and a dreary silence prevailed within encouraged by this he was rising from his seat in the hope of returning to his bed when the noises suddenly were renewed and to his infinite terror he heard one of the antique foldingdoors of a spacious apartment beneath open and close sinking down again on the bench with affright he observed from the window which commanded a view of several of the rooms in the second story a light moving from room to room with a strange celerity that chilled his blood such was its speed that like lightning it caught his eye only by flashes sir guise left the room and without knowing what path to take ran forward by hazard rather than design but turning to the left he recovered the suite of rooms from which he had wandered making a trembling pause in one of these he heard a voice reverberate in hollow echoes one unvaried kind of cry on lifting his eye to the window he perceived the same light going as it were before the voice the light vanished the voice continued  in a short time the sounds came evidently nearer and in their advance rendered them not more loud than distinct sir guise soon heard his own name pronounced and repeated with a violence that denoted at once misery and despair a heart more intrepid and less criminal than that of our recluse might have quaked at this  a noise as of one running distractedly forward accompanied the voice  the door of the apartment where sir guise stood supporting himself by one of the pillows of the chimney opened abruptly and the figure of a man bearing a light rushed in still repeating the name of sir guise stuart  chapter xv these terrors which certainly wanted not the power of guilt to render them more terrible proceeded only from true george who on reaching the castle had an unobserved opportunity to inform olivia of the manner in which he had placed served and left their mutual charge  yet i dont think my lady the poor man will get any sleep there does not seem a wink in his eyes nor indeed any thing else but tears  olivia expressed a wish that before george had gone off with his basket she had thought to have put into it a cordial which had proved of such use to her beloved henry whenever he suffered for want of sleep i am sure it would have procured him a good nights rest which in any misery you know my good george is a balm from heaven  it is too late now continued olivia tomorrow morning my good george you shall take it to him  i am sorry your ladyship thinks it is too late for i dont and when the squire is gone to bed if you please my lady to give the good stuff to me and tell me how much our poor quaker should have at a dose i will step with it to the abbey and if i should find him asleep as i shall not make much noise why i will leave him as i found him and it will be ready for another time  but you stand in need of rest yourself my poor fellow said olivia  i do so answered george but to my thoughts i ought never to wake again if i were wicked enough to go to bed till i had carried a poor sinful soul locked up by himself in a huge house like a deserted town something to give him strength to go on praying god to make him better  olivia gave him the cordial with due directions and george set out just as the shower began to fall for a second nocturnal excursion to the abbey on his arrival he unlocked the great door and opened every other with the greatest caution passing with stealing steps through the several long apartments till he reached that in which he had left the baronet but his consternation at finding it empty aggravating his fears brought to his mind the condition in which he had parted from his prisoner especially the regret he had expressed at sleeping in that apartment and made him adopt some of the superstitious and horrible things supposed now to infest the abbey he ran through every room in the castle lantern in hand till he found what he sought in the manner and condition we have recorded  long and reiterated however were the efforts of the protector of sir guise before the latter could be restored to sense or motion and it was lucky that the gentle and considerate olivia had added a smelling bottle of restoratives to the cordial by the application of the former the wretched man sufficiently recovered to distinguish the person who assisted him and this producing confidence he was in due time able to be conducted back to his bed by the side of which george sat and having diminished fear by gradual explanation his charge was at once composed and grateful now then your honor for a little of this good stuff which a good friend of mine  i beg your pardon  a person of my acquaintance who would not hurt a worm  gave me and which will make you sleep like a top and so it ought seeing the time my bringing it has kept you awake  george mixed up the cordialdraught according to rule and measure in half a glass of the madeira and after sir guise had taken it our good domestic seated himself by the bedside to watch its operation  i hope there will be no more noises mr george said the baronet faintly  as to noises i will tell you what i never believed in these sort of things in my life till i came and saw you had left your warm bed which in the condition you were i thought nothing but the devil himself could have persuaded you to do  and i own when i could neither see nor hear any thing of you above or below i began to imagine you were really carried off and considering all things one could not have wondered at it if you had but now i have found you again i come back to my old thoughts that there are no candles going about without hands of flesh and blood to carry them and no noises by day or night but what are made by poor mortals like you or i a mans conscience to be sure will conjure up these things and a person had better be haunted by a whole churchyard of glarish specter as squire henry called them  yea though there were to come one or more out of every grave than be haunted by that  now dont you think so  i do indeed answered sir guise pathetically  and therefore sir resumed george never mind any other lights or noises  i think sighed sir guise i need not trouble you any longer at present as i feel heavy and might perhaps sleep if i were alone  there then sir is the smelling bottle on the chair just by you day is almost at hand so a candle will be of no use  i will leave it however in the chimney in the next room i hope i shall find you fast when i come again but i will not wake you for to my thoughts it is one of the sins to wake any body  sleep is such a nice soft comfortable thing good morning sir for it is long enough past twelve  george now again withdrew but waited in and adjacent room till he had manifest tokens of sir guise being in profound slumber the good youth at length went home where he sought his own pillow and if conscious goodness did not soon after seal his eyes conscious goodness could alone bestow the happy emotions that might keep them open  chapter xvi olivias cordial draught had its full power on the corporal functions of her patient for it produced an uninterrupted repose of many hours indeed of nearly the whole of the day  for the sun was gilding with its setting rays the painted figures of his antique window as he arose from his bed  but to what did he awake the neverresting worm was at length feeding on the breast which had long defied its envenomed tooth the hour was come when he could no more deceive himself or others conducted to the chief scenes of his iniquity  the only ones perhaps in the whole range of the universe where conscience could exert herself on a hardened heart and stretched incessantly on the rack of conviction he was by degrees humbled by chastisement to renounce hypocrisy even while he felt that he had in every other instance been a hypocrite  yet all that could be effected by persevering goodness and pity was done by olivia fitzorton and true george and the forlorn object of their cares had continued under their guardianship some months  during which no sights were seen or voices heard in the abbey but those of compassion and good will yet the health of sir guise declined and all the symptoms of a diseased mind were noticed in his conduct he passed suddenly from a violent and tumultuous to a settled malady on the spirits his intellects were no way impaired his general melancholy was increased but his raving paroxysms were less frequent he roved at intervals over every apartment of the house and seemed to live most in those which at his first seclusion were avoided as objects of terror the bedchamber of lady stuart which had several times been changed for others became at last his place of constant repose those of caroline and charles were visited by turns and in one or other of these his guardian george would often discover him bathed in tears  he was one day found busily employed in fastening up a suite of apartments in the western wing of the abbey and on being asked the reason with a brief asperity that might have rather been expected from john fitzorton he answered  because they are accursed they were my wicked wifes so he had for some time past called lady tempest to distinguish her from lady matilda stuart whom he termed blessed but at length he moved from the chamber of the former because he said he was unworthy to occupy it  a report of all these changes was faithfully made by george to olivia but for all this my lady said george the man must die unless he has some help besides yours and mine i can see plainly he wants a doctor but the worst of it is we cannot pass him off to any body of that sort as a quaker because it is not now one time in twenty that i find him either wigged or hatted he will sit you in the old green silk wrapper which he found he says in one of the lumber chests  and which he says was something belonging to his blessed first lady as he calls her  and he has got something of a sash or girdle about his waist that he one day told me he was sure he had seen worn by miss caroline  so that whoever goes to attend him must know him at once not by his face neither so much for that is not like the same but he talks about himself and his wickedness and calls himself as great a villain god knows as he is oh my lady if you had heard what he said last night about jane atwood  he said she was like an angel of light and he like a fiend of darkness  poor man i have thought better of him ever since i heard him say so  but for sure something in the doctoring way he must have or he will be gone  you terrify me george and why not let the good mr burton go to him he is honesty itself in him we may confide and nobody save himself will know but that it is one of his patients afflicted with some disorder that requires he should be alone which is you know alas the truth  and so has borrowed a room in the abbey to place him within reach  hey my lady said george  yes and even if my dear henry should hear of it for mine and his childrens sake if the apothecary observes it may be infectious he will easily be prevailed upon not to indulge his curiosity and there it will end  the very man my lady o what a clever lady you are to think of him not a soul will know it from mr doctor burton i am sure i will go to him the first time i can slip out for an hour it is but a step of a few miles  but then my lady should we not tell sir guise about it poor gentleman we should take more care than ever now he is getting good not to throw him back again well i will take care of that thank you thank you my lady two heads are always better than one  the point was soon settled the worthy apothecary was entrusted and his patient reconciled to receive his visits and indeed it would not have been easy to have found a third person more fitted to the task of consoling a sick and solitary recluse than the good burton he was truly as the reader has seen in the several glances he has had of his manners and character one of the most assiduous affectionate truehearted beings in the world full of pity and forgiveness and by no means unskilful in his business by his own industry fostered by his patrons at the castle he had contrived to bring up his very large family though but a village apothecary where as jonathan observed there were few people to be either sick or sorry of twoandtwenty children there remained alive fifteen but of these only the two daughters and three of their youngest brothers were on his hands  the rest of the males had been comfortably disposed of by john henry or james fitzorton  the females were provided for by olivia so that though the apothecary from long habitude and attachment remained in the little village where he had first established and still carried on business with his usual unrelaxed attention even in the very shop where laxed attention even in the very shop where jonathan armstrong in his masquerade rags and stumps paid him a visit he was considered as a man rising above all domestic encumbrances and laying by little yearly gifts and gettings for his children  yet with a hand so clean and a heart so open that no honest distress within his reach either of body or of mind but found an adviser and a friend in mr burton of brixom and all this progressive good fortune arose from the very slight beginnings of his interview with the pretended lame beggar whom he followed to fitzorton to return a sixpence that was paid by a mistake for the memorable bottle of hartshorn  slight and sometimes too nice for instant observation are the means which bring about the most important ends as the proudest rivers may have their source in the humblest vales and issue from the scantiest rills it is true that before jonathans adventure our friend burton was upon principles of general benevolence included in the bounty list of the castle as an oppressed and struggling man to be occasionally assisted but the splendid sixpence brought his heart into action and notice and by ascertaining its worth created an interest for him in every lover of virtue the drawing of the man had been looked at transiently before it was then placed in an unfavourable light but it was this simple sixpence that shifted the picture to a spot where its colors could be feen and be appreciated  prior to our apothecarys visiting sir guise stuart the diligent george had related to him such parts of the history of that unhappy outcast as were necessary to excite his entire commiseration so that although burton was amongst those who had conceived the most unqualified detestation of the baronets former practices he was by no means prejudiced beyond the power of penitence to change his sentiments in the proportion that the offender changed his life  although burton had for some time past been an almost daily visitor at the castle his being all at once observed to take his ride or walk into the proscribed and desolate abbey excited general enquiry into his motive but the reason hinted at by olivia to george and adopted by the apothecary was so natural and in effect so true that the apprehension of any epidemic malady not only prevented the enquirers from asking any more questions but made the swains and other persons of the surrounding villages go to several places by roundabout paths rather than cut through the abbey pastures or come within a mile of its supposed tainted air  indeed some thought it not very safe to come into contact with burton himself and we know not whether his attendance on this one patient might not lose him many others for the natural gathering of a story had increased the malignity of the abbey invalid from a putrid fever to the spotted pestilence and the good folks made it a kind of parish business not to send to burton if it could possibly be avoided till he had done with the man that had got the plague  george however was observed to venture in more than once some blamed his fool hardiness and some praised his humanity while others said if he regarded not his own health he had no right to hazard that of his neighbors and the plague they had understood was a thing that like a person charmed would kill at a touch  nay and at a mile distance  thus then was the abbey under a double proscription first on account of the vices of sir guise stuart and secondly from the diseases of a contagious man  perhaps had the country people known the man was that very sir guise stuart himself they would have held the mansion in yet greater dread and have left the county to settle beyond reach of the pest  our good apothecary however and true george frequently met at the apartments of the baronet and took the active management of his health and comforts between them while olivia like some recompensing yet invisible power superintended their office and encouraged their zeal burton had contrived to fix in the abbey kitchen an old woman who knew something of cookery and who undertook to live in some of the rooms below provided the plaguey gentleman would promise not to come near her and on being solemnly assured by the apothecary that it would be impossible for her to catch it while she kept out of his way and attended only to her own business accepted the office nothing however could induce her to go near him true george therefore continued the office of gentleman of the bedchamber and thus the economy of the household was perfectly well settled  the object of their cares however often wanted more than bed or board or than all the drugs the materia medica could furnish his mind was struck his conscience was in arms and the spirit of the man was departed from him  yetevery chearing every sustaining art was tried and sometimes not without success now and then the apothecary would seduce him into a game of backgammon and sometimes assist him to take half an hours exercise in an area of the court yard that was shaded from observation by the abbey wall george would occasionally play him a tune on the flute lead him into momentary sports tell him a merry tale and by a thousand ways beguile him from himself the baronet would often speak his thanks by a smile but oftener by a tear in general however he declined motion though he found it difficult to rest he would take his solitary rounds of the castle shift his visits from the room of his matilda to that of caroline or charles he would pass lady tempests door with every mark of scorn and once ventured with burton to go into what had been the general breakfastingroom and from thence into the library but a sudden thought drove him hastily from both these and the residue of the day on which he had hazarded this experiment was unusually melancholy  chapter xvii it was in that breakfastingroom the imperious husband and cruel father had fallen upon his knees to curse the best and most obedient of wives and it was in that library he had imposed his hard commands on the most observant and dutiful of daughters the bell with which he had summoned her into his presence was amongst the few fixtures that remained and as he cast his eye upwards to survey it though the wires were broken and nothing seemed entire but the part on which he had pressed his tyrannic hand it struck his heart with a sound more aweful than the knell of death so acute is the memory of guilt when quickened by conscience  but an impression more intolerable for him to bear even than these though accompanied perhaps from its profundity with less actual violence proceeded from the unexpected sight of jane atwood at goody brabsons attached to this young woman were so many terrible transactions the delusion of youth the desertion of age the lying lips and the neverconsuming fire the excellency of true george whose conduct shone forth in the character of a protector contrasted with his own hateful behavior as a seducer hence a glimpse of the injured jane though but momentary acted upon him as the commissioned lightning acts upon its object overwhelming the proudest faculties of our nature and preserving memory only to torture him with partial recollection of his crimes  he had been under the infliction of feelings like these some days when making his accustomed call the apothecary perceived he had been writing and finding him much agitated truly my good sir said he feeling his pulse this will never do you can do yourself more harm in a single hour than i can do you good in a month and unless you will prescribe a little for yourself    no sir replied his patient with a feeble voice but earnest manner you can on the contrary contribute more to the health of my body and peace of my mind in one hour than i can in the residue of life  then i am sure if i can i will said the good man ardently that is a little correcting his warmth if i imagine what you have to propose will be really for your good because you know my good sir patients are not always the best judges of their own case nor of the remedies best adapted to their cure  but mine can be effected only one way answered sir guise with augmented emotion he then took from under his wrapper a written paper which he read aloud though in every line it criminated himself often did he drop the scalding tear of sharpest remorse upon the pages and at length he exclaimed oh if you would ever wish me to remain long enough in this world to make my peace in another deliver this as it is addressed you know the reasons why i cannot ask this favor of mr george for though there are not any sentiments that can interrupt the happiness of that good young man i have tried in vain to mention to him even the name of the injured girl to whom this letter is written in pity take it then and grant my request  i will sir answered burton wiping his eyes and receiving the letter after the trembling hands of the baronet had folded it up again and put under it a wafer i expect to see her this very evening it is her birth day we are all to meet on it and drink to her health  are you questioned sir guise with quivering lips i  i  will drink it too alas alas mr burton  sir guise smote his breast and it was a considerable time before the kind hearted apothecary could compose him he remained however in his pious endeavor till long after the anniversaryfestival at the fitzortonarms was begun he had set apart that evening for gaiety and grateful pleasure amongst his friends and benefactors but he could not feel himself in a situation to enjoy society till he had administered to his now interesting solitary all the comfort in his power to bestow what were the pleasant events and discoveries that awaited his heart as if to reward him for his worthy deeds previous to his joining the party the sympathizing reader already knows and just before the company broke up he performed his promise by giving the packet to jane atwood taking care to put it into an envelope that the hand writing might not immediately be discovered and as he gave it into her hand he said this is for your own pretty eyes it is the case of a patient of mine and a friend of yours who has long been in a very bad way and who had been given over but who i am in hopes will do better after all if you can assist a little in the cure i am sure you will  from some of my ladys cottagers i suppose said jane putting the packet into her pocket i will certainly attend it mr burton before i go to bed  chapter xviii thus by a retrospective view having brought forward some principal figures which had been a considerable time in the background of this our familypicture we will now carry back the pencil to a groupe which we feel assured will always be looked at with complacence whether painted in the deepest shades of distress or in the gayest colorings of prosperity  the honored and surely we may now be permitted to call her the honorable jane atwood  after crowning the long fidelity of her worthy lover with hopes that filled his honest heart with joy  was no sooner left alone than she took from her pocket the packet concerning which the good apothecary had excited her curiosity nay more had moved her pity but what were her emotions when on opening the envelope she saw the wellknown characters of sir guise stuart since the hour of her escape from the rash action she had committed on his account she had never suffered even his name to pass her lips and being at length thoroughly convinced of his unworthiness she had exchanged the softer sentiment in his favor for as much of dislike as was consistent with a nature so gentle as hers  but the very address of the letter  to the most injured from the most penitent  was of itself sufficient to create very powerful feelings this interesting superscription however did not occasion a moments balance in her mind on what to resolve as to the letter itself i hope said she from my soul that it is dictated by penitence but be the motive of writing it what it may worlds should not tempt me now to read it and surely it was wrong in mr burton who alas is but too well acquainted with our sad story to deliver it and from whence could he receive it where is this unhappy  this illfated man perhaps he is in the heaviness of some deep distress or of a dire sickness mr burton spoke of his having been given over yet mentioned hopes of doing well praise be to god he is not fit  ah none of us are fit to die  reflections like these forced their way to her trembling lips her streaming eyes were fixed on the direction of the letter and when her apostrophe ended true george tapped at her door to gratify himself with one more look before he retired to rest she was precisely in the situation above described when he entered her apartment and seeing a letter in her hand stood aloof lest he should seem to be obtrusive or impertinent but without asking the cause he tried whatever affection could suggest to remove the effect and i left you mrs jane in such good spirits just before i answered the squires bell cried the poor fellow george said the afflicted girl holding the letter near enough for the address to be read i have received a packet from  but you see by whom it was written  ye  ye  yes mrs jane ye  yes i  i do from sir  gui  guise  stu  stuart replied george in a stammer after which and a stop to take breath he added rather more connectedly i  i  dont now wonder then mrs jane that you  you are in the way i see you but dont think mrs jane i can bear to see you cry  and whatever may be in that letter to make those tears fall so fast dont think any kind words mr partington may have forced you to say per  perhaps against your will shall make true george hold you to what you spoke in his favor i have often heard what first love is that it goes to the grave with some folks let other folks be never so falsehearted heigho i think it will go to the grave with me but indeed  indeed jane i had rather see you happy with any body you liked than unhappy with any body you dont a thousand thousand times over though it were myself heigho  so you are not to think of what mr partington made you promise  made me repeated the deeply penetrated jane no dear and generous george the promise i gave was willing and sincere this hand is yours  this heart  would it were more worthy  is every moment more sensible of your unremitted goodness to me or if i have deserved any share of that goodness it is from having kept you from a hand which alas never never can be again what it was  what  for your sake as much as my own  i wish it were  george uttered not a word even though the purified and precious hand thus again given had been at his lips some moments but soon after the fair and trembling form of all he loved sunk into his arms  as to the letter exclaimed jane on recovering it was my settled purpose not to read it before you came into the room mr burton delivered it with every mark of caution but i gather that the unhappy writer of it has been dangerously sick the letter will doubtless mention particulars thus giving it to george she said i here place it in the best way to serve the unfortunate writer my dearest george will look over it with a good and merciful eye offer his assistance to  to the unhappy  should it be within his power and either impart or suppress its contents to his jane as he judges it right  so good night dearest george  jane atwood had left the room before george could make any reply but had she remained longer it is probable her lover would not have felt himself either willing or able to speak the three strong spells which in two little words accompanied his name  my dearest george had bound him so fast that he appeared almost to be fixed in an entire charm on the spot where it was wrought but when he could sufficiently attend to mortal things he opened sir guise stuarts packet and read what follows  dear injured girl conscious of having forfeited every claim to your esteem to your good wishes and good faith even to your belief in the representation i have now to mention to what am i reduced yet as the generous and honorable man who undertakes to deliver this can attest its truth i will venture to throw my case on your compassion o if you or either of my deeply wronged and justly offended children could know the life i have led under the tyranny of the vilest of women and most ungrateful of men  lady stuart and her abandoned miles  who after plundering me have left me to famine and the remorse of conscience in an almost shell of the abbey  which they have pulled almost into ruins upon me  and in the midst of which without a servant friend or neighbor but the poor good apothecary and mr true george the best of beings on whose charity both my body and mind alas are thrown o could you know this i should not want an advocate in your gentle breast refuse me not i beseech you the consolation to hear that in the midst of my distress and heavy sickness you will not curse me but use your interest with the good  alas too good  fitzortons to find the residence of my son and daughter i can neither think without horror of them or you  nor the fitzortons  alas neither of the living nor the dead  in their family or in my own  and yet i can now think of nothing else forgive me o forgive the penitent  guise stuart   these sentiments affected the generous heart of true george scarcely less powerfully than they would have done that of jane atwood and it was the first impression on the former to make the latter partaker of them and that with the best intentions in the world to place the present repentant state of sir guise in the fairest and strongest light to the woman he had wronged but after revolving the matter on his pillow he thought it his duty to consult his coadjutor olivia on the subject and was favored with an opportunity in the course of the same morning while henry fitzorton took a walk with his children  an it please you my lady said he though there was nothing new under the sun in king solomons time i think times are altered and that a miracle as they call it in the scriptures is at work at the blessed minute i am talking to my lady in proof of this assertion the good george in his way gave a history of what attached to the baronets epistle by way of introduction and then presented the epistle itself  the color varied in the cheeks of olivia several times during the perusal as the emotions of pity regret and wonder were excited in her breast we have been some time preparing ourselves for a change of this happy kind you know said he poor man it is never too late to be good my trusty friend but i think it may be as well not to show our friend jane the letter for the present i am going to join my dearest husband and children who are strolling this fine morning somewhere about the park and gardens and as i walk along i will think what step seems most discreet for us to take and if you will come into my dressingroom after dear jane has left me we will confer  yes my lady i always know when mrs jane is coming before i see her pretty face said george  indeed exclaimed olivia how so  by her step my lady i dare say your ladyship knows the squires step from a thousand  then you are within hearing are you  your ladyship knows that my little closet for whips and spurs and angling rods and nets and other little odd gimcracks is just under the great staircase and so observed olivia smiling you angled for her heart and then put the poor thing in your net did you that is the way you caught her is it mr george well as i am sure you will use your captive kindly i hope you may be in your gimcrack closet when she next comes down stairs  with gods blessing my lady i hope i shall said george making his bow and exit in high satisfaction  olivia again read the penitentials of sir guise stuart an idea struck her as she was putting the packet in her pocket which agitated her extremely and at length suffused her sweet eyes in tears she sat down on a bench in one of the windings of the shrubbery to recover herself but the idea seemed to gain strength the sound however of well known voices which would at any time have cheared her drooping heart  for they were those of her husband son and daughter  soon made her spring up and run with all the earnestness of unaffected conjugal and maternal love to meet them henry perceiving her had assisted the children to hide the little ones concealed themselves amongst the shrubs while the father stood behind some laurels and just as olivia past henry ran from this poetical retreat into the arms of his wife soon after the little john was discovered through the emblematic leaves of a young sir and his sister suffered herself to be espied half in a shower of clustring roses lost  olivias tears became in a moment softer than the dew yet they were still to be seen on her cheek henry was the first to observe them for he felt them on his lips my dear olivia has been weeping said he how is this ere she had time to answer this question which breathed more melody and softness than the plaining notes of aerial music  an innocent strife between the children demanded the adjustment of their mother little caroline who in her walks was continually in search of something beautiful and singular in its kind whether animated or vegetable and who discovered an early taste and delicacy in the selection had found what she deemed important and came running with it in her closed hand toward her brother asking at every step how much he would give for a sight of what she had found nothing answered john i can see it without paying for it if i thought it worth while caroline defying him john proceeded to actions which discovered more of resolution than gallantry olivia observed he should never be rude to young ladies who were objects of protection not of assault besides said henry it is not pretty to steal secrets when people offer to sell them but if they did not a secret is a thing sacred and it is mean and wicked to pry into it before his father had done speaking john desisted and yielding his point  just as his uncle on any stronger occasion would have yielded  he ran to kiss the pretty hand that held the object of contention caroline hereupon would voluntarily have let him into the secret which in truth  was only a captive grasshopper  had not henry repeated his remark as to the sanctity of a secret  but no sooner was harmony restored amongst the little ones than olivia said with some vivacity you think then my henry that even brothers and sisters which are in a manner parts of one another may have their little reserves  undoubtedly replied henry and as they grow up their great ones too secrets ought to be inviolable for my part i know not how to forgive any body who would insidiously rob me of what i judged right to conceal  but then i presume observed his wife tremulously you do not extend this reservation to married people you would not excuse a man or woman bound by ties so near and dear to have an uncommunicated action or even a thought of any consequence  the emphatic manner in which olivia spoke proceeded from a certain delicate consciousness in herself but made henry once more tremble for his own secret and he hesitated which his lady interpreting against herself observed she felt his answer in his silence it was in truth an idea of this kind which had at first brought tears into her eyes and was now starting them again i confess said she i have for some time treated my henry with guilty unkindness by shutting up in my own breast a certain transaction he had a right to know and no other excuse have i to offer than that as it did not immediately connect with any thing essential to his repose i thought the discovery of it might be made when it would be more satisfactory to him pray pray forgive me my dearest love and you shall have the knowledge and history of it instantly continued she with equal sweetness and was just about to draw the explanatory letter of sir guise stuart from her pocket  i will only excuse you answered henry much relieved by finding the secret had so well shifted ground by your promising to nurse fondle guard and entertain it in your own bosom till you think it is in the state to give both of us and all whom it may concern the most pleasure but i would not hear it now for the world  heigho sighed and smiled olivia well then as i do still think it may be better byandby i believe i must accept your conditions but i wish you had a secret too henry perhaps you have  henry was again embarrassed but as speedily released by her innocently saying with a gaiety that cleared every cloud of apprehension but if you have not got one i beg you will provide yourself as soon as you can and not tell me a word of it and then when it is just as you wish it to be we will make an exchange  a bargain answered henry and i seal it with a kiss  and these dear things shall be witnesses o the compact exclaimed olivia embracing her children  yes and sign and seal it in like manner said henry catching them from her arms thus the little family party were all good friends though each kept their secret the first notice was now given by the dinner bell and the flowery scenes where the treaty of pacification had been made and he articles agreed upon were left for the castle  chapter xix nothing could have fallen out more favorably than the little domestic occurrences above related for reconciling the truly delicate olivia to her benevolent plan and encouraging her to pursue it under these cheering circumstances she turned her thoughts toward the unfortunate baronets present situation with more energy and gave to the genial current of her soul an uninterrupted course she was however unusually reserved even though uncommonly happy during the whole time of dressing she gave no answer to janes wish to know what she would be pleased to put on have i been unfortunate enough to offend my dearest mistress questioned the gentle attendant o no i have only been in a sort of daydream dear jane said her mistress in which my mind has been so much employed that i quite forgot my person and yet though i did not chat as usual i dont know that i ever thought of you more since i began to love you and that is you know now many years ago the grateful jane bowed her head so lowly that her cheek reached her ladys hand which she ventured to press to her lips olivia then fixed on the ornaments of the day and her toilette being finished just as the preparation bell gave the last summons i have something to say to our good george said olivia do step and tell him i want to speak with him possibly you may find him in his watchbox of guns traps angles and other little odd things underneath the stairs i have heard of his being there a little before dinner but be he where he will i know i cannot make him happier than to send for him by such a messenger  olivias orders were smilingly given and smilingly obeyed and when george made his appearance his lady in the same flow of good spirits and good humor informed him that after bestowing on the subject in which they were mutually interested all the attention of which she was mistress she could not but confess there was a difficulty in it that inclined her to believe much good might arise from calling in a third person as auxiliary and the only point to settle was who this should be  to jane to henry to parlington or to the apothecary she had her objections in the immediate stage of the affair we stand in need of some one my good fellow said she who by his dispassionate wisdom may instruct us how to proceed in a matter which i take to be of real importance for i cannot but look upon the letter of this wretched man as the forerunner of something extraordinary now if it were any way possible to prevail on my brother john fitzorton to hear any thing which relates to one against whom his wrath has been so often justly kindled he is the man in the world to be resorted to on this occasion  an please you my lady said george if it was the devil himself  god forgive me for speaking of him before your ladyship  mr sir john would see that the devil had his due though he defied him and all his works and if so be my lady as you think we want a little help in this business mr sir john is your man only we must not say any thing to sir guise about it as he would be frightened out of his wits for he has always been mortally afraid of mr sir john  olivia said she would turn the matter in her mind again desired he would continue meanwhile his attentions to sir guise and particularly to assure him that he might depend on the prayers of the good jane  you know my friend said olivia we may very safely promise him this especially as i will myself undertake at a fit time to make her acquainted with the sentiments of his epistle  when henry took his afternoon wood walk from which olivia excused herself she sat down to address john fitzorton in behalf of the man on earth he held most in contempt the reader however will believe that the cause could not have fallen into better hands and that it would not have been possible for an advocate to have had greater power with the heart of the person addressed but the heart of john fitzorton in a case of conscience was not as we have already seen to be biassed by love itself  while the fair pleader was ruminating what arguments to employ the good apothecary craved audience to relate a very pathetic scene of which he had just been a spectator at the abbey he informed her that the thick melancholy which had for some time settled on sir guise had at length brought on so utter a desolation of spirits that much of his day passed in tears and when these refused to flow an anguish little short of madness succeeded but on every return to reason he called out on his children and the injured fitzortons and could he live to receive the pardon of these in this world his punishment even in the next would be made more tolerable and said if he could converse but five minutes with sir john he would tell him something for the good of squire charles and miss caroline  indeed then tell our good george to be in readiness to take dispatches to the post house and do you mr burton draw up the case of your unhappy patient just as you have stated it to me let us lose no time my worthy friend  in the next room we shall find all writing materials  chapter xx such a letter then was written enclosing such a case as brought john with all speed to the castle  my dear dear brother said henry who happened to be walking in his park as john rode by how kind is this visit how unexpected what a treat will it be to my dear olivia and our children you cannot think how your little namesake grows and more like his uncle every day ah may he prove as worthy i languished to tell you how infinitely sensible i am of your goodness in your dispatches brought me by george and of my wifes incomparable excellencies and if i am not even yet as happy as  i ought to be  it is the sad infirmity of my nature and you must not chide olivia remains blessed our children are healthy and happy their father is not wretched no he is affectionately grateful  and now his dear john is added to the family groupe  all  all  will be as it should be  these expressions were uttered with all the accustomed ardour of the speaker while he walked by the side of johns horse clasping his brothers hand yet john could perceive even in henrys account of happiness the traces of infelicity but he knew it was like the touches of an old and probably incurable disorder whose virulence being past nothing but a weakness remained  he therefore heard henrys effusions without adverting to the lets and hindrances which accompanied them congratulating him on the health of the children  and here they are said henry coming with their dear mother to give their uncle welcome  the day was past amidst domestic satisfactions which did not allow john any opportunity to confer with olivia or pursue the object of his journey but at tea he observed that he should not make his appearance any more till supper and that he should have occasion for george having thus secured the intermediate hours he set out as soon as it was dusk attended by george for the abbey at the gate of which the good apothecary was just remounting his horse after having paid his evening visit to his patient he expressed infinite satisfaction at the sight of john fitzorton but said sir guises personal health went much more rapidly to decline than he expected and that a nervous kind of terror had since the evening seized his mind which called for something composing and for that he was going home  though john still distrusted the baronets professions and determined to judge for himself he did not prevent burton from setting off full speed with every mark of alarm and solicitude george observed that he never saw the doctor look more in a fright  let us go into the abbey said john i know not the way through these ruins and you must conduct me  when they had gained the great hall they were accosted by the woman who had undertaken the office of cook  o mr george exclaimed she this poor quaker man is i fancy very bad to night he moans and takes on most piteously i never go within sight of him you know but he made my old heart ache to hear him just now  however i believe he is safe for the night as i heard him go into the room where he sleeps a little while ago and since that i thought i heard the curtains draw backwards and forwards and for my part i think you had better not disturb him tonight for he does not often get any rest  george receiving a nod from john fitzorton continued his way through the apartments till he came to that of the baronet  the door of his bedchamber was left open and a voice from the bed was distinctly heard pronouncing these words  o my poor poor children  my murdered wife  my injured friends  why do i yet live to empoison the air shut up like the ghost of some murderer in the mansion where my foul deeds were committed  here am i left to be haunted by my own guilty spirits would i had died when the generous john fitzorton first avenged his father  to what am i reduced but how much more to be envied is the corpse of sir armine in the honored tomb of his ancestors and his pure soul taking its reward in heaven than the vile body of sir guise a burden to himself and a stain to his posterity stretched on this bed of wretchedness and his guilty mind in terror of the hell it merits  the selfaccusing spirit in which every part of this was uttered the tone that gave energy to every upbraiding and the deep groans that succeeded chilled the very heart of george true and even awed the mind of john fitzorton yes these are genuine  even sir guise stuart no longer deceives these demonstrations of awakened conscience are to be relied on let us advance  in trembling silence george obeyed and was in an instant by the side of the baronets bed begging him to be comforted and to put his trust in god for that we were told he would pardon the wickedest creature that ever lived they if repented  impossible either that god or man can pardon me answered sir guise starting up but oh mr george if those whom i have most wronged could see me at this moment they might well be satisfied  even john fitzorton might relent and while he triumphed in my woes might almost pity them  he does exclaimed john who had gone to the other side of the bed where the curtains were close drawn as if unwilling to surprise the wretched man john fitzorton does relent and almost pity  sir guise heard and took shelter in the arms of george then turning his head toward the place from whence the voice proceeded and not perceiving the person to whom it belonged o god exclaimed he in a fearful kind of whisper how conscience delights to torture me i thought george i heard sir john fitzorton speak to me as plain as i ever heard him speak in my life and in a voice of compassion  alas it was but my distempered fancy how indeed should it be any thing else he of all mankind most scorns   and perhaps most commiserates you resumed the voice in yet milder accents  again cried the baronet but i suppose you heard nothing  yes i did sir i heard mr sir john himself who came on purpose to see what could be done for you having heard your melancholy case he is in the room now but dont tremble so for pitys sake  in my room reiterated sir guise yet you would not have the heart to deceive me  he deceives you not said john gently moving the curtain and showing himself the hand of the lord god seems now to be upon you and that of a feeble mortal is no longer necessary it would be presumptive your wish to see me was a far greater motive of my visit in this place than any wish to see you in additional affliction  o sir answered the now truly penitent baronet if any thing could add to it it would be this unmerited goodness from you can you sir extend your bounty so far as to tell me whether my offended children are alive  they are replied john  blessed be god exclaimed the baronet may i ask sir    farther questions might at this time fatigue you interposed john compose yourself mr burton will speedily be here to assist that endeavor and if it will seem more easy to you george shall remain till he arrives  sir guise was indeed exhausted and could hardly articulate his thanks but begged george might attend his master home  i shall probably repeat my visit shortly said john nothing sternly in the mean time i recommend you to cultivate more and more your acquaintance with the power who is allsufficient to restore the body and the soul whatever be their condition  sir guise clasped his hands together in a supplicatory manner bowed his head and kept his eyes fixed alternately on john fitzorton and true george till those inestimable men had left the room  chapter xxi george had scarcely opened his lips during the whole of the preceding scene nor did he at all presume to break silence while he went home as he knew by the length of his steps and violence of his movements that john was hard at work and would not brook interruption by an involuntary impulse however he exclaimed poor sir guise a man had better be an innocent dog than a christian sinner when conscience has once got hold of him  no remark being returned to this burst he had nothing more to do than try to keep pace with his master who strode on furiously and without the utterance of a word till just as the latter ascended the castle steps he said i shall have no farther occasion for you tonight i shall not appear at supper let me not be expected  george obeyed with his usual taciturnity on these occasions john in his philosophicals as he used to call them he seldom presumed to hazard even an opinion but in the poeticals of henry he frequently relieved himself from this suppression by pouring out all that was in his mind  john fitzorton was extremely struck with the situation of sir guise stuart he came prejudiced against his penitence and prepared for his hypocrisy but the conscious struggles mental horror and bodily decay in which he found that unhappy culprit his selfexecrations his incessant callings out on the injured and more than all his bearing to see and looking steadily at any of the everdreaded fitzortons threw him into a train of reflection which lasted almost till the dawn of day even in that chamber which had been the scene of many a powerful contention with himself and of many a virtuous resolve what although said he to himself i hope my life would never have eaten the bread nor my head reposed on the pillow of a foe whom i had wronged i can conceive conscience to be such a punisher that when once its scourge is applied in earnest the affair is taken out of the hands of man  and the sentiment of commiseration the aggrieved then feels for the aggressor is a part of the attribute of mercy which god excites in the breast to attemper his own divine blow  john rose to pursue his musings in the shrubbery on his return from which he met olivia after a little bound of the heart and flutter of the spirits which he always felt at the sight of this amiable woman  and receding a step or two he hastily advanced took her hand and related every circumstance of his abbey adventure closing the whole with a repetition of the sentiments which had formed his soliloquy and which may be considered my dear olivia said he in some measure as a justification of what you have done for the man who has been the pest of his own family and the despoiler of ours  o doubt it not my noble brother i feel that we have been acting under an influence mightier than our own answered olivia do you know last night i dreamed that every weed in our garden turned into a flower the air and skies were as we may fancy those of paradise and while i was yet gazing at the celestial and unclouded blue which spread to the extent of the horizon methought a sudden glory shot immediately over my head and an angel of light that took the form of a new born babe held forth a tablet of precious gems on which the rays of the glory played and on which i read these comfortable words  blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy  then the cherub whose face had to my imagination exactly the shape and lineaments of my henrys bestowed on me a smile that made him look still more like my husband and with one hand pointed to heaven while the other turned the tablet i saw on the reverse engraven in letters of sapphire under a crown of glory  i have blotted out as a thick cloud thy transgressions and as a cloud thy sins return unto me for i have redeemed thee  so that you may be certain we are not doing any thing displeasing to the fountain of mercy by raising up such as are fallen  and if i was not afraid you would laugh at my simple notions i could almost believe this vision had been sent by our angel parents to imitate their forgiveness  but how hard it is that our henry is still shut from his share of what his bounteous nature is so fitted to enjoy  he said last night he thought that you and he had changed characters  that he was philosopher henry and you poet john and mused and wandered more than himself  what would i have given to have told him my dream but i thought it best to see you first and take your wisdom on it for you were always you know my oracle  in the spirit of which answered john much affected with what had been related and with the manner of the relater i must strictly enjoin you to a little more forbearance and    true george came at full speed with the remains of what breath his speed had left him to say breakfast please your honors will be ready in a few minutes and the squire is come down but o your honors there is shocking news brought by mr burton of the poor quakerish gentleman  he has sat up with him all night and i thought he would sometimes have gone raving mad and he said his poor soul would be in burning hell very shortly if his children did not come to forgive him  hush  i see mr henry at the castle door your honors  george vanished  o what a cruel thing it is none of us can discover where these dear wanderers have betaken themselves sighed olivia what a consolation must it be for children to see and to forgive a truly penitent parent and what an encouragement for that parent to persevere in well doing ah surely the almighty will guide us by some directing ray to these worthy creatures they must be under his protecting eye but alas what vain trials have i not made to find them yet as their substitutes let us persist in our good offices to save this dreadful example of divine vengeance  john declared he felt himself much disordered and a cup of coffee might do him good olivia affectionately took his arm pressed it to her side and led him in to breakfast  chapter xxii amongst other pleasant consequences that had happened to the good apothecary growing out of the splendid sixpence was his being promoted to the office of familyapothecary to the fitzortons on a handsome yearly stipend  also general medical inspector of olivias cottages at a distinct salary paid out of that ladys privypurse and a desire that he would consider the castle as his home at bed or board whenever he was on duty at or near fitzorton thus full half of his time was passed with henry and olivia and it was as customary for burton to be seen at nine oclock in the winter and eight in the summer as for the clock to strike the hour indeed so good humoured and sincere a creature had he proved himself on many occasions that the master mistress children and domestics of the mansion seemed to miss him more when professional business intervened than if that clock had been carried from the cupola which enclosed it he was at length become a necessary part of the castle and went in at the time of the morning repast as duly as the repast itself of late in their own persons he had little practice the fitzorton family were in the general enjoyment of good health and whatever henry suffered from occasional sinkings too low or risings too high was imputed to nerves  one of the most convenient maladies that ever bore the blame of the head or heart and in short the best excuse that ever offered itself to the physician when he cannot find out the complaint of the patient and to the patient when he does not wish his case should be discovered by the physician  our apothecary however always made mechanically a morning tour of every pulse in the room watch in hand and observed so pleasantly on surrounding objects or contrived by other relations so to interest the family that he was himself the principal cause of the irregularity of too quick or too slow and the pulsation seldom went on in the orderly way he declared it ought to do till he had done talking laughing or crying in which pulseaffecting operations  he had the art of producing universal sympathy  he was in the act of counting the throbs of henrys animated little timekeeper when john and olivia came in  little john in ludicrous imitation was applying his hand to carolines wrist olivia was in smiles till she came near enough to perceive that her husband was in tears  they have been produced by joy my olivia said henry mr burton has been giving me such an account of the gratitude of your cottagers who have it seems agreed amongst themselves on the day that you next bless me as a father to have a fete of their own all your old women and my old men are to dance together even though some of them should be carried from their bed to their ballroom which is to be at goody brabsons who is to be mistress of the ceremonies and who i am glad to find has got quite stout again i am so pleased with this generous thought that i and the children will go the moment we have breakfasted and give our hands to every one of them i must not suffer you to venture my love the walk is too long and as to the coach  no  you would be too much affected  and as for our philosopher    i cannot attend you this morning it is true said john because i have other employments but i desire you will bespeak goody brabson my partner as i am resolved for the first time in my life to dance on that occasion also and if the founder of the festival should chance to be of olivias sex i entreat that her name may be angelica and if of yours raphael  of my conscience it is as i said observed henry smiling on olivia who had been bound in happy silence my brother has got into my character angelica of raphael i protest i should sooner have expected from my brother john a recommendation for aminadab or rebecca  why you are to know i have heard a dream lately interpreted and i think those names would suit some of the characters in the vision said john  olivia colored yet more highly  the allusion struck her  the names are however beautiful said she and our john makes so few requests that    if we did not grant them said henry catching a hand of his brother and wife kissing and then joining them we should be most unworthy  the breakfast was no sooner ended than henry and the children set out for the cottages john then begged to be closeted a few minutes with the apothecary after which he returned to olivia and told her that burtons account of sir guise stuart made it as he conceived proper to take strong and immediate steps of which he would undertake the guidance if she would promise to follow unquestioned the plan he should lay down olivia promised  in the first place then and this is the hardest thing to consent to you must let me dispose of your husband at mr partingtons and as i presume it will be as difficult a point to get henry from you as you from henry it is necessary for me to go myself to the bury in the first instance that i may make partington confidential and then an object will not be wanting on which to found an invitation to the bury so pressing that henry shall not know well how to refuse and if he did partington is not the man to take a denial  heigho sighed olivia but i am sure it is to some good end  else at such a time as this  when  when  perhaps in a few months    you may be able to present us with an infant angelica or raphael lovely as that in your vision said john very tenderly i own matters run very untowardly just now  i could wish  in short not to deal in mysteries beyond the absolute necessity of preserving them  know that the project i am engaging in is to bring this at length consciencesmitten father to his children his children repeated olivia but in pitys name how are they to be found  be that my endeavor said john as burton assures me it would be at the hazard of life and reason to move the parent to the children we must try what can be done that the children may go to the parent but as henry has been so long kept out of these transactions the sudden appearance of poor charles stuart and the horrors that now hang over the living ruins of the abbey might be too much for my brothers tender heart to bear  john rose and rang the bell true george appeared my horses said john george disappeared in three days expect my return said john to olivia tell henry i give him leave to think what he likes he has rambled long enough it is now my turn to be a rover let him have his laugh for you olivia dear good olivia for you i promise i will rob you of your beloved henry but a few days i shall ask but ten from the day i steal him from you if in that space i succeed not in my efforts he shall be returned to you and if i should bring my points to bear the worst that can happen will be your giving an angelica or raphael to the world at partington bury instead of fitzorton castle what matters it where a cherub is born my friend  george entering rapidly exclaimed the horse your honor john bade olivia adieu with a voice somewhat obstructed for she had been heaping blessings upon him and his undertaking called him by the endearing names truly indeed applied of guide philosopher and friend and sealed her wish for his health long life and long happiness with a pressure of the hand that thrilled every fiber of his struggling heart  chapter xxiii a considerable time has elapsed since any mention has been made of the fugitive part of the abbey family and yet we feel that olivia or even henry fitzorton cannot upon principles of general good will wish more to hear of their welfare than such of our readers as have hearts to follow the fortunes of persecuted virtue  on our bidding them a melancholy adieu indeed we prepared such readers for a long absence but the party was formed of too many oppressed and interesting beings to leave the sympathizing mind ultimately without a wish that in the course of the history they might be heard of again the hints which were thrown out in the last chapter however veiled cannot have failed to reanimate that hope for the reader is aware that john fitzorton was not a man to raise expectation without endeavoring to gratify it nor to sport in romantic visions or fold himself up in mysterious enterprise unless for some important end alike rational and honorable  although olivia had no suspicion that her brotherinlaw was in the secret of the residence of those wanderers which her search could never find our readers who are in the possession of more family secrets even than olivia have not a doubt but to him they shall look for intelligence on this subject  in truth father arthurs little society from almost their first movements to their final establishment had been governed by john fitzorton  soon after the departure of the good charles and caroline stuart from the polluted abbey john met them on the way when introducing mrs herbert and the young johanna he thus addressed caroline youth and age now offer themselves to your notice they have many years been under my immediate protection i am now ambitious to place them under yours the itinerant situation of a soldier has often made the trust difficult to me but after much search i have found a pleasant asylum for them where it is my wish johanna should pass another year or two of retreat under the care of mrs herbert before she steps into the world the recess i have chosen appears formed for an instructive and virtuous yet social solitude but it is on too large a scale for two females and i have been puzzling how to bring the abode and establishment within compass the providence which gave to my protection these two persons in the first instance now seems to direct in the second that i should transfer part of those pleasing cares upon you and yours because i judge they may mitigate your own while they alleviate mine i had thoughts of placing them with some of the dearest parts of my own family at the castle but those ideas on after reflection have been abandoned what say you then my friends will you receive two more unfortunates into your party and in a flowery unobserved recess make a little world of good beings driven unjustly by a female fiend out of one paradise will you my worthy exiles suffer female innocents to conduct you to another  johannas unsullied looks and mrs herberts engaging deportment and the knowledge of johns recommendation spoke the assent of caroline who embraced both the ladies arthur and dennison smiled a welcome  i have but one fear said caroline pressing the hands of johanna and mrs herbert  is it quite fair  is it not indeed cruel for us to carry our sorrowing hearts into a residence your virtue has prepared for the happy or even if we were inclined to this selfishness might not yet more troubled spirits detect our privacy and again expel us from elysium  and if they did said johanna we should not be expelled from one another and methinks in this social retirement aided by the counsels of my honored guardian so he has now permitted me to call him we could not be unprotected or unhappy in any part of the earth  they are my children from this moment and for ever exclaimed arthur  and the ever dear friends of caroline and charles said the afflicted brother and sister  and long may they live as the honored ladies of a feeble but i hope faithful old servant ejaculated dennison  and floresco sal be their slave and sal get strong great big man to workey till him is older as mr dennisons exclaimed the little indian leaping as he spoke  respecting monasteries and remote continental excursions resumed john curiosity is more at work in these than nearer home and i pledge myself that the sequestered spot which i have fixed on though not more than two or three days travel from hence shall baffle enquiry and effectually screen you from every wicked obtrusion so long as may be necessary  johns scheme was adopted and after adjusting military business at quarters he gave some comfortable finishings to his benevolent plan and returned to father arthurs party whom with an adroitness peculiar to all his designs when once settled he conducted to their new abode in the romantic island of guernsey there having staid to see that no accommodations were wanting which his power might supply he pressed alternatively the hands of each individual of the groupe and returned to the castle  in john fitzortons recess then the abbey party remained not only during the whole period of henry and olivias continental excursions without an idea entering into the mind of either that charles or caroline stuart were under his guardianship although in one of their tours the travelers had passed almost within view of the leafy retreat which concealed them  their social solitude was eventful to some of its members in johannas gentleness and improvements and in mrs herberts assiduous good offices caroline found some balm  the balm of friendship  for the deep wounds of her disappointed heart charles found yet more the laws of romance are so frequently at war not only in the writers book but in the readers mind with the laws of nature that we fear some will think the character of this young hero much degenerated when we observe that he found his fate extremely softened by the society of the interesting johanna the laws of truth however demand the information and the object was well calculated to lighten the burdens of the wretched  the party indeed all lived in the most perfect immaculacy of minds and manners each contributing a due share to the stock of general accommodation imperceptibly soothed the past reconciled the present and frowned not on the future the patriarchal goodness of arthur the approved honesty of dennison the experienced wisdom of mrs herbert the touching simplicity of the little indian and the charms of johanna with the patronage of john who paid by stealth an annual visit were all called into action while charles and caroline were happily amused by these their friends or strengthened by private communication the virtue of each other and thus the time passed on if not without trouble free from those paroxysms of despair which would have embittered a state destitute of such social resources and in order to give permanent tranquillity to the establishment which john had thus generously formed the house was taken in the maiden name of mrs herbert retiring with her family on a plan of economy so exact that country visitings and the insipid formalities which connect therewith were all excluded and here they might have continued unexplored undisturbed even till their graves formed part of the flowers that bloomed about their residence  nor was the prime contriver and conductor of this social sequestration without some rich consolements  alas none more wanted consolation selfbanished from the sight of her his soul adored even while he was perpetually invited to remain where he might both see and hear the object of that adoration john fitzorton had proved that nothing but the most vigorous exercise of a determined mind forcing itself into deeds that must at least divide the thoughts could prevent an indulgence which would mingle shame with sorrow a combination which he of all human beings was the least able to endure  all i have for it said he on leaving the castle whether in peace or war at home or abroad is occupation the merest trifle whereon this can be formed is better than that solitary indolence of the soul or what is yet worse that ruinous activity of the passions which with the sharpness of unavoidable misfortune blends the turpitude of voluntary guilt  reflections like these were revolving in his mind when the departure of the deserving children of a worthless father and of an infamous stepmother was reported to him he caught at it as one of the occasions wanting to his own virtue and resolved to make it serviceable the good literally wanted a local habitation and a name he supplied them with both they stood in need of those social aids which the innocently wretched derive from communion with the worthy such communion could john afford he could enrich the groupe by two beings whom he knew to deserve father arthurs association many things met together to render this arrangement no less agreeable to the objects of his protection than to those whom their more recent misfortune had recommended to him  the blooming daughter of the illfated maria and the hapless widow of a no less illfated gentleman had been long remaining at the village where the faithless mother of johanna had been buried but the frequent visits of john had been marked by curiosity and misrepresented by malice and a certain mystery in the fortunes both of mrs herbert and of johanna seemed to give color to suspicion who not being able to move the cloud drew upon john some reflections and upon the objects of his protection yet more  so far as this trumpery respects myself said john i should laugh it to scorn but the innocent beings i have beckoned from the storm one of whom alas i have widowed must be no less defended in their fame than in their fortunes the flight of caroline is an opportunity not to be slighted i will endeavor to profit of it so as to serve mutually the protectors and the protected when i promised the helpless johanna at the foot of her mothers grave that she should not want a parent it was a promise to stand beyond the date of my life and to the extent of hers and poor herberts relict is the deathbed legacy of a murdered friend  chapter xxiv we feel that it would be cruelty to proceed in the history of the absentees without accounting to our readers for the expression which closed the last chapter and for another yet more strange in the same page viz that john fitzorton had been the cause of widowhood to an innocent being and that herbert was the legacy of a murdered friend john was himself the murderer  a charge which we will settle in the words of mrs herbert who one day after much solicitation gratified her sequestered friends with a summary account of this fatal circumstance it is the only subject on which i trust i need be solicited observed the widow for wherefore should i grieve those whom i love  colonel herbert was at once my guardian my lover and my husband he had honor in the professional part of his character and truth tenderness and worth in every other but his nature was precipitate and who in haste is prudent he commanded a regiment when john fitzorton  to relieve an uneasy mind  droop not my johanna  first assumed the sword but the mind of mr fitzorton whether happy or in distress owned no superior my dear herbert felt the high pretensions of the youth and admitted him of equal rank in the dignity of sense and virtue the colonel and ensign were therefore bosomfriends the man of forty and the stripling of eighteen were inseparable companions but once in an evil hour my herbert yielding on some trifling occasion to sudden anger  the sole error of his noble nature  taxed his young companion with having mistated a fact  a mistater of facts said the ensign is a liar  construe as you may boy said the colonel you have mistated a fact and if that forms a liar you may apply it  the man who dares to tell me so retorted the ensign shall wash away the stain either with his blood or with mine  in one moment their swords were drawn in the next the blade of the ensigns broke in the tenderest of human hearts but even as life was flowing from it a person who had been expected came into the room to confirm the truth of what the ensign had asserted my poor herbert sensible of his error instantly made voluntary oath before that person of his having provoked the ensign beyond the bearing of an officer or a man  i was sent for but alas entered the room only to receive the last farewell  amelia said the expiring herbert yours is the hardest lot my friend must be acquitted with honor eternal coward must have stuck to his name had he tamely borne my rash reproaches  but what is to become of my wife  all your own fortune went by your own desire to relieve part of our families  mine was that of a soldier and depended on my life  and yet i have rashly lived as if i never were to die alas amelia i fear when the honest claims upon me are settled and my body put into a decent grave you will have reason to curse the hour you gave your hand to an improvident man whose profusion has been as unbounded as his love  oh i shall bless it ever as the happiest and most honored moment of my existence said i  wretch that i am exclaimed the ensign let the curse be directed to me who have impoverished the wife and murdered the husband  fitzorton said the unfortunate herbert alternately pressing my hand and that of the ensign to his quivering lips  it was unavoidable befriend my widow  the pang that took him out of the world immediately followed the ensign dropping on his knees swore he should instantly deliver himself up to justice but if acquitted would make all the miserable reparation in his power  and o my friends if it were permitted me to tell you with what sanctity he has kept his oath and how in my sickness my sorrow my almost insanity he has saved my reason my life and labored the good of my remotest relatives as well as those of my husband  and if you could hear even still how often he bemoans the inevitable wound which inexorable honor imposed you would if it could be possible honor him yet more  that is not possible exclaimed the overwhelmed johanna  every body admitted this yet every body tenderly pitied mrs herbert floresco wished he had been killed instead of the colonel blessed be my husband and blessed be john fitzorton said the bereaved amelia god orders it is ours to obey  she wept and bowed her head  chapter xxv justified by the inexorable laws of honor which not the firm philosopher may scorn acquitted likewise by the laws of the land the author of colonel herberts death was still found guilty before that tribunal at which he tried with almost unexampled severity every action of his life dire and calamitous event would he often exclaim as he surveyed her whom he had widowed and yet if the husband i have robbed you of had possessed a thousand lives i must have been condemned to hazard a similar murder upon each had the offense been repeated a thousand times so imperious alas are the compacts of social men we may deplore but dare not violate them  unhappy john yet the angel which blushed at the death of herbert smiled on thy adoption of the orphan johanna and of thy protection of the mourning amelia nor shall thy generous solicitude for the honor and happiness of olivia  innocent cause of many a bitter pang to thee  be forgotten where those good works which glorify the father are treasured up and had in remembrance  in truth the care of mrs herbert and of johanna of charles and caroline stuart of henry and olivia fitzorton and the unwearied attention he paid to their several necessities were the grand remedies which john made use of to mitigate the various incurable ills which afflicted his mind they were not only as the cloudy pillar to conceal even from himself the darkness of his fate but the pillar of fire to give him at once light and strength in the way that he should go even as if a heavenlyguide had gone before him  we are indeed firmly persuaded that could those who are under heavy afflictions from whatever cause but especially from a strife of the passions imitate john fitzorton in their adversity they would gain a temporary refuge from themselves and the return to their own state would be softened by the consciousness that the time of their trouble has been a period of comfort to those whom in the season of prosperity they might have neglected thus would their sympathy be repaid by the oblivion which the exercise of social virtue throws over selfish sorrow  inflexibly fixed to his point neither the sorrows of henry nor even the anxious wishes of olivia to explore the haunts of his fugitives could prevail with john fitzorton to share a secret on the sanctity of which he believed was founded not only the repose of his relatives at the castle but of all the other objects of his care indeed a case of the last necessity only could have tempted him to draw any of the associated company from their peaceful retreat the one which now presented itself he deemed to be of that kind the unequivocal contrition of sir guise stuart was he thought a grand operation of conscience on the soul of man he marked it as an important instance of the power of that wonderworking providence which can bring the most hardened hypocrite to repentance break down all the apparently strong holds of prosperous vice and convert the very shame and ruin of the guilty to the raising up of the innocent and detestable as the very name of sir guise stuart had been to john fitzorton even from his boyish days  dupe of his dissimulations as he had himself been he now felt for him a sentiment of compassion and a wish to save his life for the purposes of more complete reformation and to deny his children the honest joy of becoming instrumental in that good work he thought would be to withold from them the rights of nature and the rewards of virtue  while he was on his way to the bury he put into train a variety of important measures as a preliminary to which he rested at an inn on the road and wrote as follows to true george the bearer will conduct you to john fitzorton and while the messenger was gone he employed himself in preparing letters to the parties concerned  to charles stuart conscience wrings your fathers soul he is become a terrible example of parental guilt it is for you to show yourself one of filial piety follow the enclosed instructions whithersoever they conduct you george will assist your father must needs be in a fit state for receiving the compassion of his children when he finds a mediator in  john fitzorton   in a separate billet to the same person he wrote associate in disappointment attend not the summons if yet an unruly sentiment remains in your bosom if your whole heart is not yet in the government of my johanna whom as a balm to your wounds i permitted you to cultivate but remember that i have no such balm to pour over my own wounds  remember too that you are now summoned to duties that enlarge your virtues o forbear to narrow them olivia remains the happiest of wives  our henry devotes himself to her and cannot be wretched yet warned by a knowledge of his soft disposition care will be taken to remove him from temptation you i hope are to be trusted if not let your sister come alone and bear away the honors which nature calls on you to share but i injure you in the doubt forgive my unkindness punish me by showing how much my fears have wronged you perhaps i have argued on a consciousness of my own weakness  come then my friend and give me strength  when george arrived john exclaimed my opinion of your honesty is included in my confidence i entrust you with the delivery of this packet to charles and caroline stuart whose secret abode you will see marked on the superscription you are a youth of action and i need not exhaust more time in words i shall tell henry i have employed you the faithful george answered by an energetick nod and followed his instructions  chapter xxvi nothing material for the reader to know happened to either of the travelers till they had reached the place of their respective destination the interview of colonel fitzorton with partington lasted several hours for it was by far the most arduous part in the plan of the former to convince the latter that any thing like penitence could proceed from the heart of sir guise stuart although john said and with some reason that if he was himself convinced in that point every other person might be depend upon it you insufferable scoundrel said the squire to john sir guise is still a most honorable gentleman and deserving every attention  bowing  the gallows can bestow and you are again deceived by appearances although you have taken it into your head to imagine that he is a good for nothing scoundrel who means what he says at length however the colonel painted the forlorn condition of the baronet so much to the heart of partington that he was brought to the crisis of the most abusive impatience and execrated le maitre for not putting some things into his portmanteau before the least mention had been made of a journey called the groom and postillions caitiffs of the first order for not coming round with the horses and carriage before any directions had been sent to the stables and helping himself to prepare what he thought necessary he in a manner forced refreshments down the throat of the colonel crowded some wine and fruit into the chaise and hurrying in john he desired the rascals would make the most haste they could to fitzorton castle ordering le maitre to send a servant with the colonels jaded horse when he had been as well taken care of as his atrocious master  on their arrival at the abbey partington seized upon henry after having expressed his joy at seeing him by a volley of kind scurrilities and then exclaimed you are all promisebreakers and caitiffs  men women and children  none of you having kept your word since your return from vagabondism to make me a visit at the bury i have given you credit for this debt too long already and now arrest the father and daughter in my own name and by virtue of my own supreme authority and when i think fit to release them will have the other two little villains so take a short leave of one another and to prison with you  egregious john said he will settle the rest and take heed that we are off by break of day  a few radishes mean while and to bed  henry had indeed been long in visiting arrears with the worthy partington for whom he continued to feel the most sincere respect and supposing that his friend had taken a journey to the castle purely to fetch him agreed to become his captive and to be led to the bury in the chains of friendship and gained the consent of his wife to suffer little caroline to be his companion to which on some previous hints from the colonel she acceded partington who conducted every project with all the ferment of his disposition hardly suffered the dawn to show itself ere he aroused his culprits as he called them declaring that if they had not had their nap out it might as well be finished in a chaise as in a bed without loss of time or hindrance of business  while partington was thus conveying away henry and his daughter his wife and son were the associates of john the first care of whom was to make olivia acquainted with part of the history of the abbey wanderers and with true georges embassy to them in their insulated recess she applauded the part of the plot which had been assigned to partington and declared that for the high delight which she trusted in heaven would in the end be offered to her henry in the sight of his bosom friend she would forego his dear society though it should continue for a whole week but alas there will be no time for preparations my dear colonel said she it is impossible that the abbey can so soon be fit to receive the lovely caroline could she not be here the sudden sight of her sick unhappy father even though endeared to her by returning virtue will be too severe a trial let us then contrive how best to render these hard tasks supportable  all that will be taken care of answered john  he now instructed her in some other particulars of georges mission and of the secluded party still suppressing the share he had himself taken in their happy sequestration  olivias generous heart bounded with benevolent expectation and under the influence of such blessed feelings she gave way to felicity that even called for the relief of tears  recollecting the adventure of carolines miniature her joys were however dashed by apprehensions and as john was about to leave the room she caught his hand and in a sympathising voice demanded whether his intrepid heart was armed to meet unmoved its most precious object for such ever since the discovery of the picture she had supposed miss stuart pardon me my dear good friend said she in yet more consoling accents for adverting to a circumstance which my selfish transports had before absorbed which i had indeed pledged myself no more to renew but how can any of us be happy if there exists any circumstance whereby you are made wretched for although perhaps you may nobly labor to conceal the cause i who am you know in your hearts secret    i perceive answered john you have settled matters your own way and so i here take off the embargo i had laid on this subject for whatever i might assert concerning it would probably be useless admitting the point alluded to possible though observe i by no means own it methinks were it for the good of an object beloved i could at least i hope i could live in the daily hourly sight of her and not discover  a  a sentiment  which might if known involve her in unavailing sorrow or interrupt the performance of her domestic duties the task to be sure would be difficult  but  surely    the broken sentences and disjointed articulation which embarrassed johns speech while the very object of such a sentiment was before his eyes and the case actually his own was naturally enough construed by olivia together with the release from her promise into the effort of a noble mind struggling with a strong but inhibited passion and hereupon feeling a real pity for the sufferer she exerted every gentle power of a sincere and tender friendship to sooth him she tried to cheer him with the hope of happier times and at once applauded and honored his conduct in the mean while  these soothings however increased johns emotions to a degree that after various conflicts with himself and sometimes driven almost into a declaration that caroline had never approached his heart he suffered the idea to proceed and had in a manner but from the worthiest motive encouraged it but on olivias proceeding also in what she thought consolations  offering to his disappointed feelings every balm that tender amity could devise  he became nearly suffocated with the repression of his real sensations and was at length obliged to break away from her generous endearments while she on the other hand considered his emotions as another resistless proof of his love for caroline and therefore looked upon him almost as great an object of her sympathy as he really was and in this mutual contention it was alike difficult for both to nurse their agitated minds into composure  but in a few hours after john had turned to so much advantage one of his mindrestoring seclusions that as the last notice for dinner was sounded olivia observed him from her dressing room window walking on the terrace where he was soon after joined by his little nephew and namesake who was not more near than dear to him and whom he caught up in his arms in which the youth playfully struggling a sort of loving strife ensued this soon grew into a pitched battle for the uncle going by retrograde steps from the gravel path to the green swerd the nephew considered him as a retreating foe and the uncle giving into the fancy suffered himself to be overtaken but though he put himself into a posture of defense he contrived to fall on receiving the first sportive blow he then acknowledged himself completely vanquished to the inexpressible delight of the little conqueror  olivia beheld this amicable contention and trifling as it was in itself she felt it to be full of importance as it tended to restore her noble brother and friend to his wonted tranquillity availing herself of the auspicious moment she hastily finished her dress and descending into the garden joined the combatants even while john the great was yet stretched on the ground and john the little was proudly standing over him  o fie for shame exclaimed olivia what generous victor ever triumphed over the fallen  and a poor unarmed man too added the uncle  the nephew seemed to feel the rebuke in every fiber of his little frame he blushed  held out both his hands  endeavored to raise the captive  begging his mothers assistance and when they had mutually succeeded  the captive lending his secret endeavor at the same time  the conqueror assured his mother it was all makebelieve  but for all that said he if you had but seen how my uncle wanted to get the better of me and when he found he could not  how he tried to pull me down after him  you would have said that is right johnny now you have him make the best of him  this sally carried the frolic to its due point john took his nephews hand and kissed it in token of his looking on him as a generous foe and then expressed his obligation to olivia for coming to see fair play  thus the party formed at dinner a much more agreeable and harmonious trio than the discordant notes which had been heard at breakfast seemed to promise  chapter xxvii resuming his benevolent employments for others john again obliviated himself there were various points in bringing his plan to perfection yet to be gained the utmost circumspection was necessary to apprize the characters of the drama he was conducting what each had to perform lest a misunderstanding in the parts should confuse the whole and to this end a kind of general private rehearsal of the piece was requisite his sagacious and active mind pondered on these matters and he prepared without imprudent delay to take the executive direction  the abbey emigrants meanwhile yielding obedience to the summons of john under the sanction of father arthur in due time reached their first projected pausing place viz the apartments of colonel fitzorton in london where they were most dutifully received by their old servants the irwins a circumstance which found its way to the hearts of their master and mistress and the reciprocated gratulations on this occasion shaded as they were with many sad remembrances is more readily to be felt than described  but carolines anxiety respecting her father broke through all obstructions and she soon began to overwhelm robert and his wife and daughter with interrogatories from the pressure of which guarded as they were by a previous lesson of caution they would have found it impossible to escape without discovery of more than was then mature for communication had not the colonel made his appearance in time to reenforce their almost exhausted evasions for true george had no sooner seen them safely escorted to the metropolis than he set off with the news of their arrival to fitzorton and these tidings being imparted almost with equal speed by john to olivia the former hasted instantly to the apothecary in the possible chance of sir guise being sufficiently recovered to be conveyed to his children as there are said the colonel numberless good reasons why it would be more desirable to have the interview in london than in the country and indeed any where rather than at the abbey or the castle in which hope i have landed my groupe near the metropolis rather than the coast of devonshire  but every ray of such a hope was extinguished by the account which burton gave of the baronets condition alas sighed the good man the very fiends might commiserate him his voice seems no longer of use but to groan nor his eyes but to weep  your own eyes your own voice said john too strongly prove the state you describe hasten then to him give him hope that his children may be found  but proceed with caution while i endeavor to forward their interview which must be at the abbey i find after all heaven will dispose the event  returning to olivia he said i have scarcely a moment to bid you farewell  perhaps the life or death of our soulgoaded charge depends on my speedy journey to london and as speedy return  as for you my poor fellow said he to george who appeared to the sound of the bell if you wish to see a sinful man in whose return to virtue you have been instrumental receive pardon from the children he has wronged before he dies you must enable me to begin my journey by taking care my postchaise is at the door in half an hour but as it may seem hard to hurry you away again so soon you may let any of the other servants attend me or indeed i can do very well with the driver and you can follow when able  within the space limited however short as it was the assiduous lover of jane unwearied in good offices obeyed his orders in regard to the chaise and had equipped himself with a clean shirt and boots to attend it allowing himself only time to look in upon his jane  to assure her he was alive that he loved her and that although he was to be sure going out again on mr col sir johns business he would think of her all the way going and coming till god willing he might sit down and rest  the space between the castle and place of rendezvous being in a manner barren ground we shall pass to the latter and represent as fatisfactorily ae we are able the meeting of john fitzorton and his friends it had even more of interest for his heart than he expected for mrs herbert and johanna were of the party the moment he entered johanna was at the feet of her second father whose honored hand she impressed with many a kiss and bathed with many a tear  caroline would have followed her example but that she was prevented by the impetuous emotions of charles who insisted on his sharing the embraces of their guardian friend father arthur would have bent that knee which had hitherto bowed only to god had not the extravagant wildness of joy that suddenly seized floresco at beholding the man of whom he had constantly heard so much divided his attention while mrs herbert testified her sensations even as the colonel manifested his own by an eloquent silence that spoke the language of the soul  be not surprised sir said caroline who first found a voice at seeing almost the whole family we were twined together too fondly for separation it was with difficulty we prevailed on the aged dennison to remain at the recess each asserting an equal right to show their duty and their love  not equally said johanna ardently as john raised her to his arms  not equally mine surpasses every other claim  ah can it exceed that of charles and his sister said caroline who are to owe to him a renewed father  o generous generous friend where is he  what is his present state  forgive forgive our impatience  does he live  is there a hope  dare we tell our terrified yet delighted hearts   tell them every thing answered the colonel that filial love corrected by devotion should most desire  if your father recovers he will live i trust to virtue and if he dies his penitence though short and late will be carried by the angel of truth to the throne of mercy i revere your eagerness sweet maid too much to check it  our friend george whose heart is in our concerns and who i have therefore admitted into our confidence will now follow such instructions as he received on the road and trusting that you will place yourselves with father arthurs permission under my government i dare to promise you shall hear the penitent sighs and feel the conscious tears of sir guise stuart ere it be long dear and subtle as has been his hypocrisy the hour of truth is come  follow him in all things my children exclaimed arthur  the brother and sister promised the most implicit obedience the indian who had sometimes on tiptoestep advanced close to him to devour up every word and sometimes retreated at aweful distance now hastily approached and passed his trembling hand along the arm of john as if to see whether he was indeed mortal  johanna could not restrain her frequent homage  mrs herbert kissed the hand which had made her a mourning widow  and true george had vanished like lightning at the first hint of his master wishing with all his soul that instead of affixing harness to the horses he could have hung wings  previous however to their departure the colonel held a conference with mrs irwin and patty may i depend said john that robert has strictly observed my directions in regard to what was to be done at the abbey and how the business was to be conducted i know he received my orders but did he understand them  i am sure said patty curtseying my dear father will do every thing just as your honor ordered him for tears were in his poor eyes at the thoughts of doing any thing again to serve his good young master and mistress  john returned well pleased to his associates  true george soon came to announce the carriages at the door and when john had filled them as he thought proper the journey began  chapter xxviii have you taught our johanna questioned the colonel amongst other good things mrs herbert the important duty of placing any thing trusted in the most sacred foldings of her heart  have you strengthened her mind to reject a confidence while it can be refused  to receive it with regret even when it cannot be withheld  to retain it with unbetraying sanctity when it has been received  as mrs herbert was about to reply john perused the countenance of johanna and then continued his discourse  although i am not in the habit of reading human hearts through human faces nor in truth of believing eyes or lips either i will for once give credit to the honor that seems to mark the features of this young woman  your place of repose observed he must in the first instance be at the castle from which henry fitzorton is absent  our olivia will be prepared to receive you  indeed little preparation will be necessary her heart is the asylum of ready hospitality  besides ye are not altogether strangers to one another and her guests will be her friends but should any of our fellowtravellers either in the spirit of friendship or folly have imparted to you johanna any family secrets of which you may imagine the knowledge might too much affect or interest olivia i expect you will give me an instance of your discretion by guarding them in your own bosom  does my face still answer for me my reverend protector or must i use another language  i am satisfied with its reply said john and though i have never taken any man or any womans affirmation on such trust since  here john stopped sighed and with tears in his eyes left a chasm in his sentence  to be filled by every reader with the name of johannas mother  yes resumed john i am as perfectly satisfied dear girl as if you had sworn a thousand oaths  as if i had tried your fidelity by the test of a thousand years your charge continued he addressing mrs herbert is grown very lovely  i am of opinion too with charles stuart that her beauty resembles that of our olivia  possibly the lieutenant may have mentioned this  yes i perceive he has  as john threw a scrutinizing look on johanna her responsive features gave in an evidence so rosy that he exclaimed  for once i have been a true physiognomist  unless perfectly convenient johanna to your feelings it will henceforth be perfectly unnecessary to answer by words any question i may put to you  they would be mere repetitions  so the lieutenant has often told her said mrs herbert  has he questioned john well then no more need be said about it  john perceived the crimson accumulate in the cheeks of johanna and relieving her by observing that he considered the lieutenant to be at least as good a physiognomist as himself changed the subject  the residue of the journey was undistinguished by further matters requisite to its history till they came to the last stage at a town about fifteen miles from fitzorton  here john proposed a change of companions taking charles stuart in the place of mrs herbert and johanna with whom he had before associated himself george was now sent forward with a letter to olivia announcing her new guests  and while the horses were changing at the door a wagon stopped and the company soon ascertained the waggoner to be robert irwin  if you are come from the abbey tell us exclaimed caroline how you left my father  in as fair a way my lady as he can go  blessed be god  yes blessed be god indeed for none but he could have put him there  i know that by myself my lady  put him where robert  why in a fair way of recovery  yes miss of recovering his soul and mayhap his body also though he does not seem much to care now what becomes of that so as it will serve to hold his soul in it till he sees your honors  have you seen him then  o yes blessed be god for that too i would not but have seen him for all the worth of the abbey he knew me at sight took me by the hand and then asked my pardon so then i asked his and he said i had done his soul good and i told him he had done mine full as much so we thanked one another and if mr burton had not been in a hurry to get me away with this bit of a letter to the colonel sir john i should have talked longer with his honor  you have talked too long said the coloned who had been some time in fear of roberts loquacity  thank heaven the horses are ready exclaimed caroline handing johanna and mrs herbert into one of the chaises and hurrying the rest seeing john however open the letter she paused while ascending the carriage to cast an enquiring look on the colonel  it is from a friend of sir guise said john in reply to the look from indeed every bodys friend  our good apothecary who writes that all is as well as can be expected  the travelers a good deal relieved pursued their journey  when the colonel and the lieutenant were shut up together the former spoke as follows your forming one of the party is a sufficient reply to the improper doubts of my letter yet the frequent sight of an object of which our frail nature is in danger and yet whom a complicated duty places in our view is a task which your virtue has been spared my friend but some persons who have endured absence with philosophy have found every energy melt away on a return to the object which had before enthralled them if you apprehend this may be your case as much caution should be observed to prevent an interview between you and olivia as there has been taken to hinder the meeting of henry and caroline and so environed indeed is the path we are all going that could i have brought your repentant and perhaps dying parent to his children i would have appointed the interview at the distance of the poles rather than on the spot to which we are hastening let not however the necessity i am under of thus leading you into temptation be augmented by your own indiscretion the abbey is sufficiently separated from the castle to stand betwixt your weakness and your strength if any of the former remains and when your duty is fulfilled at the one the honors you have thereby acquired may be preserved untarnished by returning to your recess or to more active scenes which in truth you have but too much and too long neglected we err as fatally my friend from having too proud as too humble an opinion of our virtues and from too great as too little confidence in ourselves  if replied the lieutenant i have to boast of any strength on this occasion it is not my own  and did i not fear you would accuse me of inconstance i could satisfy you that although i am now moving on trembling ground i advance with nerves that can no longer shake with a heart that no longer palpitates  but second impressions are deemed so slight so faithless even by the romantic    by the romantic they may interposed john fitzorton yet those who are at all conversant with the powers of circumstance of time and chance operating on humanity will pronounce the possibility at least of second impressions taking firm root in a steady heart nay of their being more cogent than the first and although this may trample on the laws which romance has imposed on caricatureloving fancy it is within the boundary of nature  charles acknowledged that he felt relieved on a subject he had not dared to open  you should not only have dared to disclose but have sent both your friends at the castle the earliest confidential accounts of it and correct and did i not enter into the motives of your suppression imputing them to a sincere yet false pity for henry and myself i should assert you had used us most unkindly since to withold a good example is to withold often the means of virtue and yet possibly it might have been lost on us for there is no making human beings reach or attempt to reach similar ends by similar means i have endeavored with unceasing diligence to wean my affections and have been elaborating a lovers cares for every thing i saw that deserved attention from the glowworm at my feet to the lark at the extent of my vision  and to divide my heart amongst all the gradations of intermediate beings till i could absorb the one which had so long annihilated the rest but finding that all other parts of nature had less congenial magic for my heart than the attractive particles that constituted that one i could at best only take care that the feveral objects on whom i employed myself were the better and thus were our separate consessions made known to the world both our characters would fade in the page of romance yet without appealing my friend either to writers or readers let us do justice to ourselves it pleased heaven to set in the eye of your constant remark an object sufficiently beautiful and good to draw you imperceptibly to itself and though i have not had the same advantage the heaven by which you have been favored has so far extended its bounty to me that if i continue to think more highly perhaps more tenderly of olivia than of any other woman it is tenderness i have directed every way to her honor and happiness and although i admit this furnishes no instance of victorious energy it offers to a heart beset by temptations from which it could not escape the only innocent mode of consolation and o forgive me sacred source of my life if in this despairing hour  after many a year of unavailing effort  forgive me spirit of my father if i observe but with fond remembrance of all thy virtues that the still agonized hearts of thy children supply to parents a lesson of aweful caution  with regard to myself observed the lieutenant all merit is precluded by the very circumstances which have enabled me to transfer an unfortunate to a happy choice the steady example of my dearest sister who without affecting to have gained a sudden or easy conquest over herself preserved a silence which in my presence was seldom broken even by a sigh her patient submission to destroying languors which have as you must have noticed invaded her frame   i observed it said the colonel  the care she took to extend an example not of obdurate philosophy nor yet of hypocritical indifference but of chaste resignation her unfeigned regrets and prayers for her father while she knew him unworthy of the name  this my dear colonel in the first instance endued me with a patience greater than my own thus from a female and one of the tenderest of her sex has a soldier learned to suffer the sweet johanna meanwhile at once kept alive while she was imperceptibly subduing an unfortunate passion nature had given to her features a similitude which    but interposed john strongly unless it should turn out that you can love johanna for herself independent on all comparison she never must be yours for i must not have her secondary in her husbands eyes even to olivia  secondary ah she is the first and dearest to my soul  perhaps however answered john it may be as well after all that mrs fitzorton and you should meet for let romancers say what they will i have seen many instances and experienced one where a second love has effaced improved and obliviated the first i have likewise known both men and women imagine themselves in love much oftener than they are and johanna must never condescend to become a substitute neither am i yet sufficiently acquainted with the particulars of the passion to sanction it but i love you both  the lieutenant bowing gratefully turned the discourse by making enquiries as to the state of his friend henrys affections which i cannot but hope said he are as completely transferred to olivia as are mine to my dearest johanna  his conduct is meritorious answered the colonel but it will be best to keep him from unnecessary trials  and therefore when the fate of your father is determined which to deal heartily with you i think an almost immediate event the return of your whole party either to your former recess or to some other must by no means be retarded for you indeed charles whatever may be the issue of your wishes toward an alliance with johanna i think a more active scene might be adopted alas my friend both you and our henry have been too long idle  in that respect my plan under at least an equal difficulty has been better contrived i have found or made time for the performance of official duties of very different kinds and though alas i performed them often amidst the wailings of humanity and the throbbings of my heart i determined they should be done and that they should contribute to my private relief while they effected i trust some public good but charles stuart is still a subaltern and henry fitzorton carries about a mind which by long habit of indulged softness is unfitted for exertion and instead of being eminent as a divine and celebrated as a poet his noblest effusions even in his occasional attempts to preserve the character of the latter sink to a querulous elegy that moans his own disappointments or dwindles to a sonnet that veils in an address to delia or cleone his inextinguishable passion for the real though involuntary object of his heart  i thought said the lieutenant you had pronounced his conduct meritorious  as a husband as a father he is irreproachable but as a man he has no character at all it has evaporated in sighs and tears i too have sighed i too have wept but i have not forgotten that i had engaged in public employments  alas answered charles my henry is not by nature endued with the strength of john  and what replied the colonel is johns strength rather say that he has taken a less perilous mode of nursing his weakness perhaps my friend we are all equally wrong to have felt any weakness at all and as passion wounded us reason should make us whole but the best efforts do not always measure to duty  rather let us utter a prayer that    the colonel was proceeding in these reflections when the postillion stopped the chaise to give notice he was within a mile of the place and while he was speaking true george came up to assure their honors that the lady olivia would be ready to receive all the worshipful good company  chapter xxix the gate which the colonel had marked as the first point of direction stood on the side of the road which all the party must necessarily pass and just as the chaises containing the ladies intended to be the castle guests were drawing up to it the midnight moon presented to view not only the castle itself but a much nearer prospect of its lovely mistress the fair hostess anxious to give to hospitality its most attractive grace had ventured through the dews of night near a quarter of a mile in complete oblivion of herself and attended only by the faithful jane to offer the warmest welcome of her bounteous heart  and difficult would it be to find words suitable to the short but interesting events which her courtesy produced every glass was in a moment let down  every door thrown open  every carriage was emptied  and every affectionate and grateful expression was given and received o that i had power to tell you exclaimed olivia how welcome you all  all are and how i envy myself the miserly joy of receiving you for the present alone my dear husband being as doubtless you have heard from home but i trust we shall have him amongst us soon and meet to part no more  while she uttered this address in a voice that mingled the music of an affectionate heart with every word she distributed her caressing hands to each of the party she said the kindest things to charles caroline she embraced many times  and although this was her fondest point of friendship neither johanna nor mrs herbert nor the good monk nor floresco had cause to be jealous of a preference and she earnestly desired that the castle might be honored by all present at least for that night  this is against all rules all plans all reason said john nay all promises and what is worse the fair promisebreaker has made it impossible to chide even though she is betraying us  ah forgive  forgive me my dear brother said olivia my emotions are too strong to be contained  whatever were the particular and appropriate sensations of each individual on this sudden rencounter there was no time for explaining them john hardly allowed opportunity for the exchange of general courtesies the meeting and separating were alike abrupt and under cover of this hurry in their movements and the shading of the moon light on their features the secrets of every heart were commodiously veiled  a short conversation now taking plaec a little farther in the park betwixt john and olivia the former wreathed the arms of mrs herbert and johanna within those of mrs fitzorton and desiring george and jane to take care of one another that division of the party went forward to the castle while johns party returned to their carriage and proceeded to the abbey  the urbanity of mrs fitzorton however was felt and acknowledged after which a profound silence prevailed broken only by an impatient wish from caroline that they had gained the end of their journey  agreeable to the colonels instructions the carriages stopped at a style that led through a coppice to that grand avenue already so eventful in this history and while john was charging the postboys to remain till the steward meaning true george returned that dispatchful youth came with almost winged speed to inform the colonel he had seen the ladies safe into the castle remain then with your horses said john to the postillions till this young man who must attend us gets back to you from the place to which we are going there is a possibility we all may return with you but whether we do or no i rely on your being found here till you hear from or see us again  the party now passed through the grove led by john fitzorton and followed by true george and they came into the avenue at the very spot where henry first betrayed his heart the abbey clock struck one in the morning and was almost immediately answered by that of fitzorton and the chapel house  as if an angel spoke they felt the solemn sound  arriving at the lodge that divided the park from the back garden over which as if to welcome by a light from heaven the angellike train returned the moon cast a ray so pure and clear that every object became distinct hereupon several sighs broke involuntarily from the party but in so mingled a sound that it would have been difficult to appropriate them arthur however as he passed the portal which george held open exclaimed blessed be our entrance into that wellknown mansion amen added the little floresco dropping on his knee and raising his arms charles and caroline were supported indeed almost carried by colonel fitzorton the brothers feet faultered at every step the sisters trembling limbs claimed the support which even the firm frame of john could ill bestow but the generous burton from his appointed station in the summer pavilion marked by many an indelible record hastened to their relief my patient is not yet dead exclaimed the worthy man willing to remove a fear which his precipitate appearance might occasion not yet exclaimed caroline then he is dying  and without waiting a reply she ran toward the house with a speed as if proceeding from a renovation of nature alas it was but the exertion of one of those moments in which it is sometimes permitted to the immortal soul to assert its independence over the mortal body and to mount with an energy sublime over every exhausted power of our common nature at the foot of the abbey door she was saved from falling in a manner lifeless on the edge of the marble steps only by the little indian whose ready humanity outflew that of his companions pray good dear lady forgive poor negro boy for hims boldness in touching you with black hand  but only till white massers come up the generous and timid youth resigned her to the arms of her brother and the colonel the instant they arrived true george softly opened the abbey door to follow his masters instructions and ran to summon those whom the colonel had appointed to receive the guests and when caroline recovered she observed in the persons of the females who had been busied in restoring her two of the servants who had conducted themselves most to her satisfaction both before and after the death of her mother  chapter xxx in vain however did these faithful adherents and the generous john fitzorton who had sought for and provided them  in vain did the tender charles and the pious arthur counsel our british daughter to take a few hours of repose before she had seen her father it was not without difficulty the good apothecary could prevail on her to go and see whether her visit might be proper  it must it must be proper cried she let us go my brother the sight of us must calm may perhaps restore him it may be even dangerous observed john perchance fatal added mr burton and went forward caroline turned even paler than before and remained in terrified suspense till the return of the apothecary who brought the comforting tidings that both himself and the nurse were in profound repose o conduct me to him exclaimed caroline catching the reporters hand  my steps my very breathing shall not be heard  for pitys sake let me see the state he is in and i will be satisfied  indeed i will  her appeals were not to be withstood  with the lightness of the air itself she no sooner received permission and understood where her father was reposing than she moved to the chamber the door of which being half open she reached the foot of the bed unperceived the day had been sultry and the curtains were undrawn  ye who have ever beheld the parent whom ye left in vigorous health of body though covered with crimes of the soul and to whom filial piety has brought you after sharp remorse has made that mind its victim and sickness has almost devoured that body ah recall the sensation of your hearts at the sight of a father under these circumstances  then will you have a just image of caroline on the first view of the deeplychanged sir guise stuart it is true that she saw him sleeping but she saw the wildness of despair entrenched in the untimely furrows of a face colorless and shrunk as death itself  she observed the symptoms of unquiet rest in the catch of the features and the starts of the whole frame his eyes too opened and closed abruptly but at length his countenance settling more regularly she went round to the side of the bed and bending over his pillow remained in that posture some moments  fearful of disturbing him and yet more afraid of the effects of a surprise should he awake and perceive her unprepared she trusted not the meltings of her pitying heart with a voice scarcely with a sigh  but after having for some time hung over him the tears which surcharged her eyes dropped on his pale cheek and following each other fast before she was conscious where they had fallen she was wiping them gently away when his eye half unfolded met those of his daughter  o god o god groaned he there then is one of them  but it cannot be she  no  those lips will never return my curse  ah no no exclaimed she dropping on her knees and folding her upraised hands  never never she is come to bless you  to crave your blessing  to nurse you into health  into felicity  into an assurance of eternal duty  eternal love  eternal happiness  and your son is come with her answered charles  john fitzorton father arthur and the little indian had stolen under the guidance of the apothecary unseen into the chamber  yes we are all come sir guise to bless you said the colonel because we hope and believe you continue to deserve it  and to intercede with the allmerciful to grant you his benediction also cried arthur kneeling at the foot of the bed  floresco imitated him in a remote corner of the apartment  george standing meanwhile at the door but wrapped in purest contemplation  the sick man labored to hold himself half raised while he stretched forth his hand and bowed his head to john fitzorton  saying eagerly but feebly  this under god is your work sir i  i  i thank you you are just come in time my children to see the death alas of a sinner but of a penitent  yet of that death the allmerciful is not desirous said arthur  and if you will try to compose yourself sir said burton your children and friends after a weary journey will rest themselves also and when i assure both them and you sir that this is necessary to your life and their happiness all parties will surely submit to my direction  sir guise unable to speak from the fullness of sensation bowed assent to whatever should be thought proper then laid his head on the pillow but kept his eyes in a fixed gaze on his children  on a whispered promise from the apothecary to be again admitted when her father was refreshed and to be summoned if any thing should happen caroline was prevailed on to leave the room with the rest of her friends and afterward being indeed worn down with fatigues both of mind and body and understanding the rest were properly accommodated she suffered herself to be conducted to her sleepingroom by the other female attendant arthur went to the good apothecarys accompanied by his indian and the lieutenant though he had hitherto deported himself with the utmost decorum seemed doubtful whether he should go to the various claims which attracted him at the castle or listen only to the single duty that fastened upon him at the abbey john left him to his own election you will say every thing most good most dear for me colonel sighed he after a short pause where you are going i feel that i ought to remain here for the night i believe you are right cried john it is already near the day all i hope are at rest in the castle and to tell you the truth my friend my thoughts and feelings have been so long upon the stretch that i shall be glad of a little sleep too you see matters have turned out so that it would be a heartbreaking effort to drag your sister from her father so soon though we leave him so much better than might be expected we must give up therefore the idea of returning to town with the chaises  george must go round and dispose them late as it is at fitzorton but with proper cautions and in the course of tomorrow or more correctly speaking of today let us hope all the good proposed by my long and your yet longer journey may be accomplished we may then get back to london without hazard of curiosity carrying our adventure at least in a suspicious shape to my brother henry  lieutenant farewell  charles and the colonel shook hands and the latter with the everactive george took their circuitous route to the castle  george had not uttered a single word during the sacred interview of the father and children although he had wept and smiled kneeled down and leapt up according as grief or joy reverence or activity operated on his impressive nature finding himself now only with the colonel or perhaps forgetting a moment that he was so an exclamation burst from him which induced john to ask him what was the matter why i was thinking your honor that if poor sir guise went on every day getting a little better and better all ways he would be good enough in time for one that he has used the worst though she is one of the best to see him too and beg of god to bless him before he dies as well as the rest she will forgive him i am sure lord help us your honor so little while as we be in this world and so long in another that is to say for everlasting none but a fool one would think would be wicked and yet for my part it seems to me that the more sensible the more sinful lord help us saving your honors presence we are all of us a pack of poor little things  the colonel took georges arm and put it within his own and notwithstanding the timid reluctance of janes lover who would reverentially have withdrawn it john walked in that endearing way till he came to the postillions both of whom were shut up fast asleep in their chaises while the horses silently followed their drivers example as to napping with their heads nodding and noses bent almost to the ground only one of them was cropping twigs from the green hedge near which they had drawn up  familiar however to every sudden summons they were easily aroused  george had brought out of pure good nature both man and beast some refreshments from stable and pantry on his return from escorting the ladies and whispering that a second part of the same tune now awaited them at the castle they were not only awake but on their horses in an instant the colonel crossed the corner of the park on foot leaving the postboys to the discretion of george and when he heard from the servant who sat up for him that the ladies were but just gone to their rooms he tapt at olivias chamber door in passing to his own simply to say all is well and went into his apartment  we are all visible cried olivia opening her door and tripping into the gallery that parted off the chambers  do pray tell us how you found poor sir guise exclaimed mrs herbert following olivias example  and how sweet caroline our caroline dear john how did she bear the meeting continued mrs fitzorton  and how did my honored patron leave the  the  the lieutenant sighed johanna  but perhaps he is come that is perhaps   all well repeated john from his citadel and then drew another bolt across his door  i suppose you know ladies that shuts out all further arguments said olivia playfully we shall not get another word from him tonight though we were to die for it  so as alls well we must be contented  they wished john cordially a good night notwithstanding his neglect of minute gallantry and embracing each other returned to their chambers  chapter xxxi the morning greetings however atoned for the deficiencies of the farewell negative the colonel joined them at early breakfast and while they were yet partaking and conversing over it with those renewed spirits which temporary death returning to blameless life generally bestows several little agreeable events happened in succession the indefatigable apothecary paying his morning devoir and said that the trusty jonathan who had been the watch of the night had with giant strides already given in a favorable report of his patient that jerome had relieved guard at the fourth hour and that therefore the good fellow thought it best to take the news to brixham before he went to rest you must know ladies said burton jonathan thought we should all sleep the better after it  my sally overheard this account for the giant has a mavelous good voice and though she was yet in bed she cried out to her sister  who is her bedfellow  do you hear that hester god bless the bearer yes so say i god bless jerome for that cries hester waking  aye you have been dreaming about my jerome i suppose answered sally but the news happens to be brought by my jonathan well dont quarrel about it vollied jonathan there is my pretty lasses cousin jerome shall bring the next account and then we shall expect a kiss apiece and double it this produced a hearty laugh both above and below stairs i skipped up and made dear oldish wife laugh too  the giant then tucked him in a truckle in the back parlour where as i may say he and jerome ride and tie in sleep as they take turn and turn as sir guises nursery men as i call them  the girls got his mess of milk ready by the time he waked wife took the other nap and here am i come for my cup of comfort and slice of conversation but odso time will not stop a moment although we are often enough obliged to wait years for him  that is for the merrytime  so as your faces have declared the state of your pulses my good friends   o yes interposed john as burton was going round as all is well no more need be said on the subject  the ladies interpreted the arch look to which the all is well applied and laughed almost as much as the apothecarys daughters and the giant and then burton the best natured of living beings joined in chorus without having any other reason for it than the genuine joy he had in seeing his friends joyful he then set off to visit olivias cottages in his way to the abbey  these diurnal journeys were always performed on his medical pad who as brisk and bonny as himself and perfectly acquainted with the doctors language trotted cantered or set off full gallop according to the calls of life and death or only the gentle indispositions or the megrims of a patient indeed it was a sort of a parishponey for all the little boys and girls within ten miles of brixham had been upon its back and sometimes two or three of them together when the good man was visiting a father or mother the children of the family or a little neighbor would have a ride on the doctors pad so that the poor little fellow had as much employment and got no more rest than his master the urchins would take him from the gate hedge door or manger to which he might be fastened and hurry away with him sometimes in the middle of a nap now and then it must be owned the youngsters would lead him into a cloverfield meadow grounds or conduct him even into the garden to graze on the sward of the walks or grassplats and sometimes they would purloin the oats from the cornbin and the hay from the stacks and so reward him for their pastime while a few generously took delight to see him at feed without mounting his back and sometimes too the apothecary would receive him at their officious hands wantonly bedecked with flowers wreathed in his mane or braided into his tail burton accustomed to their sport and always pleased with it would then distribute some of the nuts plumbs or apples with which his pockets were usually surcharged and then man and beast would set off to the next on the sick list whether in town hamlet fine house or humble hut  scarce had the apothecary reached his first pausing place ere a packet was delivered to mrs fitzorton who with extatick accents cried out almost the moment of receiving it  from my dear dear henry  she bowed for permission to read and was opening the letter while she bowed her satisfied heart panted to communicate and john auguring from her happiness that all was well too in that quarter did not check her you know all about henry  only hear said she proceeding immediately with the contents  although my dearest olivia i have thus been trepanned by the kidnapper partington who has been abusing me ever since i became his prisoner  i expect he will be tired of calling me names in a week or two at most when i will fly to her whose happiness is the sole study of my life let me hear from you i entreat were not our dear johns both little and great your inmates i should really be angry with mine host for stealing me away at this crisis of your tender and interesting expectations dear carry is well and sends love gaffer and gammer atwood the same jonathan and jerome are from home we suppose with their sweethearts at the apothecarys again and again adieu  partington scolds for himself   you are perhaps unacquainted with mr partingtons humor and might therefore think him said mrs fitzorton one of the most illmannered men in the world whereas he is one of the most friendly and most blameless and only scolds those whom he loves  we have often heard of him said mrs herbert olivia then gave to their perusal the following curious postscript to henrys letter  dear abominable your goodfornothing husband can scarcely be withheld from leaving me already i must have him chained like other puppies to prevent his running home before i have done with him  and the young villain his daughter begins to whimper after mammy too  i will tie the rascal by the leg as i would a singing bird  but after all you are the most atrocious caitiff for witching them away dissolve your spells or use them to bind the refractory fellow to this spot till i am weary of him which as he rightly says i shall soon be or else i will have you burned witchfashion yours as you deport yourself  b partington   the gentleman is a humourist cried mrs herbert smiling  surely it is very unnatural said johanna to abuse ones best friends  perhaps you would think it more so to hear him lavish praise on his worst enemies observed olivia which he does invariably  that is more unnatural still exclaimed johanna  not my little wonderer said the colonel if you were to see the look and hear the voice in which he addresses both  still it is unnatural added johanna  rather say it is singular for it is in nature i assure you we are very apt remarked olivia to call that unnatural which never came within our observation  o but here is a little notabene for you colonel  being in the letter to olivia john knew it might be read aloud he therefore heard what follows  tell the insufferable colonel john to take heed  sat sap  a word to foolish fellows is enough  o but if you knew said john warmly as we know this scurrilous being  if you knew that he has in his heart no enmity but for vice no friendship but for virtue that his oaths are asperities on the surface and seem like small knots on the bark of the oak mere idle peeling but the heart is sound and good to the bottom  you would think of and love him as we do  i love him in your report said mrs herbert  pray dear sir questioned johanna do you think there is any chance that i shall come in for a share of his scurrility  if you go on improving i think you may hope answered john  o yes depend on it observed mrs fitzorton you will be one of his most abominable little caitiffs  this sort of chat went on for some time and those who sustained it were thereby more familiarized and endeared to each other it was then proposed that while olivia withdrew to write to henry little john and jane atwood should show the park and gardens to her amiable guests the colonel having signified his intention to ride to the abbey after he had settled some business with his privy counselor true george  chapter xxxii the morning so generally cheerful in the castle took a different color at the abbey the passing hours there had reflected many hues it was there indeed as an april morn in which a sudden but soft succession of cloudings and sunbeams  of light showers with now a dark shadow and now a vivid ray alternately cleared and obscured the face of things  bright however was the beam that at early dawn visited the chamber of caroline stuart for it was ushered in by tidings that her father had passed a better night than any he had enjoyed for many weeks and that he was still in the arms of sleep guarded by jerome the nurse and one of the female attendants  cheared by this intelligence and not a little renovated by the slumbers into which she had herself fallen at intervals she was at leisure to attend to some of the other circumstances that accompanied this strange reverse of fortune some of these indeed were immediately under her eye she found herself once more in the chamber where she herself first opened her eyes and where her dearest mothers were closed for ever her brother had reported to her long since that the abbey was in ruins that its blooms were all destroyed and that whatever it contained had been even like the wreck of an insolvent variously dispersed yet she had been reposing on probably the same bed certainly surrounded by the same furniture even to the slightest ornaments which had graced it in her own natal and in her poor parents mortal hour the very portraits of her grandfather and of her mother lady matilda then a child decorated as before the chimneypiece if the rumor said she of the sale was not false it must surely be magic  unless  perhaps   she hurried from a very tender idea not at least to be encouraged by going to the window but from thence a continuation of similar objects struck her eye and penetrated her heart the chamber which both the mother and daughter had alternately occupied and resigned was immediately over the flower garden this on her throwing up the sashes welcomed her return with every fragrance and regaled her with every florid bloom of the season  how is all this possible sighed she i certainly wake  i certainly speak  i move   one of her women whom she had enjoined to bring reports from her fathers room entered as she uttered this caroline had half begun a question which she broke off by observing it was of no immediate consequence  another time perhaps she might trouble her with it  and requested to be left a little  as her filial terrors began more to subside closer and acuter recollections thronged to her memory by a resistless force and natural approximation as well as celerity her thoughts traveled from the abbey to the castle and back again as fast  by nature and by habit firm selfdenying and steady to her principles she had forborne to mention the names either of olivia or henry to her brother even though from his new attachment he might possibly have heard them unmoved but aware that human strength is baby weakness if it inflates us with a daring confidence or braves temptation she had avoided every thought as much as possible that led to henry fitzorton  incapable however of change she could not like her brother transfer her feelings or compromise with her heart she retained her sentiments of preference without proposing thereby any idea but that of carrying to the grave an original impression unmixt with any image external or interior that should debase or sully it to live in a state of singlehood and separation far from an object who was solemnly and for ever disposed of wishing both him and the sacred being to whom he was bound all human good in this world and all bliss in the next this comprised the whole plan of her existence if we add only her unwearied prayers for an alteration in the former pursuits and consequent practice of her father and her attentive affection to her brothers heart which when she found it capable of a change she conducted by the most gentle and generous means to that of johanna  in the performance of these several duties and in observance of the laws she had herself instituted for the government of her own heart the recess in which she had passed the last few years became she thought the most proper she could have found so entirely suited indeed to her feeling was it that sweetened by friendship and softened by sympathy she ardently desired to remain there to the remotest period of her days  summoned however at length by a voice which she would have followed though it should lead from an earthly paradise to the gloom of a dungeon the voice even of nature  breathed from a repentant father  she had again to approach scenes and objects over which it had been the solemn business of her soul to draw an oblivious veil she had long seen them in retrospect  every day added to their distance the piety of arthur who pointed to higher prospects  the resignation of his sable attendant who caught from his masters precepts the virtue of submission even to the eternal loss of her he had left in the indian world  and the purity of her own mind had all a share in quieting her spirit and in directing her ideas but every thing was suddenly and unavoidably brought back inanimate and living objects each interesting to her heart encompassed her about and john fitzorton relying on the force of her character had not even made the conquest of her former attachment to his brother henry a question so that many things which she could not but see  which she could not but feel were wrapped in clouds of mystery  several points however were palpable and to these her mind always submissive turned for relief as often as she could draw it from more uneasy and perplexing reflections she again beheld the sun gilding the scenes of her youth she was restored to her father her brothers indignant feelings for him were changed to duteous pity she had again received the caresses of olivia a little chosen band from her former household smiled on her commands and john fitzorton whom she had once supposed the greatest foe of her house alas with but too much cause had approved himself its noblest friend  yet even to john fitzorton her heart assigned not the honors of preserving to her the sacred relics by which she saw herself surrounded ah sighed she with a softness that thrilled her frame if these wellremembered objects have ever been dislodged  by whom were they replaced my brother dennison arthur and our indian were far remote  yet who even knew the particulars or the appropriate places of all i now see in this consecrated apartment the inventory can have been taken by no careless hand yes sacred image of thy blissful years continued she lifting up her eyes to the portrait of her mother thou the prime ornament of all about me  thou did not regain thy station here by means of one who was a stranger to thy virtues or to their eternal impression on thy children  doubtless my mother some friend to us both it was  and  blessed be his name  for ever  turning from contemplations which had been forced upon her she opened her door and passed into several of the other apartments the naked walls the half rotted casements shaking from their frames  the damps that had lodged in the ceiling and chilled the floors  the darksome look of most of the closed windows across which the bars had rusted  and the dust which the winds had beat up and the frost hardened upon the sashes which had been left unfastened  with the woof of the spider on which hung obscenely many a victim the wily artificer still lying perdue in the center of his snares  these were all but so many confirmations of her former opinion with respect to the care which had been taken of her apartment  at this instant the lieutenant appeared at the bottom of a staircase that led to another division of the chambers on the east side of the abbey caroline ran to him expressing a hope that he was comfortably lodged well lodged my sister yes in truth too well for a soldier but the furniture must be from the castle nay part of it i think from colonel fitzortons chambers i will swear to some of the articles how did you find your own too well furnished likewise considering all things said caroline but not  from  from the castle  carolines hesitation incited the lieutenants curiosity and without any more questions he followed his sister back to her own apartment no sooner had charles cast his eyes around the room than he exclaimed o this can be done only by henry i see him in every circumstance  in a moment he felt carolines hand tremble within his own and a cold paleness came over her face like that of death  yet expelled as suddenly by a burning blush pardon ah pardon my cruel rashness cried charles but i thought   she pressed his hand kindly and elaborating a smile hoped he would attend her to sir guise he obeyed in silence yet her agitation both distressed and surprised him  we must explain this although it had been a settled point with caroline never to assist in reviving the image of olivia by mention of her name before charles even after she had reason to believe his affections had taken another bent he had been equally circumspect only while he felt an equal consciousness of the mighty powers that associate with the name of a beloved object when his gliding heart had once deviated from the point at which as is common to all lovers he thought it would fix for ever he not only spoke of henry and olivia with less and less irresolution but even called johanna his second olivia either from her real or fancied resemblance to that lady and as caroline had never testified or at least as he had never noticed any confusion similar to what he now observed he presumed there lay no more danger in the name of henry than he himself found in that of olivia so prone are we to judge the seelings of others by our own alas the lieutenant wholly forgot the different conformation of human minds the young the delicate the interesting johanna had taught him indeed to forget every thing save herself but had he consulted the great painter of minds he would have known that although he had adopted the advice of the merryhearted mercutio by taking a new infection to his mind by the force of which the poison of the old had died his less mutable sister who though she gave her sorrows no voice nor at a distance from their source scarce knew herself how deeply that source was seated  might in a nearer advance to objects long unseen  and studiously shunned  and at such a crisis of her softened thoughts  feel as if the name of henry  shot from the deadly level of a gun had murdered her  finding her agitation increase as she walked along she begged the lieutenant would leave her a few moments to herself but catching his hand eagerly before she suffered him to depart she exclaimed o let me not be mistaken  it is the remembrance of a generous and disinterested heart  it is the unexpected sight of its bounty its pity and its goodness it is a combination in which are those sacred persons who are above and under the earth and no object no image less hallowed than these has over whelmed your caroline  the lieutenant embraced her and being now in an antechamber that joined her fathers room he said he would prepare sir guise to receive her  she did not however remain long after him he who calms the raging of the sea can raise the innocent flower which the storm has beaten down with him she communed to him she bent the knee and offered up the prayer which was accepted  she rose tranquillized and hearing herself called by a voice which even when it summoned harshly she had never disobeyed she soon assisted the pious offices of a reconciled son by blending with them those of an exemplary daughter  and now for some hours they had both the ineffable delight of testifying the blessed effects of a contrite spirit the rock was softened and the tears which gushed from thence as from a pure source were as living waters to cleanse the polluted soul sir guise avowed his crimes owned his sorrow and his regret  confessed that he had erred beyond what the blameless minds of his children could image of wrong but that now they were restored to him he had some assurance their innocent mediation would be accepted avowals like these he had made before and with fraudulent design but the reign of hypocrisy was past and conscience had at last ascended her rightful throne  chapter xxxiii cheared by these appearances and anxious to improve them the good brother and sister sat on each side of their fathers bed and tried every thing most likely to continue the happy symptoms in answer to some kind questions sir guise had asked respecting the worthy old dennison whom he considered as amongst the first on the long list of those he had injured caroline produced a letter with which the veteran steward had charged her at parting and which she promised to bring forward when it might most gratify the servant and the master and this appeared to her the moment that it would set forth in the simplicity of nature the unaffected good wishes and good will of an honest heart of this caroline from a long knowledge of the writer was perfectly assured  but fearing that in the unfolding these there might be some expressions which a mind sore from the wounds it had inflicted on itself would feel too pointedly  she proposed to spare her father the trouble of perusing it by consigning it to her brothers reading observing that he might at some future early opportunity either report the substance or give the whole jerome and jonathan who had been keeping watch over the baronet offered to withdraw but sir guise with some energy said  as his improper behavior to that muchwronged old man and to every other person had been public so should be his confessions his shame and repentance i know continued he my dear childs generous motive but i must entreat to have the letter immediately and will try to read it myself for this purpose sir guise raised himself in the bed and made many ineffectual efforts but he had taken too wide a measure of his corporeal powers or rather he had mistaken a momentary supply of spirits from several chearing circumstances for bodily strength and unable even to bear the posture necessary to trace the characters of the letter he was constrained to lie down and entreat his son to read it as his desire to know the contents remained and was perhaps increased by the difficulty of procuring them the lieutenant having broken the seal and unfolded the paper began to read but stopped in the middle of the first sentence in vain did his father importune him to proceed caroline guessing indeed perceiving in some measure the cause from what she had already heard now regretted she had mentioned the letter till sir guise had gained a little more strength he agreed to this and feeling himself exhausted said he wished to be alone  the lieutenant and caroline obeyed and when they were gone sir guise made another ineffectual trial i see you are main willing your honor to hear what daddy dennison says cried jonathan who had returned into the chamber with jerome  and i exclaimed the latter will read it were it as cramp and crooked as our own aye well make him out i warrant answered jerome an if it be long why we can ride and tie you know cousin you a bit and i a bit ods zookers now you are got on the right side the post your honor shall not be on the fidgets for the value of reading a letter and so as the squire and young lady seem shillyshally about it what little book larning we have is at your service if you like to have it  taking the silence of the baronet for consent though in truth he was silent because he had not recovered himself enough to speak jerome received the letter and began  to sir guise stuart baronet  by favor of his most excellent and never enough to be loved daughter  honored and as i may now say by gods grace honorable sir  blessed be god for it we are told your honor that nothing has for a great while been new under the sun and that there has been an end put to miracles ever since the bible times  now that i take to be  to be  to be   what is that word jonathan  he is as long as my leg  and a pretty deal more crooked answered jonathan looking over his cousins shoulder but i have him for all that  pokrifal you fool pokrifal who is the best scholar now i wonder  jerome clapping him on the shoulder said you are a fine old greecein to be sure and proceeded now that i take to be pokrifal  for first it is new to see your honor what i hear with great joy you now are beginning to be that the sun old as he is mayhap shall hardly shine on the like again  and secondly so bad as you have been many long years nothing but a mavelous miracle could make a good christian man of you again  for it is easier for a leopard to change his spots  you understand me your honor  so i dare say that under gods favor a miracle and no small one has been made on purpose for your honor  daddy dennison is a brave sensical old youth ant he coz said jonathan  dont put me out answered jerome  o sir were the dear good real lady stuart whom you  you    better skip the next word i fancy coz said jerome hesitating   see here just where i have put my finger  it is the devils own word to be sure said jonathan but the steward meant it should be read or he would not have put it down besides the things true and so what signifies mincing of it  read on said sir guise jerome continued  real lady stuart whom you murdered as a body may say by inches were she alive to witness this good turn she would almost die again with joy but for that matter she does see it where she now is and my old heart bounds to think there is now a chance you may meet her how must your honor also feel when you have got a little over the shame on it to have your allgood son and daughter by your side to forgive you and to make your bed in your sickness as the scripture says your honor should have old dennison about you too but that i am rather dim sighted of late and moreover could no otherwise but by staying behind to keep house and nurse my age prevail on young master and mistress to go in comfort so i thought the only way to show my love at this great distance would be to indite my thoughts in a letter that your honor might know i was not the least glad to find you such an altered man  and from being the greatest  the greatest   here is another word said jerome checking himself which his honor may not like  look  lord you are so squeamish  come i will finish it observed jonathan taking the letter and reading on    and from being the greatest sinner i think i ever knew are getting to be the greatest penitent and heaven can tell it should be so else the one can never be able to set off the other i mention these things now out of pure kindness that you may not imagine you have repented enough  for alas if your honor should live to the age of mathusalem and go in sackcloth and ashes all the time it would not be too much seeing what is past  a groan here issued from the bosom of sir guise jonathan whispered to jerome that the groan was a good omen but that he was glad he had come almost to the end of the letter because said he you see the poor mans face is covered with tears and it is a pity to whip a horse to death when he sees his fault and after all his freaks is going the right road here is only a bit more to end with your honor  and now honored and praised be god as i said in the beginning  honorable old  and as i may say  new master wishing you may go on with the good work so that although your sins have been as scarlet they may become white as snow which we are told in holy writ shall be the case to all true repenters i am always your old faithful servant to command nestor dennison  but there is a postscript observed jerome only a few lines though   we have all young and old lived here as i may say like people taken out of a pesthouse and put all at once into a paradise but this your honor will hear from better hands all grace to your honor and no more at present but love to every thing at the old abbey and to little old fitz if alive  i dare say if little fitz knew how your honor had mended yourself he would come and tend you too as to squire henry and madam olivia i shall say nothing  but heaven make em happy  your honor has not a little to repent of in that quarter  but i have done  and its time you had old boy said jonathan folding up the letter and returning it to the baronet who had felt the truth of every passage at his heart but made no other comment than that which was written in his sighs and tears both which much affected the young kinsmen who used every means in their power to console him though in fact some of those intended consolations like dennisons epistle probed to a salutary end indeed the deepseated wound  meanwhile charles and caroline had been trying to console one another as it was a point presettled by the colonel that they were not to go beyond the walledgarden at the west end of the house for fear of being seen and known by any of the villagers they wandered without perhaps knowing their feet were in motion over several parts of the house itself in this ramble they insensibly came to the room which caroline had appropriated in happier hours for its parallel situation to the castle the instant however she had set her foot into it she drew back as from sudden recollection and would have taken another path but the lieutenant arrested her step by telling her that he saw from the window several persons coming down the grand avenue  good heaven exclaimed caroline perhaps i mean heaven forbid that  did you say several persons brother   while she asked the question she was mechanically moving forward in a direction which would have enabled her to answer it herself for she approached to the window rapidly caught a view not only of the walking porter but of several well known objects i fancy my dear charles said she trying to disguise her sensations it must be some of the family with perhaps our own islanders  yes answered the lieutenant looking eagerly i think i can distinguish at this distance my mountaindaisy johanna  let us prepare to receive them observed caroline repressing a sigh but taking her brothers hand and leaving the chamber which had also some pieces of its ancient furniture and particularly a little cabinet which she had not time to bring away but which she now took under her arm  when they had got back to her own apartment one of the maids came up to inform her that true george was come with all manner of good things from the castle and with a message of love from his lady saying that she and her friends were coming to ask permission to partake of them they are not far off maam added the maid i and letty saw them some time ago they left their carriage at the park gates  the question betwixt the brother and sister now was where to receive them i suppose it must be in one of the chambers for none of the lower rooms i understand have any furniture  o yes sir answered the maid the little saloon and parlour on the right hand are as nicely fitted up as ever though not with any thing that was in them before  new wonders seemed to take possession of charles and caroline they exchanged looks neither spoke but followed the maid down stairs into the saloon where the lieutenant recognized many of his old acquaintance of the castle in the articles that adorned it  but before they had leisure to form their feelings on the occasion into any thing but desultory exclamations the party which consisted of mrs fitzorton mrs herbert johanna the colonel and little john were announced as just entering the abbey each brought some testimony of loving kindness one a basket of flowers another of fruits john fitzorton had loaded his hands and pockets with food for the mind while his nephew and sisterinlaw carried between them a small wickerpannier which the moment after their entrance was laid at the seet of caroline stuart i wish i could tell you the happiness i have in rendering up my trust said olivia were my henry here he would do it for me  he who has an eloquence proper for every occasion but in his absence as none of these good people seem willing to help me out i must even trust to your known goodness sweet friend and see whether the offering itself can supply my defects  olivia took the peg from the cover of the pannier and the lid being laid open uprose to the view of the company the now almost withered but still silky head of carolines favored spaniel poor old fitz his eyes like dennisons were dim his deep brown and once redundant ears the hair of which was wont to curl like a cupids head hung languid down and although he had shared every delicacy with henry and olivia the wasting power of time had made his face look meagre while the other parts of his body even amidst every sign of care and love bore the marks of decay he was still however sleek to his protectors he had been interesting and the tokens of a good old age were in his countenance he was received by his long absent mistress with all the cordiality that attached to him indeed so many were the sensations that the unexpected sight of him brought into her minds eye that her corporeal one could not hold its tears while the cause of them himself after being lifted from his downy bed in the pannier and often passing his face over the lovely hand that caressed him began to show signs of grateful recognition  i assure you my dear caroline if it had been possible cried mrs fitzorton i would have restored him to you in all the beauty that graced him at your departure and had you seen how anxious henry has been to keep him from suffering even by the power of time  alas the spoiler of us all  you would have loved him for it and the dog loved him for it too  for i am in favor only when my husband is absent yes fitz continued olivia you know when your master is at home i am but a kind of secondbest with you  he who as one of his favorite bards expresses it was made to engage all hearts is your first love so he is mine and yet though you have been my rival i forgive you  while olivia thus talked to and fondled little fitz johanna and charles had got into a little teteatete in another part of the saloon  as had the colonel and mrs herbert with respect to caroline although nothing could be more apparently trivial than what had dropped from mrs fitzorton on the topic of the fourfooted favorite  an old decrepid little animal  she felt it of the utmost importance and had never known an event in her life that required more management to prevent its being noticed that she paid the circumstance a disproportionate attention  little john with that acute remark which belongs to children asked his mother if the lady was not taken very ill and i am sure said he it is a pity such pretty eyes should ever weep  yet any body may see there are tears in them now  except yourself mamma i think i never saw so handsome a lady  and i dare say papa would think so too i will write to him about her  caroline overheard part of this some of it caught the ear of john fitzorton who walked restless about the room then desiring johanna to join olivia he said to charles in a governed voice lieutenant i fear your sister is still unhappy you should have told me this i knew it not myself answered charles  it must appear strange cried caroline as if conscious she had excited conversation that i should have bestowed on this little brute so much more than is his due while i am in the presence of so many persons who have higher claims to my grateful attention but the truth is i am every way so surrounded by those invaluable claimants and feel so powerfully the impayable debt i owe them that i shrink under the conscious weight of unnumbered obligations and deplore the insignificancy of my powers to express my feelings  express them only sweet caroline said olivia in being happy  in thinking that you are part of ourselves  in believing that providence has at length heard our mutual prayers  yours in rendering a parent worthy of your love ours in bringing you after many a fruitless wish within reach of friends so very precious to us i cannot be surprised at your present emotions i know full well they must partake equally of pain and pleasure but the former i trust will hourly decrease and the latter receive some large additions  the air of soothing and the accents of encouragement with which the admirable olivia spoke this the generosity of its motive and the soft blandishments which illustrated by tender action every heartfelt word wrought powerfully on the grateful caroline who suffered herself to be heard and on olivias expressing a hope that she found sir guise better and the abbey a little more like its former self than fame had rumoured it caroline said smilingly that she should have thought it all the work of some good genii had she not long known that a race of beings superior in benevolence to every fabled creation resided in fitzorton castle and dispersed their blessings to all around  and to such magicians she attributed the enchantments which awaited her own and her brothers return to the abbey  thus by a happy and innocent compliment to the family in general did caroline throw a timely veil over the particular cause of her late perplexity  john fitzorton however still appeared anxious and traversed from one party to another without fixing near any body long enough to begin discourse his disquietude was silently noticed by olivia who imputing it all to tender emotions in the presence of his beloved caroline stole toward him with an assurance that all these inevitable asperities would in time soften and that though she would not betray his secret for the world she could not but think many things which had dropped from caroline admitted an interpretation in his favor  these she promised to impart when she got home and as sir guise was now restored to virtue she hoped her dear john would not shut up his mind against any kind impressions  while john was considering whether it would be best to let olivia continue this mistake or to correct it in part mrs herbert came forward to say that caroline had been suggesting the impossibility of quitting her father so soon and had entreated her to intercede with the colonel for her and her party remaining some time longer o by all means interposed olivia grant her filial wishes send away the carriages at once and let us all assist in the recovery of the now good parent and the consequent felicity of his children  johanna and the lieutenant again got together ah my charles exclaimed the former not in jealous but in consciously humble accents would i had never seen the lovely olivia your affection for me you have often said was grounded on a fancied resemblance of her and if so o how must the poor ineffectual copy fade in your eye in a comparison of the original which surely is grace and loveliness itself  i have shrunk even in my own idea ever since i first saw her in this meridian splendor of her charms even in her infancy she was fascinating but how little was i prepared for the attractions which now surround her  it is true she is the wife of your friend and you hold her sacred and appropriate  but if you love me only for my similitude to those features my hopes to retain your heart must be faint even as that similitude yet were the sight of her to rob me of your heart could i forbear to love the author of my despair when i see her thus arrayed in every grace  in every virtue charles could only reply to this by an ardent glance and gentle pressure of the hand for arthur floresco and the apothecary came into the room with a summons from sir guise stuart who understanding there were some of the castle family below said he should think himself honored if any of them would deign to attend his son and daughter into his chamber that he might pour before them his true thanks for their unbounded goodness to him and his burton said he believed the visit would act upon the spirits of his patient as a richer cordial than any he could prescribe for him arthur insisted it would be an act of spiritual charity caroline pleaded eloquently without uttering a word olivia took the hand of the latter and said she would answer for the assent of johanna and mrs herbert to every thing arthur had pronounced charitable john i am sure added she cannot refuse to promote his own good work no said his nephew though my uncle is a philosopher he can just laugh and cry like a little brat as i am i have made him often do both myself  so has sister carry  besides wishing to do every good he attempted effectually john desired to see how the longimplored and at length granted request of sir guise to see his children had operated if the lieutenant leads said he the colonel shall follow although contrary to military etiquette  i thought observed olivia that in all the little matters of this great world we women were the commanding officers and that wherever the ladies led not only captains and colonels but all their armies were proud to follow however as we depute lieutenant charles and colonel john our aiddecamps on the occasion we order them to go forward  if poet papa had been here cried little john i know what he would have called them what questioned the colonel not aiddecamps but gentlemen of the bedchamber uncle and if i can get to the room first i shall be the page in waiting you know  little john bribing the apothecary to accompany him ran out of the saloon and if there had before been any difficulty his apt and playful allusion would have settled it the feelings of the party which had been somewhat entangled in a labyrinth by the preceding conversation now concentrated in one generous point and they were conducted by charles to his fathers chamber  chapter xxxiv neither little john however nor his friend the apothecary though both nimblefooted beings were the first persons of the groupe who reached the aforesaid apartment arthurs floresco no sooner understood from a whisper of his master that it was the intention of the party to indulge the baronet in his desire than he slipped imperceptibly out of the saloon while the company were settling the order of their going he luckily met true george to whom he imparted the news and both flew with it to sir guise who no sooner heard the tidings than he begged george would assist him in some little preparations for their reception exerting therefore all his force and assisted not only by george and floresco but the egregious letter readers jonathan and jerome  the good apothecary and his young companion found the valetudinarian faint from the labors of equipment or rather of supporting the fatigue of being equipped but arrayed in one of the comfortable changes of an invalids wardrobe which the diligent and pious love of caroline had purchased on her way in addition to what had been supplied by the considerate friendship of colonel fitzorton and olivia  the party on entering were pleasingly surprised to observe sir guise stuart able to receive them in that manner he testified the fullest sense of obligation to all in general but repeatedly called the colonel the restorer of his children and himself some  he observed looking first at olivia then at george were absent  whom he dared not expect to see but for whom he had poured his daily hourly prayers  he means my beloved henry and dear jane atwood whispered olivia to caroline  yet if all now present will cheer my throbbing heart with the sounds of forgiveness undeserved as i feel it is i may still hope that the pardon of the absent great as have been my offenses to them may in time be added unto me  he next insisted upon kneeling under the support of his children to receive the forgiveness of the company and when he was led to true george that humble creature unable to see his superior in station in any posture that implied condescension without meeting him on equal terms bent his knee to the baronet at the same time and assured him in a generous whisper that it should not be long before his forgiveness was sealed by both the certain persons he had alluded to meanwhile he begged him to believe that he could answer for it neither the one nor the other bore him any malice  floresco had thrown himself into a supplicating position in a quiet corner almost folded in the bed curtains  the good burton was very desirous to shorten this scene which he observed was becoming much too strong for his patient but the most trying part which the latter had allotted to himself was yet to be performed grant me i pray you said the almost exhausted man the indulgence of another moment  while in the presence of those i have wronged i now publicly solicit what has already been privately granted to me the forgiveness of the two beings i have the most injured o pardon pardon my children the author of your lives as of all the tyrannies torments and frauds which have rendered those lives intolerable pardon him who has deprived you of health peace fortune and severer than all of a parent worthy of your loves good virtuous and sincere pardon him whom you ought to execrate pray for him whom you ought to despise desert and curse in return o god in just return for the curses he has poured on you  sir guise had sunk from the arms of his children on his knees and folded his trembling hands and lifted up his streaming eyes finding it in vain to attempt checking the effusion of his surcharged heart his son and daughter knelt with him and by every tender evidence their own situation allowed strove to convince him he had atoned for every thing charles importuned him for pardon on his own impetuous and perhaps unfilial errors instead of imitating his meek and uncomplaining sister caroline wholly regardless of so many observers was only intent to raise her father from his humiliating posture and this being effected by means of the colonel and true george jerome and jonathan having left the room he was no sooner replaced on the bed than caroline entreated the company would leave him to composure in the care of herself and charles she then concealed her father from observation by drawing the curtains round him knelt by his side and while she used every soothing power of her tender heart conjured him to believe that he had not only conciliated the respect of all who had heard all who had seen his distress and possessed her own and her brothers tenderest love but that he might be convinced the angel spirit of his wife and the spirit of god himself would be his propitiated guardians  father arthur confirmed this in the name of the almighty  with great difficulty john got his sympathizing friends out of the chamber every one offering to be the nurse of the father and associate of the child burton however suggesting that the very life of sir guise who he said was in a much more perilous state than they imagined depended on their observing the wise and delicate request of his daughter they went down stairs the company waited in the saloon till the apothecary had again visited his patient and as he perceived the only restoratives to be hoped were rest and quiet he had interest enough with the party to persuade them to return home which they did after one of carolines women following the orders of olivia had softly taken up little fitz into carolines own chamber  chapter xxxv in this exhausted state however the lulling powers of the apothecarys prescription and of slumber gradually restored sir guise of whose comparative recovery a message was taken by the worthy burton himself to the castle after his evening visit to the abbey but the baronets situation was pronounced in answer to johns still earnest enquiries too precarious either for his removal to any other place or for withdrawing the consolation of his children  it was therefore necessary for john to send away the carriages and that the drivers might not commit any blunders by unnecessary gossipings on the road it was determined that as true george might be wanted at home jerome and jonathan should on pretense of having business that way see them safe back to town for although when irwin recommended them he said they were to be trusted  the colonel had frequently expressed regret on the journey when it was too late to make new arrangements that he had not thought of jerome and jonathan and even irwin himself rather than confide in any persons more immediately out of the family but alas such is the imperfection of human foresight even in the most sagacious minds the plan however of dismissing the chaises appearing the first best measure to be taken the two trusty cousins sportingly told their sweethearts at little brixham they were going to london to buy them gingerbread husbands and receiving due instructions from the colonel began their journey in the dusk of that very evening  but this measure went to the removal of only one and that an inconsiderable perplexity in the project with which john fitzorton had embarrassed himself prompted in the first instance by the exhilarating thought of encouraging penitence of obtaining a victory over that hate of which he now thought the remains ought not to harbor in his bosom against a punished foe who sought his mercy anxious to mitigate the dire pangs of two worthy children who were hiding their heads from an iniquitous parent and flattering himself that the gratification he wished to gain for both parties might be carried on and completed without any counteraction of events he forgot to provide against many points of which his heart though usually provident had not suffered him to suspect the danger henry himself could not have precipitated a benevolence with a more fervid but perilous rapidity  the time of mrs fitzortons confinement from the prospect of a third child drew near the return of her husband could not in affection or in propriety be long protracted olivia grew daily more and more fond of carolines society and he himself became shocked at the idea that he might have led the latter into an inevitable relapse of sensibility on the sharp point of which though her principles would remain unshaken her heart might receive an involuntary wound he knew from himself the possibility of uniting the weakness of sensation with the strength of practical virtue and he felt by experience also that as a soldier and a man retreat was often the only measure of security and as to the doctrine of annihilating the passions of the soul while their sovereign objects were brought close under the eye he allowed the duty of inculcating it and felt the necessity of the sentiment of daily praying not to be led into temptation for though every impure thought will be expelled even if for a moment it should dare to approach the truly virtuous mind the thought may be pure while the heart the very source of that purity may bleed and agonize at every pore he was not altogether at ease with respect to the state of the lieutenants affections his own had long been under the despotism of his determined sway he continued a tyrant on himself and wrenched the scepter from each unruly passion as it made head against him but he soon saw that the illsmothered affections of henry the halfrestored peace of caroline and the hitherto well managed happiness of olivia were all again at hazard and made so even by a project of his own  reflections of this kind began to harass him as he returned with his party to the castle after the interesting scene in the baronets chamber  every succeeding day increased the apprehension and there was not one with whom he could share the confidence save the lieutenant who except in his own case saw clearly the danger but no immediate way of removing it as his father alternately recovered and relapsed and though his life would not probably be long he felt it a kind of parricide to shorten it by leaving him  olivia also began to be importunate on the subject of henry she allowed every merit to johns original motive but said that matters at the abbey had taken upon the whole so happy a turn that she thought it would do her husband rather good than harm to make him partaker of the general felicity she submitted to john whether there was not something cruel in thus shutting him out of his share of joy in the return of henrys friend as john did not well know how to get rid of these reasonings he remained silent which being taken for a species of assent she followed up her supposed advantages sometimes by the aid of mrs herbert and johanna and sometimes olivia would call in caroline herself as an auxiliary and she attributed the embarrassment which she discovered in that young lady to an unwillingness to oppose any measure in which john fitzorton did not seem heartily to concur  and as if these entanglements wanted yet another twist olivia hinted to john her perfect assurance that he would find in her husband the warmest friend his passion for caroline could wish and that even upon that account his presence was desirable although said she the uncertain state of sir guises health would make it indelicate and unseasonable to point to subjects of that kind i have omitted no occasion since her arrival to do justice to your merits of which indeed i find her impressed in a manner the most favorable  this opinion was now so fixed in mrs fitzortons imagination that at every opportunity she spoke of her brother johns various excellencies  and although said she that beloved being who i hope will shortly be amongst us yields to none the palm either of genius or goodness and seems every hour to gain new attractions by a certain peculiar tenderness that attaches to all he says or does  pardon me for paying him in absence this passing tribute which rises from my full heart  i know not any head or any heart but those of henry which can vie with john fitzortons  glad of a subject which might give a relieving turn to that which olivia had excited caroline fastened with an eager haste on the merits of a man who luckily supplied her with abundant sources of eulogy finding that mrs fitzorton only knew partially the history of the colonels protective goodness to herself and friends she gave the particulars of this patronage in the most generous and glowing colors warmed by the honest theme she rose above all selfish emotions and drew the character of that exalted man till she affected her fair auditor even to tears and although olivia conceived somewhat less of johns conduct as to its disinterestedness even than it deserved thinking the grand agent therein to be love and allowed less merit also to carolines encomiums which instead of confining to gratitude she imputed to love also she saw clearly her brothers manly hand and beneficent heart in various characteristic displays when carolines incense was paid olivia felt herself called upon by the voice of equity and of love likewise to mention the part which her henry had taken in the affairs of caroline and charles  how often we have traced your paths paused in your shades praised your virtues wept at your misfortunes  yours and the lieutenants  abroad and at home you have mingled in our hopes our fears  and although from a generous apprehension that my henry whose health and spirits are of late uncertain might feel too powerfully from the sudden sight of friends so long despaired of the excellent john has projected a temporary absence doubt not but when we have prepared him for the joy of such a meeting caroline that his happiness will be supreme meanwhile though i acknowledge that our brother has entitled himself by more important services to the first place as esau appropriated the birthright my henry has a claim to the second nor must i forget to inform you that a little stranger who is now with her father our first born is honored by bearing your name and i hope soon to present her  john fitzorton joined them abruptly just as olivia finished and thinking it the moment in which he would appear in luster before caroline would have left them together but that the colonel expressed a hasty and eager desire to confer with olivia on some dispatches he had received from partington she therefore took an affectionate leave of caroline and attended john home  on the return of our amiable caroline into the abbey  for the preceding interview had taken place in the flower garden  she was accosted by the good arthur who was just descending from the orisons he had been offering up in the baronets apartment the report he made of that unfortunate mans mind was no less favorable than what the apothecary had been able to send her of his body he has had another comfortable repose said he and his piety is uniform even when his health is irregular and i have received a welcome present this morning my dear child upon which i am sure you will congratulate me  observe continued he taking a small parcel from his pocket  folded in this careful envelope and wrapped literally up in cotton  observe my child the keys of my chapelhouse chapel and the hallowed sanctuary to which it leads on the outside of my parcel you see is written in fair and legible characters words that describe at once  benevolence and truth sacred deposits the hand exclaimed caroline is  no matter whose the hand said father arthur  the heart that governed it was bountiful noble  and restores to me more than recovered empires dear and holy scenes i will offer the tribute of my thanks to the generous beings who have saved you from profanation and although happily i may find in you the marks of a desolated long absent friend thy altered state shall but the more endear thee to arthur  and to caroline sighed she  and poor floresco shall make thee all as him was used cried the little indian who bounded at the thought of once more seeing the scenes of his early care and as arthur delivered to him the keys he pressed them to his lips to give them welcomes  the colonel who had received them from olivia presented them to arthur only entreating that if they were made use of it might be late in an evening to avoid that discovery which he now found so difficult yet so necessary to be prevented carolines secret thoughts however had gone to the most holy places to which these keys appertained almost immediately on her arrival and though she did not know how to give those thoughts a voice from the fear of seeming to press on the colonels exhortation to keep within the bounds of the immured flowergarden and abbey she hailed the prospect of having her solicitude on this subject granted without importunity her wishes being now made known to the good arthur he readily gave his promise to be her conductor on the very first evening she could be spared with satisfaction to herself from her attendance on sir guise  arthur himself however resolved to dedicate the coming night to his ancient abode it will be best that i and my little whitehearted black man should go first and make our little preparations floresco embraced as usual his masters robes at finding himself included in the visit to the spot where he had received the first precepts of christianity and the first pure idea of a god  chapter xxxvi meantime the trials of caroline accumulated from every quarter they frequently pursued her into her fathers chamber where as she watched the too languid or too fervid pulse or held the now parched and now humid hand of sir guise he would frequently lament amongst the other causes of his regret the disingenuous part he had acted in regard to herself and henry fitzorton in reply to all which though she felt the truth of every word like a poisoned arrow whose barb had been left to rankle in her heart she would unmurmuringly beg him to be comforted on every part of that subject as the person he mentioned not only constituted the happiness of one of the most amiable of human kind but was she trusted supremely happy himself and when a more particular review of these afflictive circumstances made it impossible for her to answer she would pour the balms of silent forgiveness on her selfexecrating parent by assuring him that she considered mrs fitzortons goodness manifested both at the castle and the abbey as deserving every blessing heaven could bestow and that she loved revered and honored her beyond any woman then living in which assurance she exceeded not the truth  on returning to her fathers apartment from her conversation with arthur she had the heartfelt comfort of finding him so much mended as to converse on several topics he had never before agitated he required from his attendant children the history of their wanderings and as caroline imagined the knowledge of john fitzortons guardianship of herself and party would tend to establish a reconciling sentiment she repeated to her father what she had told to olivia it is not possible to paint the mingled emotions of admiration and respect sir guise now felt for the colonel or the sense of shame and selfabasement for himself at a more composed moment however of the same day he eased his now sinking and now overflowing heart by entering into a detail of the conduct of olivia and true george toward him as it had been reported in different conversations by the apothecary  the brother and sister now heard all that part of the benevolent story which appertained to olivia and which she had omitted in her own narration fresh causes of admiration and of gratitude to both olivia and george were hence discovered and it was made manifest what mighty blessings these two excellent beings under the conduct of john fitzorton had bestowed the good burtons own benignity was next the subject of the baronets eulogy the voluntary attendance of jonathan and jerome had their due share of his praise  and in fine from this evenings discourse in addition to what she had before gathered from olivia a complete history of the transactions of the abbey and the castle from the time of her departure even unto that moment was in carolines possession  her whole soul was filled with wonder and with praise and combining the bounty and protection which she and her dearest friends had received from the same sources she rose in pious thought and as her meditation ascended from sinite to infinite her spirit communed with that power who out of darkness and anarchy natural and moral can educe light and bring forth order  ah assure yourself my dearest brother and my honored father exclaimed she while all of us have thus been in the care of heavens best creatures they have been wrought on in our favor by heaven itself all of us were in need of divine assistance and the manner in which the effects have been brought about cannot leave us a doubt of the cause  blessed be his holy name ejaculated sir guise  soon after this the baronet confessed he felt much relieved by having paid the debt he thought due to the patrons of his repentance and although the length and interruptions of his narrative had wearied his body his spirits were lighter and his mind more refreshed than it had been for some time  in this tranquil period father arthur came into the apartment and entered on the vesper duties of his office these being ended the baronet declared his wish to devote the rest of the night to that repose which he augured he should best enjoy if his slumbers were unbroken by the idea that his too diligent children were losing their own necessary restoratives and this being a point insisted on by the apothecary who had come in with arthur sir guise was left in the care of a single attendant and the rest of the party retired  they retired but not to sleep too many aweful images impressed the bosoms of the brother and sister to permit them to indulge even the thoughts of repose father arthur too and his indian were wakeful the former told caroline that a sudden message brought by true george from the colonel who requested to have back the keys put a stop to his intended visit to the chapelhouse but that mr burton had now brought word from the castle if any of the party felt it material for the quiet of their minds to resort thither and had no objection to the present evening he and george would be their conductors and guide them by a secret way  it is scarcely possible to express the eagerness with which the whole party caught at this proposition caroline enquired earnestly after the secret way which burton had intimated and when the subterraneous passage which led from the uninhabited part of the abbey and which had been in ancient days the ordinary path from thence to the chapelhouse and which all had frequently heard of they seemed much to wonder it had not occurred in relief of their late embarrassment forgetting their minds had been engrossed by a multiplicity of absorbing objects which kept every power in action true george observed to them that his master henry had often passed more time than he should mention in some of the recesses of that very passage and to his knowledge gone at midnight all alone as he thought by that path to the abbey  a universal wish to profit of the present opportunity possessed every one and o let us not lose a moment breathed in a deciding whisper from caroline to the rest george placed a fresh candle in the lantern with which he had been conducting burton lead said the lieutenant george was in motion francisco took the robe of arthur and followed caroline was conducted by her brother and the apothecary the night was dark but they passed along the ruins without any impediment and gained the trapdoor which shut from observation the steps that led by a very deep descent into the subterraneous way george now begged the company to pause until he lighted a torch which he said he had left a step or two father on they stopped but what was their surprise when he returned to them saying that the torch had been taken from the place where he had put it it must have fallen down said caroline but the lantern will do my good friend perfectly well they went forward slowly the masses of stone mortar and fragments that had fallen in the path in many parts made it very difficult to pass and the light which was afforded by the taper in the lantern but dimly showed the obstructions cautiously however pursuing the path which though not in the straight line was sufficiently broad in general they came to a stone seat projecting from the wall where arthur proposed they should rest a moment he prevailed on caroline to sit down  ah my dear good young lady if you knew how often a certain person had been on that very seat sighed george pray let us go forward said caroline rising i am perfectly able to proceed  as they came to a curve in the passage a little farther on and which george holding the lantern had gained first he exclaimed  good heavens look look there is my torch as sure as i am alive nothing of this however appearing to the company as in the next instant they turned the angle it was attributed to fear or rather fancy for george had nothing of the former in his nature presently they came within sight of another recess as they approached which a dark shadow resembling a human figure palpably arose from the seat in view of the whole company and ran with great speed along the passage on referring to one another it was admitted that every one had seen it at the same moment and in the same point of view but without making any reflection they pressed onward and with very little interruption arrived at a large circular opening within a few paces of the correspondent trapdoor  there is the torch again cried george  look it is now going away through one of the gaps in the wall  it was indeed visible to all for some moments and then disappeared  it is very strange said arthur yet it cannot be an illusion to us all neither can it if not imaginary be of ill augury to beings seeking a place of peace and holiness  so let us go fearless on  perhaps observed francisco it may be the evil spirit that once haunted the poor gentleman in the abbey and is now wandering about this dark dismal spot under ground without any body to speak to it or keep it company because of its wickedness  as sure as can be that is it asserted true george and it may go on walking and wailing that way these thousand years but as his reverence says if it be the devil himself it can have nothing to say to us  so here we go again i rather apprehend it to be observed burton if it really be not a deception of our senses some of the   as the apothecary was proceeding in his conjecture   hark hush cried the lieutenant i certainly heard some body speak  they broke short their steps but all was still they walked forward to the trapdoor when a second noise of voices not their own induced them to listen and the word murder distinctly issued from one of the corners of the circular opening  in the name of god demanded arthur advancing  what is your purpose  by this time george had gained the trap and opened the door that led to the secret steps that conducted to the edge of the forest near which stood the chapelhouse and just as caroline was preparing to ascend the steps while george held the lantern to clear her path the figure which had been seen soon after they entered the passage now more decidedly human accompanied by two others flitted along and though every one followed and attempted to stop them they gained the top and were lost in the forest almost instantly  chapter xxxvii but these mysterious appearances were soon succeeded by magic of a different kind for taking the woodpath the little gothic gate that separated the chapelhouse front garden from the forest presented the object of their midnight ramble the monk preceding the action by a spontaneous effusion of his truly pious soul approached the door of his beloved mansion and after assuring his friends that whatever unhallowed things might be permitted to hover without its walls he was certain all within was pure and holy  the door opened while he was yet speaking as if by an invisible hand for on entering after a short pause no one appeared but in the next instant fresh scenes of wonder rose before them in the first compartment of the chapelhouse the sacred lamp was lighted that hung over the benetiere the crucifixes in the scriptorum and in every other part bore shining marks of constant and even of reverential care the dormitory could still boast its wholesome couch for the franciscan and the attendant pallet by its side was invitingly spread for the faithful floresco  but how shall we duly describe what presented itself to our astonished guests in the refectoire how represent their sensations on beholding the table covered modestly yet abundantly with every fruit and flowret of the season and while their admiring eyes were fixed on these a sweet and solemn breathing sound as of aerial music accompanied by a voice of softest melody invited their attention all seemed enchantment and the sacred spell was yet stronger when they found both the words and the air were designed to gratulate the longabsent father of the chapelhouse and his friends to their modest resting place as they stood even at the door of the refectoire listening and observing on these forth issued from a small recess at the bottom of the room the enchanters themselves  olivia fitzorton and jane atwood  the surprise and effect of this encounter upon the whole company at such a time and in such a place was extremely affecting divine and human sentiments seemed to mix do not imagine exclaimed olivia advancing that you are under any conjuration every thing you see and hear has fallen out quite in the common way i expected that the return of the keys and the good apothecarys offer would immediately bring you hither we busied ourselves therefore in making our little preparations when all was ready we persuaded the colonel to conduct us unknown even to johanna and mrs herbert for the delight of a little stratagem of this kind is its mystic secresy and here have we been ever since sadly afraid that our commander in chief would return to escort us back before you came pray pardon the deception and enjoy the reality  fair and virtuous lady said arthur had i not before had reason to believe that the veritable author of all good can inspire some of his creatures to kinder actions than were ever painted by mere human fancy for the fabled arcadia i should perhaps believe that i was transported into fairy land and that you and this fair damsel were the benevolent genii but i had rather do homage to gods own creations than to the best and brightest of mere imagination it is real excellence real philanthropy to which i now bow my knee and before whom i now pour forth my heart every one followed the example and reiterated the effusion of the holy father  but in pure obedience to heaventaught feelings the sable child of nature not contented with simple kneeling fell prostrate at olivias feet then pressed the hem of her garment to his lips kissed the sacred earth near which she stood and indeed almost every well remembered object in the chapelhouse running rapidly from one to the other jane atwood took the earliest opportunity to question caroline how she had left her father then joined the side of her true george well satisfied with the information she had received charles was wrapped in silent admiration arthur now paid his visit of greeting to other objects dear to recollection  the storied windows sacred figures sculptured effigies of the virgin and the redeemer and found them all in the most perfect preservation  the emotions of his innocent heart mounted to his eyes as he made this survey floresco accompanied him and having indulged his first ungovernable emotions followed the lead of his master in similar silence and with similar feelings  the words oh blessed savior oh hallowed maria oh lord of earth and of heaven make us worthy of these thy benignities were reiterated at almost every step  meantime olivia again struck the harmonious chords and by an air yet more solemn carried the soul still nearer to the skies  lady observed arthur the words of both the strains with which you have honored us seem to me well meriting the melody in which you convey them to our hearts ah they deserve a far better harmonist sacred sir answered olivia  they are the effusions of my own henrys muse we had always as you have already heard our hopes that you would again take possession of this little sanctuary and in our frequent daydawning or twilight visitations we consulted one another what would find most favor with the owners and what be most worthy of the place  yet they were not consultations holy sage so much as impulses  we have sometimes dared to think them inspirations and in one  a very  very recent one  of these my husband at my urgence wrote for me the beautiful words to which you have done so much justice in your approbation  to these i attempted the imperfect sounds you have honored with such welcome flattery if continued olivia with uncommon fervor of air and accent if they have the smallest portion of the poets fire it was reflected from him and a sincere desire not to disgrace the subject methinks there wants but the society of the poet to render it one of the most blessed points of time that ever has been or indeed ever can be expected to happen in mortal life  caroline had left olivias chair behind which she had placed herself during the air and had gone somewhat hastily to another part of the room  from thence she moved onward till she reached the private door that communicated with the chapel over this door was a projecting arch that formed a small porch in which two seats were carved gothic fashion in the stone work she had moved the curtain which was usually dropped betwixt the refectoire and the entrance of the chapel and retiring from observation had at first sat herself down in one of the seats  the enchantments which olivia had been spreading caught every ear and every eye but the instant she had ceased to speak she missed caroline and found her kneeling at the door of the chapel  ah my sweet suppliant exclaimed olivia supposing caroline to have been praying doubt not every wish every prayer of your pious soul will in due time be granted the whispering of angels thronging about my own soul assure me it will be so  but this night must be devoted only to festal gladness the pensive pleasures will have their hour but let not this i pray you be one of them  olivia looked round her with much solicitude caroline seemed terrified olivia appeared anxious to say something apart to her but checked herself o may her every desire be followed by obedience like mine sighed caroline rising with difficulty under olivias support and rejoining the wondering party olivia wishing to give caroline time to recover herself prevailed on her friends to partake of her repast caroline found her terrors abate but continued agitated  sensation is often too mighty for the mere appetites of nature and in a thousand instances the mind asserts its dominion over our bodily frames the collation was blessed admired and untasted  but the health and happiness of the fair foundress of the banquet of the bard and of the harmonist  of all within the domains of the castle and the abbey were proposed by the grateful monk and accepted by all in a glass of the burgundy which olivia assured the company bending over caroline was part of the reserve which had been made for the anniversary of the day of her own honored birth  when the assembled houses of fitzorton and clare reiterated their benediction on henry and olivia it has ever olivia continued been sacred to blessed events always consecrated to love or to friendship it marked the day eternally respected  that gave me the hand of henry fitzorton it noted the birth of our dear dear children and now it is brought forth to distinguish the restoration of those whom olivia and her henry and their excellent brother most honor and most love when this irresistible toast had gone its round the door of the refectoire was opened by john fitzorton who accompanied by mrs herbert and johanna came he said to reclaim his fugitives not without exculpatory hints on his own rashness for allowing olivia to engage in such undertakings in the immediate state of her health olivia however was too socially happy to have any fears for herself and when johanna and mrs herbert sportingly arraigned her for keeping them out of her plot she made her peace by an avowal of her selfishness and a promise to be more confidential in future johanna then conferred with the lieutenant and the party were by this addition yet more interestingly blended one with the other caroline tried hard to rally at length john intimated the necessity of dispersing and undertook himself the arrangement of the separation to the ladies who had attended him were united olivia and jane atwood and with those he sought the castle leaving true george and the apothecary to escort back the inhabitants of the abbey ah father of spirits sighed caroline secretly if indeed a vision what a shadow was the last  chapter xxxviii but scarcely were the colonel and his friends departed ere father arthur suggested the duty of returning a general thanksgiving to the fountain of all good in a less uninterrupted way and in a yet more holy place  even in the chapel carolines mystic terrors were resumed but she still labored to conceal them  they all entered the chapel prayed and returned into the refectoire caroline who had been much disturbed petitioned strongly for an exclusive privilege of passing a few moments in it alone and of paying the homage which had been pressing on her heart ever since she had regained her fathers house and her fathers love o suffer me holy director to offer the devotion of a daughter to my longneglected mothers ashes not exclusively dearest sister said the lieutenant i must put in my equal claim on this occasion we must all assert our privilege of pious love interposed the monk you must allow us all to share with you this tributary offering my dear child the plea was too strong to be rejected and arthur leading the way his party followed to the cemetery of the stuarts  here too every aweful object displayed the same hand of tender care which had exerted itself in the chapelhouse and chapel the lamp which like the everlasting fire depended from the center of the burial place was lighted and the coffin of lady matilda was distinguished from the rest by an holy taper placed on a small pillar of white marble at its head this having been erected since their departure every observer felt at the sight an aweful curiosity as they approached nearer to the pillar they read engraved on the marble these words in honor of the dead  o till parents children and the friends who shall be found worthy of them quitting this troubled earth meet in the heaven of heavens farewell farewell  the groupe of friends and relatives now encircled the coffin and never perhaps ascended to that power who alone can read the thoughts of mortals a more sincere or fervent offering yet caroline still looked anxiously and carefully around as if in expectation of the vision she had alluded to  but none appeared  they rose  embraced each other  and returned into the chapel  caroline only lingering behind and begging again a few moments went back to the remains of her mother  her heart was surcharged with strong emotions  and there she hoped to relieve them o thou who have been the bosomed companion of thy caroline remote as near cried she embracing the coffin fervently  behold once more she returns to thy venerated relics  returns to them with better hopes that he whose mistakes we have both so often deplored shall be all thy pure spirit can wish happily thy intercessions for him have brought about this blessed change  continue them i implore thee till every pain of body and error of mind be erased from the records of eternal pity  and o extend thy influence to caroline herself  to her who alas too soon bereaved of thy bright example has not yet learned the unrepining unmurmuring resignation which made thee even while on earth scarcely a being of this querulous world ah endue me immortal spirit with a more perfect gratitude for the varied and unexpected turns of relenting fortune which have of late attended me  enliven my sense of the mighty blessedness of being restored to the affections of a parent  o beseech the source of every good to give thy caroline a more unmixt sensibility of the benefits she is hourly receiving from the hand of friendship  to make her more truly thankful for bestowing on her the power of returning to this solemn spot where she seems to commune with the spirit of her angel parent  and for being conducted to it when every fading power of nature warns her she shall shortly fill the space even that whereon she now kneels  long since fondly appropriated  beside her mothers  her matildas ashes  as if by this aspiration the powers invoked had listened to her prayer and suddenly become visible caroline lifted up her hands toward heaven as she arose and gazing earnestly for some time spread out her arms as if to receive the descending object while a more than human smile pervaded her own countenance then continuing her position till she seemed to feel strengthened in the conviction it was permitted the maternal seraph to impart the heavenly promise to her child she bowed her head in acknowledgment and exclaimed with an exulting voice blessed blessed assurance in its faith will i live and die  she joined her friends with a mind renewed and as she returned thanks for their patient attendance plainly indicated to father arthur the pious cause from whence her complacence had been derived recovering gradually the tone of her mind she communicated her acquiescence to the rest she pressed them to partake with her of the repast a pious serenity of heart was spread from one to the other and they returned by the arched passage to the abbey without encountering any more impediments real or imaginary perhaps then said caroline softly to her own heart it was but a phantom of my brain jonathan who with jerome had returned from his journey was waiting at the abbey door eager to inform them that when they arrived to resume their ancient position in the sick chamber they found the baronet in a state that appeared to them something worse than delirious and in that condition he had left him in the care of his cousin jerome while he should have gone in search of the apothecary the latter part of this intelligence was related while the persons to whom it was addressed made the utmost expedition to the baronets chamber where they discovered jerome and the old nurse and both the attendants struggling to hold sir guise in their arms  on the entrance of his friends sir guise seemed perfectly to distinguish them but in vain attempted to speak and continued to contend with and almost break from the efforts of jerome though now assisted by jonathan at length he was exhausted and then seemed to have gained the point for which he had contended by covering his head in the bed clothes they gathered with difficulty from the broken and feeble expression of the nurse that about an hour after their departure as she went down stairs at the baronets request to prepare some drink for which he was impatient she only staid about a quarter of an hour while the drink was warming and on her return up stairs saw the poor gentleman in strong convulsions but why she could not tell  the soothing attention of his children and their associates each of whom joined their consolements at length succeeded in recovering the baronet so far as to express his joy in seeing them  o my dear children exclaimed he i thought never to behold you more the most terrible apparitions if indeed they were not more terrible realities  have affrighted  afflicted me  methought they entered my very chamber approached my bed threatened me with the most agonizing death if i uttered a syllable  then methought two of them advanced to the head of my bed on each side each planting a naked poniard at my throat if i refused their requisitions  i was in total darkness but methought one said to the other we may go safely into carolines room we know she is from home i saw her   saw her exclaimed arthur looking at his friends  yes answered sir guise and therefore they swore it was the time most fitting  fitting for what demanded charles  i know not answered the baronet but i was methought preparing to make some answer when thank heaven the two young men with the other attendant you have provided me came to my succor i must confess added sir guise my thoughts had been heavily wandering it is certain there was no appearance of any body afterward  to be sure said jonathan his honor was so distracted mad with fright that we had all enough to do to look after him so that fifty men or devils either might be in the house and we never the wiser but when i went down stairs and waited ever so long for your honor i peeked and pottered about the premises but saw never a living soul but little old fitz who had taken it into his head to come after me  the rest of the company confirming this it was conjectured the baronet had been actually wrought upon either by a distempered fancy a fresh attack of his remorseful feelings or a disordered sleep interrupted by horrid visions indeed his weak state of body and nerves and his habitual fearfulness which had still its degree of force though his mind had of late known an unusual energy seemed to give a color to this supposition the apothecary declared it was physically possible as to that said jerome dont you remember cousin jonathan when you were one night in the clutches of the nightmare that you cried out the furies were hunting you with redhotpokers and as the pest would have it i was your bedfellow at that time and a fine time i had of it and by the same token you gave me such kelps in the stomach swearing you had hold of one of em howsomdever and would make him pay for the rest  yes your honors he took his own innocent cousin for one of the devils that had got into un and so no wonder sir guise should think he saw the incarnates who used to haunt him which is natural  poor gentleman he has been hagridden long enough broad awake and has at last dreamt about it  these remarks with a quaint joke or two from the apothecary threw over the solemnity of the circumstance a ludicrous air which the apothecary and arthur thought it best to encourage and so well carried on that sir guise himself in the end smiled at his own chimera the subject was dismissed by george declaring that he had heard much of such devils works and believed he had in his time seen some of them but that he was very sure if all the imps below with the old one at the head of them were to appear before a person who was resolved to be good and with the grace of god upon him he might be just as safe amongst them as if they were so many kittens jonathan and jerome however for the baronets more entire satisfaction determined both to be his lifebodyguards the ensuing night and floresco promised to sit openeyed on the outside of his master arthurs door to give notice if any body approached ickle florrey used to be fright at every thing said he but now only fraid of god true george and the apothecary now went to their respective residences the lieutenant and caroline withdrew to their chambers but not till the latter had tenderly assured her father she could answer for the intercession of his wife being added to that of his friends and children for every good that mortal could enjoy in this world and angel in the next  it is however to be noted that although none of the abbey party which had returned from the chapelhouse made mention to sir guise of any of the strange appearances they had seen or heard in their way thither nor indeed had alluded to any such fancies or facts to any of their friends of fitzorton castle being on the one hand afraid of increasing the alarm of the baronet and on the other too much wrought upon by the impressive realities which awaited them in the chapelhouse the circumstances could not but recur to them while that unhappy invalid was describing their dreadful influence on his mind and imagination nor could the whole party help thinking there was a strange yet incongruous analogy betwixt what they had themselves seen and what sir guise had related and thus while they imputed much of the overcharged colorings and conscious personifications of the one to a distempered mind and body they concluded there was more substance than shadow in what had assailed their own eyes and ears  and in this deduction they were not a little confirmed by the report of the apothecary as they were separating had not one of the singular sights we have seen put a sudden stop to my discourse said this worthy man i was going to inform you what i had indeed before mentioned to colonel fitzorton that notwithstanding all that gentlemans precaution and my own to have it supposed i was in expectation of more patients as well as some kinsfolk of the sick quaker and although your journey hither was performed with the utmost privacy and you arrived at the dead of the night a very general curiosity concerning you had been excited in the neighborhood the wagons too and the appearance of robert irwin and a more frequent resort to and return from the abbey in the fitzorton family particularly the visits of olivia which could not be altogether private much increased the mass of wild conjecture which flew from one village to the other yet the superstition of the villagers covered every thing soon after tribes of gypsies who as you must remember usually inhabited the forest disappeared soon after their benefactors left the abbey but of late a new set has been observed to lurk about the woods and hover near the house nay some have as the report goes been seen to come out of it now it strikes me that the figures we saw moving about our underground path were some of those very gypsies who may there occasionally take up their lodging and who were possibly more alarmed at us than we at them caroline shook her head and suppressed a sigh  arthur inclined to burtons opinion the lieutenant said it was more probable that some of the friendly party at the castle had included those seeming apparitions in the general magic of the evening but rather did not choose or forgot to mention it but then said caroline how are we to account for my dear fathers terrors happening on the same evening and almost at the same period and the dreadful word murder none of the friends at the castle would extend the spirit of a fearful frolic to the sick chamber of him they now succor and protect on the contrary they would rather carry into it every amicable and soothing guest no spirit of darkness could even in mockery proceed from them doubtless fancy may greatly deceive by her illusive creations methought i myself very lately saw a spirit of light  but alas it soon flitted away  chapter xxix it is now the time for us to explain alarms and appearances of a different nature which happened about the same crisis at the castle and with which some of those at the abbey are materially connected when colonel fitzorton was returning home with olivia from her interview with caroline thereby breaking up a very interesting conversation he was extremely thoughtful and spoke little but on gaining the castle he informed his fair sisterinlaw who was always terrified at the silence of john that he had received accounts from partington by express intimating henrys resolve to return when they got into the library partington writes thus said john presenting the following letter  our impracticable caitiff resists all authority he even mocks at oaths though i have fulminated at him like an anathematising pope but the villain is headstrong a bull of basan could not stop him i threaten to put him in double irons  but he is wifesick and whimpers like a great boy to go home as it is plain that our little fairfaced incorrigible olivia alone can stop his career i send to desire she will pronounce sentence of obedience and absence upon him for another week or so as i expect my brother the doctor from the east and have set my heart on his staying to greet him  most insufferable i remain your friend   well exclaimed olivia as she returned the letter why may he not return you must own i have been all patience and submission but surely you have apprehended though from the kindest motive more than was necessary for my part as sir guise is so much better and both his children amongst his nurses i think the sight of a bosom friend and of my sweet caroline must be what henrys heart could most wish and i augur from it every good to his health as well as happiness and i every ill answered john i know his nature and its limit of bearing suddenly any excess either of joy or sorrow grant me another week my dearest sister and if at the end of that term   i yield up interrupted olivia wholly my judgment to yours it shall be so and i will though it feels very unnatural issue such mandates as you think necessary to keep far from me him whose presence is the supreme joy of my life long may he remain so cried john very tenderly it is only that his joy may be secured to him for years that i deprive him of hours and days olivias eyes shone with grateful tears and begging pardon for her impatience marked with a submissive hand the sentiments which the colonel dictated he added some reasons of his own confided in a separate letter to partington and the express set off olivia then related a plan she had sketched in concert with jane atwood to make the good arthurs return to his beloved chapelhouse and perhaps that of charles and their favorite caroline a little more fitted for their reception now as all this is settled in our own minds as to what is to be done and indeed almost every thing prepared i do not ask you to take any active part on the occasion my dear colonel but as you know i can fancy no undertaking of mine however trifling goes on well or as it should do till it has your sanction on it  next to the blessing of my beloved husband and my god  and as you have thought fit to deprive me of my henrys council and james is absent you must be their representative to throw out such a lure as the party may not be able to resist she recapitulated all she had done to obey john and expected a reward  john fitzorton was not the man with all the asperity we have seen on the surface of his character to refuse virtue its recompense or to chill the spirit of benevolence by a frown he smiled assent offered every assistance and the apothecary coming to the castle with some good tidings from the abbey it was resolved nem con after he and true george the ready auxiliary of every good to call in the two last mentioned personages as assistants a few more words past as to the subterraneous passage and the couriers set off their conduct on arrival has been already related but the events that in the intermediate time took place at the castle are yet to be told  when our little project has succeeded so far as to bring the party together said olivia to john and they are all as happy as i sincerely hope the arrangement will make them you can bring dear johanna and mrs herbert to see the effect and thus every thing will be right but the absence of our henry for after all it must be allowed that no man living  no nor woman either  could give so much grace and sweetness to a plot of this kind the sole point of which is to soften for a moment the wounds of the unfortunate and good  scarcely had her ever faithful heart poured forth audibly and ardently this tributary effusion to its first and dearest object ere that object made his appearance he had been for some time in a cabinet adjoining olivias the library where she and his brother had been conversing and of that conversation every syllable had met his astonished ear for although the door that communicated with the library was shut a small window which looked into it was open and only a thin silk curtain parted the speakers from the hearer the latter had indeed entered the cabinet very soon after the former by another and indeed the usual door that opened into the library henry had moreover met the express just as he entered the park received his own letter and understood from the courier that john and olivia were both well and indeed when he was called into the library to receive his commands their honors seemed main merry as henry therefore met no body either in the stables or court yard but such servants as were immediately employed there he past directly from thence into the house and gained the suite of apartments that communicated with the library without being observed by any of the family not however as the reader who has long been intimate with all his feelings and all his merits will easily believe with design to steal any intelligence or purloin any secret by that ignominious method many husbands and perchance some wives also have thought a fair accommodation betwixt conscientiousness and convenience to adopt but purely to give his return all the pleasure his generous nature would wish to impart happening however to gain his station in the cabinet just as his wife began to read partingtons letter a second time and aloud with the ludicrous spirit in which it was written he sat himself down quietly to hear himself abused but soon finding there was going to be formed a conspiracy against him he thought it but fair to fortify himself with as much of his friendly enemies design as he could yet their designs were woven with so many other plots of infinite concern to his feelings that he was bound to the spot by spells more potent than any the conspirators were preparing to throw within the chapelhouse or indeed any which had visited in their most mystic shapes either the subterraneous passage or the abbey every syllable that reached his ear and not one could escape went immediately to his astonished heart and the whole formed a chain of wonders and of miracles that nothing but the voice of the guileless being that revealed them or that of god himself could have made him credit  irresolute what course to take he remained awhile concealed after his olivia had testified her eternal sensibility of his merit absent as present but that fresh evidence of her generous love called forth a grateful repetition of his vows to live only for her and with this assurance he opened the library door and notwithstanding all he had heard ran into her arms there to the dismay of his brother and to the delight of his wife he said that he felt himself so unjust unkind wicked to be wandering from home when his olivia was in circumstances that asked for the care of all her friends that he traversed the wiles of his dear abusive partington to detain him left the bury in an adventurous manner in the middle of the night and left little caroline in pledge and a note to say if his friend had not had enough of him he must follow to the abbey the inexpressible sweetness with which mrs fitzorton received these kind motives of the runaway the fondling of little john whosoon came into the room with the animated tokens of good will that sat on the face of every domestic when the mystery of his first entry was removed by olivias ringing for some refreshments and the cordial welcome of john who in the midst of all his embarrassments at this sudden event was rejoiced to see the marks of so tender a meeting gave to henrys salutations a more than usual energy he felt himself able to speak of the plots upon him and to explain the fair stratagems always taken in wars by which he had discovered them but when he proceeded to show that such discovery went to all the family secrets they were carrying on at the castle the chapelhouse and the abbey and in dilating all this that the same or rather a more redundant and unobstructed flow of spirit and expression animated him to the infinite bliss of olivia who conceived it very naturally to be the effect of the several causes of her own happiness from the penitence of sir guise the restoration of the son and daughter his oldest friends the joy of which she had so long wished him to partake  the fears even of the colonel were perhaps for the first time extinguished by some bright hopes that at length the reconciling affection of the wife had emancipated the very heart of henry from all former slavery as effectually as a newer mistress had obtained the freedom or rather a more lawful captivity for the heart of charles  there can now then be no earthly objection cried olivia to your brothers taking an active part in our darling plan my dear colonel nay no philosophy  i want poetry and song and music and all manner of things from earth and heaven o henry you could not have come back at a moment in which you and your muse were so much wanted i have myriads of things to tell you  a long long history of all that belongs to the dear persons who are now amongst us and you shall have it all before we go but at present jane and i must bestir ourselves for we have yet something to do toward our little fete  i have also to present some new friends to you here at the castle  but we will not say a word to your old ones at the abbey about your return till the exact moment  imagining she saw negatives begin to cloud johns before assenting face she caught the hand of her son and jane atwood and left the library  chapter live henry and john fitzorton were now brought together in the most critical period of their domestic history  and it was not till after they found they were thus by themselves that they became fully sensible of it yet the ardour of the former in a great degree still marked his language and his look and a sentiment that blessed the innocence and unsuspicious goodness of olivia followed the parting steps of his wife and thanks to heaven and to you she is as happy as she is good observed john my dear dear brother cried henry smiling in tears to heaven and to you would have been truer language  let us  let us  converse a little on the almost incredible events which lead to what i have just heard give them to me naturally and simply just as they have been just as they are john managed this requisition with admirable address he passed lightly over such parts as would he knew have too much interested his brothers feelings and detailed at length whatever was likely to give energy or example to his mind at the same time there were few incidents of importance with which he did not make him acquainted so far as respected the penitence of sir guise and the amiable conduct of his son and daughter in their relative characters as children and in all other particulars he took blame on himself for excluding his brothers from the pleasure he was conscious they would have had in joining him in his several plans for the establishment of those who were certainly no less objects of pure love and care to them than to himself but that in truth he considered himself as performing the part of guardian for the general good and in that character thought it would turn out most for the advantage of his wards to keep them out of the trouble of very difficult and perplexed affairs till he could see how far it would be possible to clear off encumbrances and deferred laying before them the history of his trusteeship for their real felicity till he could deliver with it a correct estimate of what in such possessions they were worth but since it had turned out that their worth in the tried virtue of some of their dearest friends in the corrected vices of one of their foulest enemies and above all in the daily hourly proof of the love of a sister and a wife beyond all price he hoped he should be pardoned he thence took occasion to enlarge more particularly on the behavior and tranfactions of olivia as connected with his own in the affairs of the abbey he showed her commiseration for the suffering wicked her honor of the good her friendship for the friends of henry her forgiveness even of his foes when they repented them of their enmity and her love of henry  a love said he pure and permanent blended with every thought wove into every action mixed with every object and joined with almost every word in short a purer or more eloquent appeal for penitent vice  a more generous offering to persevering virtue or a more honorable discharge of fraternal duty amidst private heartfelt disappointments has rarely surpassed that which was then paid by john fitzorton  henry fitzorton had a soul to feel it he felt it indeed in all points but the one which gave luster to the rest of many touching and trying features in the character and conduct of his brother henry was still ignorant yet he knew enough to be convinced john fitzorton was to be ranked amongst the first of wise just and honorable men and that to him he stood indebted for the nearest and dearest obligations and in the present instance he felt most profoundly the generous principles on which he had acted and saw clearly into the motives from which he had spoken and when the narrative closed with the eulogy of olivia although by a thousand silent emotions he responded to all the preceding particulars he drew the eulogist to his bosom with a fervor that after a thrice repeated embrace he dropped from the arms of a brother on his knees to god  it is thou thou only must i supplicate o fountain of all power to make me more worthy of such friends  of such a brother  of such a wife on each on all be thy everlasting blessing  dearest henry said john while he raised him i am beyond all payment in your debt your conduct is at once my rebuke and my glory instead of winding my way from one mystic path to another with a caution that might seem leading to the haunts of infamy rather than to the recesses of innocence and really trembling from fear of discovery at every opening of my labyrinths as much as if i were actually carrying on a plan of fraud i might have gone on in the straight and direct line of amity and confidence and gained from your copartnership the same end by more expeditious and easy means the apology therefore that i have already found it necessary to make to charles stuart i now repeat to henry fitzorton  for every pleasure your olivia would have shared with you on the points i have conducted have been withheld from you by me and i was even in the act of projecting new concealments in order to keep you  from old misfortunes interposed henry  it remains with you resumed john to act as your judgment may decide as to the immediate scheme at the chapelhouse it is too late to recall the invitation and if it were not there could no strong reason be given for the cruelty of withholding the pious father arthur from his offerings in the little temple which his poor heart has consecrated nor for checking olivia in the glowing career of what her poor heart has projected i think it however likely that some of the abbey family will remain with sir guise and a ready reason to be given for your declining to go is  brother interposed henry i am rejoiced though surprised at my dear charless transfer yet on that subject there is much to be said the transfer to the second was made in a long absence from the first object  there to be sure answered john intersecting the discourse  both you and he have had an advantage over  over  many others the words many others were substituted for a name that hung trembling on the verge of the speakers lips ah my dearest john observed henry had my friend the lieutenant been exposed to the temptation of seeing before his eyes the scenes of his former passion  had he possessed only the faintly imitated the inanimate likeness of the features that first won his heart  brother henry answered john it is very possible  i  know it is  a  a friend of mine was  unfortunately  once in a situation of that sort  i  therefore know it is very possible  to be in the almost constant habit of seeing and speaking to the originals of such pictures  and whether the affections were transferrable or not  i am certain he never harbored a thought that  the hasty and lucky entrance of olivia put a stop to johns observations she came to relate the farther progress she had made in her project  but added she had instant employment for the muse of her darling henry the reader already knows the nature of that employment  and just as she had placed before him pen ink and paper and had whispered the subjects desiring john would go down stairs with her and leave the bard to the inspiration of friendship mr partington preceded by a volley of accusations set forth in his most vehement style burst into the room calling out an escape an escape the caitiff has robbed and plundered me of my treasure  taken out of my house a thing i chose to set a value on  his abominable self and those who harbor him are as bad as himself my dear railer said the colonel jocularly i am afraid i shall be henceforth entitled to your politeness for i have led you amongst many others into these strange roundabout mistakes john then entered into some partial explanations after which taking the squire by the hand he exclaimed and now my good friend if you will accompany me into the shrubbery and grant half an hours patience i will relate to you the rest partington easily saw he had heard as much as could safely be confided in the presence of olivia and went out with the colonel observing as he took off his hat with unusual civility  yes i begin to think you are one of my worthy gentlemen  chapter xli when john fitzorton had told his friend partington all that it was necessary for him to know he introduced that gentleman to his protegees mrs herbert and his johanna assuring him they were candidates for his most distinguished incivility and that they were as likely as any women he knew to deserve it o i have not the least doubt answered partingron when he was first presented  but i shall be obliged to set them down in my list of abominables i see it in both their faces indeed sir said johanna trembling betwixt fear and hope you cannot think how uneasy i have been lest you should take it into your fancy to be polite to me and for my part observed mrs herbert i should look on myself as a lost woman were you to pay me a compliment or make me a bow partington had long since heard their general and some of their particular misfortunes and therefore though he never saw either of them before he clapped on his hat which in truth seldom quitted his head but to express his aversion and walked off with them into the library arm in arm abusing them all the way as an earnest of what might farther be expected the colonel followed and seeing the cabinet door open they stopped there  henry was sitting at his desk with the pen still in his hand olivia leaning over and suiting what he had written to her guitar alternately running to another part of the library to try it on her harp  hush whispered partington we must not disturb the rascals i suppose while they are in that sort of mad fit  the poet and musician proceeded in a subject that touched every chord of their hearts perhaps neither of them heard the observations or saw the observers yet tears which by the position he who shed them concealed from olivia filled the eyes of henry and were not easily prevented from dropping on the lines he had composed similar drops suffused the lovely face and trembled in the voice of olivia as she adapted them to spontaneous harmony the genuine poesy of nature animated by the music of a benevolent heart olivia with diffident sweetness proposed the adoption of an epithet in one of the verses as more auspicious to sound but feared the sense would be injured the sound was her own the sense henrys henry substituted and confessed the sense was much improved to the bloom in olivias cheek on this compliment there is no description it was the bloom of gratitude and love who can paint it henry in turn improving on himself altered a thought and gave it poetic expression it occasioned the change of a whole distich and its aim was to prove that the recovery of a lost treasure was a richer possession than if we had never been bereaved o heaven what an idea exclaimed his wife and so it is  you mean the recovery of the little chapelhouse  the treasure of arthurs heart  it extends also to the chapel itself and what is yet more sacred to the solemn burialplace of the stuarts  the treasure of our carolines heart  ah how shall i give sound to this help help your despairing olivia my dear dear henry let the poet inspire the musician or o rather let the fountain of every pure and bounteous idea who bestowed the thought assist its melody it deserves the music of the spheres and to be sung by its angels  then it should be sung by olivia exclaimed henry rising from his chair and folding her with enthusiasm none but an angelic nature can surely attribute to every thought and word and deed the best and purest motive by providence i swear every moment of my life convinces me that i can never never merit thee not merit o ingrate to that providence answered olivia you merit every thing that is good  the closeted auditory now came from their recess they advanced even to olivias harp without speaking or being spoken to john had been weeping and was still extremely softened o thought he can it be in nature that olivia should love more tenderly than she is beloved  mrs herberts bosom throbbed at the remembrance of recollected happiness  her eye insensibly turned on john but she suffered it not to tarry johanna almost shrinking from herself timidly sighed to her own heart as she approached olivia ah charles charles how can thou ever fancy any resemblance betwixt thy poor johanna and olivia partington had struggled betwixt his nature and his habits a considerable time and as the one or the other obtained the mastery he was now ready with an ejaculation of unmixed tenderness or began a blessing with its inversing accompanyments  at length he got sufficiently into his old humor to exclaim as he took the hands of olivia and henry  i can only say that if you do not quite murder me before i get back i will here grant an act of oblivion to all the abominations that are past partington demanded a share in olivias plot  unless said john looking significantly at henry you think it best that you and partington should stay and abuse one another comfortably at home most readily answered henry with generous earnestness  our little gratulatory offerings are just finished and then   what not go to see and hear the effect of your sweet ode and beautiful hymn  my brother said john may be fatigued after his journey and with his unexpected flight to parnassus the air for odes you know is very far indeed up the poetic mountain sister and hymns i should think observed partington being heavenly can blow only from the summit  isnt it so you clambering caitiff fatigued cried olivia responding to the humor o how little do philosophers and gentlemen farmers know the unwearied spirit which poesy inspires  but i feel the reason that induces the bard to decline honoring us with his company he is ashamed of his musician  ashamed of her ejaculated henry  i would show her with pride to the host of heaven i am sensible resumed olivia that she has by no means done him justice  but on a meeting of so many dear and unexpected friends  methinks i beg pardon  i dare say you are all right  but i had so set my heart on his presence  the very laurel  yea the crown of my poor little project else i hope i should not have been quite so unreasonable  and then perhaps for the first time in all the years of their  to her blessed  to him alas unhappy marriage olivia fitzorton dropped on her husbands hand which she held to her lips a tear of disappointment and henry was the innocent cause  go brother whispered john o ever dear too tender and too good cried henry i thought mr partington might want company  i thought that my sudden and unexpected appearance might perhaps in a manner derange the plan  or perchance cried olivia correcting herself might alarm our beloved friends  caroline is indeed much out of health and her spirits have suffered you will hardly know her henry i am ashamed not to have thought of this  forgive my precipitance it would be wrong  yes i see it would at these words she walked backwards and forwards in the room by which she relieved not only herself but the rest of the company johns hopes revived as to henrys remaining at home and he was collecting arguments and reasons as to the propriety of that measure on the ground of olivias own remarks and partington was gathering together a round of scurrilities to back the colonel while henry with very worthy feelings sat down to the vain attempt of finishing his poetry  in the midst however of his employment which alas was rather that of making long crooked marks than legible words he said to john  still marking and the tones of his voice as irregular as the strokes of his pen  he hoped caroline stuart was not very ill  not  not  not in any danger this was the only time he had mentioned her name to his brother or any of his friends or even given an allusion to it except when his wifes conversation made it inevitable since the time he intimated a wish sanctioned by olivia to have some of the abbey furniture bought in for the former owners and even then it was by letter john making therefore full allowance for a question which tender friendship strictly warranted he pressed the hand of henry most affectionately and returned in whispers a consoling answer olivia after walking had sat herself down by the side of her harp bending pensively over it and now and then drawing from it a saddening note suddenly however she struck the chords to happier sounds and looking at her friends through the spaces of her harpstrings still enlivening the air she paused to exclaim  i believe there is something of magic even in an instrument of music it has this moment inspired me with a thought to turn all the jarring of our late objections as to dear henrys being of our party into harmonious concord  the rest of the company were again thrown out of their arrangements  you may rememember resumed olivia springing up after pressing her lips on the harp and protesting she loved it dearly as a friend you cannot indeed forget the west door that leads from the little cypress walk to the cemetery and thence ascends by steps to the chapel of that door knowing it is never opened but at the time of sepulture i have not yet delivered the key but i know where to find it in a moment henry and i had occasion for it several times when we were carrying on our monumental labors there my henry you may see yet be unseen i will drop the curtain before the door of the chapelhouse and as i mean that to be the boundary of the first evenings exhibitions to the oblivion of as much as may be of every melancholy thought that lies beyond there will not be the shadow of a reason to shut my henry out of a sight of the happiness to which he has so largely contributed while we are all shielded from what we were apprehensive of before what a lucky thought now dont fall into your philosophies again dear john and pray do you mr insufferable stand prepared to join my brother in escorting the ladies of the castle when it is their cue to swell the scene the poet i see has not a dissentient word to offer and so the musician will go fetch the sacred key and summon jane to conclude the preparatives she left her associates to finish her generous plan and left them too without a reason to check her that abominable villain cries partington carries all her points after all the lordly oak man is but as a switch to that little twiglooking shrub in blossom called woman heigho i should not wonder if one of these days a thing of this kind should steal the heart out of my tough old trunk by the bye where is that mrs herbert gone from something i saw i take that lady to be an arrant scoundrel well i will have no hand in this matter you are a couple of wife caitiffs and i leave it between you settle it and let me know i am ready for any mischief you propose how shall it be settled my very dear and good henry most affectionately enquired the colonel when partington went out you see our predicament best of men and of brothers answered henry trust me as far as i will trust myself i am clear even at this moment in which the pulses of my head and heart beat with a violence i can neither help nor account for i am clear that it would not be in the power of any earthly being  no not the being nearest to omnipotence in potency over my soul  to draw me from the honor esteem reverence and almost worship due to my angelic wife and which it has long been my pride to make happiest of the happy but i know not as yet my weakness or my strength whether to consider the thronging emotions that now flush my cheek shake my frame and possess my bosom as symptoms of terror or of triumph  henry manifested vehement and tumultuous agitations while he spoke perhaps the sensations which are now penetrating the central mansions of my soul resumed he catching eagerly the the hand of john may be the result only of too many surprises suddenly accumulated and mingling together  perhaps i only want tranquillity to arrange select and separate them  perhaps  and o join me in supplicating god that it may  perhaps the love the virtues the good faith the guileless mind of my dear dear olivia may rise paramount the unrivalled victor and lawful sovereign of my breast perhaps the eye and voice and hand of long lost friends will encounter mine with gentle and salutary greeting cordial to each to all brother i am determined on the trial the visible and invisible method proposed is favorable fear me not i will glide with the silence of death along the wellknown mansions of the dead and if i find that my hour is not yet come for the only sort of association which the holy peace of my olivia requires i should form with any other human creature and which is alone what i ought to give or to receive in that moment i will retire unheard unseen and never again be led into a similar temptation  amidst all the fiery wildness of this speech the inconceivable rapidity with which part of it was uttered and the fearful starts that attended much of the action there was on the whole such a genuine and generous virtue in the idea and such connection in the plan that john who had been more depressed by fear than elevated by hope now came to a kind of compromise with those passions and thought it best to let the proposal take place and trust the direction of the event to that providence which when human circumspection proves insufficient and sometimes alas counteracts as if in mockery its own too attentive care can render the dreaded circumstance the cause of producing the very effect of which shallow plotting laborious mortals supposed it would be utterly subversive  chapter xlii thus have we explained one of the extraordinary appearances which met the eye of caroline stuart giving at the same time a view of henry fitzortons return to the castle and we have unfolded these points and the incidents with which they connect after rather than before their taking place that the reader might enjoy the like impression of the magic scenery of the chapelhouse unbroken by anticipations but events also of great moment happened in the house of fitzorton after these chapelhouse scenes were over and having settled those tumults of the stuart family that fell out about the same period this is the due place to go on with progressive circumstances  caroline stuart was not the first who had bent the knee at the tomb of her mother henry fitzorton had done homage there before her but that was not his immediate devotion when the conference betwixt himself and the colonel ended he repaired to that hallowed spot where his own progenitors lay inurned and where the everfriendly fitzortorns and clares united even in death mingled their sacred dust there sometimes with olivia but oftener alone had he directed his steps there would he recite the struggles of his head and heart his infirmities his fortitude there conceal his tears from the living and confide them to the spirits of death his last visit was of a milder sort he sought the ashes of sir armine in smiles for he sought it to pour forth his congratulations to assure the aweful inhabitants which surrounded him and chiefly they whom it most concerned his honored parents that after struggling with solitude and society with the powers of love and of insanity with the rooted passion of his heart and the horrible suggestions of murder  self murder all all the sad effects of one dire mistake the constrained disposal of his hand the virtues of olivia had weaned him from the fell intents of despair and death and won him back to reason and life he no longer loathed the earth his heart had become susceptible of comfort he honored the choice which his father had made for him he had sacrificed his own he loved his children his brothers were parts of his own existence his neighborhood was dear and blessed be god he could at last survey all its objects without terror the dark cloud that seemed to cover the heavens and the earth again admitted some rays of light even as if recreated to his eye it chiefly beamed from the power he still had to bless his wife for himself the die had been cast the bolt would rive where it struck he was a wreck but he had perhaps been the plank to save others from sinking and he was thankful  such were henrys confessions in the vault of his fathers when he first felt the influence they describe but motives of a still more affecting kind now drew him to those mansions o my father my father cried he in rapid and earnest supplication kneeling by the coffins that held the relicts of both his parents now assist your son  now strengthen your henry  let not the deep scar that has seamed the wound be again torn open spare i conjure you the son whom your misguided  but blessed hand has laid long since on the altar  and you my mother whose cold dust is more precious than the vital power which warms these clasping arms assist thy husbands prayer  o let not the victim who has so lately survived his sacrifice be bound again driven back on all he loved  on all he feared  alas on all he shunned oh ye spirits of heaven who once inhabited these holy ruins do i invoke  and thou o venerable father of my olivia do thou become a suppliant with the god of power in the cause of thy beloved child  pray alike for the husband and the wife and all their little ones  having breathed these aspirations he returned to the castle there waited for him her for whose felicity he had importuned the dead and the spirits that live for ever lovely and scarcely less pure than one of those  she presented to him the fatal key that was to give him once more the view of caroline stuart all is on my part ready my henry said olivia but surely you are unwell  unquiet  the approaching scene will cheer you come dearest let love conduct you to friendship you must not feel these things too strongly she led him to the western door then passed hastily through the place of sepulture ascended the chapel showed him the manner how jane and she had contrived the curtain so as to give him sight into the chapelhouse and a security from others then after many a tender expression went tound to the other door accompanied by her jane and with a heart throbbing with benignity waited to confer happiness impatient of delay only as it retarded the communication the cause of that delay on the part of arthur and his friends has been made known to the reader on the part of mrs fitzorton and jane atwood it was filled by rendering their preparatives more acceptable while henry gliding with steps now well sustained and now faltering corresponding to the risings or sinkings of his spirit alternately ruminated in the burial place at the tomb of lady matilda and at the altar of the chapel  at length the moment came and that moment was decisive he heard again the sound of carolines voice he saw from his secret stand her downcast eye her sainted air her sacred form and he saw the change which sorrow longsuffering corroding cares and perpetual vigils had caused he hastily desc ended into the burial place and concealed his heartfelt groans and shed his burning tears on her mothers coffin soon ah soon must she join you here o mouldered beauty  but alas her figure has already been the prey of the tyrant the canker of grief i see has eaten into the core of her heart and with immitigable tooth is still devouring her alive  he returned to his place of observation the room was filled with objects dear to his thoughts yet he fastened but on one his trembling eye now deluged with tears and now parched by a fever of the soul fixed on and followed caroline olivias music was unheeded his own poesy extinguished all that beauty love and benevolence had done to grace the scene was covered from his view as with the mantle of death  almost suffocated with sensations and their proper reliefs controuled he again descended into the chambers of darkness he wept supplicated and again returned exhausted at length he sat down on one of the seats of the porch scarce had a minute elapsed ere the other seat was filled also filled by caroline the mourner had there attempted to weep and to pray unobserved by the happy her sight was dim and her hands crossed over her eyes a heavy sigh broke from her heart and penetrated that of henry alas he was within its breath an answering sigh heaved his own bosom and he rose caroline started henry had moved some paces and was half lost in the darkness of the chapel but a saint light from the refectoire by the aperture in the curtain and the opening which caroline had left on effecting her concealment gleamed indistinctly on the chapel a figure moved before her more aweful more affecting than all she had seen in the subterraneous passage it had the motion of henry but in the next moment it rushed forward and was seen no more  chapter xliii henry paused awhile in the burial place to wish he had been numbered amongst its inhabitants before he had witnessed the scene  from a farther view of which he was hurrying  and then past on he reached the castle a considerable time before the rest of the party  before indeed the colonel and partington with the ladies could have got to the chapelhouse in order to escort olivia he luckily therefore gained his chamber which was that his father had used without interruption the very sword with which john had punished sir guise stuart hung over the chimney piece henry looked at it and traversed the apartment with wild and irregular steps on the flash of a sudden thought he closed the windows on the inside  locked and bolted his door  he took down the sword drew it from the sheath and examined its point  no said he this  this  may not be the instrument the blood which was shed in defense of a father shall not be washed out by that of a son even though that father has made life insupportable  he replaced the sword  but his senses were still unsettled and the dire image of selfdestruction appeared still to possess him perceiving a movement about the bed  he leaped up and throwing aside the curtains demanded furiously who dared to interrupt him only little john papa exclaimed a soft voice your own dear little john who has crept into your bed just to get a kiss and a good night from you and mamma  when you came home  as you all ran away from me and left me to myself a whole  whole evening just as if i had no papa or mamma at all  which god forbid  for what would poor little john or great john either or even sister with all her beauty do without them  a voice  yes it was a voice from heaven exclaimed henry running to the bed dear dear boy you have saved your poor father  you have saved him from   from what papa o how cold you are  do come to bed little john shall warm you in his bosom  just thus said the son carrying his fathers hand to his breast ah let us warm one anothers hearts papa and i have not said my prayers yet  so we may say them together  and so we will my blessed deliverer cried henry tenderly kissing the child and laying down by his side and johnny shall beg of god to love  to forgive his father  and god will hear him oh that he will and you too papa  for he hears all good people i can say all you set me by heart  mamma has heard me every night since you were gone the belief the lords prayer and the ten commandments without missing a word  now only hark hereupon the innocent prattler repeated those holy ordinances in which henry with repentant spirit fervently joined and when he came to the inhibition of murder an icy horror shot through his conscious heart and as he thrice repeated the words  o wretched man he cried what did thy rashness meditate  would thou have put to death at one stroke father wife children and friends and exposed thy immortal soul to the wrath of the eternal o what wicked man would have killed all those papa do let us say over our prayers again  to beg god almighty to forgive him too for mamma says the good should pray for the naughty if they be ever so wicked o how often have i heard her pray for that bad  bad sir guise of the abbey very often indeed but not so often as she has blessed good papa ah how she does love papa  not more than johnny though  saying this the soother threw his arms fondly round his selfrebuking parent drew him by many a fold closer to his little heart and composed the troubled soul to sensations of piety and peace the intercession of a spotless child was offered up for the evil thoughts his despair had induced and after he had again and again supplicated the throne of mercy and of grace the kind restorer of harassed nature sunk him to repose  when the company returned olivias first enquiries were directed toward her husband somewhat alarmed at hearing he had not been seen she ran through the rooms it was usual with him to frequent and at last coming into her chamber she found both the father and the son fast asleep in each others arms  tenderly impressing a kiss and breathing a sigh of pride and happiness on them both she made her report below stairs to the comfort of the anxious colonel and to the satisfaction of all  as henry awoke he saw his brother john standing by his side and how fares my dear and still good henry enquired he with generous solicitude  well  yet not good well  yet most wicked but question me not tonight in the morning i will unfold myself  shall we not see you amongst us will not your absence seem strange asked the colonel  let the fatigue of my journey and subsequent walking watching etc explain and excuse it i am unequal to company at present but if olivia brings me a glass of wine after your repast i will drink her dear health in it  but not till the withdrawing hour meantime i will to bed and this blessed boy to whom i owe more than life must be our companion for this one night i cannot endure the thoughts of his removal now  do tell his mother so see how sound he sleeps brother such is the repose of innocence  as henry made these reflections he caressed his son  repeated his obligations to him  took his little hand from the spot where it was laid  on his fathers breast  to press it to his lips  then replaced it while john delighted by the effect without knowing there was any thing astonishing in the cause  henry being at all times an exemplary father  went down stairs and with faithful pleasure related what he had heard and seen  when olivia soon after withdrew she found that her little john and henry had again fallen asleep and sincerely uttering a prayer for both including in it her absent daughter and all the friends whom she presumed she had made as happy as herself she crowned a day of benevolent exertion with a night of undisturbed repose  chapter xliv henry when he awoke complained of an extreme headache and imputed it to the heat of the apartment alas the heat was in himself for it was toward the end of october and the air had been sharpened in the night by a frost it is very early i believe my sweet olivia said he to his wife whose pure and light slumbers were easily chased away although they had been serene yet i think continued he that a turn or two in the garden will do me good i will rise and attend you love answered olivia henry overruled this consider said he i stole home to bed long before you and it is but fair that you should be even with me another thing is i propose to return presently and besides the dear boy you see sleeps still hush we shall disturb him poor fellow tell him if he should wake before i come back to remember me in his morning prayers and kiss him for me a thousand times for his evening ones  and o tell him too that i live only for himself his sister and his mother  the fondest dearest wishes of mrs fitzorton being ever included in performing those of her husband she begged him to guard against the early air which however warm it might seem to him in the chamber would be different out of doors and then she resigned him tenderly to himself  at the foot of the great staircase that led into the grand hall from which there were two doors the one commanding a view of the woodlands of the abbey the other leading to the grounds and park of the castle through the shrubbery he stood for a few moments divided in his thoughts at which of the doors to go out  as if following the impulse of nature his first movements were toward that which led to the mansion of sir guise stuart yet turning from thence abruptly even while his hand was upon the bar that fastened it he hurried to the one which led into his own grounds as if in obedience to the dictate of duty and reason but he was much surprised to observe either that some one of the family had gone forth even sooner than himself or that his servants had been very negligent for the door was not only unbolted and unlocked but very slightly closed  he entered the park crossed into the shrubbery and walked up and down the first path that presented itself his mind crowded with thought  a mist blending with the frost had rendered objects dreary and indistinct every drooping shrub and every flower in the train of autumn were loaded with heavy dew half dissolved and half congealed as the hasty steps of henry brushed them away he exclaimed  yes  all nature is in tears he sighed and passed on the sun rose and gradually dispersing the fog displayed the later beauties of the year more clearly but showed them in their decline henry after exercise too violent for either felicity or health stood leaning against an alcove on the outside he saw the withering leaf fall alike from the loftiest tree and the most lowly shrub  such is man thought he and such the equal fate of the ambitious and the humble as his eye surveyed the different objects within its reach and beheld on all the visible signs of sickness and decay all nature is dying cried he aloud  see even at the point of death then what is man  immortal answered a voice immediately from behind the place where he stood it was the voice of john fitzorton the brothers embraced for once said the colonel my dear henry i am a more early wanderer than yourself my night was unquiet but i trust yours was sweet and yet the remarks i heard you just now make or rather the tones in which they were expressed seem not the result of a refreshing sleep  dearest brother cried henry if sleep which is but for a night is sweet what must be the sleep of death  still sweeter answered john for that is eternal waking  i have wholly recovered the tone of my mind henry since i came into the garden observe the wide spreading ravage of the vegetable world as it lies around us in ruins  i have observed it with a sinking heart and it has made me descend atom as i am into a more modest sense of my own insignificancy brother said henry with an air of selfabasement  and my heart on the contrary resumed john it has elevated from this low earth to the heaven of heavens  from things perishable to powers that shall never know corruption  from my decaying body to my everlasting soul that proud oak my brother may in this poor world maintain its station far longer than its lord even though the honors are now falling from its top but when its very roots shall be trampled into dust by the power which puts all mortal things under his feet i trust in the pardoner of offenses and the recompencer of virtue that henry john and james fitzorton and all who are dear to them will be rejoicing in the unfading bliss of eternity be proud then my brother ascend to the dignity of yourself  rise to the sublime height of your own nature  the eyes of henry were streaming with tears yet they were raised to heaven and o he cried it is from the pardoner of offense not the recompenser of virtue that henry must have hope in death  my brother continued he i am weak as childhood  but alas without its innocence yet what have i not attempted  what will i not attempt to fulfill every duty  to avoid every snare o thou my brother and my friend  thou christian  philosopher  guide and conduct me back to scenes of less agonising thought and keep me there  forbear ah still forbear to question me i have kept within the conditions i ascended from the gloomy repositories of death and saw the one created being most afflicting most dear to sight  saw her scarce living  about to be numbered with their cold inhabitants yet i did not rush into her presence i felt her heartsick figh upon my cheek i saw her sink almost at my feet  yet raised her not to my arms  but left her  left her on the cold ground and with savage speed rushed from her fainting form you had my promise and it has not been broken so far virtue and my brother are obeyed but i must move again from hence beings far far more valued more valuable than myself demand it  my wife my dear wife my children my friends  yet i know not how or where  nor can i think  o think for me  something and speedily must be done or all must be lost  this throbbing head this panting heart  all  all  foretell it  he clung round his brothers neck  then started from him and then again enfolded him  now incongruous now coherent as he spoke  and womans love no not the love of his olivia could more fondly return his embraces soothe his wandering pity his weakness or confirm his hope than did the rugged john fitzorton in this trying moment he kissed his cheek wiped away the tears he found upon it yet bathed it with his own ah my unhappy henry my dearest and still good brother  virtuous even in agony yet o be comforted think on the more disastrous wretch  alone and hopeless  to whose sad fate i pointed in our late conversation shut for ever from his object by bonds yet stronger  bonds which even death could not remove  yet forbid the privilege of escape and condemned by inexorable necessity  even by virtue  strange mysterious fate to see her for months for years the only form that could ever truly enchant his eye to hear the only voice that was ever music to his ear  not like the voice of the siren that once lured and betrayed  and to observe the only mind which has ever conveyed to his idea the most perfect image of truth and goodness ah think on him  on him not culled from fancys painted store  but one whom i have known a real victim and had you known him too you would have wept his sorrows and if not forgot your own have owned that they were blessedness to his indeed you would yet never never shall she know the cause of his despair  all the powers of wonder and of pity seemed suddenly to overspread the face of henry and as he examined the countenance of john with an earnestness he had never looked into it before retiring gently from his arms he appeared to puzzle awhile betwixt conjecture and discovery and then run again into his brothers embraces   shall she know exclaimed the astonished henry is he still existing still one who sees that form who hears that music who observes the workings of that heavenly soul  then is he a wretch indeed o brother i should commiserate that man were he a villain but were he good and just and virtuous even such a man as thee my brother i should mix adoration with my pity and do homage to him as to a wounded god could ought of divinity receive a wound  henry appeared to be sinking from his brothers arms and had bent one knee on the ground as he ceased speaking  even as though he thought his closing words applied but john hurrying him up as if not unconscious of his meaning yet more than he expressed cried with a voice of some trouble hush brother for heavens sake hush we are observed  yes indeed said little john who came running up the alcove walk followed by olivia you can come into the garden to hug my uncle mr papa but leave poor mamma and i to ourselves  i am come here my dearest henry to invite you to a dish of coffee which on account of your early rising and walking may do you good so i got up to make it myself and if the colonel has been as early a rambler as yourself it will be of service to him likewise  nor shall it be refused my ever good olivia said henry i will answer for us both and this blessed boy shall partake  yonder too i see partington and his ladies let us lose no time then  a tranquil nay a pleasant breakfast ensued even to the surprise of olivia herself who from little johns perplexed account and the last nights discourse and from her own morning observations had her fears that henry was again out of health or spirits john was at first the most taciturne on this occasion of the whole party but resumed himself in the course of the repast and henry from whatever motive was for the whole of that day more tranquil than he had been at any period since his last arrival at the castle partington whose spirits were always elated or depressed by the fair or soul weather of those he loved now found the fitzortons who had long been his grand barometers more calm and temperate than from the late stormy violences he had reason to expect he therefore gave a loose to his accustomed scurrility mixed with a thousand good humoured turns with such effect as settled him in the best opinions of johanna and mrs herbert who on their part contrived also by their endearing behavior to olivia to be set down amongst his most atrocious incorrigibles  chapter xlv on the day following however the tempest which had thus blown over returned it had rolled to a distant quarter but rolled back to its point henry in great disorder sought a second conference with john my brother said the former there is no bringing all mens minds any more than their persons to an equal size or strength i honor the greatly good and greatly suffering being who lives unsubdued by temptation but i cannot reach his virtue i cannot profit by his example i will not disgrace myself or distress you by telling you where these truant feet guided by my erring heart would have led me in the twilight of yesterday when you remember i petitioned for and obtained a solitary hour  to the abbey no doubt answered john much discomposed fatal was the hour in which my erring heart conducted thither its old inhabitants you have paid them a visit i presume and in one moment brought to naught the labored project of many a diligent hour shallow thoughted mortals behold here another lesson to humble the pride of human foresight i am fallen with the fabric i raised and shall bury my friends brother sister and all whom i would have saved in the ruins  o no my brother answered henry you have erected a temple to pity friendship honor and i trust in god to happiness i and i only feel myself unworthy to enter its sacred gates and do homage there mistake me not  weak fragile as i am i have not invaded by willing rashness the sanctuary where your generous hand has placed the penitent and the mourner but blushing i confess that i bent my misguiding steps that way  yes i took a forbidden path the one rarely trodden  and yet even there i met my dear my long lost  caroline said john no her brother said henry i am sorry for it observed the colonel the lieutenant was rash and forgot the bounds prescribed the bounds of honor  within those bounds i saw him answered henry then the rashness was yours yet you said you had not intruded nor did i the rencontre happened in a place where i could expect to meet only the form of melancholy  the subterraneous passage  even there my friend rushed upon me unawares from an angle almost at the caverns mouth so far from expecting he furiously seized my throat demanding the name of the lurking ruffian the midnight robber he had at last detected a drawn sword was in his hand  and in the next instant would have been in my heart had not the wellknown voice and name of henry fitzorton arrested the stroke o gracious heaven i should have murdered my friend my dear dear henry fitzorton ejaculated he in an agony and as he spoke a groan  no doubt the work of terrified fancy seemed to sound near the place where we stood he threw down the instrument of death and pressed me to his bosom my friend was in my arms i ask not o my henry said he the state of your heart  you no doubt have heard the state of mine but if yours be not all olivias or even if it be forbear i conjure you to invade my sisters peace he then hurried to other subjects talked to me of fearful sights of frightful founds  told me that such an air of mystery had there invested the abbey both within and without  he was himself that night come forth armed to attempt a discovery and had encountered strange appearances which eluded his pursuit he informed me that jerome and jonathan with the intrepid arthur and his fearless floresco were also on the watch in their different stations he concluded alas by giving me credit for virtues i have never possessed applauded my considerate my godlike benevolence as he called it in administering comfort to the wretched myself unseen and then ended by observing that as the prosperity of his family had been derived from the kindness of john so would the peace of his sister dearer than all other possessions be protected by henry fitzorton  ah my beloved brother i could only answer by ardently straining him to my bosom pouring out my blessings on his house on my knees asseverating that if the power were mine i would watch and combat for years unwearied to repel its enemies  and then alas unequal to farther converse i ran back with trembling steps from the cavern into the forests disguising my agitation in sudden illness and yet heaven knows that was not counterfeit  behold the history of my unsought trespass  behold dear john and prevent its repetition i have lost all confidence in myself others therefore should not trust me  o think of some means to save me then from myself your plan for that safety shall be mine  generous charles and worthy henry i trust a fair reward awaits ye both cried the colonel  your narrative brother has filled me with various objects for reflection but the one which more immediately presses is that which regards yourself  the grief of this poor conflicting bosom here john in his usual way sat himself down to solitary thought while henry perceiving his son at sport in the garden went to his little consoler and preserver as now he called him hoping to gain composure enough to bear such endearing society before he returned to his wife  although the time advanced more near when olivia would naturally require and receive the tenderest support from the attentions of her husband yet as it was altogether improper to convey her at such a moment from her comfortable home where all had been long ready for perhaps one of the greatest trials of human nature even though human kind is thence continued on the earth yet as the pressure of unforeseen events and surrounding circumstances had made the environs of the castle and the abbey more perilous to all the inhabitants even than they had ever been before and as on every possible ground of discretion henrys virtuous and manly proposition ought to be adopted it was settled by the good colonel that his brother should again be stolen by partington  that little john in order to be exchanged for little caroline who was still at bury should be of the runaway party  that mrs herbert should be trusted with the scheme and that just as it was about to take place  the coach at the door and trunks packed  john should betray the conspiracy and undertake to bring about mrs fitzortons consent  this arrangement was only part of what was forming in the colonels mind he believed that now sir guise was much recovered the whole abbey family might be removed at least beyond the track and out of the observation of his brother and this he thought would be a wise measure free of all other considerations as it would convey them from a spot surrounded with dangers he imagined henry might then come back and that while his worthy mind was employed as he well knew it would be in the soothing offices of which his olivia would then stand in need he should have no aching void left for the division of a wandering image and indeed he began to think it would be best for the castle family to settle elsewhere when such a measure could sfely be proposed  all of this plan which was then proper for henry to know was imparted henry yielded and was much soothed by the idea of little john being his companion  and yet alas my brother sighed he what have i to hope from the preservation of a few days or months or even years  every thing even from a few hours answered john the evil which has been growing for half the life of man may by the providence of god be in a moment removed let us rely on that providence and by taking what at least appear the best measures hope that they will be directed to that end henry sighed and assented  partington was ductile to every generous aim all was prepared with secrecy and dispatch and while partington was handing his party into the coach railing and raving in whisper  the colonel who had been conducting his impeachment and detailed his charges brought round mrs fitzorton to assist him in apprehending the conspirators  i seize you ladies and gentlemen said john in the name of olivia o thou most incorrigible goodfornothing traitor exclaimed the squire bundling in little john who enjoyed the scheme at his heart and seeing johanna with olivia i have a good mind to have that handsome hussy into the bargain then shutting the door after he had leaped in himself he flourished his hat crying  aha this is trick for trick one runaway job for another let the rascal see if he can escape again  i have him now father and son old dame partlet and the familycoach into the bargain  drive on caitiffs  drive on and never stop till you get to the end of the world  the postillions setting it all down as a new frolic of their old squire who was a great favorite with them all obeyed orders and away they drove but tears stood in the eyes of olivia  it is but for a day or two  and to bring back my sweet little niece and partingtons brother the physician who is daily expected at the bury from the east indies and in short to strengthen and enliven our party on the ir return  and so even let them go dearest sister said the colonel well then sighingly answered mrs fitzorton  we must endeavor to do without them a little but still i know not the time when i could so ill spare them  would to heaven i could any way render the loss of their society less irksome said the soft and diffident johanna but perhaps the good lieutenant and  should the baronets health permit  that of caroline might do much  truly sweet maid answered mrs fitzorton if any thing in nature could fill the void which the absence of my husband and children always leaves the consolations you propose to me would have their effect yet under the most gloomy sensations such society must be most welcome to my heart  i will myself go to the abbey said the colonel and make report how far our society may be admissible  chapter xlvi having thus in some sort reconciled both the ladies under his protection john fitzorton directed his steps to the abbey where however many objects of increasing difficulty remained to be adjusted for although the generous conduct of his unhappy brother the tender display of the true and modest feelings of johanna and his own still unyielded power of mind had softened the past scenes the prospect of the future rose to his view convolved in clouds the dispersion or even clearing of which seemed to require an energy greater than any he had yet employed  to him therefore who can bring light out of darkness he breathed an earnest prayer as he took the way that led to the abbey for john fitzorton was not a convert to that weakly proud doctrine which depends wholly on human means but always thought  and as he thought  he acted the philosophical enlightened and ennobled christian character as he proceeded toward the abbey he encountered burton upon the back of his little horse busy posting to the castle the whole detail of the apothecary immediately described the terrors under which his patient labored in consequence of the illusive appearances  adding thereto an account of those which he and his friends had seen in their way to the chapelhouse  i know nothing about such ghostly fancies cried john but the sooner your patient and indeed all his family can get from them the better in a word my friend i am projecting a general remove for as matters have turned i see no tranquillity either of soul or of body in this once peaceful and happy neighborhood at present our first operation is on sir guise stuart if we can but get him by any means into a traveling situation i think i still see a path out of all our perplexities burton declared he had hopes if no new phantasms and disturbances real or imaginary fell out a few more nights rest would give to his patient and to all the family the degree of strength necessary to the occasion  meanwhile answered the colonel rejoiced at this intelligence as you must know henry has been hurried back to the bury by partington the limits of our poor prisoners at the abbey may be enlarged and to that purpose am i now going to the abbey but since we have met you my good friend will best settle this matter while i return home to make preparations for the general movements the apothecary answered that he would lose no time in setting the captive brother and sister free turning round the nimble busy and gallopped back to the abbey  but neither charles nor caroline were in a situation to enjoy even the blessings of liberty for scarce had henry exchanged the mournful but affectionate adieus with his friend in the subterraneous passage ere the terrified francisco came to implore the lieutenant to follow his steps then led him some paces farther along the cavern where an object assailed his eyes that almost reduced him to the condition of that object he saw his beloved sister stretched on the cold ground and in a swoon fain would he have numbered that heartpiercing sight also amongst the visions that seemed to hover around but alas it was the real caroline and the groan which struck the doubtful ears of charles and henry was hers  impelled by her apprehensions on the delay of the lieutenant and auguring ill from his enterprise she had impulsively explored the winding paths of the cave and she reached a part near which her brother had taken his station even as the words  murdered henry fitzorton my dearest friend were bursting from his lips she fell lifeless at the sound  and when somewhat restored finding herself supported by her brother she exclaimed what murdered dead  her senses still wandering  your friend  henry fitzorton murdered him it was then a warning voice  a warning shade i heard and saw in the chapel  o god o god  the dreadful image again weighed down and closed every faculty and again she fainted in the lieutenants arms she was deaf to all his explanations meantime floresco had summoned father arthur and his party to her assistance and by them she was conveyed even as if the hand of death were on her back to the abbey in vain did the lieutenant assure her the words she heard were only part of a sentence the object of which went to congratulate himself that he had escaped the dire murder which impended she was beyond all sense of hearing and remained so for many hours at length her struggles terminated in sleep finding when she awoke that she was in her own chamber with her kind attendants to which were now added both the apothecarys daughters  sitting round her bed and the still faithful still favored little fitz reposing on his carpet at her side and the lieutenant anxiously waiting the moment to explain the whole appeared to have really been the effect of her late distempered fancy in sleep yes it must be a dream said she but the most terrible that ever fancy teemed with  has any thing happened my good friends  no dearest caroline answered charles unwilling to hazard more until she was more able to bear even happy tidings  and is all well here and elsewhere questioned she all replied the lieutenant our father mends fast  we hope to see him down stairs soon indeed said caroline smiling and are none of our friends or benefactors come to any thing grievous none said the lieutenant  what nobody murdered  heaven forbid answered the lieutenant and just as he was going to unfold the cause of her fears she exclaimed then certainly it was a dreadful dream and i will try to think of it no more burton was of opinion that at present it would be best to let that idea continue observing that by the time it was chased away by a connected recollection of circumstances more happy effects would be derived from their developement this plan was therefore adopted and the several confidants received a charge from the lieutenant not to hint the subject until if ever that should be the case it was brought forward by himself and even then said he father arthur or i had better relate it  the connected recollections however soon came to the mind of caroline when at her desire she was left to herself every dreadful sound was repeated to her ear and smote her heart yes said she it is beyond dispute henry fitzorton is murdered  and o heaven and earth his bosom friend  my brother some dire mischance it could not be design my brother has been the murderer  it was in that place of delusion and darkness  o most terrible to thought yet alas there remains not a hope it could not be a dream that agonized by suspense i left my fathers apartment  wandered forth into the ruins and entered the cave of  death  of murder  murder  of the noblest best of beings  and alas ere this perchance of thee poor widow olivia  rash dreadful deed and the wound will be mortal also to him who gave it will charles put henry to death and survive the blow impossible let me not reproach him  ah rather let me try to soothe to comfort to reconcile him to life  to life and can that be made supportable to the murderer of henry fitzorton  these images gained strength from reflection and from afterobservations she perceived the lieutenant assiduously waiting an opportunity to unfold himself she remarked that on her observing him with unwonted scrutiny he appeared to shrink from her inspection and yet that he labored to communicate she found that he even began a kind of tale and then broke it off abruptly and although this proceeded but from an observance of his own plan presettled betwixt him and burton she referred it all to the one point most horrible and thereupon not doubting but that her brother was the victim of conscious misery she resolved on her part not to renew the subject in his presence but if possible to mourn it in secret accordingly whenever a word or look from any of her attendants or from the lieutenant escaped that might tend thereto she indicated by an immediate change of discourse that it was unwelcome to her and as it was hence supposed to be her wish there should be no revival of the circumstances it was agreed upon by her friends never more to advert to them but what farther established caroline in her full belief was the never having seen any of the fitzorton family since the supposed event alas said she to herself they are all deeply mourning the calamity and shun more assiduously even than before these ever illfated walls  her former distresses acute and manifold as they were the loss of her fathers love the disappointment of her own heart even the untimely fate of her everhonoured and lamented mother all seemed less heavy to her sinking soul than the death of henry fitzorton  yet she did not allow even this bitter aggression to interrupt the duties which still called her toward her father the moment she could rise from the room to which her fatal misconception had confined her she passed her time as usual in the chamber of sir guise her cares this way at least were attended with a success that carried a ray of consolation to her heart even in the zenith of its despair sir guise daily gained strength a time was fixed for his leaving his chamber and burton pronounced that he might venture in midday to air himself under the support of his son and daughter  penetrated by this chearing information caroline exerted herself to the utmost not to throw a cloud over this prospect sir guise had more than once asked after the miniature of his injured wife and caroline took it from her bosom and he pressed it to his lips she led him into her own apartment at his strong urgence and when his eye caught the family picture he kneeled down to it and wept he recognized in the furniture several of those very objects which had rent his conscious heart at robert irwins the sight of them now excited emotions less terrifying but more salutary his seelings were still wounded by reflection but not harrowed by remorse yet he was conveyed back to his apartment in a state to move the pity of a foe  nevertheless the morning found him again refreshed in this situation of affairs the lieutenant who had received instructions from colonel fitzorton to watch the first favorable opportunity told caroline not without the difficulty however which the first suggestion of such an idea to his sister in her circumstances would excite that he had some thoughts of proposing to sir guise a change of air indeed said he i am of opinion we ought all to quit the neighborhood  and an occasion offers by means of a friend for its being done almost immediately and with the necessary caution  and that carriages have been some time in readiness  carriages exclaimed caroline yes said the lieutenant so many sad events and strange matters environ and are hourly happening in this place that methinks we cannot leave it too soon  and leave it for ever think of it my sister said he and left her  if there had wanted a confirmation of the murder this would have supplied it to the trembling caroline he would fly from the spot where the blood was shed thought she her own blood froze in her bosom  but blood calls for blood exclaimed she alas perhaps my brothers own life is in danger roused by this thought she ran to the lieutenant and eagerly yet fearfully whispered but without confessing her suspicions that she would be ready at any hour but that if it should be thought more safe for him to go first she would follow with her father the instant he was able and a secure place should be found she spoke in great disorder and as the lieutenant was going to answer came an immediate summons from sir guise whom the messenger reported to be dying every power of carolines soul flew to this point she forgot that she had another cause for grief in the world  chapter xlvii the baronet was laboring under an internal malady notwithstanding all appearances and though it had not hitherto stopped the great functions of life had been undermining his constitution by a slow but consuming progress after a whole day of composure during which his pulse eye and appetite gave to general spectators every hope of increasing convalescence he dropped into a lethargic kind of sleep in the midst of which he rent the air with the most piercing shrieks succeeded by long heavy groans that terminated in sighs and tears  the paroxysms became more and more frequent impairing at each return every power of body and of mind in truth the conscience of this unhappy man was aroused beyond the power of being appeased by the usual propitiations it was the neverdying worm which sensibility of crime had at length lodged in his bosom  and in his moments of reflection so penetrated and devoured his heart that he was perhaps in the only tolerable state when every ray of intellect was quenched in delirium in both these afflicting situations caroline remained a martyr to her vigilance and want of exercise as well as of repose she seemed indeed fearful that the slightest movements might disturb him she doubled the carpeting  entreated that her brother the apothecary and every attendant in their going up or down stairs might step as lightly as possible with her own hand she once more administered his medicines and smoothed his pillow and the least creak of the door went jarring to her heart in a word every thing which a good and gentle nature could devise did this affectionate daughter practice in her fathers sick chamber though sick herself almost unto death  at burtons particular request and entreaty a consultation of two neighboring physicians was held on sir guise whose unusual calm and apparent tranquillity had been more dreaded by the apothecary than the former violences the latter indicated at least muscular force but the former denoted exhausted nature  with very little variation he continued in this condition four days in the progress of which he exhibited at moments such unequivocal marks of shame contrition and selfabasement joining fervidly in the offices of which the pious arthur made him partaker that those whom most he had wronged would have felt their resentments buried in their charity alas those whom he had most injured were indeed more immediately under his eye and most assiduously engaged in offering to comfort him  for charles stuart though less constant in his attendance than caroline was equally earnest in trying every power to conciliate him to himself to diminish his fear and enlarge his hope  but one outraged being there was who had not yet met his corporeal eye since the arrival of his son and daughter though in mental vision he had nightly almost hourly beheld her and while he blessed her name he execrated his own  the interesting the good the lovely and allforgiving jane atwood a sincere penitent like himself had not yet been seen since his illness though thrice that amiable girl prompted by the truest goodness had been conducted by true george to the antechamber from whence when occasion favored she entered the apartment while the unhappy man reposed then after gazing until she could endure for pitys sake to look no longer she would steal away lest the sight of her should increase his pangs but still remained in the antechamber either until he again dropped to sleep or tidings of his health were brought by the lips of caroline or her cousins or caught by her own listening ear at length the hour of sir guise stuart approached but it had advanced gradually and as it came more near it moved toward him with more tranquil steps the forlorn state above described had relaxed its horrors and for some weeks reason once more visited his mind which though the animal frame continued to waste away permitted the man covered with conscious crimes to feel even in this world the blessed influence of penitence unfeigned the deeptoned groans and heavy elaborations of the breath yielded benignly to the milder sorrow of silent tears or of sighs which rather relieved than aggravated his conscious heart the death of a sinner was coming on and in its progress furnished an important example to the wicked of just distributions both of reward and punishment in the present world as the first months of his sickness and confinement had past in the sharpest pains of body and of mind in the direst retrospects of the past torments of the present and tremendous apprehensions of the future  in the returns of rationality mitigated only by temporary distraction  in all the agonies of waking consciousness or in the no less terrific visions of haunted slumber so when the ministers of heavenly justice had fulfilled the sterner part of their commission and the heart of this modern pharaoh was no longer hardened but melted to the degree of ductility that is necessary to save the soul alive  then those ministers like spirits of mercy wore to his eye a less vindictive form breathed into his ear less despairing sounds and on the wounds that yet lacerated his bosom distilled some drops of celestial balm  the knowledge of jane atwood having been already his visitor had been withheld from him only by the tender caroline who feared from his extreme distress on the mention of her name though so frequently repeated by himself her presence might prove too much for him to bear at his reiterated and earnest entreaty however as well to his son and daughter as to jonathan jerome and to true george the latter hastened to the castle for his beloved jane atwood soon made her appearance before sir guise stuart who had desired to see her alone  on her entrance he shook violently after gazing on her earnestly for some time his eyes closed in a shudder of his whole frame  amidst the shock of which outstretching his arm and pointing to heaven he confusedly uttered the words  injured being forgive  forgive  and pray for me there  he remained in that position some moments when recovering vision and observing jane kneeling at his bedside complying with his request by fervent prayers in which she was joined by all present he signified by a movement of his lips and placing his hand on his breast a faint smile attesting the action that he was much comforted  he then desired his children might be summoned and being told they were both in the room he turned his view to the other side of the bed and there saw them engaged in the same intercession arthur and his indian united their supplications alarmed by the tidings of george olivia johanna and colonel fitzorton had followed jane they seated themselves awhile in the antechamber and then entered the apartment every eye and hand was upraised to the throne of the merciful sir guise after many vain efforts to lift his hands to the suppliant posture in which he saw theirs desired caroline and charles to raise them at length using all the force which parting life allowed the dying man amidst almost whispered sighs uttered the words  receive o god the soul of a penitent  and expired  a silence of the most solemn kind notwithstanding the strong and distinct interest in which the event was felt by almost every spectator distinguished this scene even till sir guise had pronounced the sentence that terminated his existence and then as if by an unanimous feeling that sentence expressive at once of the prayer of the dead and the pardon of the living was repeated by every one present  chapter xlviii the presence of mind which caroline displayed in the foregoing scene exhibited also that rich trait in her character which has emboldened us to believe she may safely be proposed as an example to her sex in whatever trials they may be called upon to undergo in the exercise of filial virtue but to the discharge of this last duty she was summoned in a moment of the utmost severity her bosom labored with a sense of the strongest evils that could perhaps be inflicted on humanity  loss of the only being who had ever touched her heart reflections on his supposed tremendous fate the terrors she felt for her brothers forfeited life and the death of her father  the expiring moments of sir guise it is true less touched the heart than those of his blameless wife yet perhaps the circumstances of a wicked life terminating in a penitent death has something more awful in it to the soul even than the departure of an innocent being the several spectators seemed to be sensible of this the tutored indians earnest prayers for himself unmixed with those which he offered up after the decease of sir guise were prayers that he might not be guilty of wicked deeds true george found it necessary with the assistance of jerome and jonathan to convey jane atwood to the castle and at length arthur and the lieutenant conducted caroline in solemn silence to her apartment where burton and the physicians who had attended sir guise requested she might be left wholly to herself a request which from observations they had made was particularly enforced and in which with all the strength that rested with her she earnestly joined assuring however her brother as he left the room but still in a fearful whisper that the only wish she now had in the world was to see him out of danger then she still labors with that cruel apprehension said charles following the apothecary and physician to the chamber door what apprehension questioned the physician tell it below stairs said the physician drawing the lieutenant out and gently closing the door  meantime reports were made at the castle of the last moments of sir guise stuart by true george to the infinite confusion of john fitzorton whose project to move away the abbey family was now necessarily to experience another perilous delay if not to be wholly destroyed he felt the indecency of hurrying away the children from the remains of their late father while they were yet at the abbey for some days past also mrs fitzorton had been indisposed johanna and jane atwood were of course confined by their attendance at the castle and now again the situation in which jane herself was brought home alike prevented either from the accustomed division of their cares at the abbey  all this delay however increased the alarm and confirmed the heartconsuming image that had haunted and which now returned to the bleeding memory of caroline and her pious tears fell in mingled streams for the death of her father and the murder of henry and her equal prayers were offered up for the souls of both may the long repentance of one exclaimed she fit his altered spirit for the blessed society of the other and may it be forgotten in the friendship of heaven there had been any cause for enmity on earth  but whatever be the stretch of our minds our frames can endure but to a certain point what that point is can scarcely be known to ourselves till by many a trial sustained beyond what it was imagined we could bear we feel that neither mind nor body can support more the unfortunate caroline had now gained that point and she fell into a state at once blessed and afflictive from its insensibility the intervals of sense were so transient that no soothing idea could be received or safely communicated touching the great objects of her momentary thought she rambled in wild abruptness from one point of calamity to another connected and confused her ideas separated and mixed circumstances almost in the same instant she combined the different destinies of henry and sir guise then stretched out her arms to preserve her brother she saw in the troubled region of her fancy all the forms of death and beheld the visionary coffins and graves of them all but this forlorn situation yielded and was succeeded by a less troublous condition and the ever active burton applied with happy effect those oblivious lenitives which alleviate nature in her extremity  in the mean time the lieutenant accompanied by his friends paid the last offices to his unhappy father the colonel assisted and olivia from whom the knowledge of carolines illness could not be altogether concealed and who understood she was not able to assist at the funeral could not be restrained from attending her at the abbey while the ceremony was performing at the chapel house indeed she had long complained of the interdictions which the colonel had laid on her she even thought them unkind and it was almost in direct disobedience to his counsels which she had usually thought oracular that she persisted in her design to make her suffering friend a visit of condolence shall i continue to absent myself at such a time as this she argued if my proffered love for her had ever a motive to show itself it is now my dear brother and what has been my motive of forbearance hour after hour day after day a slight indisposition in which i have suffered more from sympathy restrained than any other cause vain and unfeeling apology and now too when she will stand more in need of the supports of friendship than at any period perhaps of her life  in truth john had not a good plea left which he could discover and was therefore condemned to add the visit of olivia to caroline to the other innumerable cares and perplexities of the time no sooner therefore had john jane atwood and true george departed for the chapel than olivia and johanna conducted by a servant repaired to the abbey to prevent the tumult of public curiosity and clamor as well as to conceal the transaction as much as possible from caroline the body of sir guise stuart was conveyed to the place of sepulture through the passage under ground for although every kind of rumor had gone forth the one from its inconsistence destructive of the other and although in the absence of henry or rather since his discovery of the mysteries there no longer subsisted any reason for the concealment of the transactions at the abbey yet the lieutenant thought it best for his sisters sake to have every thing carried on in the most private manner and thus olivia and her friend johanna avoided the sight of the burial preparations but encountered nevertheless an unusual number of the villagers whom vague reports and halfexplained whispers of the thickening mysteries of the haunted abbey and the rumoured death of the pretended quaker had distributed up and down the different walks applying to one another with a fearful kind of eagerness for information  olivia however attributed all this to the single event of sir guises death not supposing but that the mystic assumption either of names or persons had been removed or at least left unguarded for some time before the baronets death the wandering and indeed wondering groupes therefore were little noticed and she entered the abbey by the grand avenue  they found caroline asleep  according to the sacred phrase she was sleeping from sorrow the daughters of the apothecary and both the female servants attended her olivia and johanna placed themselves on each side of the bed and the attendants were just beginning a whispered account of their ladys alarming situation when she started in her slumber and awoke to break the surprise of their too sudden appearance johanna and olivia shaded themselves a moment behind the curtains but a little rustling occasioned by this induced caroline to throw back the obstructions and she discovered her visitors it would scarce have been possible to give any two persons a more afflicting appearance than these good and gentle beings now wore to the terrified eye of caroline stuart from motives of genuine respect and good will olivia had put on a mourning dress the instant she heard of the baronets decease and had worn it ever since and from a motive yet more powerful  an attachment to the lieutenants family  johanna had also assumed the deepest sables the unhappy caroline looked on this as so unequivocal a confirmation of henrys being dead that she sprung up in her bed and clasping her hands implored olivia to forgive the deed what deed my sweet friend oh console yourself i beseech you your johanna and i are come to entreat that when you find yourself able you would pass a little time with us at the castle ye are spirits of pity then sighed caroline who are permitted to come in that solemn form to show us mercy but alas the castle  no whispered she to olivia that is not the place for us the widowed dove had best come to the abbey there she shall find succor these poor arms shall be her refuge  fly  fly thou bereaved bird  haste  haste to thy nest yes yes  now now thou art safe  with wild yet tender eagerness she clung to mrs fitzorton as she spoke and folded her passionately yet fearfully in her arms yet no continued she quitting and abruptly receding from olivia the abbey too is rifled my poor poor father he too is gone nothing left here but sorrow but there is a place still where we shall find both the truants and all of us be happy  yonder yonder yonder  she drew mrs fitzorton again toward her with one hand and with the other pointed to heaven at once incongruous and consistent she proceeded in this manner for some time then sunk on the pillow alas said olivia her senses are unsettled my johanna the loss of her father at such a period when she might have hoped so much happiness from his life reformed that my lady interposed the apothecarys daughter sally who was still with her is one cause of her present unhappiness but there is another she has taken into her imagination the strangest fancy   hark sally exclaimed the other daughter did you not hear a great noise  olivia and johanna were trying to recover or rather watching the recovery of caroline who had fallen into a swoon and they seemed to have no ear or eye for any other object no sally i heard nothing answered the other daughter there again cried sally  yes i heard it then good god what a shriek said one of the female attendants is there any body below questioned johanna then first hearing the noise  only my fellow servants who is gone down to the old cook for candles we should have fetched them before but that the moon shone so bright and my lady always bids us let some of the moonlight come into her chamber especially since she has been ill though i always think it is not good for any body as the moon is but a melancholy companion unless a person is very happy and then it is worth all the lights hush i surely heard a footstep said johanna o it is nothing but the dog miss little old fitz see there is his shadow on the wall he is coming round to his carpet all is still now said the remaining attendant i will venture to go down but if one of the strange sights and sounds should be going about  stepping back what can that be at one of the windows this which is left open nearest the bed asked johanna with some emotion  every one but olivia observed the object it was palpably that of figure looking into the room from the other side of the window  a human face was visibly pressing the glass  and after examining the objects in the chamber for some time part of another figure was seen at the farther end of the same window  the only one not shut to  and then every ray of light from the moon was in a moment extinguished heaven exclaimed olivia turning from caroline what my dear johanna can thus darken the room all of a sudden i can no longer see a feature of carolines face and methought her color was just returning the whole company were too much terrified to reply  the servant is now coming with a candle said johanna all will be well  do not seem alarmed  we shall disturb caroline the door of the antechamber was left half open and a light from the opposite side gleamed from it but the light did not advance and the door being suddenly drawn to almost shut out of the chamber the faint sparks which had appeared a whispering of different voices ensued  the voices stopped  the door of the antechamber again half opened and a figure folded up in a tattered dress came gliding into the room with a light that flung a ghastly hue on the countenance of the person who bore it and on the surrounding objects as from a candle burning in the socket with stealing steps the figure paced round the chamber examining in its way every part of the furniture  then walked to the head of the bed holding up the flaring light to every countenance  it then went back with like care but with more precipitation and had scarce regained the antechamber before the light went out olivia with great strength of mind had enjoined the attendants to silence on the first appearance of alarm observing that the life as well as the reason of caroline depended on it and partly from love  partly from fear  they had hitherto obeyed  in the midst of this total darkness more distinct sounds and particularly what follows assailed their ears  now now  or never our principal mark is in bed fast asleep  this changed the terrors which had before been excited on the old notion of the abbey being haunted by evil spirits into a no less dread of its being infested by robbers the words which after a short pause succeeded appeared to put this opinion beyond a doubt the window which was open is covered and all are secured below  i tell you the rest are gone to the chapel we have brought round two of the horses into the forest within a few steps of the lane that goes round to the road we can wrap the woman in the blankets and then the way is all clear before us what a plague are you afraid of then here are the other gags if you dally any longer i will call up some of the others a dreadful silence remained in the next instant it was broken by a sudden uproar of confused sounds from below accompanied by a cry of seize seize the ruffians  secure them for justice  but shed no blood a number of steps were then heard upon the stairs and a murmur of voices was resumed in the antechamber presently rushed two persons from thence into the bedroom crying to each other the window  the window  no way but the window  your cursed delay has ruined all  instantly the casement was forced open the cloth which had been spread over it torn away and the moonbeams which thence fell on the chamber discovered the ragged figure they had before seen with his companion in like shabby habiliments desperately attempting to throw themselves out one succeeded three other persons coming into the room one of them ran to the window and telling the second fugitive that death would be the consequence of the least noise while in that apartment he was conducted back into the antechamber the other two who had entered went toward the bed on or near which every one had remained in almost breathless consternation fear nothing whispered one of the persons in accents well calculated to inspire courage though there was now so violent a tumult of voices from below stairs the soothing sounds were scarcely audible the person however who had led off the second culprit now coming up softly with a light discovered to the astonishment of every one present the faces of partington and henry fitzorton in those who had advanced to the bed and that of floresco in the bearer of the light so suddenly unexpectedly momentous however and under such peculiar circumstances did these make their appearance that it seemed but a continuation of the former mysteries  a completion indeed of the magic by the entrance of some benign genii on the departure of evil spirits every thing above stairs and below still precluded explanation joy sorrow hope fear characterized the moment and distinguished it by all these blended passions from every other in the lives of either of the parties then in the chamber henry and his friends guided surely by providence came like guardian angels to save the wife who was folding him in her arms  the mother of his children  the betrothed bride of his bosom friend  and caroline stuart  from the horrid machinations of midnight ruffians  the nobleminded yet humble orphan of a burning soil  one of the beings whom christian masters consider as the beasts of the field  as an article of slavery and of sale was appointed to become an active instrument in this preservation by the power who in a yet more glorious instance even the redemption of the world clothed the redeemer with humility  but to caroline stuart how shall even this immediate interposition of heaven be extended  neither the tumultuous scenes from below nor the fearful sounds or sights in her own apartment had reached her ear or unfolded her eye nor had she indeed moved since she fell into sudden sleep alas it is the sleep of the grave sighed olivia to whom even her husband was now from the first moment of her hearts election the only second object of her attention every thought and every emotion went to caroline o god god she is dead  she is dead ejaculated henry his accents at once frantic and impassioned although demanded by the occasion terrified all present ah no exclaimed johanna blessed be god not dead i felt her breath this instant on my lips o heavens i hear it too said olivia hush  hush my love  do as i have done henry  thus  softly  and you may hear it too olivia guided the ear of henry till it pressed on carolines lips and after the silence of a moment in which breath seemed to have forsaken the listening band no no groaned henry i hear it not never shall those lips be animated more but an instant ago there was life on them said johanna and so there is now  again  again i felt it on mine cried olivia she importuned her husband to be convinced and assisting him to place his face toward that of caroline in the manner she had done her own he sensibly felt the irregular but palpable breathing of her he mourned on his cheek and while he yet remained in that position the breath gained a little accession of strength and before he changed his posture had acquired the force of a sigh yes there can be no doubt of it she is alive cried henry enraptured withdrawing from the bed and falling on his knees in gratitude to heaven little floresco followed his example repeating him is alive him is alive negro boy was praying god to take hims own poor self and put him in grave and bring back good spirit of good lady to make all good peoples happy  but him is alive  in the highest fervor of these extacies of our sable son of nature indeed on the first mention of life remaining in caroline partington had hurried down stairs but now returned with burton john fitzorton the lieutenant father arthur and several others whom he met in his headlong course for assistance coming from the chapel  a new scene of wonders now opened on the eyes of all the last comers except partington who encountering his friends near the gates of the castle and surrounded by half the villagers of both parishes all in much disorder spoke only to the apothecary on the one then most alarming subject miss stuarts illness so that to many of them the colonel in particular partington himself even before they reached the abbey was an object of amazement yet on that object which in a manner annihilated the rest  on caroline stuart  every other surprise and every other care while olivia related the story of the events since her arrival with johanna which she detailed with afflictive accuracy became subordinate  the apothecary at the end of the narrative questioned his eldest daughter whether she had attended to his orders in giving the draughts regularly both as to times and proportions she assured him she had administered them every two hours not only before he went to the funeral but for the whole of the preceding day that none of them produced the composure either of mind or body her father had expected as their result  for that his patient had not closed her eyes till after every power of speech and of motion was taken from her by the violent exertions of both and that the last draught having been offered and accepted about a quarter of an hour before she fell asleep she had apprehended in her own mind that it had proved too strong for her weakened faculties but i dare not disclose my fears to any one my dear father said she because i am sure let what will come of it you meant it to do her good  no harm can come of it  and in the end it will do her good child answered the apothecary firmly  its strength has produced on her weakness it is true the alarming effects you have noticed and in a degree far beyond my expectation owing to the unsettled state of her mind and senses and the sight of persons and things which in that state every object aggravates the medicine was intended to act as anodyne and i had judged a small addition to its opiate quality proper to be infused on this day lest any account of or reflection upon the solemn duties assigned to this evening should gain access to her too feeling heart she is already in a resuscitating state though perhaps to you imperceptible  but the giving her freer air and indeed wholly withdrawing yourselves will be very proper  every body retired from the bed and felt the force of the remark yet no one seemed willing to be the first to quit the chamber they however receded toward the door the apothecary threw back the curtains and opened one of the windows which had been closed i knew said he the force of the medicine was almost spent and that the functions of nature were regaining their tone  see  that faint tinting in the cheek is a good symptom  it might be called by mr henry the rosebud of promised return to wholesome life  look  and that soft dew that you see on the temples and which will presently overspread the beautiful forehead shall nourish it  o and those sweet eyes which praised be the almighty are opening their gentle beams upon us said mrs fitzorton shall be as the blessed sun to reanimate her heart and to cheer ours henry raised his wifes hand even to his lips but insensibly stepped nearer to the bed that he might see what she had described indeed every person in the room on the apothecarys first remark had advanced  the progress of recovery from a partial trance indeed by means like these is not slow and the effect of a successful anodyne is known frequently to produce not only unbroken repose in sleep but to bestow on the harassed body and mind even in the awaking moments images and ideas the very reverse of those irritable and painful phantoms which made the application necessary sounds and visions of a lulling and almost celestial kind follow or accompany the first movements after the spell that for a time locked up every mortal power is unbound and the charm acquires fresh beauty from our consciousness when sensibility is in a degree restored we seem as it were new born and an inhabitant of a more delightful world with kind oblivions of whatever was unfortunate and sweet recollections of whatever has been happy in the past such appeared to have been the temporary trance and the sensations which succeeded it in the mind of caroline she saw before her eye the forms of all who were most dear to her on earth but they floated as yet before her intellectual vision as heavenly shapes as spirits blessed she saw henry and olivia side by side and smiled tenderly upon both she gazed earnestly at the former bent forwards as if to gain a juster point of view passed the back of her hand over her own eyes as if doubtful of their sight and then but with timid advances extended her arm toward henry and at length touching his shoulder she drew back as if astonished to find him embodied trembling a moment she again put forth her arm and reaching the hand of henry gave it to olivia there dearest brother said she with a faint but satisfied tone thank heaven   such of the company as knew not the circumstance of her fatal misconception of the lieutenants words in which number were olivia and henry looked upon this as the remains of her delirium and those who were in the secret of its import did not judge the present by any means the proper moment to unfold particulars john and burton having conferred a moment the latter renewed his request that the society would separate i will agree to this said olivia if i can obtain dear carolines promise  no promises sister cried the colonel can be asked or granted at present two importunate messages have already been brought up by the impatient partington who had again occasion to leave us for another party john now assisted the apothecary and the lieutenant gently to enforce obedience and though as carolines fuller sense returned and objects and circumstances assumed more and more their real size and position she was nearer rationality and in her peculiar case alas farther from felicity  the dire paroxysms were at an end and expanding her widespread arms in token of unspeakable gratitude for the mass of heartfelt attentions bestowed on her she saw all her friends except the apothecary and his daughters quit the room without seeming to press at that moment their longer stay her eyes however insensibly settled on henry and olivia till they could be no more seen but scarcely were this amiable pair out of sight even while the apothecary had required an audience with his daughters in the antechamber than the female attendant who remained with caroline perhaps with imprudent though wellmeant zeal took occasion to inform her in a loose and desultory way of the peril they had all been in even of their lives and that in henry fitzorton caroline and all her friends had found a deliverer to this officious information caroline made no answer in words but she looked the language which no words have ever yet conveyed to the ears of mortal man in the utmost felicity of eloquence  it is from a consciousness of the inadequacy of words indeed to describe emotions of a particular kind that we have forborne to attempt delineating the feelings of henry in the above scene should there be any readers we assure ourselves there can be very few who imagine that those feelings were derogatory to the character of a husband a father or a friend even in that hour of trial will neither do him justice nor reflect honor on their own hearts  chapter xlix but surprises of a very different nature have been waiting our leisure below stairs and which must needs have excited some degree of curiosity in the readers mind now it can be drawn from more interesting objects the woods of fitzorton and the abbey forest had been time immemorial the summer resort of a tribe of the egyptian wanderers and although sir armine did not absolutely encourage those who attached themselves to the environs of the castle he suffered them to erect their local habitations in the neighborhood of his mansion would indirectly contribute a faggot to their fire and a joint of meat to their pot to repress and if possible reform their pilfering habits olivia and henry were more avowedly their patrons  the one would not seldom make up a little bundle of comfortables for their hedgeborn children and sometimes allow them to inspect her lovely hands to read the lines of life while the former would also in his early days consult them on the subject of his more difficult destiny and amongst other romantic plans had once serious thoughts of joining the train as well to favor his love as to escape that interruption to which his rambles around the abbey domain so often exposed him but true george was the chief protector of the sable band which established themselves in the fitzorton district for there were two parties the one calling themselves the castle and the other the abbey gypsies and what is not a little curious they were as much in hostility with one another as the two houses to which they considered themselves as appropriate had henry put his project of the moment in execution he would have certainly attached himself to the tribe of the abbey not only from its proximity to the sacred chamber of the inalienable subduer of his heart but because the hostile parties in all their treaties of peace or suspensions of arms prescribed a line of demarcation which the castle gypsies could not pass without an immediate renewal of war yet henry had been always on good terms with both parties and so of course had true george the servants of both houses would alternately resort to the different tribes to have their fortunes told although they seemed in general to give their own oracles the preference since sir armines death however the castle prophets though patronized for a time by olivia were routed by john fitzorton and even henry yielded to his motive depend upon it my dear brother said he some of these days these yellow protegees of yours will be divulging more than is agreeable and although we affect incredulity when an idea which selflove or a faithful heart declares impossible is poured into our ears it is the corner stone sometimes of a fatal edifice which jealousy can find materials to complete even to the destruction of the peace of innocence  i am determined to rid the country of them at least our party and have no objection to being called cruel on the business when henry and olivia were abroad john kept his word in the very next summer but passed them over to partington and not without a douceur to reconcile them to the change and they soon thought themselves gainers by the transfer for the merry humors of the squire were much relished his civility to the worthless and his abuse of the worthy was soon understood and his bounty being ever proportioned to desert in every station of life he bowed and abused them into something like principles at least rendered them a less criminal race of people and many of them were not only pensioners on his poorrascalwarehouse but he would sometimes buy up the halfworn dresses of his poor but good neighbors during the winter or exchange them for new articles of the same kind on purpose to lay in a stock for his gypsey vagabonds against their summer return to the bury woodlands by the sides or in which he had erected an occasional hut to mark any discovery he had made of a worthy trait of heart or character in any of these wanderers the nature of the action was written over the door of the building and a key presented to the party for whose use it was intended by way of encouragement it must at the same time be confessed that to stand as a monument of any detected baseness he would order his carpenter to run up here and there a gallows nearest to the place where the foul deed was committed and if the offending party had the hardiness to return or was allowed another trial a rope was thrust into her or his hand with a label worked into the noose holding out the threatening word  beware  with these henry fitzorton on his second forced march to partingtons renewed his acquaintance they had just then resumed their leasy retreats for the season on the evening of his arrival at the bury the leader of them with impatient earnestness solicited the honor of an audience this being granted henry went up into what was always called by the master of the mansion poets dormitory  sacred to the lawyer and philosopher of the fitzorton family there were other apartments  when the subsequent conversation past betwixt henry and the person who followed him up stairs  i am now one of the fathers and chiefs of the tribe an please your honor who for so many years enjoyed the protection of good sir armine and his family i lived in and beside fitzorton woods and hedgerows the best part of my long life and have been the better for it ever since your honor and madam olivia and squire clare all used to pay me and mine a visit and i love sir john that now is  though he sent us away from our old household trees as his good father used to call them  i remember you my honest fellow said henry  i remember you came from the abbeyparty to ours because   because interrupted the gypsey i could not bear to be sheltered by the leaves or fed by the stolen offals of sir guise stuart after the good father arthur had put us in the right way  and after i saw and heard what the wicked baronet was doing against his lady and children and our patron the squire of late years can hardly find words bad enough to throw at me when he is loading me with good things  and what have you at the end of this preface to impart asked henry  i have to beseech your honor to read what is contained in these papers immediately answered the gypsey and to take such steps as you may judge proper thereupon i was just going to send to our squire for a pass to fitzorton castle to deliver them to you or sir john when i heard you were come back to the bury here they are sir i have nothing to say more but to desire you will beware of gypsies but not to think ill of blondel gapper your humble servant though he is one of them  gapper of whose fidelity true george had often made fair report and of whose kindness henry himself had received testimony now took his leave and henry sat down to the perusal of the mysterious papers they were of a nature to call out his utmost astonishment and apprehension he judged it expedient to make partington a partaker of the confidence but it was with very great difficulty he could be prevented from returning home before the squire had discovered the cause of his impatience the instant however it was discovered he concurred not only in thinking the impatience warranted but contributed all his own impetuous powers could supply to give it new force we must be off again directly said partington to mrs herbert  i must leave these young villains  meaning carry and little john in your care mrs worthless until we come to you again or send for you to fitzorton  vehement as were the agitations of henry they were less violent than those of partington on this occasion though both were so busied hand foot and voice  now in the mansion now in the stable now in the outhouses driving every servant before them and assisting to collect every weapon of attack and defense upon the premises from the firearms in the lifeanddeathroom as the squire had baptized it to the spades and mattocks in the gardenhouse and crouding them all in henrys own coach which still remained and into all the carriages of the bury that a spectator not in their secret would either have deemed them both seized with sudden madness or that they were arming to defend an invaded country even the servants albeit in the practice of flying at the word of command and inured to extraordinary expeditions had never seen their squire in such a fury of preparation before one of them was dispatched to the gypsey chief to attend at the bury that moment with the witness he mentioned and when they appeared to the summons partington abused them as if they were two of the plagues of egypt kissed their discolored hands with more devotion than he would have done those of cleopatra the queen of their country and gave blondel the command of one of the armed chariots ordered him to shut up the person who was one of his tribe in the same vehicle and then follow the lead mrs herbert alone was made in part confidential and her conduct thereupon so gratified the squire that he regretted the young knaves henrys children must have a shething to superintend them msince he was sure from the manner in which that hussy mother herbert had put a blunderbuss and one of the broadswords into the carriage she would slice off an honest gentlemans head as neatly as any of those old tygresses boadicea zenobia or joan of arc  in this manner did they return to fitzorton taking up the turnpikeman by the way they found the castle almost emptied of its inhabitants one of the few servants however who remained at home told them the family were gone to the burial of sir guise stuart they therefore continued their route directly to the abbey for whose late possessor the chapel bell struck on their ear as they were passing but their eyes were yet more sorcibly impressed by a sight of those villagers whom olivia and johanna had seen scattered about but who had dispersed until recalled in greater multitudes by the few who dared to penetrate so far as the chapel into which they protested they had seen enter a coffin which several present had assured them contained the dead body of sir guise stuart and that they moreover beheld his son the lieutenant and sir john fitzorton true george and many others whom they knew walking all alive as mourners behind and good father arthur the popish priest before it with a book in one hand and a light in the other  this relation which was regarded as at the top of all the miraculous things that had overshadowed the abbey the forest and the whole parish reassembled them until encouraged by each other they resolved to see whether the whole was visionary or real for although the majority determined in favor of the popular superstition the credit given to some of those who made their reports from the chapelhouse amongst whom was the landlord of the fitzorton arms who received his intelligence from the young sexton no inconsiderable number were of opinion they had all along been deluded by their fears as to the objects they had themselves seen or thought they saw a large body of the rustics therefore were spirited up by the power of numbers though one amongst them with some tremor remarked that a single ghost would put to the route a whole army though it were but the ghost of a sucking child and they took courage to move even to the abbey door which they reached in the very moment that a violent shriek which was followed by cries of murder were heard by the party within the blood of those who were gathered together without curdled at the sound yet terrifying as it was the shriek was too palpably human and female for any that wore the forms of men to fly from their apprehensions for themselves were absorbed in that great principle of nature which at once distinguishes and protects humanity instead of receding they pushed onward and finding the inner doors fastened they were in the act of bursting them open when partington and his cavalcade with henry fitzorton arrived  assist assist us my friends exclaimed henry with a voice almost of madness  assist us in the prevention of dreadful horrors  of inhuman murders now even now committing within that house in a moment the furious attack was made by the multitude led on by henry and partington and the abbey was filled with the defenders of innocence a gang of infamous ruffians were thus in an instant detected and secured it was at once the crisis both of danger and of delivery to reach that crisis had been the wily labor of conspiring villainy for many months but to render the conspiracy abortive and involve the conspirators even in their own snare was the achievement only of a few minutes such is the toil by which human machinations are conducted and such the facility with which the hand of providence reveals and overthrows them  as henry led his wife and johanna down stairs partington was discovered at the head of his myrmidons standing over their bound captives but the conquerors were so numerous that nothing could be seen but themselves at the sight however of the rescued olivia and her friends the victors sent forth an universal shout of triumph this gave john an opportunity to thank them for their zeal but to observe at the same time that much of its good effect would be counteracted if they suffered even their exultation at present to disturb miss caroline stuart whom they had helped to defend intimating that she was under many alarms already and not in a state to hear them accounted for the very name of caroline stuart combined with ill health but yet soothing them into the certainty of her being alive and once more at the abbey  that caroline whom they had so often found a mediator and a friend to the utmost extent of her humble power  silenced them like the operation of some sudden charm and they uttered their honest wishes and thanksgivings only in whispers henry had in the meanwhile on a hint from the colonel placed olivia and johanna in his own coach which had so recently arrived from the bury observing to his wife that partington and john would take care of the banditti whom they had happily discovered and it is no time for you my love said he ordering the coachman to drive home  to hear the particulars of a nest of ruffians  nor do i wish it answered she a thousand thanks for hurrying us away from their sight answered olivia no doubt my henry but they will turn out very wicked people since they seemed to watch a time when they might securely terrify and perhaps plunder a set of defenseless women and when they knew their defenders were in general engaged in the most holy offices but o how providential your return my dearest henry what an interposition how was it brought about requested johanna and where is my mrs herbert and our children demanded olivia  henry whom a forced marriage  in spite of the value of the object  an enthralled situation before had involved in eternal reservations managements and difficulties was puzzling and hacking at a reply when olivia misconceiving the cause of his hesitation exclaimed  good heaven surely the alarm did not extend to mr partingtons i hope all is quiet and well at the bury  perhaps the dear children and mrs herbert were your fellowtravellers said johanna perhaps they were set down at the castle  henry now found it became necessary to say something and yet finding it both impolitic and improper to speak to the whole of the machinations which were the subject of the dreadful papers delivered to him by the gypsey chief he affectionately soothed the fears of his wife by an assurance that both their children were well and happy  that partington had deputed mrs herbert and little caroline to be his housekeepers and little john the representative of the squire himself till he should return to the bury and that in short having very suddenly received intelligence of a foul conspiracy formed by a party of gypseys who had annoyed the neighborhood of the castle and of the abbey for some time and were carrying their cepredations to the most daring lengths as she must have heard it appeared necessary to partington as well as to himself to set out with the utmost expedition to prevent if possible the complete mischief  after numberless thanks for her husbands goodness and many apologies for her own impatience  i know not how it is said mrs fitzorton to johanna  but i find it impossible to be happy or even as contented as i ought when my husband or either of my children are absent and i fear i am unreasonable enough to wish that whether they were in prosperity or in perils i might always have them in my view or easily within my reach even till death should shut them from my mental sight she almost whispered this to johanna but henry heard  and henceforward said he forcibly that wish shall be gratified i here pledge myself before this fair witness that when our children return to us nothing but that dreadful summons  which heaven keep many smiling years from my olivia  shall again divide us from the society of each other nor will i henceforth accept a visit or take an excursion of any kind from which olivia shall be excluded  could i have believed answered olivia that one of the most terrifying nights and which threatened to be even fatal should prove one of the most blessed of my happy life  her full heart could not utter more the rest was the expressive silence of felicity  nor had henry in his expression gone farther than the truth he now wished beyond every other good to continue the aweful duties of husband and of father and that those might be unbroken he thought that her guardian eye and protecting presence would even counteract whatever future events might happen hence he embraced olivias idea of a family union which might keep them all together even on the night that he had seen the only object in the whole world which could render the plan difficult to be realized  an object which he had seen in a situation every way more affecting than at any former period of a long and eventful intercourse that situation had however lost none of its interest but he concealed the emotions which he could not conquer he even struggled with them enough to amuse olivia and johanna the rest of their way to the castle with an account of partingtons loading every thing and every body with fire and sword for the expedition  perhaps under the veil of night some tears were shed and the roll of the coach might sink the sound of some heartsick sighs which mixed with or followed the narration but surely it is not consistent with the justice or the compassion either of earth or of heaven to rebuke him for these  chapter l john fitzorton partington father arthur the lieutenant true george and floresco were all this while busily employed in the abbey the first in his magstratical capacity exhorted the still clustering but now only murmuring multitude to assist in conveying the culprits whom partington had caused to be manacled hand and foot to some place at a greater distance from the apartments of the sick caroline true george seconded this motion but as an amendment proposed they should be carried to a snug place he knew of in the outbuildings which dennison had formerly told him was the abbey dungeon  i know it well said arthur it will only be necessary rejoined john to put them there for the night as other measures must be taken with them in the morning away with them therefore  the word of command found such ready obedience that had the captives been pigs of lead they would have been moved off like so many pounds of feathers indeed partington himself his own friends and the bury gypsey seemed to feel the force and do the work of angry elephants the criminals were lifted over the impediments which ruinous time had thrown in their way the massy stones fallen statues and halfperfect towers  until they reached the spot recommended by true george who bore one of the ringleaders on his shoulders it was indeed a place of dreadful security and fit only for criminals of the most heinous kind it stood in the extreme angle of that part of the uninhabited buildings near which the unfortunate sir guise took refuge from the presumed violence of his son no door covered the abhorrent mouth that gaped for the reception of its prey it was scooped in the form of a well into which there was no way of ascent or descent but by means of a ladder which not even a climbing animal could hope to ascend so absolute was the perpendicular and had little hold for the feet  so had it been represented by true george who had however the curiosity and enterprise to explore it with a candle and lantern when a boy the lieutenant nevertheless said and in which he was joined by both jerome and jonathan he had seen on one of the nights of his own watch the figure of a man come out of that place and had even pursued him but another person coming up from the cave close upon him extinguished the light and effected an escape i am glad of it said partington as the gentry know this way the better if they have been there before so what say you to our throwing the worthy personages in just as they are  they are exactly trussed for the occasion  and you see there is no ladder now at hand  the mob were delighted with this proposal and would have assisted its execution without consideration of consequences had not john fitzorton and arthur represented the danger and the impropriety of such a proceeding partington however had taken out the gag from the mouth of the person he himself was helping to carry to know whether he wished to be complimented with the first toss making his usual bow as he asked the question the answer however to which was that he had rather be thrown into hellfire than go again into that place again what you have been in it before have you then said partington  it is impossible to express the mute horror that sat indeed on the countenances of most of the other culprits as they approached the abyss o any where but there under or above ground  you know not its terrors said the wretch whose tongue was untied nay then there are good reasons which we are still unacquainted with said partington why this of all others should be the place in  in  in  with them my friends at this instant jonathan and jerome came running with a ladder which they had gone unbidden to fetch and in despite of struggles supplications etc etc the overpowering multitude were forced down true george asserted on his own knowledge there was but the way they went in to get out and that he proposed to guard sword in hand until the morning and ickle florrey shall guard too and the first bad mens shall die that tries to come up till good mens give leave this proposal was accepted the whole gang therefore were compelled to descend one by one or receive the stroke which partington swore should sever their amiable heads from their shoulders the moment they refused yet after all the matter was effected by every violent measure but the one threatened several of the village mob were earnest for leave to keep floresco and true george company especially the turnpikeman but on the colonel making it a particular request they would return home for the sake of mrs fitzorton and miss stuart and not intermeddle with the affair until he had made farther enquiry and he had entered into a private examination of the prisoners  they respectfully complied with his wishes soon after the lieutenant with burton and arthur went back to the abbey while john partington the turnpikeman the gypsey chief and his associate repaired to the castle but early next morning such additional discoveries were made and of so complicated a nature that john fitzorton found it expedient to consult higher judicial powers than his own all farther concealments were therefore of necessity given up and the whole gang of conspirators were fully committed to take their trial at the ensuing assizes accordingly they were moved under a proper guard to the county jail and no other charge given to the friends of the abbey and the castle than to forbear speaking on the business in the hearing either of olivia or caroline  chapter li meantime the recovery of miss stuart went favorably on and by gentle accessions of bodily and mental strength she came to a resolution of no longer suffering herself to puzzle betwixt visionary and existing objects  indistinct and impressive forms  those to which she had awaked still moved before her minds eye and she at length demanded of her brother an unequivocal answer to a few short and simple questions my dearest charles you are not now to learn that my nature always suffers more from conjecture of evil than from the evil itself or rather conjecture is the greatest evil i can feel i perceive and i am sure with the kindest motive you have all hid from me the one thing needful for me to be informed of yet i have not brought forward the enquiry myself till i felt as now i do the power of supporting its result be it what it may tell me then without more reserve whether by any tremendous hazard you have or have not lost your friend is the noble olivia a mourning widow  or a happy wife  the latter oh blessed be god the latter answered charles he then entered into the explanations he had so long and ardently desired and which had been so perpetually in check caroline fervently paid her acknowledgments to heaven and changed the subject but the moment of receiving this soulrelieving intelligence was likewise the moment of deciding on the line of conduct she should pursue her doubts were dispelled as to the only point she would allow herself to ask the horrible idea of henry fitzortons death and by the hand of charles stuart was removed he lived  his wife was happy  without farther investigation as to the state of his affections  whether he still loved or had forgot caroline  what were his looks or what his words  how great his firmness  or how little his fortitude  she knew there was but one course for her to take the sickness of a father had summoned her to the place she had long avoided  his death terminated every duty which attached to that spot henry was married  olivia had bestowed her pity love and bounty on her parent on her brother and on herself following therefore the sacred impulse of an unaffectedly pure and just mind which when again restored to itself combined past and present circumstances  without proudly or rashly straining itself to see what in heroic conflict it might be screwed to  an experiment which it is at all times rather vanity than virtue to attempt  without too much confidence or too much suspicion of others or of herself she modestly resolved upon taking the paths which might lead her out of temptation  the paths which to gain and to keep forms the daily prayer of  alas dailyerring mortals  caroline had not a doubt but to her that peace would be more surely found in the track that led to the soft recess from which she had so lately been called and in a conference she held with the holy arthur the day following that she had with her brother she explained to him her intentions she explained them in the sacred moment of her religious confession a duty she had postponed till the faculties of her mind were so far recovered as to perceive clearly every object of offense and of rectitude the monk entered her chamber and found her in preparation to receive him in the heart of caroline stuart religion wore none of her trappings pure and holy and simple it there resided as in its proper shrine the tinkling bell  the illumined taper  the solemn pealing of the organ  the mystic murmurs of the priesthood  and the breath of the frankincense had there no sanctuary she rejected not the public ceremonies of her faith but the perfumes of her incense ascended from an unsullied heart that heart required the solace and the assistance of one whom she knew to be a sincere minister of god and aided by him her spirit thirsted to commune with god himself yet to the one what had she to confess that might not be humbly offered to the other before him then who is the prime source of every other power she poured forth her soul in acknowledgment  for the blessings which she felt assured would crown the death of her father  for the preservation of her benefactors life  for the recovery of his happiness should it be yet incomplete  for the long and unclouded days of olivia and of her children  and lastly for heavenly aid in the future government of her own heart  animated yet tranquillized by these effusions she delineated to arthur her design and its motives but she conceived her return to the asylum of which john fitzorton was the patron made it matter of right his permission should be first obtained  the monk saw into all her motives implied or expressed and imparted them to john with reservation only of some ideas that he thought it no way material for the colonel to hear but which were in truth similar to those that lay in the recesses of johns breast yet which in his opinion as in that of the holy confessor rather exalted than humbled the character of the confessed without dwelling on the subject john assured father arthur that he would undertake to give proper reasons at the castle while the arrangements were making at the abbey in truth the whirl of circumstances had again brought back upon john perilous subjects he had so incessantly labored to keep at a distance and he was not sorry to see one occasion more present itself that carried with it at least the aspect of preserving the peace of his family and of his friends  accordingly john contrived for some days to represent the abbey as improper for olivias farther visits and burton continued to assure her that her favorite caroline was daily more and more convalescent by which means arthur had the better opportunity to prepare for the journey of which himself and his indian were to be the companions  these preparations however were not a little obstructed by persons of all descriptions flocking to the abbey to make their heartfelt enquiries after the health of miss stuart and to pay their visit of respect to the lieutenant those pensioners in particular who had been bequeathed by lady matilda to her daughter many of whom were still alive and the objects of carolines undiminished bounty could not be restrained from telling their daily almost hourly tales of gratitude to their benefactress and amongst these garrulous stories she found out what but for them she never could have known  that ever since her absence it had been the custom of henry fitzorton to make the tour of the abbey parish on the first day of every new month  in the manner lady matilda and caroline he knew had been accustomed to do  whenever he was down at the castle and that the apothecary represented him in his absence and when any of the pensioners were ill or unhappy henry would always bring them comfort and come and sit by and nurse and talk to them till they cried for joy  in short from the unfortunate but necessary moment of caroline stuarts first departure henry had considered her poor as his poor devolved upon his heart by a kind of natural inheritance and while his olivia employed herself in making happy her cottagers he would take his rounds of benevolence on the like principle as the agent of caroline and for this to be discovered thus unexpectedly by the very objects of the bounty was at once delightful and distressing to caroline the reports of the death and penitence of sir guise and the return of his son and daughter flew through the whole country with the speed of thought and the tributary marks of loving kindness shown to the survivors by all ranks and sexes and orders of religion retarded the execution of carolines design and thus was the abbey  which folly and vice had brought into disrepute and desertion and which had been shunned even by the rustic whose halfthatched shed was exposed to all the winds of heaven  redeemed by the return of wisdom and virtue  at length however a favorable moment occurred and caroline with her suite took her second leave of the abbey and by the contrivance of colonel fitzorton they performed their journey in one of those carriages which partington and henry had loaded for her defense but it had still been found necessary for caroline to begin her fatigues after others had begun their repose  after olivia and perhaps henry himself were in the arms of sleep  yet amidst the cloudings of an unquiet night as she passed the dimly discovered turrets of the castle  ah let not the most rigid virtue chide the sigh the parting sigh which mixed in her blessing on the inhabitants for it was pure and almost as silent as the tear which coursed along her cheek when she breathed an adieu to the chapel where now both her parents were entombed  there appeared to her mind little distinction as to the duration of the farewell for till her lifeless corpse should be conveyed to the one she never meant to approach the other  never oh never more shall i pass these sacred towers  that holy vault  but when i am enclosed in the unconscious hearse farewell oh scenes of anguish and of bliss  farewell  chapter lii thus was the illfated abbey once more left desolate although charles stuart intended to remain till the family ruins could be put into a somewhat clearer state than they were left by his unhappy father and till he saw what might be the event of a trial in which his curiosity was singularly interested he purposed also at a proper time after the decease of his father to invite the hand of johanna from the colonel her adopted father and in the mean time when that amiable girl and mrs herbert could be spared by olivia his further plan was to return with them to their insulated retreat with a view of affording his sister the consoling society of her accustomed friends while he should avail himself of johns salutary reproof in regard to his longneglected military duties  if however returning clouds hung over the abbey unusual brightness again beamed on the castle sacred to his promise and at length consistent with himself henry resigned the care of caroline to the brother and friends who surrounded her and dedicated himself entirely to domestic concerns and to olivia whatever yet remained of his unconquered thoughts such were his actions in this interval the hope which his tender and happy wife had promised was fulfilled by the birth of a third child and being a female infant the mother resolved it should be baptized angelica you see cried john rejoicing in the event of olivias safety it was not my dear henry to be a raphael at a more confirmed moment of his sisterinlaws health this was repeated to olivia who thus expounded her dream to henry mixing in the detail by suffrage of john all that related to their secret transactions at the abbey and their motives so far as they were known to herself previous to the ceremony of christening mrs herbert and the children were to be sent for from the bury and that all might be complete she expressed a hope that her favorite caroline would honor a secret wish she had formed to become godmother of the young angelica  as the departure of caroline took place so short a time before olivias confinement and as the latter knew she was not in a state of health or spirits to assist her friend in a moment of such trial it had not been deemed proper by burton to discompose mrs fitzorton by any mention of her friends departure but as henry now looked to the colonel for the materials of an answer to his wifes requisition john informed her that a change of air and of objects had made it necessary for her to move from the abbey i have a message to deliver on that subject from my sister interposed charles who was present though henry was not then in the room i will give it you in her words for indeed it concerns us all    we are safely arrived at our place of refuge my dearest brother and found the worthy dennison in the perfect enjoyment of his good old age the rapture of floresco is never you know to be described when his simple heart is moved by natures powerful hand and she touched him most tenderly at the sight of his ancient friend who was not less affectionately though less tumultuously happy another ancient friend was gladdened at the view obscured as it was of our good old man  poor little fitz who bore his long journey passing well father arthur has spared our veteran the particulars of that heavy event to which i feel i am not as resigned as i know it is my duty to be alas my brother  here the lieutenant passed over some sentences in a little confusion but soon recovered himself and went on  i must charge you my dearest charles with answers to the enquiries which i cannot but believe will be made concerning me at the castle and to explain my wanderings let not i conjure you the everdear and respected mrs fitzorton nor good mrs herbert nor my sweet johanna attribute my flight to any thing ungrateful or unfriendly ah it has been from far other motives so far as you know let me implore you to explain them and exculpate your sister and your friend  it is enough said olivia i am ever too selfish i ought to repine at what has grieved me but on the subject of my friends i confess myself a very miser i know that the health spirits and happiness of my caroline required a temporary removal from hence and i yield blessed be her absence blessed be her return  chapter liii it is become necessary for us to quit again the innocent and look back upon the guilty the time of trial for the gang which had been fully committed being arrived they were brought from the county prison where they had been some weeks confined in separate dungeons and deeds of foulest darkness as well as their perpetrators were at length to see the light  the crimes of this banditti were of a nature so complicated and private wrongs so mixed with public offenses that there seems no other mode of detailing them with any clearness but by adopting the measures and in some degree the language of the persons who conducted the prosecution substantiated the charges or brought the trial to issue  the bill on which the prisoners were indicted said the counsel who opened the case branches into several counts most of which taken separately are capital but the leading feature of offense may be divided into three parts viz conspiracy forgery and murder  the prosecutors and witnesses called in support of these heinous offenses were some of the most respectable men in the county the persons accused were some of the most daring and infamous that ever disgraced humanity amongst the first were mr partington john fitzorton charles stuart true george and several worthy domestics from their respective families and the gentlemen to whose lot it fell progressively to discuss and legally to determine upon the evidence which should be offered were of integrity so unwarped that had a friend or brother unfortunately violated the laws and been brought before them the most impartial justice would have been administered although their inward hearts might have bled at the award which that justice impelled  the leading counsel for the prosecution was mr morgan the honorable man who had been solicitor to the fitzortons many years now advanced to the bar and whom the colonel had already employed to punish some of the enemies and to reward some of the friends of society and the judge who happened at that time to be on the western circuit was james fitzorton then arrived at the highest honor and trust of the judicial character  the first person called upon by mr morgan to give evidence was colonel john fitzorton who deposed that the day after the prisoners were apprehended he was induced to explore the place where it had been found expedient to secure them on arriving at the mouth of the dungeon one of the witnesses jonathan armstrong who had kept watch through the night made report that almost immediately after the raging multitude and the castle party had left the spot an indistinct kind of noise ascended from the cave as of many persons whispering and groaning faintly but though the groaning kind of sounds remained the voices were soon more low and muttering as if persons had moved to a greater distance  that while the voices were loud he looked down into the dungeon and saw a flashing vapoury kind of light as if in the midst of a fog but when the groans grew fainter the flashing was gone and only a few misty sparks were left that very soon after all was thick darkness and a dreadful dumb kind of silence has continued ever since true george another of the nightguards corroborated this account and added that as he thrust his body downwards into the cell he was annoyed by a stench as if of sulphur and other combustible matter from which issued fire and smoke and the muttering groans which the former deponent spoke of seemed to come from the midst of it  from these and other reports which had been previously made john fitzorton further deposed that suspecting something of a criminal nature was yet to be discovered he selected half a dozen of his friends and descended armed into the dungeon several of the villagers following in despite of all remonstrance that he was prepared to find from witness brought by gapper the bottom of the gulf much wider than george had described it yet on gaining the bottom he was amazed to perceive every one of the culprits who had been thrust into the cave bound had disappeared conducted however by gappers witness whose evidence was material he proceeded further into the cavern which grew broader at every step it was vaulted above and below but every wholesome breeze absorbed by a noxious mist which clustered so thick around the lights and hung such heavy damps upon the glass and horn of the lanterns or threw such an infectious steam about the torches that the guide was often at a loss how to direct their steps that stopping to listen all was silent but after moving on a few paces and then making another pause a confused murmur of voices assailed his ears  the sounds seemed to issue from different parts of the abyss when moving onward such scenes presented themselves to the view as augmented the horrors the objects of his search were found distributed in various forms of misery some had crawled beneath a grating which had been made at the top of the dome into which the effluvia of a stagnant bed of waters that brooded above mingled with the polluted air and rather increased than dispelled the poisons of the dungeon below by blending therewith the miriads of infectious animalcula that fed on the vapors of the pool other wretches farther on were extended on the slippery ground or supporting themselves against the slimy walls which in many parts were covered with concretions of saltpetre  we hasted said the deponent to relieve the victims as soon as we discovered their situation but how great was our amazement to find every one of them unbound irresolute what to do we were soon invaded by a stench so deadly that it was with difficulty we could save ourselves from falling and perceiving that it increased as we advanced in that direction we were bending our course another way when a hollow kind of yell recalled our attention alarm gave us force and we again moved forward the yell now rather sounded like the collected moans of several persons dying in agony and became more audible the tremendous smells too augmented but two of the witnesses floresco and true george who had fearlessly rushed forward on the first surprise of the groans returned with marks of horror that absorbed the sense of danger our female guide too had been earnest with us to penetrate yet deeper into the precipice  pointing at the same time to a jutting wall that seemed to be only at a few paces we gained the wall with difficulty and it appeared to bound the prison our conductors however still pointed forward the wall was low and above it ascended a column of smoke mingled with sparks of fire the moaning was again heard floresco and george conducted us by an opening which shelved from the wall and in an instant we found ourselves in the midst of another distinct narrow dungeon but the smoke increased to such a degree as to smother even the flame that attempted to labor through it yet a refreshing air suddenly burst upon our senses and just as we began to inhale it a hasty step was heard and a voice exclaimed but as if gasping for life  the passage is at last broke and if we can breathe a few minutes longer we may escape still no person could be seen but one of our friends had darted through all obstructions and a shriek in the next instant from the exclaimer announced that the latter was safe in the gripe of jonathan armstrong all rushed onwards the gushing winds dispersed the smoke and blew up the flames  but more and yet greater horrors continued the prosecutor awaited us a number of persons were discovered either lying on the ground or near the fire as if recovering from almost a state of suffocation many of them however on perceiving us feebly raised themselves and attempted to escape through the passage door which had been forced but george and floresco ran forward guided by the draughts of the wind and intercepted them others were too much overwhelmed to attend even to the consequence of detection one alone amongst them with dreadful intrepidity sat unawed before the sulphurous flame which since the rushing in of the air surmounted all obstruction and illuminated the horrors of the cell amongst those horrors we had to enumerate the putrid relics of a human body over which the flame threw a livid glare that not only discovered those relicts but also other mutilated members which were yet consuming in the fire and the daring wretch who seemed to preside over the whole was at the moment of discovery preparing to cast another limb into the flames and to complete our astonishment this fury was a woman alas it is even as i told your honors then ejaculated the witness who had been our chief guide and who was likewise a female i knew he must die and now his murderers are trying to conceal the murder instantly proceeded the deponent every attendant secured one or other of the fugitives we seized a variety of offensive weapons and other instruments which lay beside them and surrounded the principal fiend she rose undaunted stood fixed and seeing us advance kept us a moment at bay uttering horrible execrations that reverberated through all the windings of the dungeon overpowered however by numbers she yielded in contemptuous silence meantime one of the banditti  who was trying to escape and endeavoring to make terms of mercy with george jonathan and floresco after he was caught attempted his preservation by informing them the secret door which they were guarding led to the subterraneous passage and as he was in the secret of all its labyrinths he would have the honor to conduct all their honors not doubting but they would speak a good word for him should their honors think it worth while to take any further notice of the business but the indignant george spurning the offer left the trembling wretch in the custody of jonathan while he hasted with the intelligence to our party measures were hereupon taken to profit by the information and the restoring air having by this time in some degree purged the atmosphere of its deadly obstructions time was given us to collect amass and carry off those more annoying objects alive and dead which fouler than the breath of pestilence had polluted the dungeon  all these circumstances being fully corroborated by the other witnesses whose depositions were severally taken the learned counsel then brought forward a body of evidence that established a variety of facts by which in substance it appeared that the offenders who had been long engaged in a course of nefarious practices and in alliance with each other had formed themselves into a body under the assumed name and garb of those itinerant cheats called gypsies the more securely and effectually to carry on an accumulation of delinquency in every part of which the persons forming the confederacy had a distinct and separate interest  the whole body being so necessary to each other that although in point of situation many members of the gang had been accustomed to perpetrate their atrocities in the higher and others in the lowest classes of mankind  a sort of social compact was maintained on the principle of selfpreservation for although each wished all the rest hanged not wilfully to hang one another was an act of policy since any attempt to snap or shorten the chain which united them would be but to convert the indignant links into so many halters for their own necks  but what was the indignation of the court and of the assembled multitude when they saw  and what will be that of the worthy reader when he finds that this excavated gang was chiefly formed of those depredators and assassins who were once associated with the late sir guise stuart  that the wretch who would have escaped from justice by impeaching others in the moment of detection was the execrable nicholas dabble and that the chief female fiend who was found in the bowels of the earth at her infernal rites was the daring lady tempest i will take upon me to create a world tomorrow says an accurate observer if today i can give rectitude of heart to one pettifogging attorney and the observation applies no less to one shameless woman when criminal habits and passions have wholly extinguished the moral principle yet even in characters like these the moral principle is not easily annihilated its destruction is usually the effect of gradual crimes sometimes even after a long and dreadful progression the keen and avenging sense of right and wrong asserts its long insulted power and arouses to shame and remorse sometimes with accumulating turpitude by continuing in dissolute society the internal guard of our nature is so far subdued as to want the force of rendering either an abandoned life or ignominious death terrible to the offender of the former part of this aweful truth the case of sir guise stuart has already furnished an example and the latter will be but too clearly illustrated in the conduct and destiny of the culprits now under the eye of the reader  we have briefly to unfold the cause of this horrid confederacy valentine miles and lady tempest stuart disappointed disgraced and traversed in many of their important machinations at the abbey and at the castle their hate for some of the inhabitants and their burning desire for others survived all their miscarriages mortifications and even punishments so effectually that soon after her ladyship had shaken off her husband she boldly and avowedly established her hazard and rouge et noir tables and her pharo bank  where contribution suppers vide a treatise on the police of the metropolis and the choicest wines were provided at fifty pounds a route and she ranked amongst her customers and subscribers an indiscriminate mixture of both sexes from the finished sharper to the raw inexperienced youth but amidst all the splendid plunder of the day and the still more gorgeous ruins of the night the flames of vengeance and of desire conflagrated her bosom the stinging thoughts of olivias marriage with henry and of carolines decided passion for him alone supplied fuel to the one passion and reflections on her innumerable degradations fed the rage of the other her valentine secretly sympathized in both they brought into one point of view what they had suffered from the first outrage to the last  miles recurred to the bullet of john fitzorton whose mark he yet carried in his neck  his disgraces at the adsell assassination  the scorn with which caroline received his vows of love  and the snapping of henrys fingers in the apartments of lady stuart  then mrs tempest  where he swore that the dearest blood of the offenders heart should one day repay the insult  all tended to accumulate the venom in his breast lady tempest also brooded over the contumely she had endured as well on some of the above as on various other account foiled in every attempt to embitter the happiness of olivia  her letters intercepted  her feeble stratagems rendered abortive either by true george or john fitzorton and driven by reiterated disappointments to despair  more particularly since the colonels conduct and menaces at the abbey carousals  the collected poisons of her fury far outstript even that of miles and the savage passion she yet felt for henry mixed strangely with her unquenchable and now maddening thirst of revenge which burnt the fiercer for being long unappeased the most dire intents indeed had been accumulating in the minds of both valentine and lady tempest before either dared to confide with the other their foul designs but the moment at last arrived both perceived they might communicate the exchange of one sanguinary look conveyed from eye to eye and from heart to heart the dreadful sympathy an oath of union past as by secret intelligence between them and they read in every feature without utterance of a word that the compact should be cemented by blood they snatched the hand of each other and in that moment the murder of john and henry fitzorton  and worse then the murder of caroline and olivia  were determined  the secret council of blood broke up after passing the following resolutions to remove every obstruction in the way of compassing the grand desideratum  to consider every other loss gain interest or difficulty or danger as subordinate till some of the victims were struggling in their arms and others laid dead at their feet in pursuit of these demoniac ends the means were proportionate the cost indeed would be enormous but avarice was now a secondary passion besides which the ladys banks had literally overflowed of late to such a degree that the golden tides of half her ruined friends and vanquished enemies had rolled their treasures into her hand and valentine independent of his share in those more obvious frauds had learned the science of moneymaking another way for with a noble ambition of calling into action all his versatile powers and showing they were alike adapted for the business of one part as for the pleasures of the other part of the metropolis he had recently engaged in no less than five of the coinages police of the metropolis  out of near half a hundred that are almost constantly employed in london and these private mints had been so productive as often to have yielded him a thousand pounds a week many of his fabricators creating and giving currency ibid to fifty pounds a day intrinsically not worth fifty shillings nay to such a point of perfection had he arrived in this line that he sometimes procured from the coiners who worked for him from  00l to  00l for country orders in the course of the week mutually possessed of such resources the means of accomplishing almost any evil end were thus thrown into the hands of lady tempest stuart and her compeer and though their longconceived hatred envy and jealousy of each other were by no means abated a common villainy now again held them together more firmly than before and the amicable way in which they carried it on might have led superficial observers to believe they had always been and then were the very best friends in the world dabble on the other hand from a run of adversity in a new branch of atrocity had found more than usual exercise for his little niceties  insatiable avarice was the grand vice of this mans character and to gratify this in every way and by every mode of enterprise and exaction had been the incessant toil of life but he had been unfortunate since we last saw him  unfortunate in the lottery  from having been the invisible proprietor of some insurance offices for the ostensible men of straw in the shape of receivers and payers having filled their pockets with the spoil imitated their employers great example and became invisible also unfortunate likewise in advancing money upon bonds title deeds and estates in reversion in hopes of usurious interest  and all this hope broke suddenly under him  then the courts were open only to issue out warrants for apprehending him and shut against him for ever as a practicing attorney and lastly with these strokes of illluck he had lost his consequence and credit with my lady and valentine yet the time was now come round when his daily professed and almost as daily rejected services were again acceptable various inferior instruments and subordinate wheels in the grand machine of the castle and abbey conspiracy were now wanted and mr nicholas dabble was employed to collect these the business was opened with very little ceremony and the terms settled without difficulty he undertook the thing on speculation and with unwearied alacrity  and indeed in less time than it would cost an honest man to pick up a single rogue or indeed reconcile his feelings to look for one this active gentleman had ascended and descended into the haunts of as many undertakers as would make honest men wonder how they past a single day or night without being assaulted or robbed wounded or murdered a chosen band of his old acquaintance to whom he had before given jobs and whom he knew to be ready for all vicious occasions at a moments warning were mustered disciplined and trained to action the troop was raised from the following personages most of whom it is probable have a mark set upon them in the readers memory  first the stumpmaker and chum who since their bargain with jonathan and jerome had found their account in assuming their own legs to run away with parcels of which they tricked boys shopmen or persons coming from the country  secondly the ingenious mr smith who conducted sir guise to the handinhand one of the illregulated public houses where fraudulent persons find an asylum to consult how and where they are to commit depredations on the public and of which there are  000 in london  and who had recently been advanced from stealing goods as a petty pilferer to opening a house for receiving such goods knowing them to be stolen  thirdly mr scuttle late the waiter at the handinhand now one of the fifty thousand persons computed to pursue gaming as a trade in london daily  fourthly the lady who acted as foil to the widow on the memorable night of henrys visit to the theater but who a little before ranked only as one of the fifty thousand females of the metropolis who are estimated to pursue publicly their abandoned trade  fifthly the two loving brothers david and gamaliel otley who had been in perpetual strife for the palm of roguery and who had never been able to settle the point to their own satisfaction or to any other persons so nearly equal were their pretensions each having with the most laudable emulation labored to excel in his vocation till at length both had ascended the climax from the theft of a nail a skewer a key or a glass bottle up to the most valuable articles there were also added to the phalanx one of the persons known to belong to the fraternity of thieves whose depredations are calculated to amount to the enormous sum of seven hundred and ten thousand pounds a year there was likewise a professional bludgeon man and an armed ruffian who are to be hired for any hazardous enterprise the terms regulated by the degrees of danger expected opposition etc but who at other times assume the trade of hawkers and pedlars etc in which character they only cheat and pilfer but in their former capacity they are to be let out by their proprietors of which mr dabble was still one at so much per head from simple assault to determined assassination and to close the whole mr scuttle the new handinhand landlord whose fitness for any mischief that might be coining in those mints of wickedness the heads of miles and my lady stuart will not be questioned when the reader is informed that the lottery insurance committee both agents and clerks amounting to near two thousand met twice a week at his house and that the bludgeon establishment had there its monthly club  but while mr dabble was collecting his daring and strong minded bravoes to cover the retreat or in case of obstinate resistance to proceed to the last extremities dabble himself conducting the secret expedition as general of the banditti under the command of fieldmarshal valentine miles and his associate the latter was not idle one of the first loves of lady stuart was mr thomas whom she still considered as an old friend and who had been part of her establishment while she resided at the abbey he there became acquainted with an under groom of the manorhouse of such promising talents that he took on himself the trouble of training him to rob his master and most of his fellow servants of sundry articles which mr thomas said he would purchase but when the theft was made and the spoil presented he thought proper all at once to scruple  seized upon the young delinquent and swore he would produce witnesses to prove  though no person had been present at the time  that he had offered the stolen goods to him but that he refused to receive them and only had them in his possession like an honest man to make discovery terrified at this being then young in crime the boy supplicated for mercy which the tenderhearted mr thomas granted on certain conditions  to wit  that he should undertake to transact any business he might be trusted with for any part of the castle or manorhouse families and as that trust was faithfully or unfaithfully discharged mercy or justice should be administered the trembling culprit promised and was almost immediately employed to deliver a letter to olivia from lady tempest which had it fallen into the hands of the former would have torn up the happiness perhaps of her whole life by the roots for it struck a dagger at the faith honor and tenderness of henry fitzorton in every line the letter carrier meeting however with true george while he was watching his opportunity olivia then being at the castle some suspicious circumstances ensued which brought on a discovery and with this george hurried  the boy in his gripe  to john fitzorton who affected to chide george for stopping a servant in discharge of his duty said the letter should be taken care of and dismissed the boy only desiring him to deliver future presents either to him or george and that for every such packet he should receive a gratuity the boy promised and kept his word being well paid by both parties without saying a word of his double dealing to either george thought it strange till the colonel explained and thus was olivias peace preserved from a train of evils with jealousy the hydra at their head but this boy advanced too rapidly in the furtive profession which mr thomas had taught him and was sent away in disgrace mr thomas himself was expelled soon after when the abbey arrangements broke up but he was fated to great preferment as keeper of a registeroffice and there his old friend the stableboy came after many other disgraces to look for a place the banditti plan was then beginning to form thomas still supposing he had the boy on the hip recommended him to lady tempest he was soon after enrolled amongst the conspirators for his brilliant suggestions of the gypsey plan  the subterraneous cavern  and an assertion that he knew some of those who had really been amongst the abbey tribe they are now clippers and coiners said the boy no longer ago than yesterday one of them told me my fortune which was that i should soon again see the old abbey  and ecod if we go upon this expedition the fortune will come true you know mr thomas in pursuance of his promise he introduced the cidivant gypsies to miles and my lady the former of whom recognized five of his moneymakers four of whom were delighted at the thought of another frolic to the abbey asserting that they could carry on part of their new employment as well in one place as another  under ground as above ground  in town or country  and that they would undertake not only to bring back the gypsey complexion into their own faces but to tinge every other as well as dress up all the characters in the true gypsey style so as to make it impossible for parents to know their children or children their parents besides teaching the occult science and all the cant of the profession concluding with the following declaration  that they owed john fitzorton and true george a grudge for some rigorous acts of the former consequent on the reports of the latter and would assist in the destruction of both with all their hearts and souls the fifth was a very young creature and followed her associates reluctantly  the full complement of conspirators was now obtained and with the different implements of their different trades and stratagems and the assistance of the very secondhand cloathesmerchant who supplied sir guise stuart with his quaker apparel and properly stained they set forward they soon established themselves in the abbeywoods without opposition they had previously gained intelligence of sir guise and the return of the whole abbey party and found means to make themselves masters of the exact state of affairs at the castle and chapelhouse the fiendlike president in her tenfold disguise often shot her dire and deathlike glances at the victims she had marked as she paced her rounds of the castle the abbey and the chapelhouse she felt a horrid joy as she caught a glance at henry herself unseen the pangs of desire agonized her heart even while she meditated the murder of the object john fitzorton true george olivia caroline charles and father arthur alternately assailed her view as she prowled the wood paths lighted her fire of withered leaves or came laden like the rest of her sable companions with the fallen branches or with the alms which for the sake of preserving her assumed character she condescended to collect her glut of vengeance indeed made her forego all claims and forget all ideas of former selflove she set the example of hardihood and a disdain of difficulty to the rest she abstained from every excess though their rags and moving furniture and habitation concealed were enriched by the choicest fare these she distributed prudently to the rest but practiced a stern selfdenial on her own habits of luxury her profuse tresses were darkened by art and tucked within a dirty coif and while her grim associates stretched along the woods or slumbered in the caverns she still held watch and passed the night in gloomy vigilance intent upon her prey miles was no less diligent dabble was alternately in every quarter every evil spirit was either on guard or on the scout thrice was that part of their plan which respected henry and john on the edge of being effected by the silent operation of poisons but was of necessity suspended the death of sir guise alone prevented his assassination and the night of his funeral was at length judged to be most apt for the grand burst of vengeance but it was broken off by a quarrel amongst themselves the brother otleys were still at strife about superiority but now gamaliel was endued with a trust more confidential and more intrepid than that of david to him was allotted the distinction of taking vengeance on john fitzorton and a chosen band was appointed him for that enterprise david expostulated and threatened to go himself instantly to the castle and make discovery of the whole plot he was directly seized by the furious tribe and till his fare could be determined the dungeon of the abbey was his prisonhouse there they suffered him either through resentment or the absorbing image of revenge on others to die of famine one of the females however less callous than the rest and who had in a former gypsey expedition attached herself to a youth of the legitimate tribe as those at the castle were called even with the son of the chief took pity on his sufferings and relieved him but found him almost gasping for breath i die said he but let it not be unrevenged on those who have murdered me  fly this instant  take with you this bundle of rags which hold the secret fates of the noblest men  the loveliest women  my ancient masters  my best friends  all i have wronged  all who are marked for an almost immediate and dreadful death  if you would escape the hell that now burns within me and happily shall burn for ever  lose not a moment  away i die the wretch with a despairing hand seized part of the food which she had brought and expired devouring it the terrified jeputha so was she called rushed from the cavern by the secret door which she had explored and gaining the woods that united with the subterraneous passage unperceived and favored by the night she followed an impulse she could not resist not to make her reports at the castle but accelerated both by horror and affright she traveled onward nor rested her step till she gained the bury where seeking the tribe who were protected by partington she gave into the hands of the gypseychief and his son the mysticpapers which led to the discovery and by means of which their detestable machinations were prevented thus was the ungrateful david otley appointed to save the lives of those whom he had often betrayed and whose death he treacherously imagined and devised  the proofs of these enormities were consummate and manifold the mutilated limbs and halfconsumed body of the apostate otley were upon the spot to establish the murder  the instruments for the fabrication of base money  an enormous evil  so as to counterfeit the current coin of these kingdoms vide police of the metropolis  the moulds dies flatted plates copper blanks cream of tartar phosphorus etc etc intended to prevent one wickedness from being at a stand still while another was in motion had been all brought from the caverns into court the villainy of miles as the proprietor of these and whom on conviction his accomplices gave up was unquestionable the proteus dabble shuddered with consciousness the moment he beheld john fitzorton as a prosecutor mr morgan as counsel and james fitzorton as his judge invention had failed and even the pettifogging attorney was left without a subterfuge the inferior members of the banditti taught to expect the gallows sooner or later as a thing of course felt without much surprise or emotion that their time was come and tempest stuart who had preserved a sullen and savage kind of disdainful silence from the moment she was overpowered just as she saw the fatal velvet laid on the head of the judge exclaimed in a satanic grandeur had the deed been done this would have been the most triumphant hour of my life  when the criminals after they had been separated were brought up collectively to receive sentence  never has there been passed a final judgment as to the destiny of this world with more temper or equity regulated by wisdom and softened by commiseration even for the depravity of our fellowmortals  never has a verdict been found more to the satisfaction of all orders of men  most of the delinquents were capitally convicted and remanded to the place from whence they came till the aweful day that should separate them for ever from the community they had so long dishonored and despoiled and we will now leave them upon the records of our history as just but terrible examples  chapter live to the punishment and ignominy of the vicious however succeeded an event of the most unexpected kind from the relation of which the virtuous must feel a pang  olivia fitzorton had resisted every persuasion of her friend the apothecary in regard to nourishing her child at her own breast on account of a pectoral complaint the only one from which personally speaking she had ever felt inconvenience in her whole life she argued that the infant which drew its first and purest nourishment from the bosom of a stranger was in effect but half its mothers child she hence deemed it a practice so unnatural as to be but one remove from a sucking babe being turned out of doors by its mother without any nourishment at all and if it be true would she say that any part of the disposition of the foster parent be infused with the milk the fashion of the times can only be justified when the natural nurse conscious of a bad constitution or of a worse heart trembles at the thought of entailing upon her offspring her own infirmities of body or of mind but even in that case she insisted that the utmost investigation should be made into the health and morals of the woman to whom the child was to be entrusted otherwise she conceived that the real mother was as responsible for the future sorrows sins and sickly or tainted habits of her infant as if they were more immediately derived from herself and as to the circumstance of a spoiled shape or any other cause assigned by ambitious beauty or negligent fashion for the transfer of their offspring to a hireling she would have blushed with shame or wept with grief could any one have judged her capable of covering the vanity of a wife and a parent under so unfeeling an apology  it is however certain that in a few pulmonary cases a mother cannot possibly indulge in a more fatal tenderness than to suckle her own child and an injury which olivia had in very early youth received was unfortunately of that kind  she owned however that it was possible she might in the present instance be wrong as she did not feel herself quite so stout as usual but the custom was so natural in general that she could not allow herself to be an exception the infant angelica was therefore fed from its morthers breast and exhibited every sign of good health during the first month the solemnity and festival of the christening at which on account of carolines absence johanna became sponsor was performed and observed with all the innocent mirth that affection decorum and gratitude could supply the conduct of her henry and of every friend was all in effect that love itself could in its fondest solicitude perform the child continued thriving to its eighth month when the hoopingcough weakened it to a degree that the tender mother was induced to keep it at the breast long after mr burton and indeed the parents own health had given warning it ought to be weaned the ravaging disorder on arriving at its crisis induced convulsions which put an end to the life of the babe on the day that it had accomplished its first year the physician who had attended partingtons brother apprehended that a degree of putridity accompanied inflammation in the last week of the childs disorder and was earnest with olivia to suspend her attendance with this requisition being seconded by henry she complied as he insisted on remaining with her in the apartment and as he shared the love to share the danger of a parent on the first favorable symptom of abating heat however reported with caution by the good apothecary the mother flew to the cradle where seeing luster in the eye and bloom on the cheek of her child although these were but the insidious flushings and flame of the malady  she caressed her little angelica with a mothers ardent sincerity  but alas she at the same time drew venom from its lips  olivia was herself seized with a fever the succeeding evening which made such devouring progress as to baffle every human aid and olivia and her babe the former almost as free from the tinge of the world as the latter expired within a few hours of each other  the suspicion that her disorder was infectious prevailed neither on henry nor john fitzorton to withhold their attendance the prayers and tears of olivia could avail nothing with the former  nor was the latter ever absent but when it was inevitable  neither could johanna or mrs herbert who had long been returned from the bury be deterred from administering to their friend  the children alone were restrained and these only because partington had literally run away with them to the bury on the first mention of danger but came back himself to the castle and was one of the most assiduous in attempting the preservation of its fairest inhabitant ah deny us not  deny not your henry at least  o most good  most excellent  his claims in all you hope in all you fear said he  as i have long lived for you so i swear to you best of wives and parents  would i die  but the angel of death had its mandate and olivia obeyed yet she was in the fullest possession and almost in the enjoyment of her reason till within a few minutes of her being removed to regions where the proudest reach of human thought is as infant feebleness her latest powers of mind were employed in assuring her surrounding family  and she desired those who loved her which was in truth all who knew her might be assured also that as she had long lived so was she now dying the happiest of the happy she tenderly embraced all present in their turn she joined the hands of johanna and the lieutenant  of true george and of her gentle jane the latter of whom she embraced twice and whispered as if it were the whispering of cherubim a certainty of seeing knowing and loving her where the society of the good is eternal then as the overwhelmed henry and john approached  she exerted that fortitude which the faith alone that inspires it can bestow  o unutterably loved and honored this would be the moment of hopeless desolation  the moment in which i should quit my being in despair could i suppose it was that which was to separate me for ever from henry  she paused and john who had hitherto borne his agony well by turns advancing and receding and as often standing aloof or sheltered from observation by the crowd at length came forward  and thou o pride and patron of all my happy days said olivia extending her hand  thou art another cause why i should have hope in death  my little ones  bless bless them o god  will have two parents  two  ah i know not how many good beings will extend toward them a parents love  can they ever want a mothers care while these kind generous friends and my dear absent caroline remain on earth  ah my henry tell her whom in dawning life i loved that with my last remains of breath i bless her  and tell her too continued she exerting herself to become distinct that did i not believe her affections were placed in a bosom too wise too noble to suffer the external forms of devotion to prove an impediment now prayer and penitence and death have removed the more substantial obstacle  olivia looked at john and then proceeded  my spirit would not fly even to the regions of happiness in perfect joy but for this till i had bequeathed her to the father of my children  my dearest dearest henry  a few minutes only prior to her dissolution her mind seemed to vibrate betwixt reason and delirium during which she supplicated that her dead infant might be brought to her poor love it can do me no harm now said she her life indeed was ebbing fast away and her physician desired she might be gratified in her request accordingly her husband brought the little angelica but stood with it at some distance as if still in fear of its infection when olivia perceived a complacent smile on her infants face and declared that her dream was out  it has certainly a likeness of henry said she and it will be my guide to happiness eternal  yes my vision is come to pass see  see john  the very lineaments of your brother  even as i told you  the child shall convey its happy mother to heaven  already the crown of glory is encircling me and now in the blazing sapphire i read  blessed are the merciful  you know the rest  she uttered this with a mixture of wildness and coherence shifting her looks alternately from the child to its father and then to heaven she beckoned henry to come nearer  there can be no longer any thing to fear or to hope said the physician indulge her henry advanced with the corpse of his latest born the eyes of olivia seemed to settle on both as if from sensations of joy  then bending toward them she stretched forth her hands as to receive her child softly saying  you will follow us and in the succeeding instant she yielded up her innocent life in her husbands arms  chapter lv never perhaps has there been since the beginning of time a death more serene if we except the few wandering moments that preceded it and even those seemed to blend the slight sigh of parting life with a foretaste of heavenly transport never had there been a life more free from malady or woe never has there been nor shall there ever be a death more generally or more deservedly lamented although perhaps after a life so free from evil and replete with good it is a species of selflove even if it be not of sinfulness to grieve that such a spirit is gone to enjoy the fullness of its recompense  humanity however long and poignantly bewailed its loss for not only kindred virtue but every other that deigns to visit mortals were votaries at the shrine of olivia fitzorton and amongst those votaries none were more sincere than henry who not only in the first impressions but for many months after seemed so abstracted from himself as to have not even a thought that divided him from the memory of her to whose happiness for the greater part of his life he had been a generous martyr  but friendship gratitude pity and all that incites to acts of justice founded on these demand that the sacred sorrows of john fitzorton should not be overlooked  while the sole being who had ever truly touched his heart was taking an eternal leave of him and the world not a tear was seen upon his cheek not a sigh was heard from his bosom and he was the first to quit the chamber of death when that being was no more henry on the contrary remained beside the body with one arm still clasping his dead child in despite of all argument  long after dr partington and the apothecary had in a manner forced every other person even the faithful true george out of the room but when the physician demanded a conference with the colonel on that subject john went back into the chamber and by gentle yet cogent accents of persuasion  and asking if he had determined to leave his surviving children without any parent when they most wanted a fathers care henry sprung from the bed on which he had thrown himself betwixt his deceased wife and babe and suffered himself to be conducted into his own apartment  he had expressed his design to remain there for the rest of the night but true george who resolved to sit up with him had by an inadvertent expression changed his purpose when do they talk questioned henry of taking the remains of my wife and child from me alas tomorrow your honor answered the afflicted george because as it is thought they died of something that was catching dr partington and mr burton say it will not be right for them to stay long in the castle  but for my part if it was not for your honor and another person or two i should wish to catch the malady that i might die too for i dont find any thing a person gets by living here in this world but seeing people one loves go one after another out of it  henry who had not taken off his clothes scarcely staid long enough to hear the whole of georges reflections but attending chiefly to the information which preceded them  he declared his wish to take his last leave of the remains of olivia and her little one  and there can be no opportunity so favorable as the moment before us said he henry went into olivias chamber attended by george whom however he beckoned to stop at the door which being partly opened henry moved forward with cautious and trembling steps as if fearful of disturbing those who were in the sleep of death as he was approaching the bed he beheld john bending over it on the side he had himself entered checked by surprise and awe he suspended his step and distinctly heard the words which his brother was uttering  they breathed over the dead body of olivia the first declaration of love they recapitulated the conduct which that love had urged to preserve the peace of its object unbroken to the last moment of her life and if o sacred spirit said the lover addressing the corpse of which he had taken up one of the lifeless hands and laid it on his bosom  if in the unencouraged but resistless feelings a sentiment more tender than brother ever felt  perhaps ever can feel  has sometimes assailed my heart and aught of blame should still attach to eternally combated and involuntary emotion let thy now angel prayers intercede with the bestower of that heart to absolve my frailty yet how can error mix with a principle which at this moment that i am beholding thee a breathless corpse hastening to decay making that corpse more welcome to my eye more precious to my soul than all thou have left behind thee to bloom in health and youth and beauty ah no like the soul itself my affection shall be eternal attend me as in thy life time here and follow thee to other worlds  john had turned his head somewhat startled for henry impelled by his feelings came onward the colonel had still retained one of olivias hands henry said he you have discovered my passion you now perceive that a wretch more disastrous than yourself had really being  behold the victim behold too the object of his affection but she is no more thy wife my brother death has dissolved the bond that made her fond and faithful hand appropriate to henry alas it is mouldring into naught the ascended spirit therefore which has left it is now our object  that too is free of human ties except by heavenly sympathy and those who still love her must share with myriads with all the host of heaven  the brothers tenderly embraced john pressed olivias hand yet more fondly and gently replacing it by her side withdrew from the bed to the window turning his eyes on the body as he walked from it he lingered a moment passed the chamber and disappeared then reentered  receded again and again advanced henry kneeled down by the side of the bed and caressed by turns olivia and angelica then put one of the infants arms within the clasp of its mothers in the position he had found it forgive me angel soul of her said he who once gave almost matchless beauty to this lifeless form  o forgive me if i was less sensible to those wondrous graces than they deserved thou now art happily conscious of the motive and will pardon what constancy to former vows and unconquerable love of their object alone could cause had those vows been thine the boasted beauties of the earth  the earth itself would have wanted power to draw me deliberately from thee  john who had a second time returned heard in turn this declaration and when it was closed ran hastily to his brother pressed him with the utmost affection to his bosom and wept they left the sacred chamber together turning at every step but when john had ordered the attendants who were waiting without to return into olivias apartment to watch the bodies and had conducted henry into his own chamber at the door of which the unwearied george was waiting his masters return  brother said he i feel an assurance not of this world that our prayers are heard our penitence accepted for the rest our weakness must have way  and our pillow may be steeped in the tears of our frailty because we are still of the earth  but happy as was our olivia how faint how feeble the most distinguished moments of that felicity to the bliss she now enjoys let us part in peace if john fitzorton can reconcile himself to her loss it ought to be supportable to henry  on the evening however of the succeeding day henry showed signs of the disorder we have alluded to and dr partingtons brother the physician as well as the good apothecary determined it to be the result of incautious attendance in olivias apartment john and the rest of the family and its friends escaped but the more irritable henry caught the malady and was its prey for several months  during which not one of his friends of the abbey bury or castle could be persuaded by any warnings of danger to leave him he remained almost a year with alternations of weakness and strength and when his body might be called convalescent his mind appeared still to suffer from an incurable wound charles stuart the almost constant attendant of his pillow observed this and imparted it to the colonel who watching by his bedside a favorable interval kindly took his hand and thus addressed him   i have attended with pleasure my dear henry to the progress of your returning health but that pleasure has been and is still checked by what i have observed  a solicitude  a misery not the effect of the weakness which mere illness leaves behind still bends you to the earth my brother we are left to the support and consolation of each other conside to me the cause and let me see if it cannot be removed  perhaps the incapacitating powers of a severe and tedious malady have too long robbed you of the solace of your accustomed employments  infirmity does still neglect all office from the sick pillow even the muse will take her flight  the friend and inspirer of our gayer hours and of our youthful enthusiasms our play of fancy and our flow of spirit  yes she like other faithless mistresses often leaves her votaries when they can no longer administer to her vanity or soothe her with melodious adulations i say not this in mockery of her art for i have long ceased to attack even the vulnerable parts of her magic since the day that i saw my brother wounded in spirit beyond the reach of sportive ridicule or serious remonstrance  since i saw that he was not simply the victim of that dire system of sentimental insanity which men of feverish imaginations have opposed to the fortitude of human beings and the duty of christians  since i noted his resolution to drink of the bitter cup that might not pass from him  earnest to turn to pious advantage the trials of providence and relinquish the thought of spurning its dispensations by flying into the presence of the power who appointed them i have forborne to take from any thing that might be encouraged its power of diverting you  but something more important than science or song now calls upon my henrys powers he has a heart to feel that one real charity shown to the lowest of the sons of men in the most desolate corner of the earth though it were but to carry into a hut the comfort of a single morsel when that morsel was wanted and deserved returns to the restorer a transport more sincere and presents to him an image more resplendent than all the picrures of bounty which the elect of apollo ever painted or shall i say that realizes the painting and poesy of the most happy and benevolent muse whose best fount of suspiration is a generous heart the cottages and the cottagers of our now angel friend  we should learn to speak of her as we do of heaven itself  with chastened pleasure  yet devoid of grief continued john sighing  i say my brother these cottagers  and perhaps more than these  are devolved on you  it would gladden your heart to hear their daily hourly enquiries  to see the confirmations of their grateful love  and a continuance of all their joys shall again be yours  my dear dearest brother exclaimed henry embracing him  but even the exercise of bounty continued john rich as it is in happiness cannot wholly occupy an active mind short as life is it will be found too long for every man who wants employment proportioned to his powers how shall i again bring forward what has so often been unsuccessfully proposed to you how shall i remind you that  while you have generously obeyed our blessed father in perhaps a hard command you still are disobedient in regard to another not so rigorous i obeyed him according to my promise answered henry in all that was possible i resisted only that which even at the time of the command was beyond the reach of my obedience  else so aweful was the moment at which i received his last commands and so little power had i to advert to myself when i beheld him leaving me for ever that had a thousand more sacrifices been exacted i should have promised to become the victim of them all i do not comprehend you said john  it could not be beyond your power to enter into that profession for which you had been designed and although we all observed a negligence in your preparations i have for my own part always imputed it to your former perplexed situation and a too vigorous pursuit of other studies there was indeed a time when i could not but think your devotion to the muse interrupted devotion of a higher kind never god forbid answered henry i trust resumed john you did not withdraw from the sacred path in which your father walked with so much honor to compliment the faith of any other person however dear the object  henry sprung up in his bed withdrawing his hand with some force from the clasp of his brother compliment away my faith fie fie  no sir  no john said he  nor would the object to whom you alluded have accepted  she would have spurned the compliment  scorned the man who could insult her with the offer john was extremely moved forgive dear henry forgive me said he my harsh qualities you perceive are not yet all subdued let us proceed like brothers you know the reasons which have closed my lips on subjects that i knew were of deep concern to you but i did not close my eyes i have not passed over caroline stuart amongst unheeded things i have observed her in the hours of varied trial of hard temptation  i have noticed her often willing to yield her life but never to swerve from any of its duties  i have beheld that life sinking gradually away against all her exerted powers to preserve it because its preservantion was the command of god even while for herself existence wanted every comfort of health and every relief of hope  when indeed she repelled hope because it was error to harbor and crime to encourage it the colonel perceiving his brother much agitated beseeched him to hear what he had farther to offer with patience in a thousand points my henry continued he this has been the victim which has surpassed us all in suffering and in suffering well and i have for some time ceased to wonder at your attachment taking into consideration the early impression by which it was formed but it was against all order all rectitude all sacred laws that i should tell you so before  here embracing henry he proceeded to inform him how he had contemplated this subject  thus have i argued said john i have not been unfaithful even to my second impressions why should my brother be inconstant to his first and what has a difference of religious belief to do with religion itself when i thought oppositely to this did i not think narrowly did i not think wrong have i not since found the essence of devotion the same in the catholic father arthur and the protestant sir armine and was not the latter heavily mistaken in this objection surely had this been the only one it might have yielded to the discussions of reason and truth but there were alas so many others  and some so horrible   o my ever generous and good protector interrupted henry it has been my fate through life to be entangled in the mazes of involuntary secrets inevitable mysteries another is yet behind and that had been shut up for ever in the few hearts to which it has been confided had the cause continued which made it at first and for so many years continued it a private concern to that heart alone we have all of us had perhaps in some points too little domestic confidence the secrets of our family have been also secrets to ourselves and exacted from us by events reserves beget reserve though in our perplexed state of general counteraction the most unbounded confidence would have little availed no i did not compliment away my religion but the faith of her i loved  became mine  brother ejaculated john mine resumed henry on contemplation  on choice  i adopted it in the very conviction of my heart  i observed it operate on the age of father arthur  on the youth of caroline  and although i saw the same spirit differing in a few ceremonials influence the no less pious life of my venerable father and shed grace divine on the conduct of olivia  i was affected even by the forms which the protestant church rejects and on the day that caroline stuart heard my vows of love i made with my own heart those vows which even to this day she has not heard that our religion should be one hence my long postponement  against all remonstrance  during the lifetime of my father of carrying into effect one part of his plan for me although i did not deem it right  when i found communication would only have embittered the remains of his life  to betray my secret  then you are catholic said john and by whom may you have been proselited by no one answered henry to one alone i imparted my feelings father arthur i presume exclaimed john scornfully i am eager for his reply it was brief cried henry he told me it would violate the sanctity of his own belief in things most holy were he to dissuade and it would trench on his conduct as a neighbor and a friend of sir armine fitzorton a distinguished member of the church of england to countenance what i had confided your confidence in me is safe said he but i can give no council i had my fears cried john i am glad i wronged him o if you thought him accessory to my resolves you did indeed wrong him answered henry  i urged him to tell me if he thought i was proceeding in the right path i trust in god we are all doing so he answered i importuned him to admit me to his chapel at his hours of prayer you press me hardly youth said he i will not invite i dare not exclude the temple in which your pious father adores the almighty would not be shut against a catholic supplicant who might wish to enter can i close the door of mine upon a protestant votary  noble arthur then you are not in verity a papist questioned john  in verity answered henry what call you truth is it not from within what mean you by vows do the words and external signs by which they are expressed make them bonds or give them sanctity  henry took from under his pillow a crucifix and then resumed his questions  derive those vows any hallowed potency from this frail image of him to whose real essence they were offered are they not all consecrated by the heart as i was not absolutely banished from the chapel i attended though i am ashamed to say by stealth both its matin and vesper duties the monk one day demanded if i had yet consulted with sir armine i owned that i knew his steadiness of faith too well to dare communicate i dare answered the monk but on my promising that before i again joined his congregation in that way my fathers consent should be attained or i would bring proof it should be no longer expedient to solicit it he was silent on the subject i withdrew however from all public forms and communed only with myself my nuptials no longer to be postponed and impossible to be prevented took place i yielded up every thing in that hour  that moment  but what i could not change  my love and my religion those were in the sanctuary of my own heart excuse brother this prolixity the occasion claims it  and it unfolds to you a thousand mysteries in my conduct respect my sincerity should you blame my election i am no example to others but i am true to my own belief  god knows replied john which of us is most in the right but it is clear to me that although i give you full credit for your feelings  and pity from my soul all you must have suffered to conceal them it appears very clear that had caroline stuart been a protestant you would never have been a catholic we will not however discuss the point farther for i am brought round to what i at first proposed to mention by a very circuitous way it has pleased the omnipotent my brother to remove many apparently insuperable impediments and the most inauspicious passion that perhaps the human heart ever set out with as its only hope in the morning of life has risen above several of the darkest clouds in the noon of your days there is every reason to believe a renewal of your affections now they may be innocently offered would not be unacceptable to her for whom doubtless your love can easily be revived  revived exclaimed henry  i will have one of my solitary thinkings on this matter resumed john smiling but his face pallid and care upon his brow meantime be assured that i shall not allow you to suffer any pain or forego any pleasure when it is consistent and within my power to prevent the one and promote the other  by such means was henry relieved from the last and one of the most burdensome mysteries that had ever hung upon his heart and thus too were again opened prospects on which he had not even dared to cast his eyes or voluntarily fix his thoughts for many years  it was amongst his brother johns maxims never to hint a promise without good likelihood of its being in his power to perform it and as the result of his meditation on the above subject was a belief that henry fitzorton and caroline stuart after all their sacrifices and sufferings deserved to come together and as their union no longer seemed to oppose any other duty could not he hoped be offensive even to the spirits of his father or of olivia which if conscious of the projecting design were conscious also of the long reverence shown to and at length the honorable removal of every former barrier as the last balm therefore which could be poured over his own wounds john set on foot a treaty with the assistance of the lieutenant that might at length heal those of his brother and friend  chapter lvi in pursuance of this plan he wrote to father arthur a letter of which charles stuart himself promised to be the bearer  my dear and reverend sir the important  i will not since they were the designations of heaven call them unfortunate events which have happened in our family since your departure have probably been described to you by our johanna or some other of our friends they will be more particularly letter which is to tell you that i no longer see any reason to prevent henry fitzorton and caroline stuart from becoming man and wife nor have i now any objection to their being united according to the forms and ceremonies of the catholic church this declaration will serve to show that i am in the confidence both of the love and religion of my brother and chastened as both have been by almost every species of trial from the sacred hand of god himself i shall no more presume to oppose myself to either and in doing this notwithstanding all past horrors i humbly trust that i shall offend neither the living nor the dead implacability is inconsistent with divine natures and if penitence can receive pardon from god it should surely be sufficient to the forgiveness of men made angels and that the recompense we are preparing for longsuffering worth will be pleasing to the spirits of peace the reward which is now preparing for the happiness of those whose hearts have been proved must owe much to your manner of representing to miss stuart the several mysterious truths  mysterious alas to mortals  but of easy process to that heavenly director who conducts the apparently irreconcilable interests of unnumbered worlds to your wisdom and loving kindness i submit the furtherance of the measure proposed our worthy charles will readily be your auxiliary and he is moreover charged with some proposed arrangements as well regarding his own plans of establishment as that of his friends  venerable and respectable man farewell   the generous writer of this epistle looked upon the object it was intended to accomplish as so nearly a good obtained that he could not withhold its contents from henry because they would in effect convey his own sentiments while they sanctioned those of his brother the lieutenant was therefore dispatched to henrys room and after the two friends had conferred no time was lost in preparations or in performance of the journey true george now seeing his master make rapid advances toward health supplicated to be the lieutenants attendant and the next morning they set out  but while the house of fitzorton had been alternately the residence of hope and fear and every extreme of sorrow and of joy in the refuge of arthur  in an obscure nook of the world  the most serious and important events had taken place alas where is that corner of the globe exempt from changes of which the globe itself is the victim  on the arrival of the lieutenant and true george at the island recess to which they passed immediately from dartmouth neither arthur nor caroline were to be found the landlord had taken possession of his house and from him our astonished travelers understood that his reverence and the family had left the island finally about six weeks ago that the lady caroline had departed a month before but that the monk came to fetch his young black and his old steward and the little old dog they all made so much of and to give up the house paying however the rent to the uttermost farthing and whither are they gone questioned the lieutenant  why your honor answered the landlord taking a slip of paper from his pocketbook this is the place where i was as occasion served to send letters but though all them pointing to a packet in the parlour window have arrived no opportunity of forwarding them has happened since his reverence went last away the lieutenant now saw letters in the characters of mrs herbert and johanna and read with increased amazement the following address in the monks own handwriting pere arthur maison de post a coutance bas normandy while charles was reflecting what could possibly be the motive that directed them to that part of the world and without having confided in any of their mutual friends or in himself as a brother a letter which had just come in by the english packet was delivered to him containing these words  my dear friend the enclosed reached the castle within an hour after you had left it it is manifestly the hand writing of father arthur but the foreign post marks and the route by which it appears to have come has puzzled us  farewell john fitzorton the word dispatch was written in the postscript by henry     the enclosure alluded to conveyed intelligence which required dispatch indeed it informed the lieutenant of a circumstance the very date of which shook his whole frame on the first glance and when he had hastily put it under a cover for the castle to go by the returning mail he enquired on the quay after the possible means of getting to the coast of france a vessel which had come in a few days before from st malos was to return by way of coutance when the wind would permit but it was not till after waiting ten days  ten fatal days  in the most anxious suspense that the vessel could get out of the harbor a favorable breeze however at length sprung up and they got to sea and the gale increasing they gained the long desired port  the moment after charles and his attendant had reached the land they desired one of the porters whom they saw on the beach to conduct them to the post office in the direction which corresponded with what was given in the letter and after a few minutes walking they came to the prioryhouse where they found the still blameless priest with his indian and old dennison sitting beside him my son said father arthur i expected you would follow our letter and i am glad at heart to find by your appearing amongst us it has been received i will not observed the agitated charles i come not to question your judgment or your wisdom  i come only to ask why you have withheld from me a circumstance or any previous knowledge on which the happiness of a sister and perhaps the life of my bosomfriend entirely depend but there is no time for words let me implore you by whatever is most holy to stop your rash proceedings  what you call rashness exclaimed arthur is in itself most holy and temerity would consist in the conduct you recommend i thought your sister had stated her duty yours and my own in the letter which you acknowledge to have received  she there told you under what authority i acted  i am sorry to find you dispute it  talk not to me of authorities sir demanded the lieutenant yielding to the impetuosity of his character and forgetting for a moment to whom he spoke  where is my sister  she is under protection replied arthur  i thought sir i was her only natural protector resumed charles under whom could she be more secure  under his whom she has sought returned the monk under that of her god slightly must you have perused what either she or i have written or else you would blush would tremble to ask that question  how could i hear of my sisters having clandestinely and by your connivance shut herself up within the walls of a cloister  from thence was her cruel letter dated i had not patience to read the dire particulars  at such a moment too  misguided girl when but for this abhorred seclusion we might all have been happy  i understand you not said arthur what moment and what happiness i assert young man that had you paid due respect to my greeting it would have made known to you the aweful calls upon me to accompany your sister from the place of her former refuge to one yet more sacred you would there have been taught to pay more respect to her motives of devoting herself and to mine in conducting her to the cloister but there she must remain i know my duty and will maintain it  the door of the house had been left unclosed on entrance of the lieutenant while the father with an expostulating determined and somewhat of a rebuking voice was pronouncing the last sentence another voice which was in an instant known to be that of henry fitzorton ejaculated  cloister  o holy man interposed a third voice which proceeded from the colonel those motives are respected  respected even by this my poor diseased distracted brother even though he is alas their sacrifice  cloister is she then already entombed reiterated henry who now fell into the arms of true george while dennison and floresco charles the colonel and the apothecary and father arthur hasted to his relief alas said the colonel from your anxiety charles to convey the tidings of carolines destiny to your friends at fitzorton you directed your packet to henry instead of john and all was abruptly discovered my poor brother was then struggling with the remnant of his disorder but persisted on taking an immediate journey and voyage to this place and in relief of his despair we have all followed alas his present situation too plainly proves our efforts have been vain  my dear master revives cried true george interrupting johns relation  she is lost then said henry even in the moment when miracles appeared to have been wrought to save us both his paroxysm now returned and at the instance of mr burton he was conducted by the attendants to dennisons own bed while the afflicted colonel proceeded to inform arthur that no entreaties could dissuade his brother henry from coming over that he was even frantic at opposition protesting that if he arrived too late his death near the wall where caroline had shut herself eternally from him would be his whole wish and if he was prosperous in his journey that prosperity would be his cure there was no reasoning with an insane who set his life at naught said the colonel i saw him desperate and to avoid something more immediately fatal i was engaged by our good apothecarys counsel in an act of desperation we hurried to the proper port where finding no vessel destined for france we hired a fishingboat and like despairing adventurers we trusted ourselves to a troubled sea under no one auspices of happy fortune but that the wind though turbulent was fair  and we are come safe  alas to what end  caroline is in her cell  it is indeed true answered the wondering arthur caroline has devoted herself and when she entered her convent i did not think sir that any possible event of this world would make me heave a sigh at what she has felt it right to do and although i grieve even from my utmost soul that my everrespected henry should be thus wrought upon  the whole mass of things i see and hear with respect to his happiness with caroline stuart  your countenance of that connection  the intemperate  i had almost said the indecent rage of the lieutenant are so strange new inconsistent and apparently impossible that a more extraordinary mystery than has ever yet involved us is now before my eyes  our letters must surely have informed you said john  i have received some from the castle interposed the monk and so has the devoted caroline but when her resolution was once formed i deemed it prudent not to intrude upon her any thing of a nature too interesting in regard to the world of which she desired to take an eternal leave so that for many of the past months we are both utterly ignorant of every occurrence which may have taken place either at the abbey or the castle  gracious heaven exclaimed john  then you know not perhaps that olivia    the lieutenant came into the room saying his friend was more composed and wished earnestly to confer with father arthur in his chamber but i cannot said charles suffer him to depart until i have thus in the humblest manner supplicated forgiveness for my late ungoverned rage that rage has chastised itself said the holy man stretching forth his hands to receive the folded ones of charles shall not a loving father forgive his child an offense which sorrow and affection caused they embraced and the lieutenant delivered the letters he had brought from the recess oh had i received these and read some former ones sooner observed arthur sighing something might have been avoided still all is mystery return to your suffering friend my child and tell him i will peruse my letters and attend him it were wicked to deceive and therefore touch not the theme that may lead him to delusion i crave your promise colonel somewhat longer to guide me through a labyrinth to whose mazes i have yet no clue i will but accompany the lieutenant into my brothers room and return said the colonel but the papers delivered soon dilated the train of incidents the mysteries were explained but the regrets were multiplied john fitzorton came back alas said arthur what combination has been formed against us or rather my friend how short is the foresight how frail the wisdom of mortals to pronounce what is most for their happiness i sigh sir mine eyes have wept at what i have already seen  my heart swells while i speak yet i know not how i may offend the alldisposer by thus lamenting his heavenly will  ah who shall dare to say that the seemingly agonizing turns of life the heaviest deprivations of death the early ascension of olivia to heaven and the eternal retirement of caroline from the world are not blessings at which we should rejoice and at which it is impious to repine  henry had desired true george and the lieutenant to lead him to arthur immediately on the colonels leaving the room so that he came into the parlour time enough to hear great part of what the holy father had said he attempted not to controvert the reasoning he disputed not the piety of the reflections but faint weak and despairing he implored arthur to save him if it were yet within his power  and if it be not exclaimed the unfortunate i have a thought which i hope without outrage to god or man i may indulge  it is my only alternative yet it shall be done father i am resolved  this was uttered betwixt wildness and collected solemnity but the effect was aweful hear me with fortitude and patience said arthur addressing himself to henry after a profound pause  all that i can i will there is but one being whom i would serve and obey with more willingness than henry fitzorton the meek and pious caroline stuart for the reasons she has assigned has withdrawn herself from the world she has nearly performed her novitiate her year of probation expires on the morrow the morrow exclaimed henry  even so my child  we are in the eve of everlasting seclusion said arthur o god cried henry  she has already signified her solemn intention to take the veil and is upon the point of pronouncing her vows henry could scarcely be held from sinking to the ground though dennison and floresco were assisting true george to support him for the lieutenant was hardly able to sustain himself and john was unusually disturbed this night however at the twelfth hour i am to meet her in the confessional after midnight prayers i have here a copy of her profession of faith indulge not these false hopes should she stand solemnly fixed to her purpose i will not dare not interrupt it henry chilled with horror but there are yet some hours betwixt the preparation and the act said the monk the choice of becoming a recluse or of returning to the world is still left her and although it is unusually late to place even in the view of a devotee any temporal scenes or objects that may lead her back to sublunary feelings  and still more uncommon for her confessor to bring them under her eyes i still hold it innocent to let her know that great and extraordinary events have taken place at fitzorton castle  nay i will offer her the perusal of her benefactor the colonels letter and then leave her spirit free to act upon the whole of the circumstances it is a case of affliction and of love my children apart from all others i have known and i will show it peculiar indulgence but i must inhibit all effusions of passion and expect you will all remain unobserved and undiscovered in this house which i have borrowed of my ancient friend the abbot of the priory yet remember caroline stuart has for twelve hardtried months conformed to an order not lenient though not rigorous she is preparing to embrace yet more austerities she is even now to be looked upon as a being nearly out of the pale of terrestrial things i must not have her sensibility seduced one strong and deciding question shall be put to her even in this the most holy and aweful moment of her life if she answers in favor of the world she shall receive no discountenance if she has so settled her steadfast soul that all earthly objects  even those once most precious  have receded from her  and such instances are not rare  even in the reign of beauty and of youth i have seen them fade away and become extinguished  should that be the case with the devoted caroline not one persuasive word shall be used by me to overruled her election i can no more my love my gratitude and my compassion will have done their utmost  hark exclaimed arthur that is the clock of her convent it is only a few paces distant from this house a door of the priory opens on it listen it is the twelfth hour  i must obey its summons caroline is exact  the sounds entered the soul of every hearer  and the pious man after assuring his friends he would return to them with a faithful report and exhorting them to believe that whatever direction it might take would be ultimately the best he commended their spirits to the angel of peace and passing from the abbots house into the priory entered the convent of visitation where caroline was enclosed  chapter lvii the terrors of suspense have been justly numbered amongst the least supportable of the miseries of life never could they have been felt more acutely than they were by the sorrowful society which now filled the house which arthur had borrowed of his episcopal friend nor could any member of that society offer substantial consolation to the other the aged dennison knew that caroline had she not been his attendant nay his nurse during a sickness which he himself had suffered would have secluded herself some weeks sooner florescos honest nature could only lead him in this instance to silent prayer  for he had listened to his masters words which sunk into his heart as the words of him whose law they expounded the apothecary and john fitzorton were too well acquainted with the constancy of caroline stuart to ground a reasonable hope or indeed almost to suffer any hope that her confessor would represent the change of affairs with such moving circumstances as to warrant any change in his devotee the lieutenant was silent and abashed from a sense of his own former irreverent behavior  and henry who had long since believed no incident of the future could exceed or even equal the past in that sickness of conjecture and of dread which uncertainty occasions now found that the interval betwixt the departure and the return of the confessor from the convent of the confessed was the most tremendous point of time in his life the solemn pause was variously filled up by the expectants the colonel retired to a remote corner of the room covered his eyes with his hands and except now and then starting up to press the hand of his brother remained fixed in thought dennison and floresco somewhat relieved themselves by assisting the servant of the house to prepare refreshments henry walked backwards and forwards or sat abruptly down  now uplifted and now wrung his hands  but when the table was covered and he had taken a chair near it to rest upon one of his arms he heard a feeble sound yet rather of joy than sadness come from under the table and in the next instant he felt the tongue of the animal from whom the sound had issued licking his hand is it possible exclaimed henry starting up that i should again embrace thee little fitz art thou still alive  o welcome welcome be it a good omen  yes hims is alive poor ickle ting said floresco  him only come from misseys convent the other day  see  good sir squire that is hims ickle bed  all satin and cotton and wool as soft as hims own ickle old head  do but feel hims and lookee sir squire hims bed is made by hims ladys  own lady  and hims was brought here in it by master our good good father arthur under hims cloak  as floresco brought forward a light to inspect the spaniels bed henry knew it to be the same which he had seen in early days  a device of the dove and the olive emblems of love and peace and the initial letters h and c twined and yet cautiously involved in wellwrought laurel leaves had at once noted and concealed their true hearts mystery henry held the candle close to examine  alas they are almost worn out see brother  see my good old dennison the initials are divided  the h is faintly shadowed look it hangs only by a few trembling threads  even like the hope  the life  of him whom it represents  and the once enwreathed c is gone for ever behold not a trace remains and why poor fitz were thou brought hither surely thou would have been a solace  even a dear companion of thy cloystered mistress  alas for that very reason said dennison was he resigned he too much reminded her of the world  she had made it her duty to forget and she knew he would here both live and die in peace henry was too much affected by the motive of sending the dog out of the convent to attend to any thing more on that subject but another drew all his attention dennison had disappeared at the end of his last speech but returned in a few minutes bringing under his arm a small box on which were written the words  things precious this my good and dear masters contains what i would it were possible to return to her who has deposited them but should the great and good director of all determine otherwise they are to be disposed of according to my lady carolines written requests within henry eagerly yet fearfully opened the lid  and as well as agitation too big for words would permit he inspected the contents some of which  for all were separate and appropriated  were directed to her brother amongst these were the miniature gifts of her mother mentioned in a former part of this history and some other relics of her family some were addressed to mrs herbert some to johanna  some to olivia others to arthur to be disposed of for the use of her pensioners a small packet to each of the apothecarys family her watch to jane atwood  to john fitzorton an emblematical design of her own painting representing the angel of forgiveness receiving from the angel of penitence a scroll on which the words  pardon and friendship were curiously tinted and underneath the illustration of two figures with hands joined representing their two fathers at the bottom of the box was found a packet superscribed  henrys he had begun to fear that amongst these solemn arrangements he should find no memorial for himself and though it is but a melancholy evidence of good will to receive on such occasions the heart feels an aggravation of its woe to be left without its tribute he opened it in haste and perceived very striking resemblances of olivia and both his children cut out with scissars from a remembrance and a strong impression of their features  a few lines were written in the envelope which covered this little gift  may the best of men live long to bless the best of women and of wives the loveliest of children  the noblest of brothers  such shall unceasingly be the prayer of the heavendevoted caroline stuart but i fear i have done what i ought not said dennison  these were not to be forwarded to any of the parties concerned till after tomorrow  tomorrow cried henry  when my lady caroline had passed her vow resumed dennison  then too i was to have sent to my dear master the lieutenant his sisters last will and testament wherein she has done all things worthy of her and though she has appointed her brother to see her general loving kindness fulfilled she has named squire henry and madam olivia to distribute her bounty to her pensioners and as i cannot expect indeed as i do not wish said the veteran to live long in the world after she has bid it farewell if that should be gods good pleasure i mean that my little modicums should go in the same channel please your honors  yet i wish i had not mentioned these things now as i see it has distressed us though i thought while his reverence was gone to know our fate it might make us less sorrowful to observe how my lady whom we all know and love has ordered every thing for her friends in the world even as if her convent was her coffin and to be sure it is pretty much the same sort of matter it is certain dennison could not have related a more unlikely set of occurrences to exhilarate the spirits of his drooping friends as indeed the tremblings which seized his own aged limbs and the tears which fell from his old eyes might testify yet he meant it all in love there is not a doubt remaining said henry all is over  these are proofs and if they be we must learn to resign answered john fitzorton we must not be unworthy the example of a tender solitary selfsustaining young woman  arouse my brother let us again examine and with the minds of men and of christians the arguments of her whom we thus mourn after and arraign her own explanations of herself have not even yet been duly attended to we received them in the hour of confusion and read them in that of terror and despair the colonel conceiving the perusal of carolines letter might now produce a good effect on them all read it aloud holding his dejected brother by the hand it was addressed to   charles stuart esquire guise abbey ah dearest and sole remaining hope of an illfated yet retrievable house read with a patient mind these sacred pages now submitted to thy discretion and virtue our father  i trust in the merciful  happy in heaven  reunited to our longsainted mother  our friends honorably blessed on earth  my brother not destitute and with the prospect of being united to virtue and love like his own reunited also in sacred friendship with the elected companion of his youthful days and with the patron of his fortunes  the highly valued henry and john fitzorton and the noble olivia whom they conspire to bless and honor there seems but one path open to caroline and that she has ventured to take i have even to the good and holy arthur only signified my intentions and called on him to give me not advice but assistance that assistance which to have refused would have rendered him unworthy any longer to be my spiritual guide and have compelled me to seek another my designs were formed in silent thought and eloquence or remonstrance would have alike been vain had he attempted to use them as weapons against my resolves i hope ere you receive this i shall have provided for every claim and duty that remains to me in society perhaps more substantially than if i had continued to live in its bosom for i shall confide in the agency of those who have more strength more wisdom and firmer health than myself  alas i am in many things weak  strong only in the love i bear my friends and therefore resolved to avoid acting toward them as if i were an enemy  according to the ceremonies of our faith i have entered these walls  and finding many reasons to be satisfied with my election and not one to counterpoise it  my purpose is to cover myself meekly with the eternal veil before the time of your receiving these informations it is the only point on which i can separate myself from a tenderlyloved brothers claims the sole principle of action in which i feel myself without responsibility to any human power  the withdrawing myself from the asylum which the purest benevolence so long afforded me every circumstance attaching to which i loved could only be excused by the fear that my own weak state yet strong feeling of gratitude might dispossess me of the power to resist arguments of kindness and by that resistance seem to adhere obstinately to my own purpose or by yielding become even of my gratitude the sacrifice express this i pray you with more force and with all the sensibility i feel on that subject to all our noble benefactors  my brother and my friend  farewell caroline stuart for the reasons assigned above sanctioned by father arthur   this letter was regarded by every one as a sort of funeral oration drawn up immediately before the decease of the orator and there was but one sentiment about it  viz that caroline stuart was irrevocably devoted  chapter lviii meantime the good father arthur joined fervently in the midnight prayers of the convent fitting his soul for every pious work he supplicated for that power of impartial judgment and of equal ministration that while it removes the mists of sense and elevates the spirit beyond the seduction of mortal things extinguishes not the principle of humanity which even in the bosom of holiness reminds us we are men and after remaining in the chapel till the nuns and sisters were gone each to her humble chamber he repaired to the confessional  caroline was already there kneeling before figures of the virgin and of her immortal son her countenance was marked by awe mingled with serenity she appeared to have subdued those heavy conflicts of the soul which usually precede the solemn act of renouncing the world while we are conscious there remains in it many objects precious to the human affections even her health appeared to have regained some force from the strength of her mind which had been for so long a time cultivating habits and imitating examples of acquiescence and tranquillity  the sacred images of the great prototype of all meekness and the purest patron of all resignation  the man of sorrows and acquainted with grief  were perpetually placed in her view she saw in every compartment of the convent his hallowed figure exhibiting at once mildness and resolution the spear goring his side the thorns platted round his brow and the nails piercing his feet by this example of perfect obedience she had been modelling her own  and even as the holy father entered she was reciting aloud while her eye fixed on the shadowed form of him whose unspotted hands though fastened to the cross had been incessantly stretched out to dispense blessings and whose assiduous feet though rivetted to the tree always went about doing good  come then my soul devote thyself to that dying savior cover thyself under the wings of his redeeming love take sanctuary under that tree of life and fly for safety to that city of refuge opened in his wounds  employ the wakeful night even as he employed it in ardent prayer for the happiness of all the good and pradon of all who have selt their error o arm me with thy fortitude as with thy benevolence that when the sun shall be arrested in his career the solid structure of the earth dashed to pieces and the heavens themselves be rent asunder  the fates of all mankind hanging on the very point of an irreversible decision i may behold the convulsions of expiring nature with composure and rejoicing with myriads more  and ah may all whom i have ever loved or pitied be amongst these  welcome the consummation of all things  she rose to receive arthur when she had closed her meditation my dear my virtuous my ever everbeloved child said the sacred man  the great and decisive moment of your existence is at hand i will not ask if you are fitted to meet it for your life has been one of voluntary discipline and earnest preparation i hope it has and i look forward to the ceremony which is this morning to take place with a complacence that augments as that hour comes nearer the father began to confess her and finding in all her responses and avowals as to the ordinary questions he began to fulfill the promise he had made to the friends he had left at the priory all this is well observed arthur but tell me daughter if the motives laudable as they were which led thee to the refuge of these sheltering walls were removed  ought my sacred friend interrupted caroline to propose a question which revives such themes at such a moment father my motives remain and the resolves formed upon them are even like them immovable  but if proceeded arthur they were all removed by him to whom the steadfast mountain is as the bending shrub that trembles at its base  if that power by whom the fabric of the universe changes its place or dissolves to the touch  if he should have prepared for my daughter that peace in the world which she has sought in leaving it   the confessor paused but the confessed was silent  if resumed the former one of those beings in guard of whose felicity thou art become a sister of this sanctuary should long since have ascended to heaven yet used the latest moments of her happy life   olivia dead ejaculated caroline  to express continued arthur that circumstances would allow her children to find a second mother in her friend   o they will find her in many friends cried caroline  and that friend was described to be caroline stuart observed the father  how then would she determine  according to the principles of her own unshaken faith which never would interrupt those of the protestant father of protestant children i bow weepingly to the providence that has disposed of olivia fitzorton but my motives good father extended to the religion of all her survivors spare then unnecessary discussion and suffer me to employ the few intermediate hours in regaining that serenity you have disturbed that i may render my vows with unmixed satisfaction  be it so my child retire to thy place of repose and of meditation there examine the great and momentous truths which these papers will convey  there commune with thine own heart  and if on the evidence of those truths it no longer appears a measure of wisdom or of piety to circumscribe thy powers of conferring happiness and of doing good to the narrow bounds of this holy place thou will order its gates to unclose and either meet me at the priory house where i will abide thy coming or send to me the summons to attend the ceremony of thy eternal vows  the blameless father led her out of the confessional into the convent and feeling that he had no power of assisting her choice he blessed her and departed  chapter lix when father arthur returned to his friends he found that none of them had retired to rest nor even sat down to any refreshment but that every one was wound up by expectation and solicitude to the highest pitch of those corroding powers he saluted them with his wonted benignity but alas he was invested with no authority to put an end to their suspense he offered however in relief of it a faithful detail of what had past in the confessional with firmness he gave the feelings of the recluse and concluded by observing that he had left in her hands not only the letter which had been brought by the lieutenant from the colonel but all the other pacquets which had been collecting whether kept back by discretion or retarded by accident in short said the pious father i have delivered to her contemplation all that it was proper for her to know and concealed only what might have unduly influenced her election as he finished his account there was still left sufficient to torture and to appease conjecture solemn silence invaded only by the sighs of henry prevailed throughout the assembly arthur threw a beam of sunshine over the prospect by observing that though in no degree receding from her point she gave her utmost attention to all he had to report and that while she preserved unwarped the sobriety of her mind she displayed and made no attempt to repel the sensibility of her heart and in that just poise of faculty and feeling  the most to be desired when an aweful decision is to be made  he said he left her  for the first time since his entrance into the abbots house henry smiled as if he caught a passing ray from that far distant yet cheering hope the good father ventured to clear the prospect yet more the generous dennison whispered henry that his honor should consider that first love was not soon forgotten the kind floresco almost imperceptibly approaching the only disengaged ear of henry dennison remaining at the other  humbly remarked that the good god had taken away poor ickle negromans dear heart  dear loraida and yet good father arthur had made him tink god is good god still so ickle negroman only tries to make hims soul like white christian mans soul that him may see hims only love in happy place  the lieutenant held one of the hands of his friend and often pressed it to his bosom the colonel took the other from time to time whispering  let what will be the issue remember me thus partly by remonstrance and partly by hope though each was slight yet as the spark if nursed cautiously and supplied will afford some warmth and some light even if it baffles all care in the end henry suffered himself awhile to be comforted insomuch that arthur persuaded him to set his friends a social example by sitting down to the humble repast  the morning hours however chased one another away without producing any sort o reply from the devotee the day had already dawned every vigilant eye and watchful ear of arthurs party remained unclosed even the good father himself whose attempered spirit had been long armed against the power of the general invaders of our brief lifes tranquillity was too sincerely interested in the event of carolines decision to court that repose or indeed to partake of that refreshment which health and virtue rarely denied him and although he had blessed the board and he regarded as his children all that were assembled the viands were served but untasted  in the meantime the fair devout was employed in contemplations of the highest import when she had reached her cell  and never did vestal enter with a purer spirit and somewhat resumed herself she sat down by her lamp not discomposed nor yet disordered she opened the papers which arthur had left with her not with an unsteady hand yet not without something of tremor pressing her cross and bending to her crucifix she rose hastily and kneeling down sought support from him who alone can give it she returned to her seat and unfolding all the letters without hesitation took up one at hazard it happened to be that which john had entrusted to the conveyance of her brother a perusal of which indeed rendered the rest iterative and superfluous as we trust that it has not left the readers memory we shall only note that after having read it thrice she sat ruminating on the varied wonders it contained  she resumed once more the same letter and although generally impressive one passage was particularly dwelt upon and when she had paid it more attention than the rest though in truth the point which so much engaged her consisted but of a single word she imagined her lamp grew unusually dim but after trimming it she perceived the obstruction of light came from her own eyes for one of their tears had fallen upon that very word almost instantly on her discovery of this she folded up the letter with a resolved hand and although she acknowledged in the superscription of the others the wellknown characters of her longlost companions mrs herbert and johanna and one from charles her muchloved brother she wrapped them in the general cover under which she had received them and left her cell  the indecisive anxieties had so accumulated in the minds of the society at the priory as the broad day came on that each individual examined the almost hopeless countenance of the others for relief and found it not the eighth hour was sounded from the convent and that it had been understood was the time appointed for the ceremony henry rushed out as he saw some lay sisters passing from one of the streets with small baskets in their hands hurrying toward them as they were ringing at the outer gate of the convent he observed that the baskets were filled with the flowers of the season to strew the floor of the vestal as she passed to the altar  he seized one of the baskets and grasping what it contained in silent but profound despair threw them again into the basket which he returned to the astonished sister   they are to cover then eternally the corpse of caroline exclaimed he the trembling sister took refuge within the halfopened gate which was closed again in a moment  smiting his breast the forlorn henry turned again toward the door of the house and perceived himself surrounded by his sympathizing friends but the majestic arthur exhorted him to respect the decrees of the omnipotent whatever they might suggest to the person he bewailed observing that if his passion was virtuous it would not shrink from the trials of virtue and if the happiness of caroline was precious he would be content to let her pursue it according to the dictate of her own conscience brother remember me reiterated john henry returned into the abbots house and endeavored to compose himself  strode along the apartment  took up the poor spaniel which had attempted in vain to follow his masters irregular movements  and then henry sighing over him placed him on his lap  seeing dennison weep he dried his tears  assured him he was perfectly reconciled  and sat himself down and sobbed with grief a number of persons passing by the window soon caught his attention throwing open the window he perceived them dressed as for the solemnity  and moving toward the convent  again henry rushed forth he questioned one of the assembly  they were friends or kindred of the sisters or nuns who have permission to see the ceremony of a novitiate who is to take the vows  and were fearful of being too late some of the visitors had gained admittance while the person interrogated was speaking others were hurrying in henry ran forward to the gate of the convent while it was yet receiving the invited guests the notes of the organ mingling with the chant of some priests who were just arrived in the cloisters of the convent struck like thunder on the ear of henry  he attempted to precipitate himself within the portals but they had received all who were to pass  and were shut a second time against him he struggled to the bell and rung it  in vain the moment was passed  his surrounding friends and the gathering multitude saved him from dashing himself with desperate rage against the massy nails that projected from the convent gate  hark hark said he  the bell tolls it is the funeral of the barbarous caroline stuart  while his friends who had all followed were conveying him from the astonished crowd the gate of the convent was again opened by the porteress and a monk issuing forth desired to be conducted to father arthur but soon perceiving him he advanced toward him exclaiming with a loud voice  father your presence is immediately demanded in the convent of the visitation not a moment may be lost arthur instantly accompanied the monk and the despairing henry who indistinctly heard the summons was too much overcome even to struggle any longer and was carried as if stiffened by death into the abbots house  chapter lx no sooner had father arthur gained the interior of the convent than he found the sisters the nuns the chief priest and st seraphina the superior standing confused and in disorder in the chapel every thing was in preparation for the ceremony the floor strewed the carpet on which according to custom the newlyconsecrated nun was to fall the neck and headdress to change from the novitiate white veil to the black appointed to be worn by the nuns of the order were ready the belt and beads were placed on the altar one of the sisters was tolling the bell to give warning to the votary that the holy association were waiting to hear and to record her vows as soon as arthur made his appearance the principal abbess came forward to inform him that his presence was necessary to enforce the obedience of the novice whom he had recommended to her convent asserting that she had come forward with objections when it was too late to admit them and that she had resisted every holy authority and repelled every sacred exhortation with a pride and confidence utterly inconsistent with a vestal and with the meek and unobtrusive demeanor she had observed during her whole novitiate she has refused even to make her appearance said the abbess as arthur was about to reply caroline herself entered the chapel and bending with unaffected reverence to the altar and with due regard to the sanctity of the place declared that she felt the most undissembled sorrow that the conduct of one she had so long reverenced and whom still she loved and honored had rendered it necessary she said to obtrude herself at such a moment and in such a presence on the judgment of the assembly after this exordium she informed arthur that having perused some of the papers he had left for her meditation she had repaired even so early as the fourth hour to the chamber of saint seraphina whom she found still at her devotions that she had stated with candor the unexpected motives which made it necessary to close the terms of her conventual life with the moment that closed her novitiate  even the moment in which she was making the declaration  and at the same time informed the superior that although many of the circumstances which formed these motives being wholly of a domestic and private nature were too delicate for discussion she referred her to father arthur for her justification in demanding the privilege of withholding her vows and of quitting the sisterhood under his holy protection humbly expressing a hope that she might leave her embrace and blessing with every respected individual of the community the preparations were however suffered to proceed the right of election was disputed and the good and beneficent st seraphina who had been to me said caroline till that moment as a friend and a parent taxed me with caprice irreverence and impiety  it was but her grief said arthur benignly her grief to part from you my daughter she felt that she found in your society the endearment of a child and to be suddenly bereaved of it even in the hour that she had told her heart you would remain with her for the rest of your life gave to her zeal prompted by her affection an earnestness for which your love and respect must allow  but sister seraphina can require only a moments recollection of herself to know that forced vows are unacceptable to the power to whom they are offered  that faith constrained encourages hypocrisy and that every act that chains the mind is impious our sister is not to learn besides that freedom of choice during the year of experiment and probation gives to every votary the power of returning to society or of remaining secluded and it has often happened as in the case before us that a change of circumstances warrants a change of conduct all the virtues it is true are like god himself who is their fountain invariable and eternal but the same principles which at one time conduct a novice to the cloister may lead her again into the world i am here to vouch my sister that many such circumstances have arisen to determine our virtuous daughter to leave this holy mansion but in leaving it she departs not from the blessed power to whom it is dedicated sister seraphina is not amongst those misguided zealots of our persuasion or of any other who believe that the omnipresent deity can be served only within the pale of their own convents or in that of the catholic or protestant church happier if every worshipper has access to his proper temple but true religion my sister knows like the sublime spirit that inspires it is not to be circumscribed the veritable god is to be found and a temple may be raised to him in every part of his universe let us not narrow his sacred presence even to that bound since passing the limit of our contracted globe insufficient alas to fill even our finite idea of the unmeasured authority and government of his power his benevolence and his wisdom he spreads himself over other worlds as incalculable in number as impartial in the diffusion of his holy spirit and doubtless in every part of these regions the votary may with equal sincerity and with equal certainty of being heard erect his altar and offer up his prayer  this our daughter added arthur after a short pause i pledge myself can always be happy in th assurance that she is every where in the guard and under the sacred eye of her creator she has raised to his glory a shrine in her heart and were she shut out from every other sanctuary and bereft of the sight of all those holy emblems figures and ceremonies which we humbly trust are symbols as innocent as we find them impressive  although god forbid we should impose them as fetters on our brethren who have rejected them  were i say the good daughter who is separating herself from this community to be separated for ever from the view also of these  be assured o sister in the faith she would still be conscious of being in the presence of the majesty of heaven even as she is at this moment and her adoration would be every where the same  the surrounding assembly were much awed and such as were too bigoted or prejudiced to yield to the matter were affected by the manner of his harangue the abbess for some moments remained silent then going up to caroline took her by the hand and led her to the venerable franciscan brother said she in resigning this child to your disposal i give up one of the purest treasures of my heart a treasure which if i have attempted to preserve it is because i could not but deem it too precious to be exposed again to the perils of the world happily my selflove may have alas mixed with this motive for she has taught me to feel that a mothers tenderness may fill the heart of the patroness of a cloister  even as these human and i hope forgiven tears have filled her eyes  touched to the recesses of her gentle bosom caroline folded her arms in the robes of st seraphina as she bent her knee even to the ground and then moving to the altar on which were laid the several emblems of vestal consecration she prostrated herself before the crucifix and taking up the pall which was symbolically to have been thrown over her while she was renouncing the world o till an eternal veil like this exclaimed she shall cover my frame every holy precept i owe to this pious community shall form the practice of my life  and these thou honored preceptor  and ye my beloved sisterhood shall be joined in every prayer and mingle in every hope of our everlasting reunion such are my substituted vows  accept them thou who have called me hence in place of those which my soul was prepared to offer the abbess raised and embraced her the nuns received her from the superior the prayers appointed for her eternal seclusion were now converted into spontaneous and fervent aspirations for her happiness in the world every knee was bent every head was bowed at length the abbess again made a solemn surrender of her charge to father arthur and caroline stuart quitted the convent followed even to the outer gate by the whole sisterhood some of whom had gathered up the flowers which had been spread over the carpet to strew them in the path that again led her into the world but when she had passed the gate and saw it closing on the attendant train who for twelve long months had been unto her indeed as sisters and to whom she had been a pure example of resignation and piety she cast on them a parting look which the pure affections of virtuous minds can alone give or receive  chapter lxi arthur had deemed it one of the fair and necessary reserves he had conditioned for to conceal from caroline every circumstance which might bias her decision or practice on her heart consequently she had as yet no idea that either her brother or any of her friends were so near at hand and conscious as he was of the afflicting but inevitable state in which he had left those he was anxious to prevent any abrupt discovery of the important issue of his return to the convent she was still in her novitiate dress but as arthur led her by the priory door he had opportunity to convey his charge into an interior apartment of which he always kept the keys beyond which was a small bookroom sacred to his own contemplations and thither he now resorted with caroline  seating himself beside her and in the most affectionate manner addressing her he briefly but cautiously acquainted her with the several things he had judged it proper to conceal and when he had carried his conversation through the several circumstances that related to her brothers journey and voyage of fraternal affection and the nature and import of his embassy from the castle of the pious death of olivia and her last message of love mingled with wishes respecting the disposal of her husband and children he was proceeding to bring down the intelligence nearer to the moment before them when caroline interposing observed that she found all he had been relating mentioned at length and with many additional circumstances in the pacquets with which he had presented her confessing to him that on the strong opposition of the superior and the urgence of several of the sisters that she should suffer the solemnities of the day to proceed arguing amidst sighs and tears that it was an offense to heaven to stop them she had gone back to her cell and in the profoundest solitude not only read the letter which had before thrice passed her eye and which till then seemed allcommanding as to the steps she ought to take but that she perused and reperused every other paper to the intent seriously and sacredly of confessing the error of her decision and blending such confession in her vows or of being farther convinced her determination to withhold those vows was sanctioned by every duty upon earth but said caroline  strengthened by all i read by all i thought in the belief that i had decided justly i hope it deserves a fairer name than the selfwilled tenacity which had been imputed to me  if my resolve then took a form of resistance which would not have given way to either argument or supplication i was returning to the sisterhood to repeat my intentions with renovated force when i saw with the comfort which always attends me in his presence the friend and guide of my life you know the rest  then you are sufficiently prepared to hear that the lieutenant though he did not give you those letters was the bearer of them that he traced us from our recess in the happy isle to our sanctuary here and that finally he is in this very house attended by your humble but ever faithful friend true george  although the reader has reason to know that yet with the name of true george associated another name so very powerful at this singular moment that she could not help asking whether she had distinctly heard what he said as to her brothers fellowtraveller yes true george came over with him replied arthur and some others  others said caroline yes our protector the colonel soon followed him  john fitzorton exclaimed caroline dwelling emphatically on the word  john how generous how good how like himself i hope said she hesitating he left all his friends all his family well  as well alas as they can be rightly suggesting that a managed discovery of the grand decision might be no less necessary to henry than to caroline the monk hastened to the room where the castle party had been assembled he encountered floresco in his way up stairs masser abed exclaimed the youth fearfully the monk ascended and saw his friends surrounding a bed on which they had laid the despairing henry who had manifested symptoms which made them for some time apprehend the loss of his senses but he soon became more composed and was speaking coherently when arthur entered  fear not my friends said he i perceive a path yet left to save me  one which none of you can blame he lay some time revolving this new image in his mind or rather recurring to a preconceived design now to be matured his tranquillity returned in proportion as he made progress in his purposed plan at length with resolution he rose from the bed and walked backwards and forwards in the room from time to time assuring his friends he was regaining his peace i am settling my mind said he with disordered accents he alternately took the hands of his brother and his friend charles as he passed to and fro his countenance became more and more serene yet tears fell from his eyes and he sighed as he lay down again on the bed but at length recognizing arthur he again rose impetuously it is unnecessary to make any report of the event exclaimed he  i will spare you the particulars caroline stuart has devoted herself  yes your delay  your silence  all which i have seen  heard  felt  pronounce my doom attend therefore to my solemn determinations nay interrupt me not  speak not i implore you till i have done i shall want your assistance but it is nothing in which your pure spirit may not engage and it is the only point that remains to restore my happiness  to reconcile my soul  hear then  i conjure you to hear me  i will answered the worthy priest with energy as if anticipating henrys ideas but perhaps it should be heard with less hazard of interruption  the party would have left the room  no cried the monk your presence may be requisite but as we shall be less disturbed in one of the lower apartments i would advise if my son feels himself strong enough  strong enough for every thing answered henry wildly  behold i can walk unsupported this way then my son and the rest of our friends will follow they now descended into the gothic apartment fronting the street where they had before assembled  i have a presentiment of what revolves in your mind my son continued the friar and will return in a few moments prepared to give you audience while arthur absented himself henrys whole soul seemed to be employed  the franciscan meanwhile returned to caroline and found her again perusing the pacquets and some of that color which paints the human affections but which an habitual repression of those affections and a life severe to itself expels gradually even from the heart had returned into her cheek  arthur judged this to be the moment in which more animating tidings might be safely communicated  he extended the pleasing news by informing her that he could now promise her an interview with her brother and the humble george as well as with her friend john fitzorton whenever she was prepared to admit them what preparation can be necessary my good father i entreat of you to let me this moment attend them  i have observed in you an apparent wish to procrastinate that alarms me  you replied not to my former apprehension as to the health of others of our friends neither have i been quite candid wherefore should i deal my good father with you reservedly  the motives cogent and manifold which have drawn me from the cloister ought to be and are sufficient to justify all the movements of my heart  wherefore then have i so long forborne a more direct enquiry after henry fitzorton i entreat of you to satisfy my solicitude about his health  but perhaps you wish the tidings to come to me from his brother or from the colonel i wish it my dearest child to come in a manner the most acceptable and to that end only have i procrastinated henry fitzorton accompanied the colonel he too is in the abbots house  his health perhaps his reason and his life depend upon his happiness  his happiness is i trust not remote he is very near us i will place you where you shall hear what i have told you confirmed but whatever you may observe i call on that obedience which has invariably distinguished the conduct of my dearest daughter to retain her station unheard unseen till i give the signal and that signal i pledge myself shall not be delayed beyond the moment even of her own attested satisfaction the father reconducted her from the little bookroom to the apartment which joined it and which was divided from the front parlour where henry and his friends were assembled only by a slight partition from whence there was a door of communication and the half of that door was of glass shaded to the extent of the glazing by a curtain that run upon rings be this your point of unobserved observation whispered the monk to the agitated caroline as he drew a chair immediately beside the curtain he then went back into the parlour  henry had been working up his several faculties to the bent of his resolve and he imagined them to be all in so firm a state that advancing to arthur on his entrance he declared aloud his steadfast purpose now then friend and holy father i call upon you in your professional office for that aid which it would be derogatory to your character to refuse me in the first place i bequeath the education of my dear children to those i love best in the world  save one who has this cruel morn precipitated herself out of that world  my duty to their angel mother at whatever price has been fulfilled  my bosom friend has by a new election regained the path of happiness  my dear brothers i feel assured will remain to sustain the honor of my family to comfort our poor and become joint guardians of my little ones  i resolve then to follow the example of caroline stuart so far as to dedicate the rest of my days to monastic sequestration and as the faith i have adopted takes no change from the color of my deep disappointments but will i trust in time enable me to support and survive them  to surmount them is beyond my hope beyond even my wish  i determine to join myself to the fraternity of which you my reverend father are a member even to the holy brotherhood of st francis i am not to learn that a neighboring monastery even in coutance is sacred to that thriceblessed saint and it will soothe me to be near my caroline although the eternal walls even when heaven itself which had set us free shall then again throw over us inextricable chains seek not o my brother and my friends to oppose me in this immovable resolve  place not as obstacles before its execution the dear dear objects of my paternal love  objects which are even new incentives to prosecute my design  were i destitute of john and james fitzorton i might struggle still in the weary pilgrimage of the world but to them i can confide my treasures and alas i feel that neither by precept nor example could their illfated parent any longer assist their youth and the affection of their uncles shall soon obliviate all memory of their unhappy father  perceiving the colonel had been throwing over the whole of this proposition the most formidable frown and that he was coming forward with arguments which would destroy his project brother continued the conscious henry i see that you disapprove my plan and that other of my friends deplore it but in this one point behold me inexorable receive then as solemn pledges of my considence in you the son and daughter of a man resolved to quit the world  you cannot dare not refuse me guard for them my fortunes everlastingly shall they and their protectors and all present and all absent who have a claim on my heart be included in my prayers an audible and exclamatory sigh broke from the opposite room such of the company as heard it looked somewhat startled on each other henry had paused and risen from his seat as if uncertain of the found but not again hearing it he addressed himself more immediately to arthur and now father said he having witnessed my immovable resolution to devote the rest of my days to a seclusion not less absolute than that of caroline stuart who alone could have made the world delightful to me  now that she for whom so many years of my life have been past in faithful sorrow  now that she has removed herself for ever  i call upon you to grant sanctuary to a breaking heart  to afford it a place of refuge voluntary has been the profession of my faith voluntary shall be the offering of myself up to the church which cherishes it o haste me father that i may be received into its bosom and confirm even now before this assembly of my friends my holy election  i consent replied arthur who had in vain attempted to speak i consent that henry fitzorton in consideration of his sufferings and his constancy for caroline stuart and of his many and hard trials in the years of his youth even unto this day shall follow her example  the company were amazed john was risen to protest against the measure  i consent reiterated the franciscan and will give my assistance to the rendering his resolve not less absolute than hers and in despite of all opposition i here pledge myself even before the altar which in the adjoining chapel of the priory has often received my bending knee and before the sacred figures that surround the shrine and every other witness who is here present or within hearing of my voice  yes by all these i pledge myself to hear and to record the vows of henry even as i have heard and recorded those of caroline  it may not be asserted john my brother has duties in the world  the duties of a father which during that fathers life no substitute can    those duties shall not suffer by the vows i am determined to sanction rejoined the monk proceed we to the altar this key will open the door which leads to the chapel i protest against the deed answered john i will not pronounce on the conduct of caroline but in my brother a similar act would be impious  and i too wholly disapprove it in my sister exclaimed the lieutenant are the children of olivia to be thus neglected  are they to be basely deserted by their father cried john in aweful whispers  o sainted spirit of the tenderest mother are thy little ones to become orphans  henry stood irresolute  dennison and floresco wept and prayed  the apothecary began to plead  true george had been in balance whether he should pursue the longtrodden steps of his beloved master or retrace the paths that led to his plighted mistress  meantime the key had done its office  and the monk firm in his purpose had caught one of henrys hands john forcibly seized the other and began to drag it in an opposite direction  and is the farfamed father arthur like the meanest bigot of his tribe a man who trades in conversion  an imposer of his faith on the misguided  i am now justified in believing my brother has been proselyted in another point    son answered the monk when a proof of your charge appears i will acknowledge its force till then no earthly power  not yours  whom most on earth i venerate  shall impede my progress  father aid me to pour forth my unshaken intents before the shrine you speak of as a solemn earnest of my future consecration and i shall then feel myself beyond the reach of this unfair control i am resolved  john with strong indignation flung back his brothers hand and arthur threw open the folding doors from which caroline stuart in the almost insupportable agitation of her feelings and of her frame had however receded the whole company followed the monk and henry into the apartment trembling at every step john came after them with movements that marked his deeplydisturbed mind  the chapel is at the end of these small apartments said arthur he led henry along still followed by the rest they at length entered the chapel of the priory the altar was placed between two broad columns on each of which were painted at full length two sacred figures the one of the blessed virgin the other of the redeemer of the world henry fell on his knees the instant he came within view of the shrine arthur looked around with surprise but as he was preparing to speak a part of carolines sacred vestment relieved him and approaching the altar and kneeling also he exclaimed now may the vows of my pious son be no less acceptable to heaven than those of my virtuous daughter  instantly from behind that column which represented the virgin proceeded another sigh so penetrating so audible that henry again started up and stood fixed blessed yet overwhelming moment cried a voice henry ran forward and in the succeeding moment she from whom the melodious sounds issued sprung to sight and caroline stuart stood confessed  unable to support her various sensations on hearing the key turning within the lock and as the hand of the reverend arthur was pressing against the door she had started from her seat which as the expressions she had heard governed her movements she had alternately left and revisited  unconscious of motion she had continued her retreat from the one apartment to the other she gained the sacred column and with difficulty supported herself behind it overcome with excess of pure felicity  astonishment and joy fixed the whole assembly save arthur in the same statuelike positions it seemed as if the wand of an enchanter even with the force of an electric communication had in that instant completed its spell and indeed it was magic of the highest kind and from the most potent hand  a touch etherial that chained them for some minutes to their attitudes  at length henry called for the aid of john and the lieutenant ran to assist the failing steps of his sister caroline but never had there yet been a period in the life of either so interesting so insupportable as that in which caroline stuart and henry fitzorton were conducted by their brothers into the arms of each other  truth constancy approved love smiling pity consenting virtue and rewarding piety mingled in that embrace  in one moment the bruised reed was made whole and the almost quenched flax purged of all its vapor kindled into a flame which burnt pure for ever  o heaven of heavens exclaimed henry and thou its purest pattern upon earth inspire me with gratitude equal to my transport  and with fortitude to endure it there there my children said the exulting arthur pointing to the altar must you invoke the inspiring power yes he is the source cried caroline pressing her rosary with one hand and with the other leading henry forward then kneeling down with all humility but with returning force as if bestowed from above  he is the source repeated she from whence every evil has been averted or sustained  and from whence every good has been derived blessed and adored be that source for ever exclaimed the monk crossing his hands upon his bosom as he prostrated himself and bowing before the shrine with the most profound reverence the auditors did the same repeating his words it is in this sacred place then  in this sacred attitude that the substituted vows of caroline shall be heard and sanctified exclaimed the monk then arthur laid his hand on their heads breathing over each of them a prayer which was not without a power derived from the source he supplicated in that moment john fitzorton and charles stuart who had placed themselves on each side of the chief objects of the benediction rose up  advanced yet nearer the altar and joined the hands of caroline and henry blessing both and uniting them for ever  but in the good old dennison the youthful floresco and the worthy apothecary it was an event that annihilated all words in sensation even as it had operated in the blissful silence of the lovers in true george its effects were accompanied by emotions so strong that had they not found mitigation in a shower of tears which came to his relief as the brothers pronounced the blessing he might have fallen a martyr to genuine but insupportable joy  by the friendship which subsisted between the bishop of cherbourg and the pious father arthur the customary term of residence was shortened and the marriage solemnized with all the forms of the catholic religion  chapter lxii on returning from the church where the ceremony was performed partington with mrs herbert and johanna who had been apprized of all the circumstances by letters from the lieutenant arrived in time to receive the bride and bridegroom at the door of the abbots house and a meeting of more genuine satisfaction can never have been witnessed in the annals of mankind but in happiness as in grief the additional drops which may be poured into the cup when we suppose it incapable of holding more fully prove how incompetent mortals are to decide upon the power of human minds or to measure the proportions they may be called upon either to enjoy or to endure  a conference with father arthur had excited in the bishop of coutance his ancient friend so warm an interest in the happiness and future fortune of henry and caroline that to testify his respect for their sufferings and their rewards he expressed an earnest desire to receive them at his palace accompanied by the rest of their party the prelates wishes were conveyed by the monk whose virtues have so much enriched this history and the happy yet grateful henry not knowing how far a visit to a catholic bishop might be agreeable to the protestant part of his company nor presuming to make his own conversion a rule of faith to others looked to his brother for a reply i trust said john kindly answering to henrys look we can have but one opinion as to the invitation of a venerable man who seeks to increase the accumulating honors of that virtue which has been tried and found faithful  a man who is also the friend of father arthur whom indeed added the colonel my unjust suspicion has again so wronged that i can hardly deem myself a fit associate and should feel that i ought to banish myself from being of the party did i not know that i should thereby rob so revered though so outraged a friend of half the pleasures of a forgiving spirit john bowed with true humility and blushed with generous consciousness my son my benefactor answered arthur your conjectures were highly colored by circumstance and your resistance to apparently undue authority exercised on the will of your brother in two the most important concerns of his life  his affection and his faith  was even a fraternal duty with the last aweful concern i have nothing to do with the former i should not perhaps have so long delayed stating the ground on which i stood i should have removed your apprehensions as to the nature of your brothers vows and without equivoque have told you that in imitating those which his caroline had formed he would act under your own sanction of which a written proof had been so recently received from you  for modes of faith let zealous bigots fight his cannot be wrong whose life is in the right thus quoted henry i think i have often heard you say you fine old caitiff cried partington addressing himself to arthur that this scoundrel of a bishop is much such another fellow as yourself let us go to his palace in a body and send somebody to bid him expect our whole gang  the invitation was accepted and in order to render the homage to real virtue which had passed the ordeal more distinguished the prelate had added to the party many of his own particular friends yet had not the visit been marked by something of yet greater import to the honor and happiness of the fitzortons it would have had no record in these pages  after a repast which hospitality had prepared and temperance had blessed the prelate invited his guests to a walk in the gardens of his palace the scenery was of high natural beauty and cultured with exquisite taste several persons were employed in watering the flowers  but they were as yet at a considerable distance and their features indistinct as the party drew somewhat nearer they heard the persons at work singing  yes said the good bishop to henry and caroline who happened to be the nearest to him that is their usual way of sweetening business with pleasure  which shows their labors to be light interposed henry i hope so said the prelate but there is an exception to this general rule of happy industry among my peasants one of them and dearer to me than the rest has never been known to raise her voice to songs of vivacity although her notes of sadness might vie with those which grace the woes of sorrows bird yet she toils  i wish her not to toil  more assiduously and with more content than any of the rest but alas she too often waters the plants with her tears and i know not why and a female said caroline drawing the back of her hand across her own eyes and i fear an unhappy one answered the bishop she came recommended to me by a brother who is no more some mystery however involves her it is about a year and half ago that she was bequeathed to my care her mind seems to require employment and i therefore have suffered her to busy herself amongst the flowers i wished it indeed to be amusement she makes it labor in all things she has diligence and taste yet she has capacities for higher culture a sense  a natural sense and sensibility too of virtue and of religion i suspect she has lost a relation or perhaps mourns my brother who was a prototype of benevolence  or she laments perchance her absence from her country she is continually heaping the flower beds into hillocks like graves and then covers them with the flowers new set but she has now made some progress toward clear perceptions of life and death and holiness and truth yet her melancholy though softened is not dispelled she has of late been touched by the example of the nuns and wishes for a conventual life she is no way gloomy or sullen but i have never been able to trace a smile on her countenance and if her grief continues i have thoughts of indulging her as a novitiate in the convent of which my friend st seraphina is the superior that is the young woman now bending over the farther bed of roses and tying some of them up alas she wants support herself  her spirits are sunk to the earth sighed caroline she is not of europe you will perceive but i cannot discover her mystery said the bishop  while he was giving these additional traits and the company advanced nearer the object a loud and piercing shriek burst from arthurs indian and another scream from the female labourer so loud and piercing it rent the air in the next moment the names of floresco and zoraida were reverberated from the one to the other with every mark of wild and ungovernable joy they embraced  they prostrated themselves on the earth  they lifted up their hands toward heaven  they kissed the feet of the spectators  kneeled down with humility  sprung up in extacy  and again embraced  it was indeed zoraida the innocent idol and neverfading image of florescos heart  my brother said the prelate returning from the western plantations where he had amassed a considerable fortune had brought over three natives of the country in his suite two of these died upon the passage with many others of the sable race belonging to the captain himself an epidemy raging in the vessel from the heat of the weather and the cruel method of crowding so many human beings together in so narrow a space my poor brother himself lived only a few hours after his arrival he yielded up his breath even before i could see him his corpse with the rest of his property and this indian girl were conveyed to coutance and when i could acquire fortitude to attend to common affairs i found amongst the papers of the deceased the following note addressed to myself  faithful to me in servitude attentive to me in sickness even to the expiring hour at which i write this receive amongst my best possessions the bearer hereof the orphan zoraida  i can add little to this account except that the most docile and gentle manners and a something of sadness which her want of our language prevents her yet from explaining had given me a sincere interest to see her more happy they will explain themselves exclaimed arthur see they are already telling to each other their short but faithful history gracious providence how alike in their fates their fortunes and their feelings  alike be their felicity leave them i pray you good my lord a little to themselves  they are of the same country the same village the same affection and i am even more interested for them than yourself we are all interested interposed the rest of the party and if zoraida be as valuable as floresco said the lieutenant to the bishop your brother has bequeathed to you a treasure indeed father arthur then recited the brief story of his sable protegee which was so exact a counterpart of the good prelates adopted that although the different friends of the abbey and castle were thus drawn for a while out of themselves and they could hear only a repetition of a wellknown tale the new interest which the discovery had created made them listen to every circumstance with the eagerness of affection  although arthur had moved with his friends only a few paces the sable lovers appeared to have no consciousness of any thing but of themselves in the language of the heart however they had been abundant pouring forth and exchanging that way every image and sentiment of bliss and rapture with an ardour that caught the view not only of the bishop and his guests but of the peasants who had gathered near at length floresco drew from a pocketbook with which true george had presented him the work of jane atwoods own hands  not only the remains of his beloveds letter with all its fond repairs even those precious pieces which had been victims to his tenderness and had been mended by dennison but he presented her with an answer written with his own hand  the achievement of many a toilsome hour and interrupted by a thousand occupations a thousand protracting incidents zoraida received it with joy and gave to it a residence nearest to her palpitating heart the sacred piece of shawl another treasured memorial was next produced and delivered to her whose bosom it had once warmed and guarded  on that faithful shrine it now again was placed and tears of extacy fell fast upon it children of nature their wonder and their bliss were alike unspeakable but who that saw them would have wished for or wanted words to explain that their eloquent and common mother had never given life or love to any of her offspring more true to her emotions  when utterance was restored they conversed in their own native tongue and their discourse ran thus dearest zoraida lives for her floresco  and floresco for zoraida answered the enraptured maid then taking each other by the hand they ran as if inspired by one idea to the place where their patrons were grouped and prostrating themselves before the bishop and the monk crossed their hands on their bosoms kissed the ground near which their benefactors stood and showed every sign of gratitude  the bishop and his friends were extremely moved at this meeting of the lovers and we trust that our readers in good will to poor floresco will not deem the time lost which they have bestowed on him and his zoraida  even henry and caroline received from it an increase of that happiness which still warmed the center of their hearts from the no less unexpected recovery of one another  a happiness which nothing but such an event could possibly have augmented  father arthur who for reasons formerly stated believed the partner of his beloved domestics heart was no more  felt even a paternal joy as at the return of a daughter to his arms he expressed this to his mitred friend of whom before he left the palace he obtained permission to number zoraida amongst his children be it so answered the bishop  i confide her to your care were she indeed my daughter i should not hesitate to place her under such protection  aware as i am that her virtue now and her reward hereafter will suffer nothing by investing him at the same time with full powers to dispose of her as he thinks proper in this too i shall fulfill part of my dear brothers dying request in granting an asylum to the orphan zoraida for thus shall i provide for her a father and a husband but continued the bishop another part of my duty to her and to my brother still remains had it pleased heaven to allow time for a more regular distribution of his fortunes this object of his regard would have had her share his benevolence would have completed what his pity began look then to me for the arrangement of her worldly good and you my venerable arthur shall be instructed as to my designs on this head in which the late happy incident has made no sort of alteration  while this treaty of loving kindness was negociating betwixt the bishop and the monk on their return into the house henry and caroline johanna and charles were made spectators of a scene not less interesting partington and the apothecary had informed the associates of zoraida of her happy rencontre and its probable consequence and unwilling that her companions should be no way the better or the merrier on the occasion partington in the first instance set them all dancing upon the green he himself opening the rustic gambols they had received general orders to present nosegays to the bishops guests on theirleaving the garden and had been gathering the choicest flowers of the season for their masters present company these the merryhearted squire distributed with some judgment giving for instance laurels to henry and myrtle to caroline  and running with floresco and zoraida to another part of the garden demanded the aid of true george to stick that still exulting and ardent couple in the midst of a groupe of sunflowers at length not making them comprehend the spirit of his amicable abuse which however he was too happy to restrain he finished his frolic by gliding money into every palm while he was shaking hands and then with the delighted apothecary whose heart always reflected the joy of others returned into the palace where indeed the rest of the party had gone some time before john fitzorton alone remained he had placed himself not in sullen solitude to avoid the sight or the sound of the happy but where both his eye and ear might be gladdened yet great and manifold revolutions had passed his mind he was sometimes forced upon the thought of these even in the gayest moments of the social joy or soft endearment of those he loved and not to cast even a passing cloud on these he would step aside without seeming to part company shade himself awhile from the too intense observation of others and if a sigh or a tear from reflection forced their way it heaved unheard and fell unseen and generally in the next moment he joined his friends and all was well he had selected on this occasion his own bouquet as he saw others gathering  and following an innocent thought drawn from times long past but fresh in his recollection he made up as nearly as the flowers would allow such an assemblage as had been presented to olivia on the anniversary of her birth he paused a few minutes to place them as they then were arranged and as again he slowly moved on he pressed them on his bosom  but as he reached the palace door at which henry and caroline were standing with joined hands he held the flowers in a position so as to prevent any notice of their arrangement as he passed and then disposed of them to his satisfaction  for they were that night strewed on his pillow  yet none of the company had received more heartfelt delight from the meeting of the indian lovers than john fitzorton the evening was passed at the palace with the highest social enjoyment when the guests were parted zoraida was closetted with the bishop from whom she received permission to accompany the protector of her faithful admirer and the next morning he delivered her with his own hand to her new guardian  having previously explained all his generous designs he then embraced the whole party and bade them farewell  chapter lxiii we feel ourselves called upon however at this crisis to take a summary view of the conduct of caroline stuart in the late transactions at the convent the votary of eternal retreat had returned to society she had returned almost from the altar of immortal love to the altar of human passion and it was caroline stuart who had done this her justification must be sanctioned by every aweful power and it behooves us to take care that by our inadvertence we do not leave her exposed to the censure either of having lightly sought or lightly left her sacred asylum  she quitted not human society in disgust nor with a design to bury herself in the gloomy caverns of inaccessible solitude forgetful or affecting to forget that the world still held objects deserving her love the paths she had deserted had innumerable flowers mixed with countless thorns all the former she had endeavored to twine into wreaths for her dearest friends but lest one of the latter should find its way into their bosoms she gathered them all in her own  all that alas she could remove  and fled with them where they might no more be heard  no more be seen yet even in the bosom of solitude stern and eternal and with many of the sharpest of these thorns in her own heart she taught the cloister to bloom during her noviciate her regularity her gentleness her wisdom her talents had softened the unnecessary rigours of a monastic institution  her harp her lute her voice had been the solace of the sorrowful and had elevated the joy of the happy the nuns the sisters the superiors resorted to her for fortitude for comfort for occupation and though the sacred hymn succeeded to the song the harmony of caroline lost nothing by the ascension of her notes from earth to heaven in fine she had communicated joy to all around her a purer piety a firmer faith a meeker resignation reflected from her example she had made content a resident of the convent and in bidding farewell to her cloister she had obeyed the same voice which summoned her to enter it  the voice of faith of virtue and of god  there now remained nothing to be adjusted at coutance but the parting visit of father arthur to the convents caroline seemed to wish she might be permitted to accompany him to the visitation but in this she suffered herself to be overruled by the tender and transported henry the monk therefore blended her kindest wisnes to the abbess and to the nuns with his own and brought back in return the most cordial felicitations to their favorite caroline and her whole party on the evening of the same day being informed that a vessel with good accommodations might be hired for england the happy groupe took their leave of normandy and without meeting any thing to interrupt their toooften thwarted enterprises they regained the coast of albion and proceeded to their familymansions where the rest of their friends had fondly been expecting them  thus after all their trials and we trust as irreproachable conduct under them as mortals in this mixed and imperfect state can hope to attain were henry fitzorton and caroline stuart brought together yet several of the events that led to their union were so disastrous and one in particular the death of olivia so sincerely regretted even by the parties to whom it gave the freedom of choice that nothing but such a succession of great and unexpected blessings could have produced the felicity which was at length established as well in the persons of caroline and henry as in the mutual friends and relatives of both time however who has been justly represented by a great writer as having a wallet at his back in which he puts scraps for oblivion by degrees sostened away the memory of past images of distress leaving only impressions which the mind either contemplates with a melancholy pleasure or a moral advantage  the suspended ideas of happiness to some and of resignation to others of the families and friends of the abbey and of the castle at length returned the remaining enemies of both houses had all been properly disposed of the treachery of the elder otley was severely punished as we have seen by a tremendous death and by the hands of those who corrupted him his corrupters valentine miles nicholas dabble the younger otley with several of their accomplices male and female were in pursuance of their sentence duly executed the reader may remember that john fitzorton to appease the disappointed multitude predicted that the next gathering together of the same culprits would probably be at the gallows the prophecy was at last fulfilled to very general satisfaction of the turnpikeman and his wife the joy was complete and indeed several of the banditti found a certain consolation derived from their mutual hate even when they were on the scaffold to perceive their destiny the same the ingenious mr skuttle the landlord of the handinhand and several of his associates were for the first time of their lives devoted to the service of their country justice barhim flourished a short time longer and was at length assassinated by some of those very rogues of whom he was so tenacious but the indignant and ferocious lady tempest rather from rage than shame effected her own destruction on the morning of execution she was found dead in her cell resulting from these terrible but just punishments of vice the property and happiness of virtue were more effectually secured in the houses offices and hiding places above and under ground in various parts of the vast metropolis appertaining to one or other of the delinquents the indefatigable prosecutor his judicial brother and his learned friend discovered diverse false and extorted securities and instruments which though they had passed and repassed through several polluted channels reverted at length to the first principal and came back purified to their proper source mr thomas one of her ladyships first loves in process of time amused himself by an evening ride upon the road and in an attempt to pillage and murder a fellowtraveller was himself shot through the head but to jeputha by whose means the first discovery of the banditti was made to partington and his friends who as we have observed was of manners less abandoned and who had been forced into her criminal employments and deserted them in terror his majestys pardon was extended  partington who had for some time suspended his abusive habits in the serious and solemn sympathies of his heart resumed himself and again became rude of speech to those he best loved and wellbred to such as he despised of the former mrs herbert had become one of his most marked objects her alacrity in carrying the broadsword and loaded gun to the coach and her other heroic achievements for the gypsey expedition made the first forcible impression for he averred that he did not at all doubt the fair caitiff would cut his old head from his shoulders if he had the honor to be worthy thereof and since that the history of her attentions to the young johanna and what farther he had observed of her conduct during the sickness of mrs fitzorton confirmed her conquest and as she was no less taken with the squire  whose mind she could read even through the disguise of his humors and singularities  it was agreed that on condition the younger varlets consented to make a general marrying day the middleaged amelia and old basil partington should form the first couple in due time this actually did take place with a proviso only on the part of john which will presently be stated  true george was at length rewarded with the hand of his lovely jane and although the latter even to the term of a long and respectable life showed a disposition to pensive pleasures which seemed to spring rather from impression of early misfortune than from constitutional gravity it no way interrupted her being uniformly an endearing wife and in the general a happy woman both she and her husband however resolved on principles of real affection to remain with henry and caroline neither could any persuasion prevail with george to assume the title although he accepted the office and labors of steward while the good old dennison was alive and it was with no better success that an attempt was made to elevate the latter to a more absolute independency as a steward he had lived as a steward god willing he would die  partington perceiving a longer delay was likely to happen than he now thought necessary determined to settle every thing after his own fashion the caitiffs exclaimed he will at this rate waste their lives in preparing for its establishment he therefore summoned every body above and below stairs into the large hall of the bury but scarcely large enough to contain the visitors and as soon as they were got together  good said he and now you shall see that i will pair ye off ye shillyshally vagabonds as easily as i couple my terriers this blessed day i have determined that as i mean myself to become a slave to this oldish rascal none of ye shall be left at liberty to laugh at me here he tucked the arm of mrs herbert under his own and sallied with her round the room true george and jane atwood charles and johanna floresco and zoraida goody brabsons sally and william jerome and jonathan with the apothecarys two fair daughters  also the son of the gypsey chief and the pardoned penitent jeputha and notwithstanding a little resistance on the part of the damsel and a sly look at true george rachael and the young sexton  and if any more insufferables cried he of this our parish of partington or any spinsters and bachelors from the vicinity of the castle or the abbey who are now our guests wish to do as we do this is their opportunity  but there is no time left to think about it for to tell you the truth we are waited for in the church even while we are now speaking  in real truth the squire had waggishly preconcerted the whole subject with the rector of his parish as to both the day and hour and had caused it to be insinuated not only about his own parish but into those abovementioned proclaiming that those who wished to pay due respect to henry fitzorton and caroline stuart  of whose rencontre on the continent and happy union they were at the same time apprized  would do well to repair to the bury where such as were disposed to marry and were found to be right and true vagabonds to one another would find a wedding dinner and the charge of the special licenses defrayed by their sovereign liege scoundrel the said partington this edict brought together not only all the young but all such of the old as could endure the labors of the journey for as it served not only as an information of the union of henry with the only lady whom they deemed fit to succeed olivia but gave them an opportunity to pay their perhaps last duty to those they most loved and honored  most of olivias cottagers and all carolines pensioners embraced an occasion so gratifying to their hearts and with respect to the younger part the squire had given out that none but such as were disposed to follow his example in regard to marriage would be deemed sufficiently qualified for the invitation and it would therefore be expected of all lovers to bring wedding rings in their pockets and to put an end to all quarrels about sighs cruelty etc by going fairly and openly to church it is incredible what numbers assembled so many indeed that the feast intended for dinner did not take place until the supper hour partington led the way to the church and was amongst the first of those who approached the altar although he remained the last preserving throughout the ceremony a reverence of demeanor suited to the occasion and wholly different from his usual behavior on their return from the altar they were introduced to henry and caroline who received and returned the most heartfelt homage and although at the particular request of caroline much of that gleeful merriment which partington had plotted was given up an evening of more general or genuine satisfaction and felicity has seldom been seen in this jarring world  the pensioners and cottagers were continued on the list of henry and caroline but as it was intended by that amiable pair as well as charles and johanna to reside for some time abroad and as the colonel had signified his intention to return to the field the care of all these objects of bounty devolved upon the good old dennison who returned to the abbey and true george and jane atwood during the absence of the family were the guardians of the castle little fitz also was to have a soft cushion in both these eventful mansions father arthur with floresco and zoraida whom the good man had united took possession of the chapelhouse with a reserve of rooms for them in both the castle and abbey as fancy might direct and while these points were settling partington protested that he was so much in the habit of living with his old caitiffs that if his beloved scoundrel of a bride affectionately caressing her was of his way of thinking she would even join the vagabond party and leave the old bury to that greyheaded caitiff le maitre with the use of the woods and hedges to blondel gapper  this proposition being agreed to arrangements were made accordingly and henry fitzorton with his caroline little john and carry charles and his johanna partington and his amelia embarked for the continent with intent to pass the residue of the summer at paris the winter in the southern parts of france and the whole of the following year in italy  meanwhile resigning with manly grace to dispensations the wisdom and benevolence of which he presumed not to question john settled most of his worldly possessions in the manner he had all along intended on his johanna and on the children of olivia disposing of the rest so as to testify his remembrance of the worthy in whatever station of life he once more girded on his sword from the mingled motives that had already so often urged him to the field a war with spain when some of our islands were threatened with invasion afforded the opportunity and a braver or more experienced officer could not have been entrusted with the wealth or glory of his country victorious alike in the senate and the camp he was promoted to the rank of general in the direct line of ascent for none other would john fitzorton have accepted  no less active nor of less service to his country the respectable james had yearly continued to illustrate the important advantages derived both to the individual and to the community by preserving the golden mean in one steady tenor of principles of integrity and of perseverance he still maintained the peace and order of his own mind and of society happy from disposition and from events he had effected this without having suffered any peculiar misfortune of body or of mind without being impeded in his progress to fame fortune or felicity by any of those passions which frequently extinguish the desire and sometimes annihilate the principle that leads us to be of use either to ourselves or others he neither encountered nor created one incident that henry would have called an adventure or john looked upon as an object of conflict and yet he wooed and yet he won in that part of the human day which lying precisely betwixt its blooming morn and fading eve may truly be called its noon james fitzorton as if destined in all things to be the medium sought and secured the affections of a very amiable woman  the daughter of a brother judge  with whom he lived in a state of uninterrupted confidence and tranquillity a state which we are nevertheless aware few of our heroic readers will envy many will think insipid and upon which every lover of adventure will look down from the summit of a romantic heart with the most chivalric scorn yet in spite of all these grand disdains the lofty character of a safeguard of the public to whom is confided the property and lives of his fellowcitizens and the endearing offices of neighbor friend and brother husband father and christian have never been sustained with more unvarying rectitude and if the rectitude of his illustrious brothers was preserved under temptations more numerous and severe if a keener feeling of joy from more acute sensation sometimes attached to the character of henry were not the moments of superior felicity purchased by days and nights of agonizing sorrow  and did it not call for a philosophy and a life of bosomcontention rigorous as that of john to keep reason on her throne yet so variously are we formed that whoever holds his principles incorrupt will probably like all these brothers have a more equal share of happiness however unequally dealt out and certainly be all entitled to the veneration and love of their fellow creatures  at length henry and caroline with their attendant friends after having passed four years two more than they intended from home arrived at fitzorton castle where the brothers john and james with the bride of the latter were assembled to receive them and where they intended to pass the summer the tender sense of times past remained yet as the general now felt disposed to pass the rest of his days in the bosom of retirement and as there was no longer a wall of separation between the abbey and the castle henry and caroline resided at the former and the general and olivias children at the latter the lieutenant still intended to resume his longneglected profession but as his johanna felt herself more at home under the protection of her guardian and friends during her husbands absence she agreed to pass part of her time at the abbey and part at the castle  the return of henry and caroline was celebrated with universal joy and that share of merriment which was repressed at the bury on the general wedding day now burst forth the abbey had resumed its former dignity it was restored to magnificence and purified by virtue the feet which had receded ran toward it the eye that had surveyed it with abhorrence as the carousal of vice or with alarm as the haunt of obscene specter now again gazed upon it as a place redeemed  as a sanctuary consecrated anew father arthur his indian pair dennison and all but little fitz who had breathed his last in a good old age were found even happier and healthier than they had been left old gaffer and gammer atwood were alive and were on a visit to their daughter and her happy husband when henry came home  the turnpikeman honest blondel and all of whom the reader of this history can wish to hear pleasant tidings were in health and distributed some at the castle some at the abbey some at the manorhouse and the rest at the fitzorton arms the jubilee continued several days  and a great evening in which all were to assemble previous to separation was appointed this also was to be conducted by partington who declared he was happier than he had ever been in his life the ancient hall of the abbey was the place of meeting  and although henry caroline charles and johanna appeared only because gratitude demanded their presence for a moment they withdrew to scenes of less noisy joy they were indeed blessed in their fondest wishes but they felt a pious decency that at once chastened and attempered their satisfaction while they remained so near the spots where such a variety of aweful events had happened to themselves and their connexions indeed after the trial of a few months they meditated an exchange of the abbey or manorhouse with partington for the bury as a general residence and only came down in future once a year the generals principal arrangements were as follow  to indulging himself in the society of johanna and the education of henrys son and daughter the first of whom was given up to his affectionate care while young caroline who presented to him an image of her everremembered mother was consigned to his johanna they were both trained to and confirmed by the church of england while the children of henry and caroline should any be the result of their union were to be cultured in the tenets of their lovely mother and which the father had thought proper to adopt these divisions of faith in families are indeed always more or less to be regretted but when they proceed from principles not from passions from steady faith not from capricious change and produce a life pure and holy differing only in the modes of that faith who shall presume to boast of exclusive rectitude  the day after the general rejoicings the happy guests departed for their several places of abode in the very content of their souls mr and mrs partington for the present returned to the bury gaffer and gammer atwood to their untroubled cottage jerome and jonathan with their brides to farms on the squires estate who continued to appropriate all the atwoods except jane and she  so strange are the revolutions of life  became at length a resident with henry and caroline  a no less singular event  at guise abbey the lieutenant and johanna past a month with the general who desired to settle some matters for their future good  and true george had so much to engage him for some time at both houses that he was alternately an inmate of one and the other  for a short time therefore henry and caroline jane and dennison were left to themselves and happy as they were in each other and in the love and friendship of all who surrounded them  they did not feel it inconsistent with that happiness to pass much of the day that succeeded their grand festival  the first of their tranquillity  not with the living but the dead the church of fitzorton and the chapelhouse of the abbey had a sacred claim on the affections of all but when henry left his companions for a while in the latter and entered the former alone he was at once pleased and moved to see john already bending over the urn of olivia the brothers did homage at the tomb of virtue and were soon joined by the votaries from the chapel and as they rose from their devotions it was to embrace each other  my caroline said henry as they were returning home wherefore should we again quit these scenes  have not these pensive sweets every part of our felicity we are here methinks under the immediate ministry and protection of kindred cherubim let us believe that we are in their charge and they our guardians ah be the rest of our lives past under their heavenly guidance said caroline  blessed blessed thought cried jane do dear your honors let us live and die here exclaimed dennison even where our friends were made angels  the idea of departed friends changed into guardian spirits was innocently adopted the very air and earth were consecrated from that moment new sources of happiness opened thus the castle and the abbey became holy ground nor did they ever leave it more  chapter lxiv those who have fairly perused this history will we trust have progressively traced its design yet it may not be amiss to add in this closing chapter a recapitulation of its moral in point of interest with the heart and effect upon the conduct of the reader it has been our endeavor to render conspicuous and impressive several of the most important objects in literature in morality and in domestic life with examples and warnings appropriate to each  in one of the personages the character of a protestant clergyman and father of a family of an honorable mind shaded by human error and somewhat warped by religious tenacity has been contrasted with the character and conduct of a man who is exhibited in the perpetration consciousness perseverance punishment and repentance of progressive crimes and as the life and death of the former of these persons give the example of a good man in the several moral divisions of a divine friend neighbor citizen parent and husband through every period of a wise and active life even till he quits the world with the above exception so does the behavior of the other hold out the warning of a vicious being placed in no less prosperous circumstances even till he is overwhelmed by a sense of his own enormity bringing the deathbed of the wicked close under the eye in contrast to the deathbed of the righteous  in a third character has been pourtrayed a venerable supporter of virtue in a catholic clergyman in all the trying instances of a difficult station to act as a corrective on that intolerant of sentiment which influenced the opinions of the protestant divine  a fourth endeavor has been to display in the domestic history of three young men brothers the two great extremes of philosophic energy and poetic softness of character with the safety of the middle man between both showing however in the conduct of the two former the possibility of preserving all the virtues of the latter even when the practice of those virtues are exposed by habit temper and pursuit to more arduous trials  the power of filial piety has also been given in the delineation of a mind that preserved its modest dignity amidst the hardest ordeals to which a child can ever be called upon in her relative situation to pass  the sixth portrait is that of a candid and perfectly unsuspicious character in all the relations of social and domestic life  the seventh discovers the good produced to an unfortunate woman from some merciful treatment received from the fortunate of her own sex for the want of which many a violated form but unsullied mind languishes in the shades of obscurity or crowds our streets with irreclaimable victims  these are interspersed with various examples and warnings  of faithful domestics in youth and age  of their contrast in some treacherous servants  of pettifoggers in the law  of honorable men in that profession  of patient meekness unaffected candor conjugal faith and maternal affection through a life of trials and its appropiate warning is given in a violent disposition coupling strong powers of mind with beauty of person and loose principles for a specific detail of the several offenses committed by this person and her accomplices for the discovery of a dreadful variety of evils which have never before been explained to the public and for their moral and legal remedies we refer the reader to the truly valuable almost incredible yet alas we are assured accurate calculations of an able and active magistrate in his treatise on the police of the metropolis lamentable indeed is the catalogue of human depravity he has exhibited but as the great motive which induced him to enter on such a laborious and painful estimate was to point out the advantages which would result from a wellregulated and energetic police conducted with purity activity vigilance and discretion we conceived that by employing a few of the most prominent facts applicable to our purpose from the soulaffrighting list in a work of this nature we might give the alarm to that part of the community which suffer most from one branch of the atrocities enumerated  the corruptions of servants and dependents  against whose arts masters and mistresses cannot be too well armed and they are less likely to derive useful information of this kind from a systematic treatise which they apprehend may pass the bound of their proper knowledge than from books more immediately appropriate to their entertainment and in which truths on every subject of awful import should as it were take them by surprise and be so mixed with events as to interest while they warm and it was further believed that this mode would excite in the mind of every reader of the foregoing pages an eager though startled curiosity to peruse the whole of mr colquhouns admirable plan for the prevention of crimes founded on a detail of the means by which they are conducted to their horrible ends a plan from which we most ardently join in the hope of the magistrate that the public in general and the legislature in particular will by giving effect to his wellmeant endeavors most amply reward the exertions he has used in the course of a very intricate and arduous investigation in which his only object has been the good of his country scorning patience and resisting conscience  a fourteenth warning arises from showing the danger of hazarding the happiness of a child in the momentous article of marriage on any consideration where the heart sanctions not the choice of the parent even though the hand is presented to beauty elegance and virtue since nothing can be more certain than that more mischief may result from one unhappy marriage than from an army of men intent on destruction  such are some of the great aims proposed to be accomplished by this work as a whole from a due contemplation of which with the parts must be collected its energy and color its ornament and utility from the intention we can with confidence claim some praise for it has been sincere  from the execution we can derive nothing but hope the labor has not been light nor yet unattended by consolation but if half a long life could bring the great moral and domestic truths to the point desired we should exult in the means by which the ends were attained  finis errata page   line   penult
