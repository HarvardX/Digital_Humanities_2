poetical works  of  john dryden     with life critical dissertation and explanatory notes  by the  rev george gilfillan    vol ii      m dccc lv    critical estimate  of the  genius and poetical works of john dryden   in our life of dryden we promised to say something about the question how far is a poet particularly in the moral tendency and taste of his writings to be triedand either condemned or justifiedby the character and spirit of his age to a rapid consideration of this question we now proceed before examining the constituent elements or the varied fruits of the poets genius  and here unquestionably there are extremes which every critic should avoid some imagine that a writer of a former century should be tried either by the standard which prevails in the cultured and civilised nineteenth or by the exposition of moral principles and practice which is to be found in the scriptures now it is obviously so far as taste is concerned as unjust to judge a book written in the style and manner of one age by the merely arbitrary and conventional rules established in another as to judge the dress of our ancestors by the fashions of the present day and in respect of morality it is as unfair to visit with the same measure of condemnation offences against decorum or decency committed by writers living before or living after the promulgation of the christian code as it would be to class the satyrs priapi and bacchantes of an antique sculptor with their imitations by inferior and coarser artists in later times there must be a certain measure of allowance made for the errors of genius when it was working as the galleyslave of its tradition and period and when it had not yet received the divine light which shining into the world from above has supplied men with higher æsthetic as well as spiritual models of principles and revealed mans body to be the temple of the holy ghost to look for our modern philanthropy in that greek gazette the iliad of homerto expect that reverence for the supreme being which the bible has taught us in the metamorphoses of ovidor to seek that refinement of manners and language which has only of late prevailed amongst us in the plays of aristophanes and plautuswere very foolish and very vain in ages not so ancient and which have revolved since the dawn of christianity a certain coarseness of thought and language has been prevalent and for it still larger allowance should be made because it has been applied to simplicity rather than to sensualityto rustic barbarism not to civilised corruptionand carries along with it a rough raciness and a reference to the sturdy aboriginal beastjust as acorns in the trough suggest the immemorial forests where they grew and the rich greenswards on which they fell  in two cases it thus appears should the severest censor be prepared to modify his condemnation of the bad taste or the impurity to be found in writers of geniusfirst in that of a civilization perfect in its kind but destitute of the refining and sublimating element which a revelation only can supply and secondly in that of those ages in which the lights of knowledge and religion are contending with the gloom of barbarian rudeness perhaps there are still two other cases capable of palliationthat of a mind so constituted as to be nothing if not a mirror of its age and faithfully and irresistibly reflecting even its vices and pollutions or that of a mind morbidly in love with the morbidities and the vile passages of human nature but suppose the case of a writer sitting under the full blaze of gospel truth professedly a believer in the gospel and intimately acquainted with its oracles living in a late and dissipated not a rude and simple agepossessed of varied and splendid talents which qualified him to make as well as to mirror and with a taste naturally sound and manly who should yet seek to shock the feelings of the pious to gratify the low tendencies and fire to frenzy the evil passions of his periodhe is not to be shielded by the apology that he has only conformed to the bad age on which he was so unfortunate as to fall prejudice may indeed put in such a plea in his defence but the inevitable eye of common sense distinguishing between necessity and choice between coarseness and corruption between a mans passively yielding to and actively inviting and encouraging the currents of false taste and immorality which he must encounter will find that plea nugatory and bring in against the author a verdict of guilty  now this we fear is exactly the case of dryden he was neither a barbarian nor a scythian he was a conscious artist not a high though helpless reflector of his age he had not we think like his relative swift originally any diseased delight in filth for its own sake was notshall we saya natural but an artificial yahoo he wielded a power over the public mind approaching the absolute and which he could have turned to virtuous instead of vicious accountat first it might have been amidst considerable resistance and obloquy but ultimately with triumphant success this however he never attempted and must therefore be classed in this respect with such writers as byron whose powers gilded their pollutions less than their pollutions degraded and defiled their powers nay perhaps he should be ranked even lower than the noble bard whose obscenities are not so gross and who had besides to account for them the double palliations of passion and of despair  in these remarks we refer principally to drydens plays for his poems as we remarked in the life are with the exception of a few of the prologues which we print under protest in a great measure free from impurity we pass gladly to consider him in his genius and his poetical works the most obvious and among the most remarkable characteristics of his poetic style are its wondrous elasticity and ease of movement there is never for an instant any real or apparent effort any straining for effect any of that double double toil and trouble by which many even of the weird cauldrons in which genius forms her creations are disturbed and bedimmed that power of doing everything with perfect and conscious ease which dugald stewart has ascribed to barrow and to horsley in prose distinguished dryden in poetry whether he discusses the deep questions of fate and foreknowledge in religio laici or lashes shaftesbury in the medal or pours a torrent of contempt on shadwell in macflecknoe or describes the fire of london in the annus mirabilis or soars into lyric enthusiasm in his ode on the death of mrs killigrew and alexanders feast or paints a tournament in palamon and arcite or a fairy dance in the flower and the leafhe is always at home and always aware that he is his consciousness of his own powers amounts to exultation he is like the steed who glories in that tremendous gallop which affects the spectator with fear indeed we never can separate our conception of drydens vigorous and vaulting style from the image of a noble horse devouring the dust of the field clearing obstacles at a bound taking up long leagues as a little thing and the very strength and speed of whose motion give it at a distance the appearance of smoothness pope speaks of his  long resounding march and energy divine  perhaps ease divine had been words more characteristic of that almost superhuman power of language by which he makes the most obstinate materials pliant melts down difficulties as if by the touch of magic and to resume the former figure comes into the goal without a hair turned on his mane or a single sweatdrop confessing effort or extraordinary exertion we know no poet since homer who can be compared to dryden in this respect except scott who occasionally in marmion and the lay of the last minstrel exhibits the same impetuous ease and fiery fluent movement scott does not however in general carry the same weight as the other and the species of verse he uses in comparison to the heroic rhyme of dryden gives you often the impression of a hard trot rather than of a longresounding and magnificent gallop scott exhibits in his poetry the soul of a warrior but it is of a warrior of the bordersomewhat savage and coarse dryden can for the nonce at least assume the appearance and display the spirit of a knight of ancient chivalrygallant accomplished elegant and gay  next to this poets astonishing ease spirit and elastic vigour may be ranked his clear sharp intellect he may be called more a logician than a poet he reasons often and always acutely and his rhyme instead of shackling strengthens the movement of his argumentation parts of his religio laici and the hind and panther resemble portions of duns scotus or aquinas set on fire indeed keen strong intellect inflamed with passion and inspirited by that ardour and impetuosity of mind which wordsworth is compelled to allow to him rather than creative or original genius is the differentia of dryden we have compared him to a courser but he was not one of those coursers of achilles who fed on no earthly food but on the golden barley of heaven having sprung from the gods    greek xanthon kai balion to ama pnoiaesi petesthaen   tous eteke zephuro anemo arpua podargae  dryden resembled rather the mortal steed which was yoked with these immortal twain the brood of zephyr and the harpy podarga only we can hardly say of the poet what homer says of pedasus  greek os kai thnaetos eon epeth ippois athanatoisi  he was not although a mortal able to keep up with the immortal coursers his path was on the plains or tablelands of earthnever or seldom in cloudland gorgeous land or through the aerial altitudes which stretch away and above the clouds to the gates of heaven he can hardly be said to have possessed the power of sublimity in the high sense of that term as the power of sympathising with the feeling of the infinite often he gives us the impression of the picturesque of the beautiful of the heroic of the nobly disdainfulbut never when writing at least entirely from his own mind of that infinite and nameless grandeur which the imaginative soul feels shed on it from the multitudinous waves of oceanfrom the cataract leaping from his rock as if to consummate an act of prayer to godfrom the hum of great assemblies of menfrom the sight of farextended wastes and wildernessesand from the awful silence and the still more mysterious sparkle of the midnight stars this sense of the presence of the shadow of immensityimmensity itself cannot be felt any more than measuredthis sight like that vouchsafed to moses of the backparts of the divinethe divine itself cannot be seenhas been the inspiration of all the highest poetry of the worldof the paradise lost of the divina commedia of the night thoughts of wordsworth and coleridge of festus and highest far of the hebrew prophets as they cry whither can we go from thy presence whither can we flee from thy spirit such poets have resembled a blind man who feels although he cannot see that a stranger of commanding air is in the room beside him so they stand awestruck in the wind of the going of a majestic and unseen being this feeling differs from mysticism inasmuch as it is connected with a reality while the mystic dreams a vague and unsupported dream and the poetry it produces is simply the irresistible cry springing from the perception of this wondrous some one who is actually near them the feeling is connected in general with a lofty moral and religious nature and yet not always since while wanting in dryden we find it intensely discovered although in an imperfect and perverted shape in byron and rousseau  in dryden certainly it exists not we do notand in this we have jeffreys opinion to back usremember a single line in his poetry that can be called sublime or which is the same thing that gives us a thrilling shudder as if a god or a ghost were passing by pleasure high excitementrapture even he often produces but such a feeling as is created by that line of milton  to bellow through the vast and boundless deep  never compare in proof of this the description of the tournament in palamon and arciteamazingly spirited as it isto the description of the warhorse in job or if that appear too high a test to the contest of achilles with the rivers in homer to the war of the angels and the interrupted preparations for contest between gabriel and satan in milton to the contest between apollyon and christian in the pilgrims progress to some of the combats in spenser and to that wonderful one of the princess and the magician in midair in the arabian nights in order to understand the distinction between the most animated literal pictures of battle and those into which the element of imagination is strongly injected by the poet who can to the inevitable shiver of human nature at the sight of struggle and carnage add the far more profound and terrible shiver only created by a vision of the concomitants the consequencesthe unseen borders of the bloody scene take these lines for instance    they look anew the beauteous form of fight   is changed and war appears a grisly sight   two troops in fair array one moment showed   the next a field with fallen bodies strowed   not half the number in their seats are found   but men and steeds lie grovelling on the ground   the points of spears are stuck within the shield   the steeds without their riders scour the field   the knights unhorsed on foot renew the fight   the glittering faulchions cast a gleaming light   hauberks and helms are hewd with many a wound   outspins the streaming blood and dyes the ground  this is vigorous and vivid but is not imaginative or suggestive it does not carry away the mind from the field to bring back thoughts and images which shall so to speak brood over and aggravate the general horror it is in a word plain good painting but it is not poetry there is not a metaphor such as he laugheth at the shaking of a spear in it all  in connexion with this defect in imagination is the lack of natural imagery in drydens poetry wordsworth indeed greatly overcharges the case when he says in a letter to scott that there is not a single image from nature in the whole body of his poetry we have this minute taken up the hind and the panther and find two images from nature in one page    as where in fields the fairy rounds are seen   a rank sour herbage rises on the green   so c  and a few lines down    as where the lightning runs along the ground   no husbandry can heal the blasting wound  and some pages farther on occurs a description of spring not unworthy of wordsworth himself beginning    new blossoms flourish and new flowers arise   as god had been abroad and walking there   had left his footsteps and reformd the year  still it is true that taking his writings as a whole they are thin in natural images and even those which occur are often rather the echoes of his reading than the results of his observation and what wordsworth adds is we fear true in his translation of virgil where virgil can be fairly said to have his eye upon his object dryden always spoils the passage the reason of this apart from his want of high imaginative sympathy may be found in his long residence in london and his lack of that intimate daily familiarity with natural scenes which can alone supply thorough knowledge or enkindle thorough love nature is not like the majority of other mistresses her charms deepen the longer she is known and he that loves her most warmly has watched her with the narrowest inspection she can bear the keenest glances of the microscope and to see all her glory would exhaust an antediluvian life the appetite in her case grows with what it feeds on but such an appetite was not drydens  another of his great defects is in true tenderness of feeling he has very few passages which can be called pathetic his elegies and funeral odes such as those on mrs killigrew and eleonora are eloquent but they move you to admiration not to tears drydens long immersion in the pollutions of the playhouses had combined with his long course of domestic infelicity and his employments as a hack author a party scribe and a satirist to harden his heart to brush away whatever fine bloom of feeling there had been originally on his mind and to render him incapable of even simulating the softer emotions of the soul but for the discovered fact that he was in early life a lover of his relative honor driden you would have judged him from his works incapable of a pure passion lust hard by hate being his twin idols how could he represent human far less ethereal love and how could he touch those springs of holy tears which lie deep in mans heart and which are connected with all that is dignified and all that is divine in mans nature what could the author of limberham know of love or the author of macflecknoe of pity  wordsworth in that admirable letter to which we have repeatedly referred says whenever his language is poetically impassioned it is mostly upon unpleasing subjects such as the follies vices and crimes of classes of men or individuals this is unquestionable he never so nearly reaches the sublime as when he is expressing contempt he never rises so high as in the act of trampling he is a good hater and expresses his hatred with a mixture of animus and ease of fierceness and of trenchant rapidity which makes it very formidable he only as it were waves off his adversaries disdainfully but the very wave of his hand cuts like a sabre his satire is not savage and furious like juvenals not cool collected and infernal like that of junius not rabid and reckless like that of swift and never darkens into the unearthly grandeur of byrons but it is strong swift dashing and decisive nor does it want deep and subtle touches his pictures of shaftesbury and buckingham are as delicately finished as they are powerfully conceived he flies best at the highest game but even in dealing with settles and shadwells he can be as felicitous as he is fierce no satire in the world contains lines more exquisitely inverted more ingeniously burlesqued more artfully turned out of their apparently proper course like rays at once refracted and cooled than those which thus ominously panegyrise shadwell    his brows thick fogs instead of glories grace   and lambent dulness playd about his face   as hannibal did to the altar come   sworn by his sire a mortal foe to rome   so shadwell swore nor should his vow be vain   that he till death true dulness would maintain  better still the following picture in imitation of the homeric or miltonic manner    the sire then shook the honours of his head   and from his brows damps of oblivion shed   full on the filial dulnesslong he stood   repelling from his breast the raging god  what inimitable irony in this epithet the god of dulness raging a stagnant pool in a passion a canal insane a mouton enragé as the french says or a snail in a tumultuous state of excitement were but types of the satirical ideas implied in these words what a description of labouring nonsenseof the pythonic genius of absurdity panting and heaving on his solemnly ridiculous tripod  the language and versification of dryden have been praised and justly his style is worthy of a still more powerful and original vein of genius than his own it is a masculine clear elastic and varied diction fitted to express all feelings save the deepest all fancies save the subtlest all passions save the loftiest all moods of mind save the most disinterested and rapt to represent incidents however strange characters however contradictory to each other shades of meaning however evasive and to do all this as if it were doing nothing in point of ease and as if it were doing everything in point of felt and rejoicing energy no poetic style since can in such respects be compared to drydens popes to his is feebleand byrons forced he can say the strongest things in the swiftest way and the most felicitous expressions seem to fall unconsciously from his lips had his matter you say but been equal to his manner his thought in originality and imaginative power but commensurate with the boundless quantity and no less admirable quality of his words his versification deserves a commendation scarcely inferior it is all ear if we may so apply an expression of shakspeares no studied rulesno elaborate complication of harmoniesit is the mere sinking and swelling of the wave of his thought as it moves onward to the shore of his purpose and as in the sea there are no furrows absolutely isolated from each other but each leans on or melts into each and the subsidence of the one is the rise of the otherso with the versification of his better poetry the beginning of the hind and panther we need not quote but it will be remembered as a good specimen of that peculiar style of running the lines into one another and thereby producing a certain free and noble effect which the uniform tinkle of pope and his school is altogether unable to reach a style which has since been copied by some of our poetsby churchill by cowper and by shelley the lines of the artificial school on the other hand may be compared to rollers each distinct from each othereach being in itself a wholebut altogether forming none pope says hazlitt has turned pegasus into a rockinghorse  we are perhaps nearly right when we call dryden the most eloquent and rhetorical of english poets he bears in this respect an analogy to lucretius among the romans who inferior in polish to virgil was incomparably more animated and energetic in style who exhibited besides traits of lofty imagination rarely met with in virgil and never in dryden and who equalled the english poet in the power of reasoning in verse and setting the severe abstractions of metaphysical thought to music with the shakspeares chaucers spensers miltons byrons wordsworths and coleridges the dii majorum gentium of the poetic pantheon of britain dryden ranks not although towering far above the moores goldsmiths gays and priors he may be classed with a middle but still high order in which we find the names of scott as a poet johnson pope cowper southey crabbe and two or three others who while all excelling dryden in some qualities are all excelled by him in others and bulk on the whole about as largely as he on the public eye  we come to make a few remarks in addition to some we have already incidentally made on drydens separate works and first of his lyrics his songs properly so called are lively buoyant and elastic yet compared to those of shakspeare they are of the earth earthy they are the down of the thistle carried on a light breeze upwards shakspeares resemble aerial notessnatches of superhuman melodydescending from above compared to the warmgushing songs of burns drydens are cold better than his songs are his odes that on the death of mrs killigrew has much divided the opinion of criticsdr johnson calling it magnificent and warton denying it any merit we incline to a mediate view it has bold passages the first and the last stanzas are very powerful and the whole is full of that rushing torrentmovement characteristic of the poet but the sinkings are as deep as the swellings and the inequality disturbs the general effect this is still more true of threnodia augustalis the ode on the death of charles ii not only is its spirit fulsome and its statement of facts grossly partial but many of its lines are feeble and the whole is wirespun yet what can be nobler in thought and language than the following descriptive of the joy at the kings partial recovery    men met each other with erected look   the steps were higher that they took   each to congratulate his friend made haste   and long inveterate foes saluted as they passd  how admirably this last line describes that sudden solution of the hostile elements in human naturethat swift sense of unity in society produced by some glad tidings or great public enthusiasm when for an hour the millennium is anticipated and the poets wish that    man wi man the warld oer   shall brithers be for a that  is fulfilled  the two odes on st cecilias day are both admirable in different ways alexanders feast like burnss tam o shanter seems to come out at once as from a mould it is pure inspiration but of the second orderrather that of the greek pythoness than of the hebrew prophet coleridge or wordsworth makes the objection to it that the bacchus it describes is the mere vulgar deity of drink    flushd with a purple grace   he shows his honest face  not the ideal bacchus clad in vineleaves returning from the conquest of india and attended by a procession of the lions and tigers he had tamed but this although a more imaginative representation of the god of wine had not been so suitably sung at an entertainment presided over by an alexander and a thais a drunk conqueror and a courtezan dryden himself we have seen thought this the best ode that ever was or would be written in the english language in a certain sense he was right for vivacity freedom of movement and eloquence it has never been equalled but there are some odessuch as coleridges ode to france and wordsworths power of soundwhich as certainly excel it in strength of imagination grandeur of conception and unity of execution and effect  of drydens satires we have already spoken in a general way absalom and achitophel is of course the masterpiece and cannot be too highly praised as a gallery of portraits and for the daring force and felicity of its style why enlarge on a poem almost every line of which has become a proverb the medal is inferior only in condensationin spirit and energy it is quite equal in macflecknoe the mockheroic is sustained with unparalleled vigour from the first line to the last shadwell is a favourite of drydens ire he fancies him and loves to empty out on his head all the riches of his wrath what can be more terrible than the words occurring in the second part of absalom and achitophel    when wine hath given him courage to blaspheme   he curses godbut god before curst him  he has written two pieces which may be called didactic or controversial poemsreligio laici and the hind and panther the chief power of the former is in its admirable combination of two things often dissociatedreason and rhyme and its chief interest lies in the light it casts upon drydens uncertainty of religious view the thought has little originality the versification less varied music than is his wont and no passage of transcendent power occurs far more faulty in plan and far more unequal is the hind and panther but it has on the other hand many passages of amazing eloquencesome satirical pictures equal to anything in absalom and achitophelsome vivid natural descriptions and even the absurdities of the fable and the sophistries of the argument add to its character as the most exquisitely perverted piece of ingenuity in the language nothing but high genius very vigorously exerted could reconcile us to a story so monstrous and to reasoning so palpably onesided and weak  his epistles are of divers merit but all discover drydens usual sense sarcastic observation and sweeping force of style the best are that to sir godfrey knellerremarkable for its knowledge of and graceful tribute to the serene and silent art of painting and the very noble epistle addressed to congreve which reminds you of one giant hand of genius held out to welcome and embrace another gross flatterer as dryden often was there is something in this epistle that rings true and the emotion in it you feel even all his powers could never have enabled him to counterfeit such generous patronage of rising by acknowledged merit was as rare then as it is still the envy of the literary man too often crowns his gray hairs with a chaplet of nightshade and pours its dark poison into the latest cup of existence  his annus mirabilis is another instance of perverted power and ingenuity astray written in that bad style he found prevalent in his early daysthe style of the metaphysical poets cowley donne and draytonthe author ever and anon soars out of his trammels into strong and simple poetry fervid description and in one passagethat about the future fortunes of londoninto eloquent prophecy the fire of london is vigorously pictured but its breath of flame should have burned up petty conceit and tawdry ornament he should have sternly daguerreotyped the spectacle of the capital of the civilised world burninga spectacle awful not only in the sight of men but as hall says of the french revolution in that of superior beings we need not dwell on the farfamed absurdities which the poem containsabout god turning a crystal pyramid into a broad extinguisher to put out the fireof the ship compared to a seawasp floating on the wavesand of men in the fight killed by aromatic splinters from the spice islands criticism has long ago said its best and its worst about these early escapades of a writer whose taste to the last was never commensurate with his genius  his translations we have not included in this edition as we reserve them along with other masterpieces of translated verse for a separate issue afterwards that of the art of poetry sometimes included in editions of his works was not his but only revised by him we may say here in general however that although there are more learned and more correct translators than dryden there are few who have produced versions so vigorous so full of exuberant life and in those parts of the authors suitable to the peculiarities of the translators own genius so faithful to their spirit and soul if not to their letter and their body as he parts of virgil he does not translate well he has no sympathy with maros elegance concinnitas chaste grandeur and minute knowledge of nature but wherever virgil begins to glow and gallop dryden glows and gallops with him and wherever virgil is nearest homer dryden is nearest him  we have reserved to the close his fables as on the whole forming the culmination of dryden the artist if not perhaps of dryden the poet in preparing his poems for publication how refreshing we found it to pass from a needful although cursory perusal of his plays and a revision of his prologues to these comparatively pure rightmanly and eloquent compositionsthe fables of dryden we do not because it would be hardly fair with wordsworth seek to compare them with the chaucerian originalsa comparison under which they would be infallibly crushed we prefer looking at them as bearing only the relation to chaucer which macphersons did to the original ossian and regarding them in this light as adaptations where the original author furnishes only the groundwork they are surely masterpieces and models of composition if not exemplars of creative power and genius how free and majestic their numbers how bold and buoyant their language how interesting the stories they tell how perfect the preservation and artful the presentment of the various characters what a fine chivalrous spirit breathes in palamon and arcite what a soft yet purple pure yet gorgeous light of love hovers over the flower and the leafthe only poem of drydens in whichthanks perhaps to his master chaucerthe poet discovers the slightest perception of that    love which spirits feel   in climes where all is equable and pure  what gay and gallant badinage exquisite irony and interesting narrative in the story of the cock and fox and what knowledge of human nature and skilful construction in the wife of baths tale we are half inclined with george ellis to call these fables the noblest specimen of versification to be found in any modern language we gather too from them a notion about drydens capabilities which we may state it is that had dryden lived in a novel and romancewriting age and turned his great powers in that direction he might have easily become the best fictionistnext to cervantes and scottthat ever lived possessing as he did most of the qualities of a good novelistvigorous and facile diction dramatic skill an eye for character the power of graphic description and rapid changeful narrative the command of the grave and the gay the severe and the lively and a sympathy both with the bustling activities and the wild romance of human life if not with its more solemn aspects its transcendental references and its aerial heights and giddy abysses of imagination and poetry  we have followed the judicious example of warton and mitford in excluding several prologues which appear in some editions but which reflect no honour on their author  drydens translations will be published in the separate series of translations which it is the intention of the publisher to issue independent of the poetical works of the various authors

lordthe commands with which you honoured me some months ago are now performed they had been sooner but betwixt ill health some business and many troubles i was forced to defer them till this time ovid going to his banishment and writing from on shipboard to his friends excused the faults of his poetry by his misfortunes and told them that good verses never flow but from a serene and composed spirit wit which is a kind of mercury with wings fastened to his head and heels can fly but slowly in a damp air i therefore chose rather to obey you late than ill if at least i am capable of writing anything at any time which is worthy your perusal and your patronage i cannot say that i have escaped from a shipwreck but have only gained a rock by hard swimming where i may pant a while and gather breath for the doctors give me a sad assurance that my disease never took its leave of any man but with a purpose to return however my lord i have laid hold on the interval and managed the small stock which age has left me to the best advantage in performing this inconsiderable service to my ladys memory we who are priests of apollo have not the inspiration when we please but must wait until the god comes rushing on us and invades us with a fury which we are not able to resist which gives us double strength while the fit continues and leaves us languishing and spent at its departure let me not seem to boast my lord for i have really felt it on this occasion and prophesied beyond my natural power let me add and hope to be believed that the excellency of the subject contributed much to the happiness of the execution and that the weight of thirty years was taken off me while i was writing i swam with the tide and the water under me was buoyant the reader will easily observe that i was transported by the multitude and variety of my similitudes which are generally the product of a luxuriant fancy and the wantonness of wit had i called in my judgment to my assistance i had certainly retrenched many of them but i defend them not let them pass for beautiful faults amongst the better sort of critics for the whole poem though written in that which they call heroic verse is of the pindaric nature as well in the thought as the expression and as such requires the same grains of allowance for it it was intended as your lordship sees in the title not for an elegy but a panegyric a kind of apotheosis indeed if a heathen word may be applied to a christian use and on all occasions of praise if we take the ancients for our patterns we are bound by prescription to employ the magnificence of words and the force of figures to adorn the sublimity of thoughts isocrates amongst the grecian orators and cicero and the younger pliny amongst the romans have left us their precedents for our security for i think i need not mention the inimitable pindar who stretches on these pinions out of sight and is carried upward as it were into another world  this at least my lord i may justly plead that if i have not performed so well as i think i have yet i have used my best endeavours to excel myself one disadvantage i have had which is never to have known or seen my lady and to draw the lineaments of her mind from the description which i have received from others is for a painter to set himself at work without the living original before him which the more beautiful it is will be so much the more difficult for him to conceive when he has only a relation given him of such and such features by an acquaintance or a friend without the nice touches which give the best resemblance and make the graces of the picture every artist is apt enough to flatter himself and i amongst the rest that their own ocular observations would have discovered more perfections at least others than have been delivered to them though i have received mine from the best hands that is from persons who neither want a just understanding of my ladys worth nor a due veneration for her memory  dr donne the greatest wit though not the greatest poet of our nation acknowledges that he had never seen mrs drury whom he has made immortal in his admirable anniversaries i have had the same fortune though i have not succeeded to the same genius however i have followed his footsteps in the design of his panegyric which was to raise an emulation in the living to copy out the example of the dead and therefore it was that i once intended to have called this poem the pattern and though on a second consideration i changed the title into the name of the illustrious person yet the design continues and eleonora is still the pattern of charity devotion and humility of the best wife the best mother and the best of friends  and now my lord though i have endeavoured to answer your commands yet i could not answer it to the world nor to my conscience if i gave not your lordship my testimony of being the best husband now living i say my testimony only for the praise of it is given you by yourself they who despise the rules of virtue both in their practice and their morals will think this a very trivial commendation but i think it the peculiar happiness of the countess of abingdon to have been so truly loved by you while she was living and so gratefully honoured after she was dead few there are who have either had or could have such a loss and yet fewer who carried their love and constancy beyond the grave the exteriors of mourning a decent funeral and black habits are the usual stints of common husbands and perhaps their wives deserve no better than to be mourned with hypocrisy and forgot with ease but you have distinguished yourself from ordinary lovers by a real and lasting grief for the deceased and by endeavouring to raise for her the most durable monument which is that of verse and so it would have proved if the workman had been equal to the work and your choice of the artificer as happy as your design yet as phidias when he had made the statue of minerva could not forbear to engrave his own name as author of the piece so give me leave to hope that by subscribing mine to this poem i may live by the goddess and transmit my name to posterity by the memory of hers it is no flattery to assure your lordship that she is remembered in the present age by all who have had the honour of her conversation and acquaintance and that i have never been in any company since the news of her death was first brought me where they have not extolled her virtues and even spoken the same things of her in prose which i have done in verse  i therefore think myself obliged to thank your lordship for the commission which you have given me how i have acquitted myself of it must be left to the opinion of the world in spite of any protestation which i can enter against the present age as incompetent or corrupt judges for my comfort they are but englishmen and as such if they think ill of me today they are inconstant enough to think well of me tomorrow and after all i have not much to thank my fortune that i was born amongst them the good of both sexes are so few in england that they stand like exceptions against general rules and though one of them has deserved a greater commendation than i could give her they have taken care that i should not tire my pen with frequent exercise on the like subjects that praises like taxes should be appropriated and left almost as individual as the person they say my talent is satire if it be so it is a fruitful age and there is an extraordinary crop to gather but a single hand is insufficient for such a harvest they have sown the dragons teeth themselves and it is but just they should reap each other in lampoons you my lord who have the character of honour though it is not my happiness to know you may stand aside with the small remainders of the english nobility truly such and unhurt yourselves behold the mad combat if i have pleased you and some few others i have obtained my end you see i have disabled myself like an elected speaker of the house yet like him i have undertaken the charge and find the burden sufficiently recompensed by the honour be pleased to accept of these my unworthy labours this papermonument and let her pious memory which i am sure is sacred to you not only plead the pardon of my many faults but gain me your protection which is ambitiously sought by my lord your

    tis much desired you judges of the town   would pass a vote to put all prologues down   for who can show me since they first were writ   they eer converted one hardhearted wit   yet the worlds mended well in former days   good prologues were as scarce as now good plays   for the reforming poets of our age   in this first charge spend their poetic rage   expect no more when once the prologues done   the wit is ended ere the plays begun                               0   you now have habits dances scenes and rhymes   high language often ay and sense sometimes   as for a clear contrivance doubt it now   they blow out candles to give light to the plot   and for surprise two bloodyminded men   fight till they die then rise and dance again   such deep intrigues youre welcome to this day   but blame yourselves not him who writ the play   though his plots dull as can be well desired   wit stiff as any you have eer admired                              0   hes bound to please not to write well and knows   there is a mode in plays as well as clothes   therefore kind judges     a second prologue enters      hold would you admit   for judges all you see within the pit      whom would he then except or on what score      all who like him have writ ill plays before   for they like thieves condemnd are hangmen made   to execute the members of their trade   all that are writing now he would disown   but then he must excepteven all the town   all choleric losing gamesters who in spite   will damn today because they lost last night   all servants whom their mistress scorn upbraids   all maudlin lovers and all slighted maids   all who are out of humour all severe   all that want wit or hope to find it here                                         ii  prologue to

tune expressing an alarm at which the boy awakes and speaks     boy wake wake quevira our soft rest must cease   and fly together with our countrys peace   no more must we sleep under plantain shade   which neither heat could pierce nor cold invade   where bounteous nature never feels decay   and opening buds drive falling fruits away    que why should men quarrel here where all possess   as much as they can hope for by success   none can have most where nature is so kind   as to exceed mans use though not his mind                         0    boy by ancient prophecies we have been told   our world shall be subdued by one more old   and see that world alreadys hither come    que if these be they we welcome then our doom   their loots are such that mercy flows from thence   more gentle than our native innocence    boy why should we then fear these our enemies   that rather seem to us like deities    que by their protection let us beg to live   they came not here to conquer but forgive                          0   if so your goodness may your power express   and we shall judge both best by our success                                           iii    epilogue to the indian queen    spoken by montezuma    you see what shifts we are enforced to try   to help out wit with some variety   shows may be found that never yet were seen   tis hard to find such wit as neer has been   you have seen all that this old world can do   we therefore try the fortune of the new   and hope it is below your aim to hit   at untaught nature with your practised wit   our naked indians then when wits appear   would as soon choose to have the spaniards here                     0   tis true you have marks enough the plot the show   the poets scenes nay more the painters too   if all this fail considering the cost   tis a true voyage to the indies lost   but if you smile on all then these designs   like the imperfect treasure of our minds   will pass for current wheresoeer they go   when to your bounteous hands their stamps they owe                                         iv  epilogue to the indian emperor  by a mercury     to all and singular in this full meeting   ladies and gallants phoebus sends ye greeting   to all his sons by whateer title known   whether of court or coffeehouse or town   from his most mighty sons whose confidence   is placed in lofty sound and humble sense   even to his little infants of the time   who write new songs and trust in tune and rhyme   be t known that phoebus being daily grieved   to see good plays condemnd and bad received                       0   ordains your judgment upon every cause   henceforth be limited by wholesome laws   he first thinks fit no sonnetteer advance   his censure farther than the song or dance   your wit burlesque may one step higher climb   and in his sphere may judge all doggrel rhyme   all proves and moves and loves and honours too   all that appears high sense and scarce is low   as for the coffee wits he says not much   their proper business is to damn the dutch                          0   for the great dons of wit   phoebus gives them full privilege alone   to damn all others and cry up their own   last for the ladies tis apollos will   they should have power to save but not to kill   for love and he long since have thought it fit   wit live by beauty beauty reign by wit                                         v  prologue to sir martin marrall     fools which each man meets in his dish each day   are yet the great regalios of a play   in which to poets you but just appear   to prize that highest which cost them so dear   fops in the town more easily will pass   one story makes a statutable ass   but such in plays must be much thicker sown   like yolks of eggs a dozen beat to one   observing poets all their walks invade   as men watch woodcocks gliding through a glade   and when they have enough for comedy   they stow their several bodies in a pie   the poets but the cook to fashion it   for gallants you yourselves have found the wit   to bid you welcome would your bounty wrong   none welcome those who bring their cheer along                                         vi  prologue to the tempest     as when a trees cut down the secret root   lives under ground and thence new branches shoot   so from old shakspeares honourd dust this day   springs up and buds a new reviving play   shakspeare who taught by none did first impart   to fletcher wit to labouring jonson art   he monarch like gave those his subjects law   and is that nature which they paint and draw   fletcher reachd that which on his heights did grow   while jonson crept and gatherd all below                          0   this did his love and this his mirth digest   one imitates him most the other best   if they have since outwrit all other men   tis with the drops which fell from shakspeares pen   the storm which vanishd on the neighbouring shore   was taught by shakspeares tempest first to roar   that innocence and beauty which did smile   in fletcher grew on this enchanted isle   but shakspeares magic could not copied be   within that circle none durst walk but he                           0   i must confess twas bold nor would you now   that liberty to vulgar wits allow   which works by magic supernatural things   but shakspeares power is sacred as a kings   those legends from old priesthood were received   and he then writ as people then believed   but if for shakspeare we your grace implore   we for our theatre shall want it more   who by our dearth of youths are forced to employ   one of our women to present a boy                                   0   and thats a transformation you will say   exceeding all the magic in the play   let none expect in the last act to find   her sex transformd from man to womankind   whateer she was before the play began   all you shall see of her is perfect man   or if your fancy will be further led   to find her womanit must be abed                                         vii  prologue to tyrannic love     selflove which never rightly understood   makes poets still conclude their plays are good   and malice in all critics reigns so high   that for small errors they whole plays decry   so that to see this fondness and that spite   youd think that none but madmen judge or write   therefore our poet as he thinks not fit   to impose upon

like lovers should be bold and dare   they spoil their business with an over care   and he who servilely creeps after sense   is safe but neer will reach an excellence   hence tis our poet in his

have enjoyed the patronage of your family from the time of your excellent grandfather to this present day i have dedicated the translation of the lives of plutarch to the first duke and have celebrated the memory of your heroic father though i am very short of the age of nestor yet i have lived to a third generation of your house and by your graces favour am admitted still to hold from you by the same tenure  i am not vain enough to boast that i have deserved the value of so illustrious a line but my fortune is the greater that for three descents they have been pleased to distinguish my poems from those of other men and have accordingly made me their peculiar care may it be permitted me to say that as your grandfather and father were cherished and adorned with honours by two successive monarchs so i have been esteemed and patronised by the grandfather the father and the son descended from one of the most ancient most conspicuous and most deserving families in europe  it is true that by delaying the payment of my last fine when it was due by your graces accession to the titles and patrimonies of your house i may seem in rigour of law to have made a forfeiture of my claim yet my heart has always been devoted to your service and since you have been graciously pleased by your permission of this address to accept the tender of my duty it is not yet too late to lay these poems at your feet  the world is sensible that you worthily succeed not only to the honours of your ancestors but also to their virtues the long chain of magnanimity courage easiness of access and desire of doing good even to the prejudice of your fortune is so far from being broken in your grace that the precious metal yet runs pure to the newest link of it which i will not call the last because i hope and pray it may descend to late posterity and your flourishing youth and that of your excellent duchess are happy omens of my wish it is observed by livy and by others that some of the noblest roman families retained a resemblance of their ancestry not only in their shapes and features but also in their manners their qualities and the distinguishing characters of their minds some lines were noted for a stern rigid virtue savage haughty parsimonious and unpopular others were more sweet and affable made of a more pliant paste humble courteous and obliging studious of doing charitable offices and diffusive of the goods which they enjoyed the last of these is the proper and indelible character of your graces family god almighty has endued you with a softness a beneficence an attractive behaviour winning on the hearts of others and so sensible of their misery that the wounds of fortune seem not inflicted on them but on yourself you are so ready to redress that you almost prevent their wishes and always exceed their expectations as if what was yours was not your own and not given you to possess but to bestow on wanting merit but this is a topic which i must cast in shades lest i offend your modesty which is so far from being ostentatious of the good you do that it blushes even to have it known and therefore i must leave you to the satisfaction and testimony of your own conscience which though it be a silent panegyric is yet the best  you are so easy of access that poplicola was not more whose doors were opened on the outside to save the people even the common civility of asking entrance where all were equally admittedwhere nothing that was reasonable was deniedwhere misfortune was a powerful recommendation and where i can scarce forbear saying that want itself was a powerful mediator and was next to merit  the history of peru assures us that their incas above all their titles esteemed that the highest which called them lovers of the poora name more glorious than the felix pius and augustus of the roman emperors which were epithets of flattery deserved by few of them and not running in a blood like the perpetual gentleness and inherent goodness of the ormond family  gold as it is the purest so it is the softest and most ductile of all metals iron which is the hardest gathers rust corrodes itself and is therefore subject to corruption it was never intended for coins and medals or to bear the faces and inscriptions of the great indeed it is fit for armour to bear off insults and preserve the wearer in the day of battle but the danger once repelled it is laid aside by the brave as a garment too rough for civil conversation a necessary guard in war but too harsh and cumbersome in peace and which keeps off the embraces of a more humane life  for this reason my lord though you have courage in an heroical degree yet i ascribe it to you but as your second attribute mercy beneficence and compassion claim precedence as they are first in the divine nature an intrepid courage which is inherent in your grace is at best but a holiday kind of virtue to be seldom exercised and never but in cases of necessity affability mildness tenderness and a word which i would fain bring back to its original signification of virtue i mean goodnature are of daily use they are the bread of mankind and staff of life neither sighs nor tears nor groans nor curses of the vanquished follow acts of compassion and of charity but a sincere pleasure and serenity of mind in him who performs an action of mercy which cannot suffer the misfortunes of another without redress lest they should bring a kind of contagion along with them and pollute the happiness which he enjoys  yet since the perverse tempers of mankind since oppression on one side and ambition on the other are sometimes the unavoidable occasions of war that courage that magnanimity and resolution which is born with you cannot be too much commended and here it grieves me that i am scanted in the pleasure of dwelling on many of your actions but greek aideomai troas is an expression which tully often uses when he would do what he dares not and fears the censure of the romans  i have sometimes been forced to amplify on others but here where the subject is so fruitful that the harvest overcomes the reaper i am shortened by my chain and can only see what is forbidden me to reach since it is not permitted me to commend you according to the extent of my wishes and much less is it in my power to make my commendations equal to your merits yet in this frugality of your praises there are some things which i cannot omit without detracting from your character you have so formed your own education as enables you to pay the debt you owe your country or more properly speaking both your countries because you were born i may almost say in purple at the castle of dublin when your grandfather was lordlieutenant and have since been bred in the court of england  if this address had been in verse i might have called you as claudian calls mercury numen commune gemino faciens commercia mundo the better to satisfy this double obligation you have early cultivated the genius you have to arms that when the service of britain or ireland shall require your courage and your conduct you may exert them both to the benefit of either country you began in the cabinet what you afterwards practised in the camp and thus both lucullas and cæsar to omit a crowd of shining romans formed themselves to war by the study of history and by the examples of the greatest captains both of greece and italy before their time i name those two commanders in particular because they were better read in chronicle than any of the roman leaders and that lucullus in particular having only the theory of war from books was thought fit without practice to be sent into the field against the most formidable enemy of rome tully indeed was called the learned consul in derision but then he was not born a soldierhis head was turned another way when he read the tactics he was thinking on the bar which was his field of battle the knowledge of warfare is thrown away on a general who dares not make use of what he knows i commend it only in a man of courage and resolution in him it will direct his martial spirit and teach him the way to the best victorieswhich are those which are least bloody and which though achieved by the hand are managed by the head science distinguishes a man of honour from one of those athletic brutes whom undeservedly we call heroes cursed be the poet who first honoured with that name a mere ajax a mankilling idiot the ulysses of ovid upbraids his ignorance that he understood not the shield for which he pleaded there was engraven on it plans of cities and maps of countries which ajax could not comprehend but looked on them as stupidly as his fellowbeast the lion but on the other side your grace has given yourself the education of his rival you have studied every spot of ground in flanders which for these ten years past has been the scene of battles and of sieges no wonder if you performed your part with such applause on a theatre which you understood so well  if i designed this for a poetical encomium it were easy to enlarge on so copious a subject but confining myself to the severity of truth and to what is becoming me to say i must not only pass over many instances of your military skill but also those of your assiduous diligence in the war and of your personal bravery attended with an ardent thirst of honoura long train of generosityprofuseness of doing gooda soul unsatisfied with all it has done and an unextinguished desire of doing more but all this is matter for your own historians i am as virgil says spatiis exclusus iniquis  yet not to be wholly silent of all your charities i must stay a little on one action which preferred the relief of others to the consideration of yourself when in the battle of landen your heat of courage a fault only pardonable to your youth had transported you so far before your friends that they were unable to follow much less to succour you when you were not only dangerously but in all appearance mortally wounded when in that desperate condition you were made prisoner and carried to namur at that time in possession of the french then it was my lord that you took a considerable part of what was remitted to you of your own revenues and as a memorable instance of your heroic charity put it into the bands of count guiscard who was governor of the place to be distributed among your fellowprisoners the french commander charmed with the greatness of your soul accordingly consigned it to the use for which it was intended by the donor by which means the lives of so many miserable men were saved and a comfortable provision made for their subsistence who had otherwise perished had not you been the companion of their misfortune or rather sent by providence like another joseph to keep out famine from invading those whom in humility you called your brethren how happy was it for those poor creatures that your grace was made their fellowsufferer and how glorious for you that you chose to want rather than not relieve the wants of others the heathen poet in commending the charity of dido to the trojans spoke like a christian non ignara mali miseris succurrere disco all men even those of a different interest and contrary principles must praise this action as the most eminent for piety not only in this degenerate age but almost in any of the former when men were made de meliore luto when examples of charity were frequent and when there were in being teucri pulcherrima proles magnanimi heroes nati melioribus annis no envy can detract from this it will shine in history and like swans grow whiter the longer it endures and the name of ormond will be more celebrated in his captivity than in his greatest triumphs  but all actions of your grace are of a piece as waters keep the tenor of their fountains your compassion is general and has the same effect as well on enemies as friends it is so much in your nature to do good that your life is but one continued act of placing benefits on many as the sun is always carrying his light to some part or other of the world and were it not that your reason guides you where to give i might almost say that you could not help bestowing more than is consisting with the fortune of a private man or with the will of any but an alexander  what wonder is it then that being born for a blessing to mankind your supposed death in that engagement was so generally lamented through the nation the concernment for it was as universal as the loss and though the gratitude might be counterfeit in some yet the tears of all were real where every man deplored his private part in that calamity and even those who had not tasted of your favours yet built so much on the fame of your beneficence that they bemoaned the loss of their expectations  this brought the untimely death of your great father into fresh remembrance as if the same decree had passed on two short successive generations of the virtuous and i repeated to myself the same verses which i had formerly applied to him ostendunt terris hunc tantùm fata nec ultrà esse sinunt but to the joy not only of all good men but of mankind in general the unhappy omen took not place you are still living to enjoy the blessings and applause of all the good you have performed the prayers of multitudes whom you have obliged for your long prosperity and that your power of doing generous and charitable actions may be as extended as your will which is by none more zealously desired than by your graces most humble most obliged and most obedient servant                                                      john dryden                                       preface   it is with a poet as with a man who designs to build and is very exact as he supposes in casting up the cost beforehand but generally speaking he is mistaken in his account and reckons short in the expense he first intended he alters his mind as the work proceeds and will have this or that convenience more of which he had not thought when he began so has it happened to me i have built a house where i intended but a lodge yet with better success than a certain nobleman who beginning with a dogkennel never lived to finish the palace he had contrived  from translating the first of homers iliads which i intended as an essay to the whole work i proceeded to the translation of the twelfth book of ovids metamorphoses because it contains among other things the causes the beginning and ending of the trojan war here i ought in reason to have stopped but the speeches of ajax and ulysses lying next in my way i could not baulk them when i had compassed them i was so taken with the former part of the fifteenth book which is the masterpiece of the whole metamorphoses that i enjoined myself the pleasing task of rendering it into english and now i found by the number of my verses that they began to swell into a little volume which gave me an occasion of looking backward on some beauties of my author in his former books there occurred to me the hunting of the boar cinyras and myrrha the goodnatured story of baucis and philemon with the rest which i hope i have translated closely enough and given them the same turn of verse which they had in the original and this i may say without vanity is not the talent of every poet he who has arrived the nearest to it is the ingenious and learned sandys the best versifier of the former age if i may properly call it by that name which was the former part of this concluding century for spenser and fairfax both flourished in the reign of queen elizabeth great masters in our language and who saw much farther into the beauties of our numbers than those who immediately followed them milton was the poetical son of spenser and mr waller of fairfax for we have our lineal descents and clans as well as other families spenser more than once insinuates that the soul of chaucer was transfused into his body and that he was begotten by him two hundred years after his decease milton has acknowledged to me that spenser was his original and many besides myself have heard our famous waller own that he derived the harmony of his numbers from the godfrey of bulloigne which was turned into english by mr fairfax but to return having done with ovid for this time it came into my mind that our old english poet chaucer in many things resembled him and that with no disadvantage on the side of the modern author as i shall endeavour to prove when i compare them and as i am and always have been studious to promote the honour of my native country so i soon resolved to put their merits to the trial by turning some of the canterbury tales into our language as it is now refined for by this means both the poets being set in the same light and dressed in the same english habit story to be compared with story a certain judgment may be made betwixt them by the reader without obtruding my opinion on him or if i seem partial to my countryman and predecessor in the laurel the friends of antiquity are not few and besides many of the learned ovid has almost all the beaux and the whole fair sex his declared patrons perhaps i have assumed somewhat more to myself than they allow me because i have adventured to sum up the evidence but the readers are the jury and their privilege remains entire to decide according to the merits of the cause or if they please to bring it to another hearing before some other court in the meantime to follow the thread of my discourse as thoughts according to mr hobbs have always some connexion so from chaucer i was led to think on boccace who was not only his contemporary but also pursued the same studies wrote novels in prose and many works in verse particularly is said to have invented the octave rhyme or stanza of eight lines which ever since has been maintained by the practice of all italian writers who are or at least assume the title of heroic poets he and chaucer among other things had this in common that they refined their mother tongues but with this difference that dante had begun to file their language at least in verse before the time of boccace who likewise received no little help from his master petrarch but the reformation of their prose was wholly owing to boccace himself who is yet the standard of purity in the italian tongue though many of his phrases are become obsolete as in process of time it must needs happen chaucer as you have formerly been told by our learned mr rymer first adorned and amplified our barren tongue from the provençal which was then the most polished of all the modern languages but this subject has been copiously treated by that great critic who deserves no little commendation from us his countrymen for these reasons of time and resemblance of genius in chaucer and boccace i resolved to join them in my present work to which i have added some original papers of my own which whether they are equal or inferior to my other poems an author is the most improper judge and therefore i leave them wholly to the mercy of the reader i will hope the best that they will not be condemned but if they should i have the excuse of an old gentleman who mounting on horseback before some ladies when i was present got up somewhat heavily but desired of the fair spectators that they would count fourscore and eight before they judged him by the mercy of god i am already come within twenty years of his number a cripple in my limbs but what decays are in my mind the reader must determine i think myself as vigorous as ever in the faculties of my soul excepting only my memory which is not impaired to any great degree and if i lose not more of it i have no great reason to complain what judgment i had increases rather than diminishes and thoughts such as they are come crowding in so fast upon me that my only difficulty is to choose or to reject to run them into verse or to give them the other harmony of prose i have so long studied and practised both that they are grown into a habit and become familiar to me in short though i may lawfully plead some part of the old gentlemans excuse yet i will reserve it till i think i have greater need and ask no grains of allowance for the faults of this my present work but those which are given of course to human frailty i will not trouble my reader with the shortness of time in which i writ it or the several intervals of sickness they who think too well of their own performances are apt to boast in their prefaces how little time their works have cost them and what other business of more importance interfered but the reader will be as apt to ask the question why they allowed not a longer time to make their works more perfect and why they had so despicable an opinion of their judges as to thrust their indigested stuff upon them as if they deserved no better  with this account of my present undertaking i conclude the first part of this discourse in the second part as at a second sitting though i alter not the draught i must touch the same features over again and change the dead colouring of the whole in general i will only say that i have written nothing which savours of immorality or profaneness at least i am not conscious to myself of any such intention if there happen to be found an irreverent expression or a thought too wanton they are crept into my verses through my inadvertency if the searchers find any in the cargo let them be staved or forfeited like contraband goods at least let their authors be answerable for them as being but imported merchandise and not of my own manufacture on the other side i have endeavoured to choose such fables both ancient and modern as contain in each of them some instructive moral which i could prove by induction but the way is tedious and they leap foremost into sight without the readers trouble of looking after them i wish i could affirm with a safe conscience that i had taken the same care in all my former writings for it must be owned that supposing verses are never so beautiful or pleasing yet if they contain anything which shocks religion or good manners they are at best what horace says of good numbers without good sense versus inopes rerum nugaeque canorae thus far i hope i am right in court without renouncing my other right of selfdefence where i have been wrongfully accused and my sense withdrawn into blasphemy or bawdry as it has often been by a religious lawyer in a late pleading against the stage in which he mixes truth with falsehood and has not forgotten the old rule of calumniating strongly that something may remain  i resume the thread of my discourse with the first of my translation which was the first iliad of homer if it shall please god to give me longer life and moderate health my intentions are to translate the whole ilias provided still that i meet with those encouragements from the public which may enable me to proceed in my undertaking with some cheerfulness and this i dare assure the world beforehand that i have found by trial homer a more pleasing task than virgil though i say not the translation will be less laborious for the grecian is more according to my genius than the latin poet in the works of the two authors we may read their manners and natural inclinations which are wholly different virgil was of a quiet sedate temper homer was violent impetuous and full of fire the chief talent of virgil was propriety of thoughts and ornament of words homer was rapid in his thoughts and took all the liberties both of numbers and of expressions which his language and the age in which he lived allowed him homers invention was more copious virgils more confined so that if homer had not led the way it was not in virgil to have begun heroic poetry for nothing can be more evident than that the roman poem is but the second part of the ilias a continuation of the same story and the persons already formed the manners of æneas are those of hector superadded to those which homer gave him the adventures of ulysses in the odysseis are imitated in the first six books of virgils æneas and though the accidents are not the same which would have argued him of a servile copying and total barrenness of invention yet the seas were the same in which both the heroes wandered and dido cannot be denied to be the poetical daughter of calypso the six latter books of virgils poem are the four and twenty iliads contracted a quarrel occasioned by a lady a single combat battles fought and a town besieged i say not this in derogation to virgil neither do i contradict anything which i have formerly said in his just praise for his episodes are almost wholly of his own invention and the form which he has given to the telling makes the tale his own even though the original story had been the same but this proves however that homer taught virgil to design and if invention be the first virtue of an epic poet then the latin poem can only be allowed the second place mr hobbs in the preface to his own bald translation of the ilias studying poetry as he did mathematics when it was too late mr hobbs i say begins the praise of homer where he should have ended it he tells us that the first beauty of an epic poem consists in diction that is in the choice of words and harmony of numbers now the words are the colouring of the work which in the order of nature is last to be considered the design the disposition the manners and the thoughts are all before it where any of those are wanting or imperfect so much wants or is imperfect in the imitation of human life which is in the very definition of a poem words indeed like glaring colours are the first beauties that arise and strike the sight but if the draught be false or lame the figures illdisposed the manners obscure or inconsistent or the thoughts unnatural then the finest colours are but daubing and the piece is a beautiful monster at the best neither virgil nor homer were deficient in any of the former beauties but in this last which is expression the roman poet is at least equal to the grecian as i have said elsewhere supplying the poverty of his language by his musical ear and by his diligence but to return our two great poets being so different in their tempers one choleric and sanguine the other phlegmatic and melancholic that which makes them excel in their several ways is that each of them has followed his own natural inclination as well in forming the design as in the execution of it the very heroes show their authors achilles is hot impatient revengefulimpiger iracundus inexorabilis acer c æneas patient considerate careful of his people and merciful to his enemies ever submissive to the will of heavenquò fata trahunt retrahuntque sequamur i could please myself with enlarging on this subject but am forced to defer it to a fitter time from all i have said i will only draw this inference that the action of homer being more full of vigour than that of virgil according to the temper of the writer is of consequence more pleasing to the reader one warms you by degrees the other sets you on fire all at once and never intermits his heat tis the same difference which longinus makes betwixt the effects of eloquence in demosthenes and tullyone persuades the other commands you never cool while you read homer even not in the second book a graceful flattery to his countrymen but he hastens from the ships and concludes not that book till he has made you an amends by the violent playing of a new machine from thence he hurries on his action with variety of events and ends it in less compass than two months this vehemence of his i confess is more suitable to my temper and therefore i have translated his first book with greater pleasure than any part of virgil but it was not a pleasure without pains the continual agitations of the spirits must needs be a weakening of any constitution especially in age and many pauses are required for refreshment betwixt the heats the iliad of itself being a third part longer than all virgils works together  this is what i thought needful in this place to say of homer i proceed to ovid and chaucer considering the former only in relation to the latter with ovid ended the golden age of the roman tongue from chaucer the purity of the english tongue began the manners of the poets were not unlike both of them were wellbred wellnatured amorous and libertine at least in their writingsit may be also in their lives their studies were the samephilosophy and philology both of them were known in astronomy of which ovids books of the roman feasts and chaucers treatise of the astrolabe are sufficient witnesses but chaucer was likewise an astrologer as were virgil horace persius and manilius both writ with wonderful facility and clearness neither were great inventors for ovid only copied the grecian fables and most of chaucers stories were taken from his italian contemporaries or their predecessors boccaces decameron was first published and from thence our englishman has borrowed many of his canterbury tales yet that of palamon and arcite was written in all probability by some italian wit in a former age as i shall prove hereafter the tale of grizzild was the invention of petrarch by him sent to boccace from whom it came to chaucer troilus and cressida was also written by a lombard author but much amplified by our english translator as well as beautified the genius of our countrymen in general being rather to improve an invention than to invent themselves as is evident not only in our poetry but in many of our manufactures i find i have anticipated already and taken up from boccace before i come to him but there is so much less behind and i am of the temper of most kings who love to be in debt are all for present money no matter how they pay it afterwards besides the nature of a preface is rambling never wholly out of the way nor in it this i have learned from the practice of honest montaign and return at my pleasure to ovid and chaucer of whom i have little more to say both of them built on the inventions of other men yet since chancer had something of his own as the wife of baths tale the cock and the fox which i have translated and some others i may justly give our countryman the precedence in that part since i can remember nothing of ovid which was wholly his both of them understood the manners under which name i comprehend the passions and in a larger sense the descriptions of persons and their very habits for an example i see baucis and philemon as perfectly before me as if some ancient painter had drawn them and all the pilgrims in the canterbury tales their humours their features and the very dress as distinctly as if i had supped with them at the tabard in southwark yet even there too the figures in chaucer are much more lively and set in a better light which though i have not time to prove yet i appeal to the reader and am sure he will clear me from partiality the thoughts and words remain to be considered in the comparison of the two poets and i have saved myself one half of that labour by owning that ovid lived when the roman tongue was in its meridian chaucer in the dawning of our language therefore that part of the comparison stands not on an equal foot any more than the diction of ennius and ovid or of chaucer and our present english the words are given up as a post not to be defended in our poet because he wanted the modern art of fortifying the thoughts remain to be considered and they are to be measured only by their propriety that is as they flow more or less naturally from the persons described on such and such occasions the vulgar judges which are nine parts in ten of all nations who call conceits and jingles wit who see ovid full of them and chaucer altogether without them will think me little less than mad for preferring the englishman to the roman yet with their leave i must presume to say that the things they admire are only glittering trifles and so far from being witty that in a serious poem they are nauseous because they are unnatural would any man who is ready to die for love describe his passion like narcissus would he think of inopem me copia fecit and a dozen more of such expressions poured on the neck of one another and signifying all the same thing if this were wit was this a time to be witty when the poor wretch was in the agony of death this is just john littlewit in bartholomew fair who had a conceit as he tells you left him in his misery a miserable conceit on these occasions the poet should endeavour to raise pity but instead of this ovid is tickling you to laugh virgil never made use of such machines when he was moving you to commiserate the death of dido he would not destroy what he was building chaucer makes arcite violent in his love and unjust in the pursuit of it yet when he came to die he made him think more reasonably he repents not of his love for that had altered his character but acknowledges the injustice of his proceedings and resigns emilia to palamon what would ovid have done on this occasion he would certainly have made arcite witty on his deathbed he had complained he was farther off from possession by being so near and a thousand such boyisms which chaucer rejected as below the dignity of the subject they who think otherwise would by the same reason prefer lucan and ovid to homer and virgil and martial to all four of them as for the turn of words in which ovid particularly excels all poets they are sometimes a fault and sometimes a beauty as they are used properly or improperly but in strong passions always to be shunned because passions are serious and will admit no playing the french have a high value for them and i confess they are often what they call delicate when they are introduced with judgment but chaucer writ with more simplicity and followed nature more closely than to use them i have thus far to the best of my knowledge been an upright judge betwixt the parties in competition not meddling with the design nor the disposition of it because the design was not their own and in the disposing of it they were eqaal it remains that i say somewhat of chaucer in particular  in the first place as he is the father of english poetry so i hold him in the same degree of veneration as the grecians held homer or the romans virgil he is a perpetual fountain of good sense learned in all sciences and therefore speaks properly on all subjects as he knew what to say so he knows also when to leave offa continence which is practised by few writers and scarcely by any of the ancients excepting virgil and horace one of our late great poets is sunk in his reputation because he could never forgive any conceit which came in his way but swept like a dragnet great and small there was plenty enough but the dishes were illsorted whole pyramids of sweetmeats for boys and women but little of solid meat for men all this proceeded not from any want of knowledge but of judgment neither did he want that in discerning the beauties and faults of other poets but only indulged himself in the luxury of writing and perhaps knew it was a fault but hoped the reader would not find it for this reason though he must always be thought a great poet he is no longer esteemed a good writer and for ten impressions which his works have had in so many successive years yet at present a hundred books are scarcely purchased once a twelvemonth for as my last lord rochester said though somewhat profanely not being of god he could not stand  chaucer followed nature everywhere but was never so bold to go beyond her and there is a great difference of being poeta and nimis poeta if we believe catullus as much as betwixt a modest behaviour and affectation the verse of chaucer i confess is not harmonious to us but it is like the eloquence of one whom tacitus commends it was auribus istius temporis accommodata they who lived with him and some time after him thought it musical and it continues so even in our judgment if compared with the numbers of lidgate and gower his contemporaries there is the rude sweetness of a scotch tune in it which is natural and pleasing though not perfect it is true i cannot go so far as he who published the last edition of him for he would make us believe the fault is in our ears and that there were really ten syllables in a verse where we find but nine but this opinion is not worth confuting it is so gross and obvious an error that common sense which is a rule in every thing but matters of faith and revelation must convince the reader that equality of numbers in every verse which we call heroic was either not known or not always practised in chaucers age it were an easy matter to produce some thousands of his verses which are lame for want of half a foot and sometimes a whole one and which no pronunciation can make otherwise we can only say that he lived in the infancy of our poetry and that nothing is brought to perfection at the first we must be children before we grow men there was an ennius and in process of time a lucilius and a lucretius before virgil and horace even after chaucer there was a spenser a harrington a fairfax before waller and denham were in being and our numbers were in their nonage till these last appeared i need say little of his parentage life and fortunes they are to be found at large in all the editions of his works he was employed abroad and favoured by edward the third richard the second and henry the fourth and was poet as i suppose to all three of them in richards time i doubt he was a little dipt in the rebellion of the commons and being brotherinlaw to john of gaunt it was no wonder if he followed the fortunes of that family and was well with henry the fourth when he had deposed his predecessor neither is it to be admired that henry who was a wise as well as a valiant prince who claimed by succession and was sensible that his title was not sound but was rightfully in mortimer who had married the heir of york it was not to be admired i say if that great politician should be pleased to have the greatest wit of those times in his interests and to be the trumpet of his praises augustus had given him the example by the advice of maecenas who recommended virgil and horace to him whose praises helped to make him popular while he was alive and after his death have made him precious to posterity as for the religion of our poet he seems to have some little bias towards the opinions of wickliff after john of gaunt his patron somewhat of which appears in the tale of piers plowman yet i cannot blame him for inveighing so sharply against the vices of the clergy in his age their pride their ambition their pomp their avarice their worldly interest deserved the lashes which he gave them both in that and in most of his canterbury tales neither has his contemporary boccace spared them yet both those poets lived in much esteem with good and holy men in orders for the scandal which is given by particular priests reflects not on the sacred function chaucers monk his chanon and his fryer took not from the character of his good parson a satirical poet is the check of the laymen on bad priests we are only to take care that we involve not the innocent with the guilty in the same condemnation the good cannot be too much honoured nor the bad too coarsely used for the corruption of the best becomes the worst when a clergyman is whipped his gown is first taken off by which the dignity of his order is secured if he be wrongfully accused he has his action of slander and it is at the poets peril if he transgress the law but they will tell us that all kind of satire though never so well deserved by particular priests yet brings the whole order into contempt is then the peerage of england anything dishonoured when a peer suffers for his treason if he be libelled or any way defamed he has his scandalum magnatum to punish the offender they who use this kind of argument seem to be conscious to themselves of somewhat which has deserved the poets lash and are less concerned for their public capacity than for their private at least there is pride at the bottom of their reasoning if the faults of men in orders are only to be judged among themselves they are all in some sort parties for since they say the honour of their order is concerned in every member of it how can we be sure that they will be impartial judges how far i may be allowed to speak my opinion in this case i know not but i am sure a dispute of this nature caused mischief in abundance betwixt a king of england and an archbishop of canterbury one standing up for the laws of his land and the other for the honour as he called it of gods church which ended in the murder of the prelate and in the whipping of his majesty from post to pillar for his penance the learned and ingenious dr drake has saved me the labour of inquiring into the esteem and reverence which the priests have had of old and i would rather extend than diminish any part of it yet i must needs say that when a priest provokes me without any occasion given him i have no reason unless it be the charity of a christian to forgive him prior laesit is justification sufficient in the civil law if i answer him in his own language selfdefence i am sure must be allowed me and if i carry it farther even to a sharp recrimination somewhat may be indulged to human frailty yet my resentment has not wrought as far but that i have followed chaucer in his character of a holy man and have enlarged on that subject with some pleasure reserving to myself the right if i shall think fit hereafter to describe another sort of priests such as are more easily to be found than the good parson such as have given the last blow to christianity in this age by a practice so contrary to their doctrine but this will keep cold till another time in the mean while i take up chaucer where i left him he must have been a man of a most wonderful comprehensive nature because as it has been truly observed of him he has taken into the compass of his canterbury tales the various manners and humours as we now call them of the whole english nation in his age not a single character has escaped him all his pilgrims are severally distinguished from each other and not only in their inclinations but in their very physiognomies and persons baptista porta could not have described their natures better than by the marks which the poet gives them the matter and manner of their tales and of their telling are so suited to their different edncations humours and callings that each of them would be improper in any other mouth even the grave and serious characters are distinguished by their several sorts of gravity their discourses are such as belong to their age their calling and their breeding such as are becoming of them and of them only some of his persons are vicious and some virtuous some are unlearned or as chaucer calls them lewd and some are learned even the ribaldry of the low characters is different the reeve the miller and the cook are several men and distinguished from each other as much as the mincing lady prioress and the broadspeaking gaptoothed wife of bath but enough of this there is such a variety of game springing up before me that i am distracted in my choice and know not which to follow tis sufficient to say according to the proverb that here is gods plenty we have our forefathers and greatgranddames all before us as they were in chaucers days their general characters are still remaining in mankind and even in england though they are called by other names than those of monks and friars and chanons and lady abbesses and nuns for mankind is ever the same and nothing lost out of nature though every thing is altered may i have leave to do myself the justice since my enemies will do me none and are so far from granting me to be a good poet that they will not allow me so much as to be a christian or a moral man may i have leave i say to inform my reader that i have confined my choice to such tales of chaucer as savour nothing of immodesty if i had desired more to please than to instruct the reeve the miller the shipman the merchants the sumner and above all the wife of bath in the prologue to her tale would have procured me as many friends and readers as there are beaux and ladies of pleasure in the town but i will no more offend against good manners i am sensible as i ought to be of the scandal i have given by my loose writings and make what reparation i am able by this public acknowledgment if any thing of this nature or of profaneness be crept into these poems i am so far from defending it that i disown it totum hoc indicium volo chaucer makes another manner of apology for his broadspeaking and boccace makes the like but i will follow neither of them our countryman in the end of his characters before the canterbury tales thus excuses the ribaldry which is very gross in many of his novels    but first i pray you of your courtesy   that ye ne arrettee it nought my villainy   though that i plainly speak in this mattere   to tellen you her words and eke her chere   ne though i speak her words properly   for this ye knowen as well as i   who shall tellen a tale after a man   he mote rehearse as nye as ever he can   everich word of it been in his charge   all speke he never so rudely ne large   or else he mote tellen his tale untrue   or feine things or find words new   he may not spare although he were his brother   he mote as well say o word as another   christ spake himself full broad in holy writ   and well i wote no villainy is it   eke plato saith who so can him rede   the words mote been cousin to the dede  yet if a man should have inquired of boccace or of chaucer what need they had of introducing such characters where obscene words were proper in their mouths but very indecent to be heardi know not what answer they could have made for that reason such tale shall be left untold by me you have here a specimen of chaucers language which is so obsolete that his sense is scarce to be understood and you have likewise more than one example of his unequal numbers which were mentioned before yet many of his verses consist of ten syllables and the words not much behind our present english as for example these two lines in the description of the carpenters young wife    wincing she was as is a jolly colt   long as a mast and upright as a bolt  i have almost done with chaucer when i have answered some objections relating to my present work i find some people are offended that i have turned these tales into modern english because they think them unworthy of my pains and look on chaucer as a dry oldfashioned wit not worth reviving i have often heard the late earl of leicester say that mr cowley himself was of that opinion who having read him over at my lords request declared he had no taste of him i dare not advance my opinion against the judgment of so great an author but i think it fair however to leave the decision to the public mr cowley was too modest to set up for a dictator and being shocked perhaps with his old style never examined into the depth of his good sense chaucer i confess is a rough diamond and must first be polished ere he shines i deny not likewise that living in our early days of poetry he writes not always of a piece but sometimes mingles trivial things with those of greater moment sometimes also though not often he runs riot like ovid and knows not when he has said enough but there are more great wits besides chaucer whose fault is their excess of conceits and those ill sorted an author is not to write all he can but only all he ought having observed this redundancy in chaucer as it is an easy matter for a man of ordinary parts to find a fault in one of greater i have not tied myself to a literal translation but have often omitted what i judged unnecessary or not of dignity enough to appear in the company of better thoughts i have presumed farther in some places and added somewhat of my own where i thought my author was deficient and had not given his thoughts their true lustre for want of words in the beginning of our language and to this i was the more emboldened because if i may be permitted to say it of myself i found i had a soul congenial to his and that i had been conversant in the same studies another poet in another age may take the same liberty with my writings if at least they live long enough to deserve correction it was also necessary sometimes to restore the sense of chaucer which was lost or mangled in the errors of the press let this example suffice at present in the story of palamon and arcite where the temple of diana is described you find these verses in all the editions of our author    there saw i danè turned into a tree   i mean not the goddess diane   but venus daughter which that hight danè  which after a little consideration i knew was to be reformed into this sense that daphne the daughter of peneus was turned into a tree i durst not make thus bold with ovid lest some future milbourn should arise and say i varied from my author because i understood him not  but there are other judges who think i ought not to have translated chaucer into english out of a quite contrary notion they suppose there is a certain veneration due to his old language and that it is little less than profanation and sacrilege to alter it they are farther of opinion that somewhat of his good sense will suffer in this transfusion and much of the beauty of his thoughts will infallibly be lost which appear with more grace in their old habit of this opinion was that excellent person whom i mentioned the late earl of leicester who valued chaucer as much as mr cowley despised him my lord dissuaded me from this attempt for i was thinking of it some years before his death and his authority prevailed so far with me as to defer my undertaking while he lived in deference to him yet my reason was not convinced with what he urged against it if the first end of a writer be to be understood then as his language grows obsolete his thoughts must grow obscure multa renascentur quæ nunc cecidere cadentque quæ nunc sunt in honore vocabula si volet usus quem penes arbitrium est et jus et norma loquendi when an ancient word for its sound and significancy deserves to be revived i have that reasonable veneration for antiquity to restore it all beyond this is superstition words are not like landmarks so sacred as never to be removed customs are changed and even statutes are silently repealed when the reason ceases for which they were enacted as for the other part of the argument that his thoughts will lose their original beauty by the innovation of words in the first place not only their beauty but their being is lost where they are no longer understood which is the present case i grant that something must be lost in all transfusion that is in all translations but the sense will remain which would otherwise be lost or at least be maimed when it is scarce intelligible and that but to a few how few are there who can read chaucer so as to understand him perfectly and if imperfectly then with less profit and no pleasure tis not for the use of some old saxon friends that i have taken these pains with him let them neglect my version because they have no need of it i made it for their sakes who understand sense and poetry as well as they when that poetry and sense is put into words which they understand i will go further and dare to add that what beauties i lose in some places i give to others which had them not originally but in this i may be partial to myself let the reader judge and i submit to his decision yet i think i have just occasion to complain of them who because they understand chaucer would deprive the greater part of their countrymen of the same advantage and hoard him up as misers do their grandam gold only to look on it themselves and hinder others from making use of it in sum i seriously protest that no man ever had or can have a greater veneration for chaucer than myself i have translated some part of his works only that i might perpetuate his memory or at least refresh it amongst my countrymen if i have altered him anywhere for the better i must at the same time acknowledge that i could have done nothing without him facile est inventis addere is no great commendation and i am not so vain to think i have deserved a greater i will conclude what i have to say of him singly with this one remark a lady of my acquaintance who keeps a kind of correspondence with some authors of the fair sex in france has been informed by them that mademoiselle de scudery who is as old as sibyl and inspired like her by the same god of poetry is at this time translating chaucer into modern french from which i gather that he has been formerly translated into the old provençal for how she should come to understand old english i know not but the matter of fact being true it makes me think that there is something in it like fatality that after certain periods of time the fame and memory of great wits should be renewed as chaucer is both in france and england if this be wholly chance tis extraordinary and i dare not call it more for fear of being taxed with superstition  boccace comes last to be considered who living in the same age with chaucer had the same genius and followed the same studies both writ novels and each of them cultivated his mother tongue but the greatest resemblance of our two modern authors being in their familiar style and pleasing way of relating comical adventures i may pass it over because i have translated nothing from boccace of that nature in the serious part of poetry the advantage is wholly on chaucers side for though the englishman has borrowed many tales from the italian yet it appears that those of boccace were not generally of his own making but taken from authors of former ages and by him only modelled so that what there was of invention in either of them may be judged equal but chaucer has refined on boccace and has mended the stories which he has borrowed in his way of telling though prose allows more liberty of thought and the expression is more easy when unconfined by numbers our countryman carries weight and yet wins the race at disadvantage i desire not the reader should take my word and therefore i will set two of their discourses on the same subject in the same light for every man to judge betwixt them i translated chaucer first and amongst the rest pitched on the wife of baths tale not daring as i have said to adventure on her prologue because it is too licentious there chaucer introduces an old woman of mean parentage whom a youthful knight of noble blood was forced to marry and consequently loathed her the crone being in bed with him on the wedding night and finding his aversion endeavours to win his affection by reason and speaks a good word for herself as who could blame her in hope to mollify the sullen bridegroom she takes her topics from the benefits of poverty the advantages of old age and ugliness the vanity of youth and the silly pride of ancestry and titles without inherent virtue which is the true nobility when i had closed chaucer i returned to ovid and translated some more of his fables and by this time had so far forgotten the wife of baths tale that when i took up boccace unawares i fell on the same argument of preferring virtue to nobility of blood and titles in the story of sigismunda which i had certainly avoided for the resemblance of the two discourses if my memory had not failed me let the reader weigh them both and if he thinks me partial to chaucer it is in him to right boccace  i prefer in our countryman far above all his other stories the noble poem of palamon and arcite which is of the epic kind and perhaps not much inferior to the ilias or the æneis the story is more pleasing than either of them the manners as perfect the diction as poetical the learning as deep and various and the disposition full as artfulonly it includes a greater length of time as taking up seven years at least but aristotle has left undecided the duration of the action which yet is easily reduced into the compass of a year by a narration of what preceded the return of palamon to athens i had thought for the honour of our nation and more particularly for his whose laurel though unworthy i have worn after him that this story was of english growth and chaucers own but i was undeceived by boccace for casually looking on the end of his seventh giornata i found dioneo under which name he shadows himself and fiametta who represents his mistress the natural daughter of robert king of naples of whom these words are spoken dioneo e la fiametta granpezza contarono insieme darcita e di palamone by which it appears that this story was written before the time of boccace but the name of its author being wholly lost chaucer is now become an original and i question not but the poem has received many beauties by passing through his noble hands besides this tale there is another of his own invention after the manner of the provençals called the flower and the leaf with which i was so particularly pleased both for the invention and the moral that i cannot hinder myself from recommending it to the reader  as a corollary to this preface in which i have done justice to others i owe somewhat to myself not that i think it worth my time to enter the lists with one milbourn and one blackmore but barely to take notice that such men there are who have written scurrilously against me without any provocation milbourn who is in orders pretends amongst the rest this quarrel to me that i have fallen foul on priesthood if i have i am only to ask pardon of good priests and am afraid his part of the reparation will come to little let him be satisfied that he shall not be able to force himself upon me for an adversary i contemn him too much to enter into competition with him his own translations of virgil have answered his criticisms on mine if as they say he has declared in print he prefers the version of ogilby to mine the world has made him the same compliment for it is agreed on all hands that he writes even below ogilby that you will say is not easily to be done but what cannot milbourn bring about i am satisfied however that while he and i live together i shall not be thought the worst poet of the age it looks as if i had desired him underhand to write so ill against me but upon my honest word i have not bribed him to do me this service and am wholly guiltless of his pamphlet tis true i should be glad if i could persuade him to continue his good offices and write such another critique on any thing of mine for i find by experience he has a great stroke with the reader when he condemns any of my poems to make the world have a better opinion of them he has taken some pains with my poetry but nobody will be persuaded to take the same with his if i had taken to the church as he affirms but which was never in my thoughts i should have had more sense if not more grace than to have turned myself out of my benefice by writing libels on my parishioners but his account of my manners and my principles are of a piece with his cavils and his poetry and so i have done with him for ever  as for the city bard or knight physician i hear his quarrel to me is that i was the author of absalom and achitophel which he thinks is a little hard on his fanatic patrons in london  but i will deal the more civilly with his two poems because nothing ill is to be spoken of the dead and therefore peace be to the manes of his arthurs i will only say that it was not for this noble knight that i drew the plan of an epic poem on king arthur in my preface to the translation of juvenal the guardian angels of kingdoms were machines too ponderous for him to manage and therefore he rejected them as dares did the whirlbats of eryx when they were thrown before him by entellus yet from that preface he plainly took his hint for he began immediately upon the story though he had the baseness not to acknowledge his benefactor but instead of it to traduce me in a libel  i shall say the less of mr collier because in many things he has taxed me justly and i have pleaded guilty to all thoughts and expressions of mine which can be truly argued of obscenity profaneness or immorality and retract them if he be my enemy let him triumph if he be my friend as i have given him no personal occasion to be otherwise he will be glad of my repentance it becomes me not to draw my pen in the defence of a bad cause when i have so often drawn it for a good one yet it were not difficult to prove that in many places he has perverted my meaning by his glosses and interpreted my words into blasphemy and bawdry of which they were not guilty besides that he is too much given to horseplay in his raillery and comes to battle like a dictator from the plough i will not say the zeal of gods house has eaten him up but i am sure it has devoured some part of his goodmanners and civility it might also be doubted whether it were altogether zeal which prompted him to this rough manner of proceeding perhaps it became not one of his function to rake into the rubbish of ancient and modern plays a divine might have employed his pains to better purpose than in the nastiness of plautus and aristophanes whose examples as they excuse not me so it might be possibly supposed that he read them not without some pleasure they who have written commentaries on those poets or on horace juvenal and martial have explained some vices which without their interpretation had been unknown to modern times neither has he judged impartially betwixt the former age and us  there is more bawdry in one play of fletchers called the custom of the country than in all ours together yet this has been often acted on the stage in my remembrance are the times so much more reformed now than they were fiveandtwenty years ago if they are i congratulate the amendment of our morals but i am not to prejudice the cause of my fellowpoets though i abandon my own defence they have some of them answered for themselves and neither they nor i can think mr collier so formidable an enemy that we should shun him he has lost ground at the latter end of the day by pursuing his point too far like the prince of conde at the battle of senneffe from immoral plays to no plays ab abusu ad usum non valet consequentia but being a party i am not to erect myself into a judge as for the rest of those who have written against me they are such scoundrels that they deserve not the least notice to be taken of them blackmore and milbourn are only distinguished from the crowd by being remembered to their infamy   demetri teque tigelli   discipulorum inter jubeo plorare cathedras                                         to her grace the duchess of ormond    with the following poem of palamon and arcite     madam    the bard who first adornd our native tongue   tuned

and of arms as well      vouchsafe illustrious ormond to behold   what power the charms of beauty had of old   nor wonder if such deeds of arms were done   inspired by two fair eyes that sparkled like your own               0      if chaucer by the best idea wrought   and poets can divine each others thought   the fairest nymph before his eyes he set   and then the fairest was plantagenet   who three contending princes made her prize   and ruled the rival nations with her eyes   who left immortal trophies of her fame   and to the noblest order gave the name      like her of equal kindred to the throne   you keep her conquests and extend your own                         0   as when the stars in their ethereal race   at length have rolld around the liquid space   at certain periods they resume their place   from the same point of heaven their course advance   and move in measures of their former dance   thus after length of ages she returns   restored in you and the same place adorns

been the baiting of a bull   twas at a feast and every inn so full   that no void room in chamber or on ground   and but one sorry bed was to be found   and that so little it would hold but one   though till this hour they never lay alone                          0   so were they forced to part one staid behind   his fellow sought what lodging he could find   at last he found a stall where oxen stood   and that he rather chose than lie abroad   twas in a farther yard without a door   but for his ease well litterd was the floor   his fellow who the narrow bed had kept   was weary and without a rocker slept   supine he snored but in the dead of night   he dreamd his friend appeard before his sight                     0   who with a ghastly look and doleful cry   said help me brother or this night i die   arise and help before all help be vain   or in an oxs stall i shall be slain   roused from his rest he wakend in a start   shivering with horror and with aching heart   at length to cure himself by reason tries   tis but a dream and what are dreams but lies   so thinking changed his side and closed his eyes   his dream returns his friend appears again                         0   the murderers come now help or i am slain   twas but a vision still and visions are but vain   he dreamd the third but now his friend appeard   pale naked pierced with wounds with blood besmeard   thrice warnd awake said he relief is late   the deed is done but thou revenge my fate   tardy of aid unseal thy heavy eyes   awake and with the dawning day arise   take to the western gate thy ready way   for by that passage they my corpse convey                           0   my corpse is in a tumbril laid among   the filth and ordure and enclosed with dung   that cart arrest and raise a common cry   for sacred hunger of my gold i die   then showd his grisly wound and last he drew   a piteous sigh and took a long adieu      the frighted friend arose by break of day   and found the stall where late his fellow lay   then of his impious host inquiring more   was answerd that his guest was gone before                         0   muttering he went said he by morning light   and much complaind of his ill rest by night   this raised suspicion in the pilgrims mind   because all hosts are of an evil kind   and oft to share the spoils with robbers joind      his dream confirmd his thought with troubled look   straight to the western gate his way he took   there as his dream foretold a cart he found   that carried compost forth to dung the ground   this when the pilgrim saw he stretchd his throat                  0   and cried out murder with a yelling note   my murderd fellow in this cart lies dead   vengeance and justice on the villains head   you magistrates who sacred laws dispense   on you i call to punish this offence      the word thus given within a little space   the mob came roaring out and throngd the place   all in a trice they cast the cart to ground   and

ordain   or its eternal prescience may be vain   as bad for us as prescience had not been   for first or last hes author of the sin   and who says that let the blaspheming man   say worse even of the devil if he can   for how can that eternal power be just   to punish man who sins because he must                             0   or how can he reward a virtuous deed   which is not done by us but first decreed      i cannot bolt this matter to the bran   as bradwardin and holy austin can   if prescience can determine actions so   that we must do because he did foreknow   or that foreknowing yet our choice is free   not forced to sin by strict necessity   this strict necessity they simple call   another sort there is conditional                                   0   the first so binds the

bestowd on human race                            0   and prescience only held the second place      if he could make such agents wholly free   i not dispute the points too high for me   for heavens unfathomd power what man can sound   or put to his omnipotence a bound   he made us to his image all agree   that image is the soul and that must be   or not the makers image or be free   but whether it were better man had been   by nature bound to good not free to sin                            0   i waive for fear of splitting on a rock   the tale i tell is only of a cock   who had not run the hazard of his life   had he believed his dream and not his wife   for women with a mischief to their kind   pervert with bad advice our better mind   a womans counsel brought us first to woe   and made her man his paradise forego   where at hearts ease he lived and might have been   as free from sorrow as he was from sin                              0   for what the devil had their sex to do

wanted yet an omen to the spring      attending long in vain i took the way   which through a path but scarcely printed lay   in narrow mazes oft it seemd to meet   and lookd as lightly pressd by fairy feet   wandering i walkd alone for still methought   to some strange end so strange a path was wrought   at last it led me where an arbour stood                             0   the sacred receptacle of the wood   this place unmarkd though oft i walkd the green   in all my progress i had never seen   and seized at once with wonder and delight   gazed all around me new to the transporting sight   twas benchd with turf and goodly to be seen   the thick young grass arose in fresher green   the mound was newly made no sight could pass   betwixt the nice partitions of the grass   the wellunited sods so closely lay                                 0   and all around the shades defended it from day   for sycamores with eglantine were spread   a hedge about the sides a covering overhead   and so the fragrant brier was wove between   the sycamore and flowers were mixed with green   that nature seemd to vary the delight   and satisfied at once the smell and sight   the master workman of the bower was known   through fairylands and built for oberon   who twining leaves with such proportion drew                        0   they rose by measure and by rule they grew   no mortal tongue can half the beauty tell   for none but hands divine could work so well   both roof and sides were like a parlour made   a soft recess and a cool summer shade   the hedge was set so thick no foreign eye   the persons placed within it could espy   but all that passd without with ease was seen   as if nor fence nor tree was placed between   twas borderd with a field and some was plain                      0   with grass and some was sowd with rising grain   that now the dew with spangles deckd the ground   a sweeter spot of earth was never found   i lookd and lookd and still with new delight   such joy my soul such pleasures filld my sight   and the fresh eglantine exhaled a breath   whose odours were of power to raise from death   nor sullen discontent nor anxious care   even though brought thither could inhabit there   but thence they fled as from their mortal foe                      00   for this sweet place could only pleasure know      thus as i mused i cast aside my eye   and saw a medlartree was planted nigh   the spreading branches made a goodly show   and full of opening blooms was every bough   a goldfinch there i saw with gaudy pride   of painted plumes that hoppd from side to side   still pecking as she passd and still she drew   the sweets from every flower and suckd the dew   sufficed at length she warbled in her throat                       0   and tuned her voice to many a merry note   but indistinct and neither sweet nor clear   yet such as soothed my soul and pleased my ear      her short performance was no sooner tried   when she i sought the nightingale replied   so sweet so shrill so variously she sung   that the grove echoed and the valleys rung   and i so ravishd with her heavenly note   i stood entranced and had no room for thought   but all oerpowerd with ecstasy of bliss                          0   was in a pleasing dream of paradise   at length i waked and looking round the bower   searchd every tree and pryd on every flower   if any where by chance i might espy   the rural poet of the melody   for still methought she sung not far away   at last i found her on a laurel spray   close by my side she sat and fair in sight   full in a line against her opposite   where stood with eglantine the laurel twined                        0   and both their native sweets were well conjoind      on the green bank i sat and listend long   sitting was more convenient for the song   nor till her lay was ended could i move   but wishd to dwell for ever in the grove   only methought the time too swiftly passd   and every note i feard would be the last   my sight and smell and hearing were employd   and all three senses in full gust enjoyd   and what alone did all the rest surpass                             0   the sweet possession of the fairy place   single and conscious to myself alone   of pleasures to the excluded world unknown   pleasures which nowhere else were to be found   and all elysium in a spot of ground      thus while i sat intent to see and hear   and drew perfumes of more than vital air   all suddenly i heard the approaching sound   of vocal music on the enchanted ground   a host of saints it seemd so full the quire                       0   as if the blessd above did all conspire   to join their voices and neglect the lyre   at length there issued from the grove behind   a fair assembly of the female kind   a train less fair as ancient fathers tell   seduced the sons of heaven to rebel   i pass their form and every charming grace   less than an angel would their worth debase   but their attire like liveries of a kind   all rich and rare is fresh within my mind                          0   in velvet white as snow the troop was gownd   the seams with sparkling emeralds set around   their hoods and sleeves the same and purfled oer   with diamonds pearls and all the shining store   of eastern pomp their long descending train   with rubies edged and sapphires swept the plain   high on their heads with jewels richly set   each lady wore a radiant coronet   beneath the circles all the quire was graced   with chaplets green on their fair foreheads placed                  0   of laurel some of woodbine many more   and wreaths of agnus castus   others bore   these last who with those virgin crowns were dressd   appeard in higher honour than the rest   they danced around but in the midst was seen   a lady of a more majestic mien   by stature and by beauty markd their sovereign queen      she in the midst began with sober grace   her servants eyes were fixd upon her face   and as she moved or turnd her motions viewd                      0   her measures kept and step by step pursued   methought she trod the ground with greater grace   with more of godhead shining in her face   and as in beauty she surpassd the quire   so nobler than the rest was her attire   a crown of ruddy gold enclosed her brow   plain without pomp and rich without a show   a branch of agnus castus in her hand   she bore aloft her sceptre of command   admired adored by all the circling crowd                           0   for wheresoeer she turnd her face they bowd   and as she danced a roundelay she sung   in honour of the laurel ever young   she raised her voice on high and sung so clear   the fawns came scudding from the groves to hear   and all the bending forest lent an ear   at every close she made the attending throng   replied and bore the burden of the song   so just so small yet in so sweet a note   it seemd the music melted in the throat                           00      thus dancing on and singing as they danced   they to the middle of the mead advanced   till round my arbour a new ring they made   and footed it about the sacred shade   oerjoyd to see the jolly troops so near   but somewhat awed i shook with holy fear   yet not so much but what i noted well   who did the most in song or dance excel      not long i had observed when from afar   i heard a sudden symphony of war                                    0   the neighing coursers and the soldiers cry   and sounding trumps that seemd to tear the sky   i saw soon after this behind the grove   from whence the ladies did in order move   come issuing out in arms a warrior train   that like a deluge pourd upon the plain   on barbed steeds they rode in proud array   thick as the college of the bees in may   when swarming oer the dusky fields they fly   new to the flowers and intercept the sky                           0   so fierce they drove their coursers were so fleet   that the turf trembled underneath their feet      to tell their costly furniture were long   the summers day would end before the song   to purchase but the tenth of all their store   would make the mighty persian monarch poor   yet what i can i will before the rest   the trumpets issued in white mantles dressd   a numerous troop and all their heads around   with chaplets green of cerrialoak   were crownd                 0   and at each trumpet was a banner bound   which waving in the wind displayed at large   their masters coat of arms and knightly charge   broad were the banners and of snowy hue   a purer web the silkworm never drew   the chief about their necks the scutcheons wore   with orient pearls and jewels powderd oer   broad were their collars too and every one   was set about with many a costly stone   next these of kingsatarms a goodly train                          0   in proud array came prancing oer the plain   their cloaks were cloth of silver mixd with gold   and garlands green around their temples rolld   rich crowns were on their royal scutcheons placed   with sapphires diamonds and with rubies graced   and as the trumpets their appearance made   so these in habits were alike arrayd   but with a pace more sober and more slow   and twenty rank in rank they rode arow   the pursuivants came next in number more                           0   and like the heralds each his scutcheon bore   clad in white velvet all their troop they led   with each an oaken chaplet on his head      nine royal knights in equal rank succeed   each warrior mounted on a fiery steed   in golden armour glorious to behold   the rivets of their arms were naild with gold   their surcoats of white ermine fur were made   with cloth of gold between that cast a glittering shade   the trappings of their steeds were of the same                      0   the golden fringe even set the ground on flame   and drew a precious trail a crown divine   of laurel did about their temples twine      three henchmen were for every knight assignd   all in rich livery clad and of a kind   white velvet but unshorn for cloaks they wore   and each within his hand a truncheon bore   the foremost held a helm of rare device   a princes ransom would not pay the price   the second bore the buckler of his knight                           0   the third of cornelwood a spear upright   headed with piercing steel and polishd bright   like to their lords their equipage was seen   and all their foreheads crownd with garlands green      and after these came armd with spear and shield   a host so great as coverd all the field   and all their foreheads like the knights before   with laurels evergreen were shaded oer   or oak or other leaves of lasting kind   tenacious of the stem and firm against the wind                    0   some in their hands beside the lance and shield   the boughs of woodbine or of hawthorn held   or branches for their mystic emblems took   of palm of laurel and of cerrialoak     thus marching to the trumpets lofty sound   drawn in two lines adverse they wheeld around   and in the middle meadow took their ground   among themselves the tourney they divide   in equal squadrons ranged on either side   then turnd their horses heads and man to man                     0   and steed to steed opposed the jousts began   they lightly set their lances in the rest   and at the sign against each other pressd   they met i sitting at my ease beheld   the mixd events and fortunes of the field   some broke their spears some tumbled horse and man   and round the field the lightend coursers ran   an hour and more like tides in equal sway   they rushd and won by turns and lost the day   at length the nine who still together held                        00   their fainting foes to shameful flight compelld   and with resistless force oerran the field   thus to their fame when finishd was the fight   the victors from their lofty steeds alight   like them dismounted all the warlike train   and two by two proceeded oer the plain   till to the fair assembly they advanced   who near the secret arbour sung and danced      the ladies left their measures at the sight   to meet the chiefs returning from the fight                         0   and each with open arms embraced her chosen knight   amid the plain a spreading laurel stood   the grace and ornament of all the wood   that pleasing shade they sought a soft retreat   from sudden april showers a shelter from the heat   her leafy arms with such extent were spread   so near the clouds was her aspiring head   that hosts of birds that wing the liquid air   perchd in the boughs had nightly lodging there   and flocks of sheep beneath the shade from far                       0   might hear the rattling hail and wintry war   from heavens inclemency here found retreat   enjoyd the cool and shunnd the scorching heat   a hundred knights might there at ease abide   and every knight a lady by his side   the trunk itself such odours did bequeath   that a moluccan   breeze to these was common breath   the lords and ladies here approaching paid   their homage with a low obeisance made   and seemd to venerate the sacred shade                             0   these rites performd their pleasures they pursue   with song of love and mix with measures new   around the holy tree their dance they frame   and every champion leads his chosen dame      i cast my sight upon the farther field   and a fresh object of delight beheld   for from the region of the west i heard   new music sound and a new troop appeard   of knights and ladies mixd a jolly band   but all on foot they marchd and hand in hand                      0      the ladies dressd in rich symars were seen   of florence satin flowerd with white and green   and for a shade betwixt the bloomy gridelin   the borders of their petticoats below   were guarded thick with rubies on a row   and every damsel wore upon her head   of flowers a garland blended white and red   attired in mantles all the knights were seen   that gratified the view with cheerful green   their chaplets of their ladies colours were                        0   composed of white and red to shade their shining hair   before the merry troop the minstrels playd   all in their masters liveries were arrayd   and clad in green and on their temples wore   the chaplets white and red their ladies bore   their instruments were various in their kind   some for the bow and some for breathing wind   the sawtry pipe and hautboys noisy band   and the soft lute trembling beneath the touching hand   a tuft of daisies on a flowery lea                                   0   they saw and thitherward they bent their way   to this both knights and dames their homage made   and due obeisance to the daisy paid   and then the band of flutes began to play   to which a lady sung a virelay     and still at every close she would repeat   the burden of the song the daisy is so sweet   the daisy is so sweet when she begun   the troop of knights and dames continued on   the concert and the voice so charmd my ear   and soothed my soul that it was heaven to hear                     0      but soon their pleasure passd at noon of day   the sun with sultry beams began to play   not sirius shoots a fiercer flame from high   when with his poisonous breath he blasts the sky   then droopd the fading flowers their beauty fled   and closed their sickly eyes and hung the head   and rivelld up with heat lay dying in their bed   the ladies gaspd and scarcely could respire   the breath they drew no longer air but fire                        0   the fainty knights were scorchd and knew not where   to run for shelter for no shade was near   and after this the gathering clouds amain   pourd down a storm of rattling hail and rain   and lightning flashd betwixt the field and flowers   burnt up before were buried in the showers   the ladies and the knights no shelter nigh   bare to the weather and the wintry sky   were drooping wet disconsolate and wan   and through their thin array received the rain                      0   while those in white protected by the tree   saw pass in vain the assault and stood from danger free   but as compassion moved their gentle minds   when ceased the storm and silent were the winds   displeased at what not suffering they had seen   they went to cheer the faction of the green   the queen in white array before her band   saluting took her rival by the hand   so did the knights and dames with courtly grace   and with behaviour sweet their foes embrace                        00   then thus the queen with laurel on her brow   fair sister i have sufferd in your woe   nor shall be wanting aught within my power   for your relief in my refreshing bower   that other answerd with a lowly look   and soon the gracious invitation took   for ill at ease both she and all her train   the scorching sun had borne and beating rain   like courtesy was used by all in white   each dame a dame received and every knight a knight                0   the laurel champions with their swords invade   the neighbouring forests where the jousts were made   and serewood from the rotten hedges took   and seeds of latent fire from flints provoke   a cheerful blaze arose and by the fire   they warmd their frozen feet and dried their wet attire   refreshd with heat the ladies sought around   for virtuous herbs which gatherd from the ground   they squeezed the juice and cooling ointment made   which on their sunburnt cheeks and their chapt skins they laid    0   then sought green salads which they bade them eat   a sovereign remedy for inward heat      the lady of the leaf ordaind a feast   and made the lady of the flower her guest   when lo a bower ascended on the plain   with sudden seats ordaind and large for either train   this bower was near my pleasant arbour placed   that i could hear and see whatever passd   the ladies sat with each a knight between   distinguishd by their colours white and green                     0   the vanquishd party with the victors joind   nor wanted sweet discourse the banquet of the mind   meantime the minstrels playd on either side   vain of their art and for the mastery vied   the sweet contention lasted for an hour   and reachd my secret arbour from the bower      the sun was set and vesper to supply   his absent beams had lighted up the sky   when philomel officious all the day   to sing the service of the ensuing may                              0   fled from her laurel shade and wingd her flight   directly to the queen arrayd in white   and hopping sat familiar on her hand   a new musician and increased the band      the goldfinch who to shun the scalding heat   had changed the medlar for a safer seat   and hid in bushes scaped the bitter shower   now perchd upon the lady of the flower   and either songster holding out their throats   and folding up their wings renewd their notes                     0   as if all day precluding to the fight   they only had rehearsed to sing by night   the banquet ended and the battle done   they danced by starlight and the friendly moon   and when they were to part the laureate queen   supplied with steeds the lady of the green   her and her train conducting on the way   the moon to follow and avoid the day      this when i saw inquisitive to know   the secret moral of the mystic show                                 0   i started from my shade in hopes to find   some nymph to satisfy my longing mind   and as my fair adventure fell i found   a lady all in white with laurel crownd   who closed the rear and softly paced along   repeating to herself the former song   with due respect my body i inclined   as to some being of superior kind   and made my court according to the day   wishing her queen and her a happy may                               0   great thanks my daughter with a gracious bow   she said and i who much desired to know   of whence she was yet fearful how to break   my mind adventured humbly thus to speak   madam might i presume and not offend   so may the stars and shining moon attend   your nightly sports as you vouchsafe to tell   what nymphs they were who mortal forms excel   and what the knights who fought in listed fields so well   to this the dame replied

of arms excelld   and after death for deities were held                               0   but those who wear the woodbine on their brow   were knights of love who never broke their vow   firm to their plighted faith and ever free   from fears and fickle chance and jealousy   the lords and ladies who the woodbine bear   as true as tristram and isotta were      but what are those said i the

both the bands in worship disagree   and some adore the flower and some the tree      just is your suit fair daughter said the dame   those laurelld chiefs were men of mighty fame   nine worthies were

swarming at his back the country cried   and once in view they never lost the sight   but seized and piniond brought to court the knight                0      then courts of kings were held in high renown   ere made the common brothels of the town   there virgins honourable vows received   but chaste as maids in monasteries lived   the king himself to nuptial ties a slave   no bad example to his

                     0   moved by the damsels tears and common cry   he doomd the brutal ravisher to die   but fair geneura rose in his defence   and prayd so hard for mercy from the prince   that to his queen the king the offender gave   and left it in her power to kill or save   this gracious act the ladies all approve   who thought it much a man should die for love   and with their mistress

nor hast thou other surety than the grace   not due to thee from our offended race   but as our kind is of a softer mould                                0   and cannot blood without a sigh behold   i grant thee life reserving still the power   to take the forfeit when i see my hour   unless thy answer to my next demand   shall set thee free from our avenging hand   the question whose solution i require   is what the sex of women most desire   in this dispute thy judges are at strife   beware for on thy wit depends thy life   yet lest surprised unknowing what to say                         00   thou damn thyself we give thee farther day   a year is thine to wander at thy will   and learn from others if thou wantst the skill   but not to hold our proffer turnd to scorn   good sureties will we have for thy return   that at the time prefixd thou shalt obey   and at thy pledges peril keep thy day      woe was the knight at this severe command   but well he knew twas bootless to withstand   the terms accepted as the fair ordain                              0   he put in bail for his return again   and promised answer at the day assignd   the best with heavens assistance he could find      his leave thus taken on his way he went   with heavy heart and full of discontent   misdoubting much and fearful of the event   twas hard the truth of such a point to find   as was not yet agreed among the kind   thus on he went still anxious more and more   askd all he met and knockd at every door                         0   inquired of men but made his chief request   to learn from women what they loved the best   they answerd each according to her mind   to please herself not all the female kind   one was for wealth another was for place   crones old and ugly wishd a better face   the widows wish was oftentimes to wed   the wanton maids were all for sport abed   some said the sex were pleased with handsome lies   and some gross flattery loved without disguise                      0   truth is says one he seldom fails to win   who flatters well for thats our darling sin   but long attendance and a duteous mind   will work even with the wisest of the kind   one thought the sexs prime felicity   was from the bonds of wedlock to be free   their pleasures hours and actions all their own   and uncontrolld to give account to none   some wish a husbandfool but such are cursed   for fools perverse of husbands are the worst                        0   all women would be counted chaste and wise   nor should our spouses see but with our eyes   for fools will prate and though they want the wit   to find close faults yet open blots will hit   though better for their ease to hold their tongue   for womankind was never in the wrong   so noise ensues and quarrels last for life   the wife abhors the fool the fool the wife   and some men say that great delight have we   to be for truth extolld and secrecy                               0   and constant in one purpose still to dwell   and not our husbands counsels to reveal   but thats a fable for our sex is frail   inventing rather than not tell a tale   like leaky sieves no secrets we can hold   witness the famous tale that ovid told      midas the king as in his book appears   by phoebus was endowd with asss ears   which under his long locks he well conceald   as monarchs vices must not be reveald                            0   for fear the people have them in the wind   who long ago were neither dumb nor blind   nor apt to think from heaven their title springs   since jove and mars left off begetting kings   this midas knew and durst communicate   to none but to his wife his ears of state   one must be trusted and he thought her fit   as passing prudent and a parlous wit   to this sagacious confessor he went   and told her what a gift the gods had sent                          0   but told it under matrimonial seal   with strict injunction never to reveal   the secret heard she plighted him her troth   and sacred sure is every womans oath   the royal malady should rest unknown   both for her husbands honour and her own   but neertheless she pined with discontent   the counsel rumbled till it found a vent   the thing she knew she was obliged to hide   by interest and by oath the wife was tied                           0   but if she told it not the woman died   loath to betray a husband and a prince   but she must burst or blab and no pretence   of honour tied her tongue from selfdefence   a marshy ground commodiously was near   thither she ran and held her breath for fear   lest if a word she spoke of any thing   that word might be the secret of the king   thus full of counsel to the fen she went   griped all the way and longing for a vent                          0   arrived by pure necessity compelld   on her majestic marrowbones she kneeld   then to the waters brink she laid her head   and as a bittour   bumps within a reed   to thee alone o lake she said i tell   and as thy queen command thee to conceal   beneath his locks the king my husband wears   a goodly royal pair of asss ears   now i have eased my bosom of the pain   till the next longing fit return again                             00      thus through a woman was the secret known   tell us and in effect you tell the town   but to my tale the knight with heavy cheer   wandering in vain had now consumed the year   one day was only left to solve the doubt   yet knew no more than when he first set out   but home he must and as the award had been   yield up his body captive to the queen   in this despairing state he happd to ride   as fortune led him by a forest side                                0   lonely the vale and full of horror stood   brown with the shade of a religious wood   when full before him at the noon of night   the moon was up and shot a gleamy light   he saw a quire of ladies in a round   that featly footing seemd to skim the ground   thus dancing hand in hand so light they were   he knew not where they trod on earth or air   at speed he drove and came a sudden guest   in hope where many women were at least                              0   some one by chance might answer his request   but faster than his horse the ladies flew   and in a trice were vanishd out of view      one only hag remaind but fouler far   than grandame apes in indian forests are   against a witherd oak she leand her weight   proppd on her trusty staff not half upright   and droppd an awkward courtesy to the knight   then said what makes you sir so late abroad   without a guide and this no beaten road                            0   or want you aught that here you hope to find   or travel for some trouble in your mind   the last i guess and if i read aright   those of our sex are bound to serve a knight   perhaps good counsel may your grief assuage   then tell your pain for wisdom is in age      to this the knight good mother would you know   the secret cause and spring of all my woe   my life must with tomorrows light expire   unless i tell what women most desire                                0   now could you help me at this hard essay   or for your inborn goodness or for pay   yours is my life redeemd by your advice   ask what you please and i will pay the price   the proudest kerchief of the court shall rest   well satisfied of what they love the best   plight me thy faith quoth she that what i ask   thy danger over and performd thy task   that thou shalt give for hire of thy demand   here take thy oath and seal it on my hand                          0   i warrant thee on peril of my life   thy words shall please both widow maid and wife      more words there needed not to move the knight   to take her offer and his truth to plight   with that she spread a mantle on the ground   and first inquiring whither he was bound   bade him not fear though long and rough the way   at court he should arrive ere break of day   his horse should find the way without a guide   she said with fury they began to ride                              0   he on the midst the beldam at his side   the horse what devil drove i cannot tell   but only this they sped their journey well   and all the way the crone informd the knight   how he should answer the demand aright      to court they came the news was quickly spread   of his returning to redeem his head   the female senate was assembled soon   with all the mob of women in the town   the queen sat lord chiefjustice of the hall                        0   and bade the crier cite the criminal   the knight appeard and silence they proclaim   then first the culprit answerd to his name   and after forms of law was last required   to name the thing that women most desired      the offender taught his lesson by the way   and by his counsel orderd what to say   thus bold began my lady liege said he   what all your sex desire is sovereignty   the wife affects her husband to command                             0   all must be hers both money house and land   the maids are mistresses even in their name   and of their servants full dominion claim   this at the peril of my head i say   a blunt plain truth the sex aspires to sway   you to rule all while we like slaves obey   there was not one or widow maid or wife   but said the knight had well deserved his life   even fair geneura with a blush confessd   the man had found what women love the best      upstarts the beldam who was there unseen                         0   and reverence made accosted thus the queen   my liege said she before the court arise   may i poor wretch find favour in your eyes   to grant my just request twas i who taught   the knight this answer and inspired his thought   none but a woman could a man direct   to tell us women what we most affect   but first i swore him on his knightly troth   and here demand performance of his oath                           00   to grant the boon that next i should desire   he gave his faith and i expect my hire   my promise is fulfilld i saved his life   and claim his debt to take me for his wife   the knight was askd nor could his oath deny   but hoped they would not force him to comply   the women who would rather wrest the laws   than let a sisterplaintiff lose the cause   as judges on the bench more gracious are   and more attent to brothers of the bar                              0   cried one and all the suppliant should have right   and to the grandame hag adjudged the knight      in vain he sighd and oft with tears desired   some reasonable suit might be required   but still the crone was constant to her note   the more he spoke the more she stretchd her throat   in vain he profferd all his goods to save   his body destined to that living grave   the liquorish hag rejects the pelf with scorn   and nothing but the man would serve her turn                        0   not all the wealth of eastern kings said she   have power to part my plighted love and me   and old and ugly as i am and poor   yet never will i break the faith i swore   for mine thou art by promise during life   and i thy loving and obedient wife      my love nay rather my damnation thou   said he nor am i bound to keep my vow   the fiend thy sire hath sent thee from below   else how couldst thou my secret sorrows know                        0   avaunt old witch for i renounce thy bed   the queen may take the forfeit of my head   ere any of my race so foul a crone shall wed   both heard the judge pronounced against the knight   so was he married in his own despite   and all day after hid him as an owl   not able to sustain a sight so foul   perhaps the reader thinks i do him wrong   to pass the marriage feast and nuptial song   mirth there was none the man was alamort                       0   and little courage had to make his court   to bed they went the bridegroom and the bride   was never such an illpaird couple tied   restless he tossd and tumbled to and fro   and rolld and wriggled further off for woe   the good old wife lay smiling by his side   and caught him in her quivering arms and cried   when you my ravishd predecessor saw   you were not then become this man of straw   had you been such you might have scaped the law                   0   is this the custom of king arthurs court   are all roundtable knights of such a sort   remember i am she who saved your life   your loving lawful and complying wife   not thus you swore in your unhappy hour   nor i for this return employd my power   in time of need i was your faithful friend   nor did i since nor ever will offend   believe me my loved lord tis much unkind   what fury has possessd your alterd mind                           0   thus on my wedding nightwithout pretence   come turn this way or tell me my offence   if not your wife let reasons rule persuade   name but my fault amends shall soon be made   amends nay thats impossible said he   what change of age or ugliness can be   or could medeas

turn to such a bride   and is this all that troubles you so sore   and what the devil couldst thou wish me more   ah benedicite replied the crone   then cause of just complaining have you none   the remedy to this were soon applied   would you be like the bridegroom to the bride   but for you say a long descended race   and wealth and dignity and power and place   make gentlemen and that your high degree                            0   is much disparaged to be matchd with me   know this my lord nobility of blood   is but a glittering and fallacious good   the nobleman is he whose noble mind   is filld with inborn worth unborrowd from his kind   the king of heaven was in a manger laid   and took his earth but from an humble maid   then what can birth or mortal men bestow   since floods no

wrappd in his crimes against the storm prepared   but when the milder beams of mercy play   he melts and throws his cumbrous cloak away   lightning and thunder heavens artillery   as harbingers before the almighty fly   those but proclaim his style and disappear                         0   the stiller sound succeeds and god is there      the tithes his parish freely paid he took   but never sued or cursed with bell and book   with patience bearing wrong but offering none   since every man is free to lose his own   the country churls according to their kind   who grudge their dues and love to be behind   the less he sought his offerings pinchd the more   and praised a priest contented to be poor      yet of his little he had some to spare                            0   to feed the famishd and to clothe the bare   for mortified he was to that degree   a poorer than himself he would not see   true priests he said and preachers of the word   were only stewards of their sovereign lord   nothing was theirs but all the public store   intrusted riches to relieve the poor   who should they steal for want of his relief   he judged himself accomplice with the thief      wide was his parish not contracted close                          0   in streets but here and there a straggling house   yet still he was at hand without request   to serve the sick to succour the distressd   tempting on foot alone without affright   the dangers of a dark tempestuous night      all this the good old man performd alone   nor spared his pains for curate he had none   nor durst he trust another with his care   nor rode himself to pauls the public fair   to chaffer for preferment with his gold                             0   where bishoprics and sinecures are sold   but duly watchd his flock by night and day   and from the prowling wolf redeemd the prey   and hungry sent the wily fox away      the proud he tamed the penitent he cheerd   nor to rebuke the rich offender feard   his preaching much but more his practice wrought   a living sermon of the truths he taught   for this by rules severe his life he squared   that all might see the doctrine which they heard                    0   for priests he said are patterns for the rest   the gold of heaven who bear the god impressd   but when the precious coin is kept unclean   the sovereigns image is no longer seen   if they be foul on whom the people trust   well may the baser brass contract a rust      the prelate for his holy life he prized   the worldly pomp of prelacy despised   his saviour came not with a gaudy show   nor was his
