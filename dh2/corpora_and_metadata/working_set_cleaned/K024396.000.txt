some reflections upon the modern practisers of physic in relation to the small pox  written for the particular use and perusal of the nobility and gentry  by walter lynn  filii magnatum frequentius ex inutili remediorum copia quam ex vi morbi pereunt praesertim si acute laboraverint etc paucis utaris and cum prudentia bagliv london printed for r knaplock at the bishops head in st pauls churchyard       the preface i published an essay on this subject the last year upon which some of the faculty were pleased to pass this judgment that it was only written on purpose to diminish the practice of the physicians and apothecaries in town  i here declare that it was not written with that design though if it had i believe it would not have been the less esteemed by most persons  i have used in that piece all deference and respect to the good and worthy practisers of physic at least and if by accident it may prove detrimental to the rest of the faculty or those that depend upon it or rather to take it in a right sense whom those latter gentlemen are too much depending upon it ought not i presume to be reckoned as a fault of mine  the reosons and design of that piece i have delivered very plainly in my preface to it and how far suiting to such a design the work it self was is given in the judgment of those two very learned and unprejudiced persons i have mentioned toward the latter end of this  the fault as i am informed of that other piece was in my not being open and plain enough but from henceforward i shall be more free in declaring my own and others sentiments upon this subject of which i here give the reader the following short specimen  some reflections upon the modern practisers of physic in relation to the small pox sydenham sydenham was both a great admirer and follower of hippocrates the first is most apparent in those passages of his preface where he tells us that hippocrates who arrived to the top of physic laid the solid foundation upon nature cures diseases and again it is from the ancients and chiefly hippocrates we have received the best part of the therapeuticks that is the art of administering to or healing of the sick so that both the true theory and practice of physic was chiefly this great writers in sydenhams opinion and still more so i judge in his we are going to recount was a great admirer of hippocrates nevertheless we must not allow him to have been either the closest or the most successful follower of him as will appear by the following account i shall give of one that was his great crony and cotemporary i mean the good dr mapletoft i had occasion to wait upon this reverend and very venerable person the last year and to discourse with him something about the small pox which was no uncommon subject then nor now in london he told me that he once thought he understood that distemper himself for in six years that he was a practiser of considerable he was president of the college of physicians eminence in london he lost not one patient by the small pox at length he said two or three died under his hands which though there were other physicians whom he named employed with him in those patients it gave him that concern as to hasten the leaving off his practice of physic which was gainful enough to him being better worth than a thousand pounds a year as he assured me and which he did not probably expect the same profit from his pains in divinity to which calling nevertheless he said he had a greater inclination than to the other and during his employment in physic was as constant in public acts of devotion as since  this whole relation was very much surprising to me especially from one of his character the perfect veracity of whose words i could no ways scruple or make a doubt of and it gave me occasion to enquire of him what were his ways or methods in the cure of the small pox he very frankly told me that his general way was to do nothing at all that a patient of his when his apothecarys bill was brought in it came but to three pence anothers which was accidently viewed by him at the same time amounting to ten pounds that person died this last account was not altogether so surprising but that the doctors good success should continue for so many years when it is probable there were different seasons and constitutions of those years and some more dangerous than others to this distemper as well as has been since that the doctors method the same i presume with hippocratess viz a proper diet was the first the principal and oftentimes the only remedy that hippocrates made use of to satisfy the greatest part of the intentions we have touched upon by these means he opposed moiss to dry hot to cold he added or supplied what was deficient and took off from what was superfluous etc and that that was to him the most considerable point he supported nature and assisted it to overcome the cause of the malady and in a word put it in a condition to do of it self what was necessary for the cure of distempers says le clark p     of the history of physic and it is confirmed in hippocratess books de morbis and in his epidemicks which were his practice diet prescribed and a regulation in the other the nonnaturals are diet air sleeping or watching evacuation or retention of excrements exercise or rest and passions of the mind nonnaturals should so infallibly succeed when a multitude of medicines then and since given by others has proved either ineffectual noxious or deadly deserves a thorough consideration and before my departure i could not forbear telling the doctor my sentiments that the practice of the town seemed to be far different from his he confessed it was so and that the physicians now made use of bleeding blistering etc by which they told him they saved the lives of many i answered him that i thought matter of fact was too plainly against their practice and if they saved the lives of many they destroyed far more  to all this and likewise what sydenham mentions concerning the poors generally escaping well in this distemper there can be i think but one plausible answer given which though it may be so to this latter of sydenhams yet can scarce be allowed to the foregoing it is this that whoever concerns himself with physic ought always to consider that there is a very great difference in the constitutions of most persons which makes the very same distemper severe and dangerous to one yet mild and very easy to to be born in another that nothing appears more plainly than this observation in the small pox and from hence we are told we ought to infer for a generat reason why the poor who use little or no physic in this distemper yet commonly escape well in it that it is from the lowness of their diet and their different ways of living from the rich which causes their bodies to be of another nature and not liable to the virulency or high malignity of the disease but the rich are subject to it and therefore they must use means and all the powers of art to quell lessen and destroy it in their bodies or to prevent it and after all that can be done for them if great numbers of these latter miscarry in the hands of their physicians notwithstanding their utmost care and medicines it is not to be imputed to their fault for they cannot alter nature so very speedily and create a good and strong constitution or habit of body where it was not at all to be found in the patient before this has passed with many for a good answer to what sydenham has said relating to the poors escaping better than the rich though they used no physic nor methods of art in the small pox but will not serve i think to what dr mapletofts constant practice proved viz that the same methods being used to both were successful alike except we suppose he had no rich patients which after what i have but now related of him twere a mere absurdity to imagine  this therefore is some proof of what i hinted at in my title page and preface but shall make out more fully in a larger piece concerning physicks being grown in this age too much an art or craft it being used too much and not to a right intention in the present case before us  but least i should be any ways mistaken in either the receiving or delivering of these matters or i may seem to my reader to have overweighted them with consequences which in his opinion they will not so very well bear i shall go on and take a view of the other part of hippocratess practice in the exceptions against his general rule of diet only for so we may properly call them exceptions being but few and not to be met with in many pages of his works especially of his practice it is certain however that he made use both of evacuations and other means or medicines in acute and chronical distempers though not near so often in the former as the latter nature being generally better able of her self to bring matters to a crisis without them i design to consider several of these but at present can only go upon one of them without swelling this piece to too large a bulk but it is pretty material namely the evacuation of bleeding to see upon what reasons or tokens scarcely upon slight ones hippocrates made use of it  the first indication in him taken notice of by a certain author le clarke  who has undertaken to put them in order is a plethora or overfulness of the blood vessels in which case he used bleeding to evacuate or take away the superfuity of what was in them  this i own is highly requisite where the case by certain or very numerous indications is manifest but where not it is as indispensibly necessary to let alone or omit it for by bleeding we most certainly weaken nature if we do not relieve her nay tho we do as is most certainly known in many cases and ought to be well noted in distempers that are both long and violent as this we are now treating of at present most commonly is  but say some of our modern practisers in defense of their own ways and methods though not successful the gentry or rich persons who have plenty of every thing are apt to indulge themselves to excess and so must needs be full of blood and humors which renders evacuations necessary to them  this assertion i hold to contain very considerable falsities and to be most pernicious in its consequences as i shall make appear both by reasons and facts themselves and for that purpose shall enter upon a brief consideration and account of the general ways of living both of the rich and poorer sort and what are the common diet and delights of both  the common diet both of those whose circumstances are good and plentiful as also of almost the meanest mechanic here in london is butchers meat little differently dressed excepting some few who delight in made dishes sauces etc but neither in this nor in the variety of courses do the generality of wealthy persons exceed those of the poorer or commonalty who dine at the cooks shops in london this then can make no great difference in their constitutions either for good or bad we shall descend therefore to the deliciae the entertainments of the gentry or richer sort amongst one another in this there is a considerable difference and distinction of them from the meaner sort the entertainments of the first where they give any in their visits being with coffee tea chocolate a cup of cordial waters or a single glass of wine and the like now whoever considers these and compares them with the good roast beef ale and cheese which the meaner sort both in city and country are apt to set before their friends or visitors at all hours will think there is no comparison in the substantialness of the treat and that the latter is much more likely to fill the body with blood and humors than the former for to consider of coffee it is a noted dryer up of the blood and humors of tea the green first it is an evacuator both by urine and sweat this last by its own heat and by being drank in a fashionable manner that is in large quantities and excessive hot the bohea tea is something of another nature being reckoned good in consumptions by many yet no person that i have met with has complained of their growing too gross bulky or plethorick by feeding on it or that it put too much blood in their faces as is the complexion of those who too much abound with it this might make it become altogether an unfashionable liquor which i do not hear that it is at least upon this account  the third thing i have mentioned is chocolate which though not so often used in visits is yet drank constantly by many and this to be sure will be reckoned an high diet yet i cannot find that those persons who take it even in bed which way it should be most nourishing are obliged to make use of any evacuations as bleeding purging vomiting once a month or quarter upon that account  i need not mention the nature or effects of the other two liquors which people of fashion and sobriety especially the ladies though they may taste of yet we must believe it is sparingly enough and as for those genlemen who make too free with their own constitutions by an overliberal use of wine and other liquors this does not always render them plethorick or too abounding with blood spirits and humors in their veins and nerves such persons rather wanting them and even a natural heat in their bodies upon any intermission of their usual debauch to these the greatest this must not be taken to extend to an accidental debauch or excess where it is not customary in young persons for in these latter the blood is apt to swell and boil up upon it which may endanger bursting of the vessels in this case we must use bleeding though with caution caution therefore ought to be used how we too much impair their spirits by any exhaustion when nothing but even a riot can repair them again so much is custom a second nature and as hardly to be put off as the first  these are but short hints which might be cleared and enlarged upon very much but such as they are at present they are enough to show that this supposal of a plethora or fullness of blood in rich persons rather than in the poor or middle sort has no good foundation and another thing that may plainly convince us of this mistake is the very countenances as well as shape of body of such as live nicely and delicately in the city compared with those who live more hardily and in the country for in the first it is thin pale and without color but in the other sanguine and full which made one of our best poets when he brings in two cityladies ridiculing the countrygentlemans illbred daughters to mention their being congreves old bachelor act   scene   plump cherrycheekd and fat as barndoorfowl which none doubts was naturally though satyrically expressed in him  i shall go not much farther nor use many more arguments at present in this thing being not so far swayed in my own judgment and opinion though grounded upon reason and observation as to disbelieve there are any plethorick persons at all amongst the rich who may need evacuations in the very beginning of this as well as other distempers but i am nearly of opinion that there may at least as many be found among the poorer or middle sort of people and of such as live upon a plainer diet too than any i have yet mentioned i shall give the following instances  there was some years since living in cotherstock near oundle in northamptonshire a family of the whiteings consisting of the grandmother three grandsons and a daughter the four young persons were pretty well grown up when the eldest of them about nineteen and a very lusty youth fresh and sanguine fell ill of a cold or cough only which being neglected presently turned to a consumption advice was at length called for him when it was too late but who gave it as their opinion that if he had been let blood early enough when he had only a cough and not a consumption or wasting of the lungs and other parts he had avoided this fatal distemper which in a short time carried him off  about a year after the second brother of much the some habit of body and not yet quite at his full growth fell ill of the small pox and was taken with an inward bleeding before the distemper well appeared which carried him off speedily the third brother caught them of this last and with the same symptoms viz voiding bloody urine died likewise whilst he was yet unburied the only now surviving child the granddaughter of a clear florid and something sanguine complexion fell ill and her they got presently blooded in the arm notwithstanding which she had a most violent haemorrhage or bleeding at the nose which lasted so long till her friends about her thought she would have expired by it they having tried several things in vain to stop it at length they bethought themselves of a very good bloodstone which being applied the bleeding immediately staid the small pox however notwithstanding this one would think cooling of the blood by emptying proved of the worst and most confluent kind yet she escaped with great difficulty and is alive at this day  what i introduced these examples for is to show that persons either of a mean estate or that live almost as frugally as possible may be over full of blood and humors the grandmother of these persons who was manager and provider of the family being noted for her parsimonious temper and though i suppose the house did not want for necessaries having means to provide them yet she allowed very little superfluities either to her self or grandchildren their diets being both plain and common and as for those refreshments of coffee tea chocolate etc they were scarce at that time known in the family no more than wine or brandy commonly used or permitted in it yet these persons seemed manifestly plethorick in their constitutions as i have showed and perhaps they were the more inclined to be so for living after their plain manner and upon a low diet for i remember that communicating these cases and some others to an old physician of my acquaintance he asked me if the forementioned persons fed upon a milkdiet i told him i could not directly affirm that was their constant food but that the family kept a dairy and i supposed it might be a considerable part of it this physician told me the reason of his asking was that he had observed persons who voluntarily chose a milkdiet and lived upon it were generally more turgid and fuller fleshed than others which we may commonly observe of the poorer sort who are not overlabourd and especially of their children  another common diet of the meaner sort is cheese which though reckoned by some not to be a nourishing nor good food yet has been reputed otherwise by the most judicious for we find there were so long since as in hippocratess days various opinions about this edible as to the wholefomness or unwholesomness of it which in one place he ridicules as only given by ignorant people at random without considering the different constitutions of persons who may feed upon it and find different effects viz an agreeableness or disagreeableness of it and he tells us that for many de veteri medicina part    thin and lean persons it is found good and wholesome food which argues that it someways nourishes and fills up such bodies  thus we see that notwithstanding the supposed luxuriant and riotous living of the rich the poor or meaner sort both may and do abound with blood and other juices at least as much or rather more and as often as the former and consequently may have as great occasion for bleeding and other evacuations as those first but that they do make very seldom any use of them especially of bleeding i am pretty thoroughly persuaded not only from their general and natural abhorrence to it but a particular one in this distemper of the small pox which is so great that i have heard more than one person affirm they would sooner admit a dagger to their hearts than suffer it to be done upon any account in this disease yet these are the same persons that escape the best as sydenham observes and suffer the fewest miscarriages by it  there is one thing however which my most timorous readers will be too apt to conclude from the foregoing particular cases two of which having proved mortal to all appearance for want of this precaution of bleeding before nature had forced her way by the secret passages which is that this inward bleeding being both a very common and dangerous symptom we ought to use a fence and precaution against it and that nothing is so good and safe as bleeding at the arm i can agree with such a person in none of these things for first were this both a very common and very fatal symptom dr mapletoft must no doubt have often met with it and not knowing how to cure would have lost some of his patients by it which we do not find that he did or by any other means of a long time viz six whole years if he had a certain remedy for this symptom i do not question but he would have communicated it to the public long ere this especially when he had left off his practice if we suppose he used the forementioned precaution and blooded all his patients in the beginning the supposition is very unreasonable for this is far from doing see p   nothing it is too frequently doing mischief as i have shown by some see my essay p       etc arguments and mean to do hereafter by more but in the mean time shall consider something farther of this symptom and of a way to prevent or cure it  this bad symptom as it is commonly and truly accounted seems most incident to persons of a pretty full but lax habit of body whose fibers have not a true strength tone and resistance when any thing of force or violence is impressed upon them it seems to require too that their blood and humors be not only pretty much abounding but that they should be of a thin and watery consistance i speak this as not only knowing one of the three persons aforementioned who had been my patient to have been of this constitution from certain tokens plainly discovering both the solids and fluids to be so constituted but the other two were in outward appearance and upon this trial of the distemper as we see inwardly affected almost the same these things together with another remark i shall mention by and by have made me take some notice of a reflection dr lister has thrown upon sydenham for his method of using dilutives viz quantities of thin and small liquors in this distemper he tells us that this celebrated author carried it to an excess in that point and the effect of it was to his knowledge very often a voiding of bloody urine dr lister was a person of some considerable practice though far inserior to sydenham and upon whom he is too severe in his reflections yet if his experience or rather the passage in dr lister is salivatio addis promovetur multa and tenui potatione ita quidem and interdum diarrhaea funesta and micturitio tua mortifera haec tibi in medicina facienda scio saepius accidisse at causam non vidisti tantus tuarum hypothesium amer est prying temper into the miscarriages of others discovered this to him twas very well the discovering it to the world especially when sydenham plainly shows himself at a loss upon this symptom  i cannot say my self that i have seen this effect upon any one in the small pox but i have seen a very sudden and apparent diabetes caused by a persons only drinking a very large quantity of small beer in the paroxism or fit of an ague which failing to be discharged by vomit as it had used to have been to the same person presently turned downwards and the patient had at least twenty discharges by urine in less than twelve hours and with such a prostration of strength and spirits that life seemed to be in danger before we could get proper remedies in a countryvillage which nevertheless this distemper soon yielded to when received and the person recovered from the ague and diabetes thus accidentally attending it in a very few days there being no contrariety in the two methods that i used for both however i have reflected upon it since that if in such a distemper as a common ague a diabetes succeeded by only thinning the blood with too much liquids as is mentioned in the small pox which has a much greater acrimony the blood it self by corrosion of the vessels might be carried down with those liquids the same way i am therefore altogether for a moderation in this as well as in other methods or administrations for this distemper and not for large quantities of liquors to be given except the patient has been long and injuriously detained from them so that the excessive heat and drought of his body does absolutely require them for then only they are both safe and useful all this is by way of precaution only against this symptom of inward bleeding which if due care be taken i mean if no violent methods or ill regimen has been used in or immediately before the distemper few persons constitutions in my opinion would make them directly liable to it  as for the cure of it i shall advise but to a seemingly slight and easy method at present which was recommended to me by a lady one of a very generous and charitable disposition who visits equally both rich and poor in any distress and in one that her own tender sex is only liable to when she makes a ready visit she tells me she never goes unfurnished with an herb called rosfolis or sundew which has this powerful virtue to stop immediately the greatest hoemorrhages or fluxes of blood that often happen in those cases by hanging it in a bag upon the breast of the person and that its force is so great as to hinder the evacuation of what is necessary and natural afterward if it be not removed in time for which reason she takes it off at the end of twelve or four and twenty hours at farthest this she assures me she has likewise made use of in those inward bleedings of the small pox and with perfect good success it stopping them immediately as she had clearly experimented more than once and does not doubt but it will always answer the same however there is one thing to be taken care of that this herb be pretty fresh and good for if it be either decayed or has been too long or too often used its virtue is then lost as she particularly proved upon persons who have bled at the nose habitually for though it will both stop and prevent such bleedings while worn upon the person yet it must be renewed at the end of two or three months at farthest i have seen my self some effects of it in this latter case but have not had opportunities of the former however i am far from discountenancing the trials of it as some i question not will do who are of another temper as well as intellect from their great master hippocrates who says that a physician ought not to be ashamed to inform himself though by the meanest people of remedies confirmed by experience by this means in my opinion the art of physic grew up by degrees that is by amassing and collecting observations of the several particular cases one by one which being all put together make one entire body  but to return from this something long though not useless digression to the examination of hippocratess other reasons for bleeding this first and chiefest of a plethora supposed being not so common or probable a case especially among the rich as has been mistakenly imagined  a second reason in leclarks collection of them was to divert or recall the course of the blood which was going where it ought not to be  this might probably have been useful in those cases i lately mentioned but we are not to suppose a necessity for a thing where there is none for this would be like a person who having seen another die of an apoplexy and hearing it after reported that if the deceased had used bleeding vomiting and blistering he had escaped his death this should make him upon the first time he was dozie or his head achd send for an apothecary and a surgion and order himself to be immediately blooded blisterd etc by way of prevention which if not the first time yet if this humor often took him would infallibly ruin the best constitution in the world and bring upon him such weaknesses and disorders as he would never have been attacked with had he forborne those methods  that this is a parallel case and that there is as great hazards and commonly as little necessity bating perhaps a little present ease which might happen too in both cases it commonly causing an enlivening or briskness for such a practice in the one case as in the other i appeal to the experienced and successful dr mapletoft abovementioned p     but to proceed  a third end of bleeding was to procure a free motion of the blood and spirits which though dr le clarke has quoted in his history of physic a long case that will not much resemble the small pox nor any distemper known in england at this day yet since there are disorders of the nerves and there may be stagnations both of the blood and spirits in this present distemper i shall be told that we are not to take these as slight indications or symptoms and i confess they are not being such as put not only sydenham but many others i believe upon forcible methods to remove them yet if we have showed that there are very great hazards in going that way to work for the relief of the patient and that there is a safer and better way and one more peculiarly adapted to this distemper and that carries several great advantages with it of use in the whole course of it after this is certainly to be preferred before any precarious or hazardous method and such an one i published in my last treatise or essay which had so far the approbation of two of the greatest men in this nation one for his unparalled skill in mathematics and natural philosophy the other for his equal reading and experience too in the practical part of physic that the sir isaac newten first of them told me upon his through perusal of my tenth experiment or case with what follows upon it it was a better way than any thing else in the beginning and in a second visit he terthd it a very fair proposal and design the other late bishop of ely dignified person perusing and approving my whole book through told me upon the same passage or experiment that he thought long till he could try it himself so much was he satisfied with the apparent safety and more than probable efficacy of it  however i have not yet attained my end of publishing that piece which was to have the forementioned and some other things fully tried for public use nor have i yet on the contrary received an account of any the least matters of fact nor so much as arguments except what i have mentioned in my preface which i really received urged against the whole or a part so true is it what that highly skilful person in a profession scarce less see hippocratess divine character of a physician lib de decenti ornatu and le clarkes history of physic p    where he tells us that in the most ancient times none but kings priests and grandees were allowed the study and practice of physic sacred than his own and therefore worthy of his study and practice told me viz that i should find it an hard matter to introduce a new invention in medicin the physicians of the town as he had experienced being all inclined tenaciously to follow their own way at least not to admit of any that was more plain and easy what alteration this second treatise of mine which i designed to have been much longer will make i must wait a little while to know  one thing more i shall mention here which is that when i last paid my duty to his lordship he gave me fresh assurances of the goodness of his own plain medicine or that i call his own he having recommended it to me he now again commended the same and told me he had done good things with it  this i speak because its having been laid aside in common practice seems to me for little other reason but because it did not suit the humor of the town when formerly published though it is far more safe and commonly effectual too than those in present vogue which i have given reasons for in that essay but to return  a fourth intention of hippocrates in bleeding was for refreshment or ease the instance there is in the iliack passion but i have given an instance where sydenham has used both that and vomiting for the same intention of acquiring ease and refreshment only in the small pox which is very often better procured another way see p       etc of my beforementioned essay  in the next paragraph he tells us that the conduct of hippocrates was much the same in bleeding as purging in respect of time and persons we ought says he to let blood in acute diseases when they are violent and if the party be lusty and in the flower of his age  in those instances i have given page       of an excessive athletick or full habit of body the flower of youth etc i should not have been against bleeding but for it for the speedy taking off a plethora and for turning the course of the blood as speedily as might be but that this is to be done always and to all persons indifferently who have this distemper and are in youth i must deny and once more appeal to the safer and better practice of dr mapletoft who generally omitted this as we may most reasonably infer from page   as for those circumstances of diseases acute and violent though the small pox is both yet we must not falsely or upon ill grounds draw in hippocratess advice or authority even though the distemper be attended with pain too which is another of his indications for bleeding those distempers he directed it for being quinzies pleurisies etc as is plain in the original which we know by experience not only admit of alleviation or abatement of their pain by bleeding but very often of a most speedy cure too by that alone but the case of the small pox is widely different for the greatest progress we can make toward its finishing its course by this or using other evacuations is only to bring it into act or to make its plain and too commonly very evil appearance but the patient is obliged to undergo almost the whole course of it afterward which how tedious and harassing as well as dangerous a one it is frequently in those cases i my self have sufficiently felt as well as seen these last therefore are no precedents to go by and i wish all who have to do in directing for the cure of this distemper would not insist upon the precepts especially as collected by others or taken from particular cases in hippocrates no ways parallel to ours but would rather follow the practice of this sage and well experienced physician which would most exactly suit this distemper as plainly appears by see again p     fact and in it they would find that he used the greatest caution against evacuations in the beginning of all acute distempers this of bleeding especially which le clark tells us he very seldom used and that in his first and third book of epidemicks which he calls the most finished of his works we find but one single instance and that in a pleurisy so much did he trust to the power of nature whom he endeavored always to support and not by the too often false reliefs of art to weaken and destroy  there is one thing still to be considered with relation to the first question started to my best most honorable and i presume now impartial readers which was whether the rich in this distemper did or did not require different methods of cure from the poor in it the question it self supposing them of something different constitutions and that the rich are not quite so strong and hardy to endure its force as the poor which is the reason given why they cannot likewise go through this distemper but fail commonly before the end of it even when appearances have been good or made so seemingly by art in the beginning which supposition of their being not quite so strong naturally to bear it we must perhaps grant but then it makes highly against the present ordinary practice which is opposite to the authority of the great hippocrates too this passage from him warning or instructing in all violent methods de locis in homine part     si vero morbum fortiorem aegrotum autem debilem acceperis debilibus pharmacis curabis quae ipsum morbum superent and abducant verum aegrotum nihilo debiliorem reddant which plainly signifies i think thus much that if we meet with a strong disease in a weak patient we ought to use milder it is such safe and easy remedies i attempted to bring in practice and should still farther promote others of the like kind could i see any possibility of having repeated and fair trials made of them the causes of opposing those trials appear many of them in this and in my other essay remedies which may diminish or overcome the distemper but not weaken the patients strength now it is to the rich who are either confessed or demonstratively it is thought of a weaker nature that we see daily violent and exhausting remedies are used and not to the poorer but more robust and stronger sort of persons who might perhaps bear them better but do not at all care for the trial as we find by their not only avoiding but even detesting the physicians as much as may be in this disease and for what too apparent reasons they do both is in part showed  tantum books printed
