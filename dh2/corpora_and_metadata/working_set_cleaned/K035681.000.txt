his death and so i must not quarrel with him   enter stately stately mr bootekin i rejoice to see you look so well  though indeed i dont wonder at it  when i consider that you take so much exercise  it will do you good  you have been used to it  being a working man i mean to say   bootekin my dear friend i heartily thank you for what you mean to say  well and how do you do  i suppose you are pretty well  i am heartily glad of it  and so much for compliments  now my dear mr stately    stately perhaps i did not explain myself for you to understand me   bootekin yes you did  and so let us proceed to business   stately mr bootekin your ideas are confused  though indeed how should you have ideas  do you know what an idea is  it is  i will tell you another time what it is  i studied the noble science of the law  it was at the bar i learnt to think   bootekin yes you had leisure enough for thinking then  i believe you never had the trouble to speak at the bar in your life   stately explanation was always my motto   bootekin aside and it suits you just as badly as many other mottos suit those who adopt them  i suppose you have heard how mrs poplin has crowd over me because forsooth i cannot jabber gibberish out of a printed book as fast as she can  now is it not    stately permit me to interrupt you  reading you know  indeed i need not say you know  but i know  that reading    bootekin permit me to interrupt you  i only wish to ask you if my case is not a cursed hard one  after working like a horse to get a fortune i quitted business and came down here to smoke a comfortable pipe  walk about the green fields  look at the trees and enjoy the pleasure of doing nothing  well down i came and bought a large estate here to make myself respected  and respected i was  was complimented by being made churchwarden immediately on my arrival and gave a feast to the parish  the parson declared i spoke monstrous well at the vestry and liked my company so well that he has dined with me three or four times a week  all my letters came directed to robert bootekin esquire  and the member for the county shook me by the hand last election when he came round to canvas  nay sir charles courtly came down from london the other day to dine with me and apologize for not paying two hundred pounds he owes me  now i call this being respected   stately you may call it so mr bootekin  you have not much idea of respect  he he he  i dont mean to offend you  but give me leave to explain to you  it is my opinion    bootekin zounds my dear friend when you were in the law did you give opinions before the case was stated  i was going to tell you that since this irish woman has set it about the town that i am a vulgar dog egad things begin to change  fellows in carters frocks and hobnaild shoes contradict me at the vestry  the parson had the impudence to preach about the badness of my wine at my own table  and egad nobody in the place bow to me now but old women and children and that is only when i give them halfpence  all because forsooth i am a vulgar fellow  zounds how can a man be vulgar with l 0000 in his pocket   stately look ye mr bootekin  i knew you in london  you made shoes for me many years  you are a wellmeaning man and i have a regard for you  but you have been brought up in a low way  and your ideas are confined  he he he your arguments are loud and heavy like a lapstone dropped in a pond  they make a noise for a moment and then sink in the mud  he he he  sink in the mud    bootekin first raising circles in the pond which like your roundabout explanations become wider of the mark every moment till at last they leave no trace of what occasioned them he he he imitating him   stately mr bootekin you are ignoramus as we say in the courts and therefore    bootekin i beg pardon mr stately  i was too warm  aside egad i shall lose the legacy  to him i thank you much for the honor of this visit  this afternoon i give my readings  i will convince you and all the world that i am not a vulgar fellow   stately i shall be very happy to see it mr bootekin he he he  pray do you read yourself    bootekin no  my nephew bob to whom i gave my business will read  he is a smart lad i assure you  and very much of a gentleman though i say it  enter kitty  is bob come home   kitty this very moment sir  he desires to speak to you   bootekin i will introduce him to you mr stately you will be vastly pleased with him  exit stately aside a mighty pretty girl in faith  my dear you seem in a hurry   kitty had you any thing to say to me sir   stately why yes my dear i should like to have something to say to you  aside if i could but tell what  but these girls are so apt to laugh at a middleaged man when he makes love to them that i am half afraid to venture  to her i suppose you have a sweetheart my pretty maid   kitty dear sir what should there be about me for people to fall in love with me   stately oh ho  it will do  to her fall in love with you  why who could help it  come here child  dont be afraid of me   kitty oh dear  no sir i am not at all afraid of you  ha ha ha   stately aside there  now it will not do  she begins to laugh    kitty i am sure sir you are too goodnatured a gentleman   stately yes my dear you will find me so  aside egad it will do after all to her my sweet little kitty will you favor me so far as to  to  enter bootekin and bob bootekin who runs up to stately and shakes him by the hand  to tell em to give my horse some corn  do my dear go directly  exit kitty  aside to be interrupted in such an interesting situation   bob sir i have the honor to be your most obedient devoted very humble servant   bootekin mr stately this is my nephew bob   stately young man i hear you are an orator i suppose you have classical learning   bob classical learning  ho ho ho bless your ignorance  why i went through all the classes  but my genius was too great to remember any thing i learnt at school   stately i must explain to you that without classical learning genius is but a kind of  a  a    bob aye aye  you mean to say it is all my eye   stately all my eye   bob nay if you like it i will take the other side of the question  it is all the same to me  i will engage to speak on any thing for a quarter of an hour at least  what say you to that old gentleman   bootekin mr stately pray excuse my nephews freedom of speech he he  aside to bob at him again bob   bob i perceive sir you have resided in the country lately  you must come to town and visit our disputing society  we have questions to suit every body and i speak upon all questions   stately no doubt and with equal ability  but pray sir dont you find it necessary sometimes to understand your subject   bob not at all sir  i am a natural speaker  never study but say whatever comes uppermost  my opinion is that a speech is a speech if there are but words enough in it  and i am allowed to have the  of saying more in a given time than any speaker in the society   stately i suppose you talk faster   bob exactly so sir  but apropos i can give you a specimen or two of our questions  let me see where are my memorandums  oh here the questions to be debated as they stand in order on our list are first  is war or peace best for this country  we were favored with this question by a navy agent and we expect it will produce a warm debate  second in the list stands the question whether the lady who has black blue or gray eyes is likely to make the best wife    stately a very instructive and amusing speculation    bob  upon charlottes first introduction to werter did not she behave rather ungenteelly in not offering him a dish of tea   stately very material to be ascertained   bob the next  no faith the next question was debated last week out of its turn on account of its peculiar importance and at the desire of several respectable members    stately what may that be   bob is the tinker the tailor or the lamplighter the most useful member of society   stately and how might it have been determined   bob why sir  as our advertisement in the newspapers next day very properly stated  this question gave rise to a most important and interesting debate in which instruction was mingled with amusement  the arguments were from time to time enlivened by the most brilliant flashes of wit and humor from several gentlemen of the firstrate abilities who honored the question with their attention  by the bye i was prodigiously great that night  with their attention  but the variety of material points which presented for discussion protracting the debate to an unusual length and the friends of the lamplighter  i supported him  the friends of the lamplighter wishing for an opportunity of answering the arguments of their opponents the debate was adjourned till next week   stately and pray young mr bootekin do you never touch on politics   bob oh yes sir  politics are my forte  we had a most glorious debate the other day  whether some great men ought not to lose their heads for not doing something  but egad i forget what  however i supported the question and beat dick dab hollow though he sported a dozen latin mottos which he stole from the spectators and tatlers the day before  i sat down amidst a thunder of applause from hands feet and sticks  in short the minister tottered  when within ten minutes of the debate closing in came a posse of treasuryrunners as we suspect who by dint of coughing laughing and hooting put a stop to the debate  a battle ensued between two ladies  the moderator flew into a violent passion  constables were sent for  and the debate ended    stately as most political disputes end  neither party giving up the point  well i must go and pay a few visits to some of my old acquaintance  and    bootekin you will be back time enough for our readings  what d ye think of bob  is not his conversation vastly amusing   stately oh yes  like the bells of a team of horses it makes a pleasant jingling noise though there is no meaning in it  he he he  i dont mean to be severe i assure you  exit bob a stupid old put   bootekin stupid indeed  i never knew him do but one sensible thing in his life  and that was putting my name down in his will  but bob you have not told me what preparations you have made for our readings   bob i have got you plenty of company however  and that is the principal part of the business   bootekin so it is  well and who are we to have eh bob   bob faith i dont know  they are of all sorts like the county militia  however you will have enough of em  our great parlour will be so crammed that we shall not have room to stir   bootekin odds my life that will be comfortable  well show old mother poplin what a rich man can do though he is a vulgar fellow   bob nay what is more i have engaged sam scrape the fiddler to touch up his catgut a little between the readings  and his son will sing   bootekin thank ye my dear bob  odso i am so overjoyed  but what will you read to them  suppose you give them a touch from burns justice or the parish laws   bob oh lord no uncle  here i have made out a bill of the evenings entertainment   bootekin let us see it  why what the devil is all this  overture for two orchestras  sam scrape  john gilpin from stern by mr bootekin  he gave them hailstones for rain  grand chorus  by a young gentleman accompanied on the fiddle by sam scrape  zounds bob what the devil is this   bob fashion sir fashion   bootekin fashion  but what is the reason   bob oh lord sir  reason has nothing to do with fashion   enter wilmot wilmot mr bootekin your most obedient  i have great pleasure in waiting on you with a message from a fair lady  your neighbor mrs poplin   bootekin a fig for mrs poplin

wit   bootekin aye but you must dine with me to taste my wit in perfection  i am told i shine prodigiously at the head of my own table  and egad i believe it is so for people never laugh at my jokes

a friendly trial of skill with your nephew and if he and you are equally desirous of it she invites you to meet her there and to bring all your friends with you  the room is large enough to contain us
