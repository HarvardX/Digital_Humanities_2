the iliad of homer  translated by mr pope  vol ii  quis martem tunica tectum adamantina digne scripserit aut pulvere troico nigrum merionen aut open palladis tydiden superis parem horat london printed by w bowyer for bernard lintot between the templegates       an essay on homers battles perhaps it may be necessary in this place at the opening of homers battles to premise some observations upon them in general i shall first endeavor to show the conduct of the poet herein and next collect some antiquities that tend to a more distinct understanding of those descriptions which make so large a part of the poem  one may very well apply to homer himself what he says of his heroes at the end of the fourth book that whosoever should be guided through their battles by minerva and pointed to every scene of them would see nothing through the whole but subjects of surprise and applause when the reader reflects that no less than the compass of twelve books is taken up in these he will have reason to wonder by what methods our author could prevent descriptions of such a length from being tedious it is not enough to say that though the subject itself be the same the actions are always different that we have now distinct combats now promiscuous fights now single duels now general engagements or that the scenes are perpetually varied we are now in the fields now at the fortification of the greeks now at the ships now at the gates of troy now at the river scamander but we must look farther into the art of the poet to find the reasons of this astonishing variety  we may first observe that diversity in the deaths of his warriors which he has supplied by the vastest fertility of invention that ever was these he distinguishes several ways sometimes by the characters of the men their age office profession nation family etc one is a blooming youth whose father dissuaded him from the war one is a priest whose piety could not save him one is a sportsman whom diana taught in vain one is the native of a fardistant country who is never to return one is descended from a noble line which ends in his death one is made remarkable by his boasting another by his beseeching and another who is distinguished no way else is marked by his habit and the singularity of his armor  sometimes he varies these deaths by the several postures in which his heroes are represented either fighting or falling some of these are so exceedingly exact that one may guess from the very position of the combatant whereabouts the wound will light others so very peculiar and uncommon that they could only be the effect of an imagination which had searched through all the ideas of nature such is that picture of mydon in the fifth book whose arm being numbed by a blow on the elbow drops the reins that trail on the ground and then being suddenly struck on the temples falls headlong from the chariot in a soft and deep place where he sinks up to the shoulders in the sands and continues a while fixed by the weight of his armor with his legs quivering in the air till he is trampled down by his horses  another cause of this variety is the difference of the wounds that are given in the ilaid they are by no means like the wounds described by most other poets which are commonly made in the selfsame obvious places the heart and head serve for all those in general who understand no anatomy and sometimes for variety they kill men by wounds that are no where mortal but in their poems as the whole human body is the subject of these so nothing is more necessary to him who would describe them well than a thorough knowledge of its structure even though the poet is not professedly to write of them as an anatomist in the same manner as an exact skill in anatomy is necessary to those painters that would excel in drawing the naked though they are not to make every muscle as visible as in a book of surgery it appears from so many passages in homer that he was perfectly master of this science that it would be needless to cite any in particular one may only observe that if we thoroughly examine all the wounds he has described though so infinite in number and so many ways diversified we shall hardly find one which will contradict this observation  i must just add a remark that the various periphrases and circumlocutions by which homer expresses the single act of dying have supplied virgil and the succeeding poets with all their manners of phrasing it indeed he repeats the same verse on that occasion more often than they   etc but though it must be owned he had more frequent occasions for a line of this kind than any poet as no other has described half so many deaths yet one cannot ascribe this to any sterility of expression but to the genius of his times that delighted in those reiterated verses we find repetitions of the same sort affected by the sacred writers such as he was gathered to his people he slept with his fathers and the like and upon the whole they have a certain antiquated harmony not unlike the burden of a song which the ear is willing to suffer and as it were rests upon  as the perpetual horror of combats and a succession of images of death could not but keep the imagination very much on the stretch homer has been careful to contrive such reliefs and pauses as might divert the mind to some other scene without losing sight of his principal object his comparisons are the more frequent on this account for a comparison serves this end the most effectually of any thing as it is at once correspondent to and differing from the subject those critics who fancy that the use of comparisons distracts the attention and draws it from the first image which should most employ it as that we lose the idea of the battle itself while we are led by a simile to that of a deluge or a storm those i say may as well imagine we lose the thought of the sun when we see his reflection in the water where he appears more distinctly and is contemplated more at ease than if we gazed directly at his beams for it is with the eye of the imagination as with our corporeal eye it must sometimes be taken off from the object in order to see in the better the same critics that are displeased to have their fancy distracted as they call it are yet so inconsistent with themselves as to object to homer that his similes are too much alike and are too often derived from the same animal but is it not more reasonable according to their own notion to compare the same man always to the same animal than to see him sometimes a sun sometimes a tree and sometimes a river though homer speaks of the same creature he so diversifies the circumstances and accidents of the comparisons that they always appear quite different and to say truth it is not so much the animal or the thing as the action or posture of them that employs our imagination two different animals in the same action are more like to each other than one and the same animal is to himself in two different actions and those who in reading homer are shocked that it is always a lion may as well be angry that it is always a man  what may seem more exceptionable is his inserting the same comparisons in the same words at length upon different occasions by which management he makes one single image afford many ornaments to several parts of the poem but may not one say homer is in this like a skilful improver who places a beautiful statue in a welldisposed garden so as to answer several vistas and by that artifice one single figure seems multiplied into as many objects as there are openings from whence it may be viewed  what farther relieves and softens these descriptions of battles is the poets wonderful art of introducing many pathetick circumstances about the deaths of the heroes which raise a different movement in the mind from what those images naturally inspire i mean compassion and pity when he causes us to look back upon the lost riches possessions and hopes of those who die when he transports us to their native countries and paternal seats to see the griefs of their aged fathers the despair and tears of their widows or the abandoned condition of their orphans thus when protesilaus falls we are made to reflect on the lofty palaces he left half finished when the sons of phenops are killed we behold the mortifying distress of their wealthy father who saw his estate divided before his eyes and taken in trust for strangers when axylus dies we are taught to compassionate the hard fate of that generous and hospitable man whose house was the house of all men and who deserved that glorious elogy of the friend of humankind  it is worth taking notice too what use homer every where makes of each little accident or circumstance that can naturally happen in a battle thereby to cast a variety over his action as well as of every turn of mind or emotion a hero can possibly feel such as resentment revenge concern confusion etc the former of these makes his work resemble a large historypiece where even the less important figures and actions have yet some convenient place or corner to be shown in and the latter gives it all the advantages of tragedy in those various turns of passion that animate the speeches of his heroes and render his whole poem the most dramatick of any epick whatsoever  it must also be observed that the constant machines of the gods conduce very greatly to vary these long battles by a continual change of the scene from earth to heaven homer perceived them too necessary for this purpose to abstain from the use of them even after jupiter had enjoined the deities not to act on either side it is remarkable how many methods he has found to draw them into every book where if they dare not assist the warriors at least they are very helpful to the poet  but there is nothing that more contributes to the variety surprise and eclat of homers battles or is more perfectly admirable in itself than that artful manner of taking measure or as one may say gaging his heroes by each other and thereby elevating the character of one person by the opposition of it to that of some other whom he is made to excel so that he many times describes one only to image another and raises one only to raise another i cannot better exemplify this remark than by giving an instance in the character of diomed that lies before me let us observe by what a scale of oppositions he elevates this hero in the fifth book first to excel all human valor and after to rival the gods themselves he distinguishes him first from the grecian captains in general each of whom he represents conquering a single trojan while diomed constantly encounters two at once and while they are engaged each in his distinct post he only is drawn fighting in every quarter and slaughtering on every side next he opposes him to pandarus next to aeneas and then to hector so of the gods he shows him first against venus then apollo then mars and lastly in the eighth book against jupiter himself in the midst of his thunders the same conduct is observable more or less in regard to every personage of his work  this subordination of the heroes is one of the causes that make each of his battles rise above the other in greatness terror and importance to the end of the poem if diomed has performed all these wonders in the first combats it is but to raise hector at whose appearance he begins to fear if in the next battles hector triumphs not only over diomed but over ajax and patroclus sets fire to the fleet wins the armor of achilles and singly eclipses all the heroes in the midst of all this glory achilles appears hector flies and is slain  the manner in which his gods are made to act no less advances the gradation we are speaking of in the first battles they are seen only in short and separate excursions venus assists paris minerva diomed or mars hector in the next a clear stage is left for jupiter to display his omnipotence and turn the fate of armies alone in the last all the powers of heaven are let down and banded into regular parties gods encountering gods jove encouraging them with his thunders neptune raising his tempests heaven flaming earth trembling and pluto himself starting from the throne of hell  i am now to take notice of some customs of antiquity relating to the arms and art military of those times which are proper to be known in order to form a right notion of our authors descriptions of war  that homer copied the manners and customs of the age he writ of rather than of that he lived in has been observed in some instances as that he no where represents cavalry or trumpets to have been used in the trojan wars though they apparently were in his own time it is not therefore impossible but there may be found in his works some deficiencies in the art of war which are not to be imputed to his ignorance but to his judgment  horses had not been brought into greece long before the siege of troy they were originally eastern animals and if we find at that very period so great a number of them reckoned up in the wars of the israelites it is the less a wonder considering they came from asia the practice of riding them was so little known in greece a few years before that they looked upon the centaurs who first used it as monsters compounded of men and horses nestor in the first iliad says he had seen these centaurs in his youth and polypaetes in the second is said to have been born on the day that his father expelled them from pelion to the deserts of aethica they had no other use of horses than to draw their chariots in battle so that whenever homer speaks of fighting from an horse taming an horse or the like it is constantly to be understood of fighting from a chariot or taming horses to that service this as we have said was a piece of decorum in the poet for in his own time they were arrived to such a perfection in horsemanship that in the fifteenth iliad   0 we have a simile taken from an extraordinary feat of activity where one man manages four horses at once and leaps from the back of one to another at full speed  if we consider in what high esteem among warriors these noble animals must have been at their first coming into greece we shall the less wonder at the frequent occasions homer has taken to describe and celebrate them it is not so strange to find them set almost upon a level with men at the time when a horse in the prizes was of equal value with a captive  the chariots were in all probability very low for we frequently find in the iliad that a person who stands erect on a chariot is killed and sometimes by a stroke on the head by a footsoldier with a sword this may farther appear from the ease and readiness with which they alight or mount on every occasion to facilitate which the chariots were made open behind that the wheels were but small may be guest from a custom they had of taking them off and setting them on as they were laid by or made use of hebe in the fifth book puts on the wheels of junos chariot when she calls for it in haste and it seems to be with allusion to the same practice that it is said in exodus chapter    the lord took off their chariot wheels so that they drove them heavily the sides were also low for whoever is killed in his chariot throughout the poem constantly falls to the ground as having nothing to support him that the whole machine was very small and light is evident from a passage in the tenth iliad where diomed having taken a chariot debates whether he shall draw it out of the way or carry it on his shoulders to a place of safety all these particulars agree with the representations of the chariots on the most ancient greek coins where the tops of them reach not so high as the backs of the horses the wheels are yet lower and the heroes who stand in them are seen from the knee upwards see the collection of goltzius etc this may serve to show those critics are under a mistake who blame homer for making his warriors sometimes retire behind their chariots as if it were a piece of cowardice which was as little disgraceful then as it is now to alight from ones horse in a battle on any necessary emergency  there were generally two persons in each chariot one of whom was wholly employed in guiding the horses they used indifferently two three or four horses from hence it happens that sometimes when a horse is killed the hero continues the fight with the two or more that remain and at other times a warrior retreats upon the loss of one not that he has less courage than the other but that he has fewer horses  their swords were all broad cutting swords for we find they never stab but with their spears the spears were used two ways either to push with or to cast from them like the missive javelins it seems surprising that a man should throw a dart or spear with such force as to pierce through both sides of the armor and the body as is often described in homer for if the strength of the men was gigantick the armor must have been strong in proportion some solution might be given for this if we imagined the armor was generally brass and the weapons pointed with iron and if we could fancy that homer called the spears and swords brazen in the same manner that he calls the reins of a bridle ivory only from the ornaments about them but there are passages where the point of the spear is expressly said to be of brass as in the description of that of hector in iliad     0 pausanias in laconicis takes it for granted that the arms as well offensive as defensive were brass he says the spear of achilles was kept in his time in the temple of minerva the top and point of which were of brass and the sword of meriones in that of aesculapius among the nicomedians was entirely of the same metal but be it as it will there are examples even at this day of such a prodigious force in casting darts as almost exceeds credibility the turks and arabs will pierce through thick planks with darts of hardened wood which can only be attributed to their being bred as the ancients were to that exercise and to the strength and agility acquired by a constant practice of it  we may ascribe to the same cause their power of casting stones of a vast weight which appears a common practice in these battles those are in a great error who imagine this to be only a fictitious embellishment of the poet which was one of the exercises of war among the ancient greeks and orientals mos est in urbibus palestinae and usque hodie per omnem judaeam vetus consuetudo servatur ut in viculis oppidis and castellis rotundi ponantur lapides gravissimi ponderis ad quos juvenes exercere se solent and eos pro varietate virium sublevare alii ad genua alii ad umbilicum alii ad humeros ad caput non nulli super verticem rectis junctisque manibus magnitudinem virium demonstrantes pondus attollunt st jerome tells us it was an old custom in palestine and in use in his own time to have round stones of a great weight kept in the castles and villages for the youth to try their strength with and the custom is yet extant in some parts of scotland where stones for the same purpose are laid at the gates of great houses which they call puttingstones  another consideration which will account for many things that may seem uncouth in homer is the reflection that before the use of firearms there was infinitely more scope for personal valor than in the modern battles now whenever the personal strength of the combatants happened to be unequal the declining a single combat could not be so dishonorable as it is in this age when the arms we make use of put all men on a level for a soldier of far inferior strength may manage a rapier or firearms so expertly as to be an overmatch to his adversary this may appear a sufficient excuse for what in the modern construction might seem cowardice in homers heroes when they avoid engaging with others whose bodily strength exceeds their own the maxims of valor in all times were founded upon reason and the cowardice ought rather in this case to be imputed to him who braves his inferior there was also more leisure in their battles before the knowledge of firearms and this in a good degree accounts for those harangues his heroes make to each other in the time of combat  there was another practice frequently used by these ancient warriors which was to spoil an enemy of his arms after they had slain him and this custom we see them frequently pursuing with such eagerness as if they looked on their victory not complete till this point was gained some modern critics have accused them of avarice on account of this practice which might probably arise from the great value and scarceness of armor in that early time and infancy of war it afterward became a point of honor like gaining a standard from the enemy moses and david speak of the pleasure of obtaining many spoils they preserved them as monuments of victory and even religion at last became interested herein when those spoils were consecrated in the temples of the tutelar deities of the conqueror  the reader may easily see i set down these heads just as they occur to my memory and only as hints to farther observations which any one who is conversant in homer can not fail to make if he will but think a little in the same track  it is no part of my design to enquire what progress had been made in the art of war at this early period the bare perusal of the iliad will best inform us of it but what i think tends more immediately to the better comprehension of these descriptions is to give a short view of the scene of war the situation of troy and those places which homer mentions with the proper field of each battle putting together for this purpose those passages in my author that give any light to this matter  the ancient city of troy stood at a greater distance from the sea than those ruins which have since been shown for it this may be gathered from iliad   of the original     where it is said that the trojans never durst sally out of the walls of their town till the retirement of achilles but afterward combated the grecians at their very ships far from the city for had troy stood as strabo observes so nigh the seashore it had been madness in the greeks not to have built any fortification before their fleet till the tenth year of the siege when the enemy was so near them and on the other hand it had been cowardice in the trojans not to have attempted any thing all that time against an army that lay unfortifyd and unintrenchd besides the intermediate space had been too small to afford a field for so many various adventures and actions of war the places about troy particularly mentioned by homer lie in this order   the scaean gate this opened to the field of battle and was that through which the trojans made their excursions close to this stood the beechtree sacred to jupiter which homer generally mentions with it   the hill of wild fig trees it joined to the walls of troy on one side and extended to the highway on the other the first appears from what andromache says in iliad       that the walls were in danger of being scaled from this hill and the last from il        etc   the two springs of scamander these were a little higher on the same highway  ibid   callicolone the name of a pleasant hill that lay near the river simois on the other side of the town il  0      bateia or the sepulcher of myrinne stood a little before the city in the plain il       of the catal   the monument of ilus near the middle of the plain il          the tomb of aesyetes commanded the prospect of the fleet and that part of the seacoast il    0  of the catalogue   it seems by the     th verse of the second iliad that the grecian army was drawn up under the several leaders by the banks of scamander on that side toward the ships in the mean time that of troy and the auxiliaries was ranged in order at myrinnes sepulcher ibid   0 of the catal the place of the first battle where diomed performs his exploits was near the joining of simois and scamander for juno and pallas coming to him alight at the confluence of those rivers il       and that the greeks had not yet past the stream but fought on that side next the fleet appears from     of the same book where juno says the trojans now brave them at their very ships but in the beginning of the sixth book the place of battle is specified to be between the rivers of simois and scamander so that the greeks though homer does not particularize when or in what manner had then crossed the stream toward troy  the engagement in the eighth book is evidently close to the grecian fortification on the shore that night hector lay at iluss tomb in the field as dolon tells us lib  0     and in the eleventh book the battle is chiefly about iluss tomb  in the twelfth thirteenth and fourteenth about the fortification of the greeks and in the fifteenth at the ships  in the sixteenth the trojans being repulsed by patroclus they engage between the fleet the river and the grecian wall see     patroclus still advancing they fight at the gates of troy  00 in the seventeenth the fight about the body of patroclus is under the trojan wall  0  his body being carried off hector and aeneas pursue the greeks to the fortification   0 and in the eighteenth upon achilless appearing they retire and encamp without the fortification  in the twentieth the fight is still on that side next the sea for the trojans being pursued by achilles pass over the scamander as they run toward troy see the beginning of book    the following battles are either in the river itself or between that and the city under whose walls hector is killed in the twenty second book which puts an end to the battles of the iliad  the fifth book of the iliad the argument the acts of diomed diomed assisted by pallas performs wonders in this days battle pandarus wounds him with an arrow but the goddess cures him enables him to discern gods from mortals and prohibits him from contending with any of the former excepting venus aeneas joins pandarus to oppose him pandarus is killed and aeneas in great danger but for the assistance of venus who as she is removing her son from the fight is wounded on the hand by diomed apollo seconds her in his rescue and at length carries off aeneas to troy where he is healed in the temple of pergamus mars rallies the trojans and assists hector to make a stand in the mean time aeneas is restored to the field and they overthrow several of the greeks among the rest tlepolemus is slain by sarpedon juno and minerva descend to resist mars the latter incites diomed to go against that god he wounds him and sends him groaning to heaven  the first battle continues through this book the scene is the same as in the former  the fifth book of the iliad but pallas now tydides soul inspires fills with her force and warms with all her fires above the greeks his deathless fame to raise and crown her hero with distinguished praise high on his helm celestial lightnings play his beamy shield emits a living ray the unwearied blaze incessant streams supplies like the red star that fires the autumnal skies when fresh he rears his radiant orb to sight and bathed in ocean shoots a keener light such glories pallas on the chief bestowed such from his arms the fierce effulgence flowed onward she drives him furious to engage where the fight burns and where the thickest rage the sons of dares first the combat sought a wealthy priest but rich without a fault in vulcans fane the fathers days were led the sons to toils of glorious battle bred these singled from their troops the fight maintain these from their steeds tydides on the plain fierce for renown the brother chiefs draw near and first bold phegeus cast his sounding spear which over the warriors shoulder took its course and spent in empty air its erring force not so tydides flew thy lance in vain but pierced his breast and stretched him on the plain seized with unusual fear idaeus fled left the rich chariot and his brother dead and had not vulcan

thus toiled the chiefs in different parts engaged in every quarter fierce tydides raged amid the greek amid the trojan train rapt through the ranks he thunders over the plain now here now there he

her shall thou wound so pallas gives command with that the blueeyd virgin winged her flight the hero rushed impetuous to the fight with tenfold ardor now invades the plain wild with delay and more enraged by pain as on the fleecy flocks when hunger calls amidst the field a brindled lion falls if chance some shepherd with a distant dart the savage wound he rowzes at the smart he foams he roars the shepherd dares not stay but trembling leaves the scattering flocks a prey heaps fall on heaps he bathes with blood the ground then leaps victorious over the lofty mound not with less fury stern

that chief some guardian of the skies involved in clouds protects him in the fray and turns unseen the frustrate dart away i winged an arrow which not idly fell the stroke had fixed him to the gates of hell and but some god some angry god withstands his fate was due to these unerring hands skilled in the bow on foot i sought the war nor joined swift horses to the rapid car ten polished chariots i possessed at home and still they grace lycaons princely dome there veiled in spacious coverlets they stand and twice ten coursers wait their lords command the good old warrior bade me trust to these when first for troy i sailed the sacred seas in fields aloft the whirling car to guide and through the ranks of death triumphant ride but vain with youth and yet to thrift inclined i heard his counsels with unheedful mind and thought the steeds your large supplies unknown might fail of forage in the straightened town so took my bow and pointed darts in hand and left the chariots in my native land too late o friend my rashness i deplore these shafts once fatal carry death no more tydeus and atreus sons their points have found and undissembled gore pursued the wound in vain they bled this unavailing bow serves not to slaughter but provoke the foe in evil hour these bended horns i strung and seized the quiver where it idly hung cursed be the fate that sent me to the field without a warriors arms the spear and shield if ever with life i quit the trojan plain if ever i see my spouse and sire again this bow unfaithful to my glorious aims broke by my hand shall feed the blazing flames to whom the leader of the dardan race be calm nor phoebus honored gift disgrace the distant dart be praised though here we need the rushing chariot and the bounding steed against yon hero let us bend our course and hand to hand encounter force with force now haste ascend my seat and from the car observe my fathers steeds renowned in war practiced alike to turn to stop to chase to dare the shock or urge the rapid race secure with these through fighting fields we go or safe to troy if jove assist the foe haste seize the whip and snatch the guiding rein the warriors fury let this arm sustain or if to combat thy bold heart incline take thou the spear the chariots care be mine o prince  lycaons valiant son replied as thine the steeds be thine the task to guide the horses practiced to their lords command shall hear the rein and answer to thy hand but if unhappy we desert the fight thy voice alone can animate their flight else shall our fates be numbered with the dead and these the victors prize in triumph led thine be the guidance then with spear and shield my self will charge this terror of the field and now both heroes mount the glittering car the bounding coursers rush amidst the war their fierce approach bold sthenelus espied who thus alarmed to great tydides cried o friend two chiefs of force immense i see dreadful they come and bend their rage on thee lo the brave heir of old lycaons line and great aeneas sprung from race divine enough is given to fame ascend thy car and save a life the bulwark of our war at this the hero cast a gloomy look fixed on the chief with scorn and thus he spoke me do thou bid to shun the coming fight me would thou move to base inglorious flight know it is not honest in my soul to fear nor was tydides born to tremble here i loath in lazy fights to press the car at distance wound or wage a flying war but while my nerves are strung my force entire thus front the foe and emulate my sire nor shall yon steeds that fierce to fight convey those threatening heroes bear them both away one chief at least beneath this arm shall die so pallas tells me and forbids to fly but if she dooms and if no god withstand that both shall fall by one victorious hand then heed my words my horses here detain fixed to the chariot by the straightened rein swift to aeneas empty seat proceed and seize the coursers of aetherial breed the race of those which once the thundering god for ravished ganymede on tros bestowed the best that ever on earths broad surface run beneath the rising or the setting sun hence great anchises stole a breed unknown by mortal mares from fierce laomedon four of this race his ample stalls contain and two transport aeneas over the plain these were the rich immortal prize our own through the wide world should make our glory known thus while they spoke the foe came furious on and stern lycaons warlike race begun prince thou art met though late in vain assailed the spear may enter where the arrow failed he said then shook the pondrous lance and flung on his broad shield the sounding weapon rung pierced the tough orb and in his cuirass hung he bleeds the pride of greece the boaster cries our triumph now the mighty warrior lies mistaken vaunter diomed replied thy dart has erred and now my spear be tried ye escape not both one headlong from his car with hostile blood shall glut the god of war he spoke and rising hurled his forceful dart which driven by pallas pierced a vital part full in his face it entered and betwixt the nose and eyeball the proud lycian fixed crashd all his jaws and cleft the tongue within till the bright point looked out beneath the chin headlong he falls his helmet knocks the ground earth groans beneath him and his arms resound the starting coursers tremble with affright the soul indignant seeks the realms of night to guard his slaughtered friend aeneas flies his spear extending where the carcass lies watchful he wheels protects it every way as the grim lion stalks around his prey over the fallen trunk his ample shield displayed he hides the hero with his mighty shade and threats aloud the greeks with longing eyes behold at distance but forbear the prize then fierce tydides stoops and from the fields heaved with vast force a rocky fragment wields not two strong men the enormous weight could raise such men as live in these degenerate days he swung it round and gathering strength to throw discharged the ponderous ruin at the foe where to the hip the inserted thigh unites full on the bone the pointed marble lights through both the tendons broke the rugged stone and stripped the skin and cracked the solid bone sunk on his knees and staggring with his pains his falling bulk his bended arm sustains lost in a dizzy mist the warrior lies a sudden cloud comes swimming over his eyes there the brave chief who mighty numbers swayed oppressed had sunk to deaths eternal shade but heavenly venus mindful of the love she bore anchises in the idaean grove his danger views with anguish and despair and guards her offspring with a mothers care about her muchloved son her arms she throws her arms whose whiteness matched the falling snows screend from the foe behind her shining veil the swords wave harmless and the javelins fail safe through the rushing horse and feathered flight of sounding shafts she bears him from the fight nor sthenelus with unassisting hands remained unheedful of his lords commands his panting steeds removed from out the war he fixed with straightened traces to the car next rushing to the dardan spoil detains the heavenly coursers with the flowing manes these in proud triumph to the fleet conveyed no longer now a trojan lord obeyed that charge to bold deipylus he gave whom most he loved as brave men love the brave then mounting on his car resumed the rein and followed where tydides swept the plain meanwhile his conquest ravished from his eyes the raging chief in chase of venus flies no goddess she commissioned to the field like pallas dreadful with her sable shield or fierce bellona thundering at the wall while flames ascend and mighty ruins fall he knew soft combats suit the tender dame new to the field and still a foe to fame through breaking ranks his furious course he bends and at the goddess his broad lance extends through her bright veil the daring weapon drove the ambrosial veil which all the graces wove her snowie hand the razing steel profaned and the transparent skin with crimson stained from the clear vein a stream immortal flowed such stream as issues from a wounded god pure emanation uncorrupted flood unlike our gross diseased terrestrial blood for not the bread of man their life sustains no wines inflaming juice supplies their veins with tender shrieks the goddess filled the place and dropped her offspring from her weak embrace him phoebus took he casts a cloud around the fainting chief and wards the mortal wound then with a voice that shook the vaulted skies the king insults the goddess as she flies ill with joves daughter bloody fights agree the field of combat is no scene for thee go let thy own soft sex employ thy care go lull the coward or delude the fair taught by this stroke renounce the wars alarms and learn to tremble at the name of arms tydides thus the goddess seized with dread confused distracted from the conflict fled to aid her swift the winged iris flew wrapped in a mist above the warring crew the queen of love with faded charms she found pale was her cheek and livid looked the wound to mars who sat remote they bent their way far on the left with clouds involved he lay beside him stood his lance distained with gore and reind with gold his foaming steeds before low at his knee she begged with streaming eyes her brothers car to mount the distant skies and showed the wound by fierce tydides given a mortal man who dares encounter heaven stern mars attentive hears the queen complain and to her hand commits the golden rein she mounts the seat oppressed with silent woe driven by the goddess of the painted bow the lash resounds the rapid chariot flies and in a moment scales the lofty skies there stopped the car and there the coursers stood fed by fair iris with ambrosial food before her mother loves bright queen appears overwhelmed with anguish and dissolved in tears she raised her in her arms beheld her bleed and asked what god had wrought this guilty deed then she this insult from no god i found an impious mortal gave the daring wound behold the deed of haughty diomed twas in the sons defense the mother bled the war with troy no more the grecians wage but with the gods the immortal gods engage dione then thy wrongs with patience bear and share those griefs inferior powers must share unnumberd woes mankind from us sustain and men with woes afflict the gods again the mighty mars in mortal fetters bound and lodged in brazen dungeons under ground full thirteen moons imprisoned roared in vain otus and ephialtes held the chain perhaps had perished had not hermes care restored the groaning god to upper air great junos self has born her weight of pain the imperial partner of the heavenly reign amphitryons son infixd the deadly dart and filled with anguish her immortal heart even hells grim king alcides power confessed the shaft found entrance in his iron breast to joves high palace for a cure he fled pierced in his own dominions of the dead where paeon sprinkling heavenly balm around asswagd the glowing pangs and closed the wound rash impious man to stain the blessed abodes and drench his arrows in the blood of gods but thou though pallas urged thy frantic deed whose spear illfated makes a goddess bleed know thou whoever with heavenly power contends short is his date and soon his glory ends from fields of death when late he shall retire no infant on his knees shall call him sire strong as thou art some god may yet be found to stretch thee pale and gasping on the ground thy distant wife aegiale the fair starting from sleep with a distracted air shall rowze thy slaves and her lost lord deplore the brave the great the glorious now no more this said she wiped from venus wounded palm the sacred ichor and infused the balm juno and pallas with a smile surveyed and thus to jove began the blueeyd maid permit thy daughter gracious jove to tell how this mischance the cyprian queen befell as late she tried with passion to inflame the tender bosom of a grecian dame allured the fair with moving thoughts of joy to quit her country for some youth of troy the clasping zone with golden buckles bound razed her soft hand with this lamented wound the sire of gods and men superior smiled and calling venus thus addressed his child not these o daughter are thy proper cares thee milder arts befit and softer wars sweet smiles are thine and kind endearing charms to mars and pallas leave the deeds of arms thus they in heaven while on the plain below the fierce tydides charged his dardan foe flushed with celestial blood pursued his way and fearless dared the threatening god of day already in his hopes he saw him killed though screend behind apollos mighty shield thrice rushing furious at the chief he struck his blazing buckler thrice apollo shook he tried the fourth when breaking from the cloud a more than mortal voice was heard aloud o son of tydeus cease be wise and see how vast the difference of the gods and thee distance immense between the powers that shine above eternal deathless and divine and mortal man a wretch of humble birth a shortlived reptile in the dust of earth so spoke the god who darts celestial fires he dreads his fury and some steps retires then phoebus bore the chief of venus race to troys high fane and to his holy place latona there and phoebe healed the wound with vigor armed him and with glory crowned this done the patron of the silver bow a phantom raised the same in shape and show with great aeneas such the form he bore and such in fight the radiant arms he wore around the spectre bloody wars are waged and greece and troy with clashing shields engaged meantime on ilions tower apollo stood and calling mars thus urged the raging god stern power of arms by whom the mighty fall who bathe in blood and shake the embatteld wall rise in thy wrath to hells abhorred abodes dispatch yon greek and vindicate the gods first rosy venus felt his brutal rage me next he charged and dares all heaven engage the wretch would brave high heavens immortal sire his triple thunder and his bolts of fire the god of battle issues on the plain stirs all the ranks and fires the trojan train in form like acamas the thracian guide enraged to troys retiring chiefs he cried how long ye sons of priam will ye fly and unrevenged see priams people die still unresisted shall the foe destroy and stretch the slaughter to the gates of troy lo brave aeneas sinks beneath his wound not godlike hector more in arms renowned haste all and take the generous warriors part he said new courage swelled each heros heart sarpedon first his ardent soul expressed and turned to hector these bold words addressed say chief is all thy ancient valor lost where are thy threats and where thy glorious boast that propt alone by priams race should stand troys sacred walls nor need a foreign hand now now thy country calls her wanted friends and the proud vaunt in just derision ends remote they stand while alien troops engage like trembling hounds before the lions rage far distant hence i held my wide command where foaming xanthus laves the lycian land with ample wealth the wish of mortals blessed a beauteous wife and infant at her breast with those i left whatever dear could be greece if she conquers nothing wins from me yet first in fight my lycian bands i cheer and long to meet this mighty man ye fear while hector idle stands nor bids the brave their wives their infants and their altars save haste warrior haste preserve thy threatened state or one vast burst of allinvolving fate full over your towers shall fall and sweep away sons sires and wives an undistinguished prey rowze all thy trojans urge thy aids to fight these claim thy thoughts by day thy watch by night with force incessant the brave greeks oppose such cares thy friends deserve and such thy foes stung to the heart the generous hector hears but just reproof with decent silence bears from his proud car the prince impetuous springs on earth he leaps his brazen armor rings two shining spears are brandished in his hands thus armed he animates his drooping bands revives their ardor turns their steps from flight and wakes anew the dying flames of fight they turn they stand the greeks their fury dare condense their powers and wait the growing war as when on ceres sacred floor the swain spreads the wide fan to clear the golden grain and the light chaff before the breezes born ascends in clouds from off the heapy corn the gray dust rising with collected winds drives over the barn and whitens all the hinds so white with dust the grecian host appears from trampling steeds and thundering charioteers the dusky clouds from labored earth arise and roll in smoking volumes to the skies mars hovers over them with his sable shield and adds new horrors to the darkened field pleased with his charge and ardent to fulfill in troys defense apollos heavenly will soon as from fight the blueeyd maid retires each trojan bosom with new warmth he fires and now the god from forth his sacred fane produced aeneas to the shouting train alive unharmd with all his peers around erect he stood and vigorous from his wound enquiries none they made the dreadful day no pause of words admits no dull delay fierce discord storms apollo loud exclaims fame calls mars thunders and the fields in flames stern diomed with either ajax stood and great ulysses bathed in hostile blood embodied close the laboring grecian train the fiercest shock of charging hosts sustain unmoved and silent the whole war they wait serenely dreadful and as fixed as fate so when the embatteld clouds in dark array along the skies their gloomy lines display when now the north his boisterous rage has spent and peaceful sleeps the liquid element the lowhung vapors motionless and still rest on the summits of the shaded hill till the mass scatters as the winds arise dispersed and kroken through the ruffled skies nor was the general wanting to his train from troop to troop he toils through all the plain ye greeks be men the charge of battle bear your brave associates and yourselves revere let glorious acts more glorious acts inspire and catch from breast to breast the noble fire on valors side the odds of combat lie the brave live glorious or lamented die the wretch who trembles in the field of fame meets death and worse than death eternal shame these words he seconds with his flying lance to meet whose point was strong deicoons chance aeneas friend and in his native place honored and loved like priams royal race long had he fought the foremost in the field but now the monarchs lance transpiercd his shield his shield too weak the furious dart to stay through his broad belt the weapon forced its way the grizly wound dismissed his soul to hell his arms around him rattled as he fell then fierce aeneas brandishing his blade in dust orsilochus and crethon laid whose sire diocleus wealthy brave and great in well built pherae held his lofty seat sprung from alpheus plenteous stream that yields increase of harvests to the pylian fields he got orsilochus diocleus he and these descended in the third degree too early expert in the martial toil in sable ships they left their native soil tavenge atrides now untimely slain they fell with glory on the phrygian plain so two young mountain lions nursed with blood in deep recesses of the gloomy wood rush fearless to the plains and uncontrolled depopulate the stalls and waste the fold till pierced at distance from their native den oerpowrd they fall beneath the force of men prostrate on earth their beauteous bodies lay like mountain firs as tall and strait as they great menelaus views with pitying eyes lifts his bright lance and at the victor flies mars urged him on yet ruthless in his hate the god but urged him to provoke his fate he thus advancing nestors valiant son shakes for his danger and neglects his own struck with the thought should helens lord be slain and all his countrys glorious labors vain already met the threatening heroes stand the spears already tremble in their hand in rushed antilochus his aid to bring and fall or conquer by the spartan king these seen the dardan backward turned his course brave as he was and shunned unequal force the breathless bodies to the greeks they drew then mix in combat and their toils renew first pylaemenes great in battle bled who sheathed in brass the paphlagonians led atrides marked him where sublime he stood fixed in his throat the javelin drank his blood the faithful mydon as he turned from fight his flying coursers sunk to endless night a broken rock by nestors son was thrown his bended arm received the falling stone from his numbed hand the ivrystudded reins dropped in the dust are traild along the plains meanwhile his temples feel a deadly wound he groans in death and pondrous sinks to ground deep drove his helmet in the sands and there the head stood fixed the quivering legs in air till trampled flat beneath the coursers feet the youthful victor mounts his empty seat and bears the prize in triumph to the fleet great hector saw and raging at the view pours on the greeks the trojan troops pursue he fires his host with animating cries and brings along the furies of the skies mars stern destroyer and bellona dread flame in the front and thunder at their head this swells the tumult and the rage of fight that shakes a spear that casts a dreadful light where hector marched the god of battles shined now stormed before him and now raged behind tydides paused amidst his full carrier then first the heros manly breast knew fear as when some simple swain his cot forsakes and wide through fens an unknown journey takes if chance a swelling brook his passage stay and foam impervious cross the wandrers way confused he stops a length of country past eyes the rough waves and tired returns at last amazed no less the great tydides stands he stayed and turning thus addressed his bands no wonder greeks that all to hector yield secure of favoring gods he takes the field his strokes they second and avert our spears behold where mars in mortal arms appears retire then warriors but sedate and slow retire but with your faces to the foe trust not too much your unavailing might it is not with troy but with the gods ye fight now near the greeks the black battalions drew and first two leaders valiant hector slew his force anchialus and mnesthes found in every art of glorious war renowned in the same car the chiefs to combat ride and fought united and united died struck at the sight the mighty ajax glows with thirst of vengeance and assaults the foes his massy spear with matchless fury sent through amphius belt and heaving belly went amphius apaesus happy soil possessed with herds abounding and with treasure blessed but fate resistless from his country led the chief to perish at his peoples head shook with his fall his brazen armor rung and fierce to seize it conquering ajax sprung around his head an iron tempest rained a wood of spears his ample shield sustained beneath one foot the yetwarm corpse he pressed and drew his javelin from the bleeding breast he could no more the showring darts denied to spoil his glittering arms and plumy pride now foes on foes came pouring on the fields with bristling lances and compacted shields till in the steely circle straightened round forced he gives way and sternly quits the ground while thus they strive tlepolemus the great urged by the force of unresisted fate burns with desire sarpedons strength to prove alcides offspring meets the son of jove sheathed in bright arms each adverse chief came on joves great descendent and his greater son prepared for combat ere the lance he tossed the daring rhodian vents his haughty boast what brings this lycian counselor so far to tremble at our arms not mix in war know thy vain self nor let their flattery move who style thee son of cloudcompelling jove how far unlike those chiefs of race divine how vast the difference of their deeds and thine jove got such heroes as my sire whose soul no fear could daunt nor earth nor hell control troy felt his arm and yon proud ramparts stand raised on the ruins of his vengeful hand with six small ships and but a slender train he left the town a wide deserted plain but what art thou who deedless look around while unrevenged thy lycians bite the ground small aid to troy thy feeble force can be but were thou greater thou must yield to me pierced by my spear to endless darkness go i make this present to the shades below the son of hercules the rhodian guide thus haughty spoke the lycian king replied thy sire o prince oerturnd the trojan state whose perjured monarch well deserved his fate those heavenly steeds the hero sought so far false he detained the just reward of war nor so content the generous chief defied with base reproaches and unmanly pride but you unworthy the high race you boast shall raise my glory when thy own is lost now meet thy fate and by sarpedon slain add one more ghost to plutos gloomy reign he said both javelins at an instant flew both struck both wounded but sarpedons slew full in the boasters neck the weapon stood transfixed his throat and drank the vital blood the soul disdainful seeks the caves of night and his sealed eyes for ever lose the light yet not in vain tlepolemus was thrown thy angry lance which piercing to the bone sarpedons thigh had robbed the chief of breath but jove was present and forbad the death born from the conflict by his lycian throng the wounded hero dragged the lance along his friends each busied in his several part through haste or danger had not drawn the dart the greeks with slain tlepolemus retired whose fall ulysses viewed with fury fired doubtful if joves great son he should pursue or pour his vengeance on the lycian crew but heaven and fate the first design withstand nor this great death must grace ulysses hand minerva drives him on the lycian train alastor chromius halius strowd the plain alcander prytanis noemon fell and numbers more his sword had sent to hell but hector saw and furious at the sight rushed terrible amidst the ranks of fight with joy sarpedon viewed the wished relief and faint lamenting thus implored the chief oh suffer not the foe to bear away my helpless corpse an unassisted prey if i unblest must see my son no more my muchloved consort and my native shore yet let me die in ilions sacred wall troy in whose cause i fell shall mourn my fall he said nor hector to the chief replies but shakes his plume and fierce to combat flies swift as a whirlwind drives the scattering foes and dies the ground in purple as he goes beneath a beech joves consecrated shade his mournful friends divine sarpedon laid brave pelagon his favorite chief was nigh who wrenchd the javelin from his sinewy thigh the fainting soul stood ready winged for flight and over his eye balls swum the shades of night but boreas rising fresh with gentle breath recalled his spirit from the gates of death the generous greeks recede with tardy pace tho mars and hector thunder in their face none turn their backs to mean ignoble flight slow they retreat and even retreating fight who first who last by mars and hectors hand stretched in their blood lay gasping on the sand teuthras the great orestes the renowned for managed steeds and trechus pressed the ground next oenomaus and oenops offspring died oresbius last fell groaning at their side oresbius in his painted mitre gay in fat boeotia held his wealthy sway where lakes surround low hyles watery plain a prince and people studious of their gain the carnage juno from the skies surveyed and touched with grief bespoke the blueeyd maid oh sight accursed shall faithless troy prevail and shall our promise to our people fail how vain the word to menelaus given by joves great daughter and the queen of heaven beneath his arms that priams towers should fall if warring gods for ever guard the wall mars red with slaughter aids our hated foes haste let us arm and force with force oppose she spoke minerva burns to meet the war and now heavens empress calls her blazing car at her command rush forth the steeds divine rich with immortal gold their trappings shine bright hebe waits by hebe ever young the whirling wheels are to the chariot hung on the bright axle turns the bidden wheel of sounding brass the polished axle steel eight brazen spokes in radiant order flame the circles gold of uncorrupted frame such as the heavens produce and round the gold two brazen rings of work divine were rolled the bossie naves of solid silver shone braces of gold suspend the moving throne the car behind an arching figure bore the bending concave formed an arch before silver the beam the extended yoke was gold and golden reins the immortal coursers hold herself impatient to the ready car the coursers joins and breathes revenge and war pallas disrobes her radiant veil untied with flowers adorned with art diversified the labored veil her heavenly fingers wove flows on the pavement of the court of jove now heavens dread arms her mighty limbs invest joves cuirass blazes on her ample breast decked in sad triumph for the mournful field over her broad shoulders hangs his horrid shield dire black tremendous round the margin rolled a fringe of serpents hissing guards the gold here all the terrors of grim war appear here rages force here tremble flight and fear here stormed contention and here fury frowned and the dire orb portentous gorgon crowned the massy golden helm she next assumes that dreadful nods with four oershading plumes so vast the broad circumference contains a hundred armies on a hundred plains the goddess thus the imperial car ascends shook by her arm the mighty javelin bends ponderous and huge that when her fury burns proud tyrants humbles and whole hosts oerturns swift at the scourge the ethereal coursers fly while the smooth chariot cuts the liquid sky heaven gates spontaneous open to the powers heavens golden gates kept by the winged hours commissioned in alternate watch to stand the suns bright portals and the skies command involve in clouds the eternal gates of day or the dark barrier roll with ease away the sounding hinges ring on either side the gloomy volumes pierced with light divide the chariot mounts where deep in ambient skies confused olympus hundred heads arise where far apart the thundrer fills his throne over all the gods superior and alone there with her snowy hand the queen restrains the fiery steeds and thus to jove complains o sire can no resentment touch thy soul can mars rebel and does no thunder roll what lawless rage on yon forbidden plain what rash destruction and what heroes slain venus and phoebus with the dreadful bow smile on the slaughter and enjoy my woe mad furious power whose unrelenting mind no god can govern and no justice bind say mighty father shall we scourge his pride and drive from fight the impetuous homicide to whom assenting thus the thundrer said go and the great minerva be thy aid to tame the monstergod minerva knows and often afflicts his brutal breast with woes he said saturnia ardent to obey lashed her white steeds along the aerial way swift down the steep of heaven the chariot rolls between the expanded earth and starry poles far as a shepherd from some point on high over the wide main extends his boundless eye through such a space of air with thundering sound at every leap the immortal coursers bound troy now they reached and touched those banks divine where silver simois and scamander join there juno stopped and her fair steeds unloosd of air condensed a vapor circumfusd for these impregnate with celestial dew on simois brink ambrosial herbage grew thence to relieve the fainting argive throng smooth as the sailing doves they glide along the best and bravest of the grecian band a warlike circle round tydides stand such was their look as lions bathed in blood or foaming boars the terror of the wood heavens empress mingles with the mortal crowd and shouts in stentors sounding voice aloud stentor the strong endud with brazen lungs whose throat surpassed the force of fifty tongues inglorious argives to your race a shame and only men in figure and in name once from their walls your timorous foes engaged while fierce in war divine achilles raged now issuing fearless they possess the plain now win the shores and scarce the seas remain her speech new fury to their hearts conveyed while near tydides stood the athenian maid the king beside his panting steeds she found oerspent with toil reposing on the ground to cool his glowing wound he sat apart the wound inflicted by the lycian dart large drops of sweat from all his limbs descend beneath his ponderous shield his sinews bend whose ample belt that over his shoulder lay he eased and washed the clotted gore away the goddess leaning over the bending yoke beside his coursers thus her silence broke degenerate prince and not of tydeus kind whose little body lodged a mighty mind foremost he pressed in glorious toils to share and scarce refrained when i forbad the war alone unguarded once he dared to go and feast encircled by the theban foe there braved and vanquished many a hardy knight such nerves i gave him and such force in fight thou too no less have been my constant care thy hands i armed and sent thee forth to war but thee or fear deterrs or sloth detains no drop of all thy father warms thy veins the chief thus answered mild immortal maid i own thy presence and confess thy aid not fear thou know withholds me from the plains nor sloth has seized me but thy word restrains from warring gods thou badst me turn my spear and venus only found resistance here hence goddess heedful of thy high commands loath i gave way and warned our argive bands for mars the homicide these eyes beheld with slaughter red and raging round the field then thus minerva brave tydides hear not mars himself nor ought immortal fear full on the god impell thy foaming horse pallas commands and pallas lends thee force rash furious blind from these to those he flies and every side of wavering combat tries large promise makes and breaks the promise made now gives the grecians now the trojans aid she said and to the steeds approaching near drew from his seat the martial charioteer the vigorous power the trembling car ascends fierce for revenge and diomed attends the groaning axle bent beneath the load so great a hero and so great a god she snatched the reins she lashed with all her force and full on mars impelled the foaming horse but first to hide her heavenly visage spread black orcus helmet over her radiant head just then gigantic periphas lay slain the strongest warrior of the aetolian train the god who slew him leaves his prostrate prize stretched where he fell and at tydides flies now rushing fierce in equal arms appear the daring greek the dreadful god of war full at the chief above his coursers head from mars his arm the enormous weapon fled pallas opposed her hand and caused to glance far from the car the strong immortal lance then threw the force of tydeus warlike son the javelin hissed the goddess urged it on where the broad cincture girt his armor round it pierced the god his groin received the wound from the rent skin the warrior tuggs again the smoking steel mars bellows with the pain loud as the roar encountering armies yield when shouting millions shake the thundering field both armies start and trembling gaze around and earth and heaven rebellow to the sound as vapors blown by austers sultry breath pregnant with plagues and shedding seeds of death beneath the rage of burning sirius rise choke the parched earth and blacken all the skies in such a cloud the god from combat driven high over the dusty whirlwind scales the heaven wild with his pain he sought the bright abodes there sullen sat beneath the sire of gods showed the celestial blood and with a groan thus poured his plaints before the immortal throne can jove supine flagitious facts survey and brook the furies of this daring day for mortal men celestial powers engage and gods on gods exert eternal rage from thee o father all these ills we bear and thy fell daughter with the shield and spear thou gavst that fury to the realms of light pernicious wild regardless of the right all heaven beside revere thy sovereign sway thy voice we hear and thy behests obey it is hers to offend and even offending share thy breast thy counsels thy distinguished care so boundless she and thou so partial grown well may we deem the wondrous birth thy own now frantic diomed at her command against the immortals lifts his raging hand the heavenly venus first his fury found me next encountring me he dared to wound vanquished i fled even i the god of fight from mortal madness scarce was saved by flight else had thou seen me sink on yonder plain heaped round and heaving under loads of slain or pierced with grecian darts for ages lie condemned to pain though fated not to die him thus upbraiding with a wrathful look the lord of thunders viewed and stern bespoke to me perfidious this lamenting strain of lawless force shall lawless mars complain of all the gods who tread the spangled skies thou most unjust most odious in our eyes inhuman discord is thy dire delight the waste of slaughter and the rage of fight no bound no law thy fiery temper quells and all thy mother in thy soul rebels in vain our threats in vain our power we use she gives the example and her son pursues yet long the inflicted pangs thou shall not mourn sprung since thou art from jove and heavenly born else singed with lightning had thou hence been thrown where chained on burning rocks the titans groan thus he who shakes olympus with his nod then gave to poeons care the bleeding god with gentle hand the balm he poured around and healed the immortal flesh and closed the wound as when the figs pressed juice infused in cream to curds coagulates the liquid stream sudden the fluids fix the parts combined such and so soon the aetherial texture joined cleansd from the dust and gore fair hebe dressed his mighty limbs in an immortal vest glorious he sat in majesty restored fast by the throne of heavens superior lord juno and pallas mount the blessed abodes their task performed and mix among the gods observations on the fifth book observations on the fifth book i verse   but pallas now etc as in every just history picture there is one principal figure to which all the rest refer and are subservient so in each battle of the iliad there is one principal person that may properly be called the hero of that day or action this conduct preserves the unity of the piece and keeps the imagination from being distracted and confused with a wild number of independent figures which have no subordination to each other to make this probable homer supposes these extraordinary measures of courage to be the immediate gift of the gods who bestow them sometimes upon one and sometimes upon another as they think fit to make them the instruments of their designs an opinion conformable to true theology whoever reflects upon this will not blame our author for representing the same heroes brave at one time and dispirited at another just as the gods assist or abandon them on different occasions  ii verse   tydides that we may enter into the spirit and beauty of this book it will be proper to settle the true character of diomed who is the hero of it achilles is no sooner retired but homer raises his other greeks to supply his absence like stars that shine each in his due revolution till the principal hero rises again and eclipses all others as diomed is the first in this office he seems to have more of the character of achilles than any besides he has naturally an excess of boldness and too much fury in his temper forward and intrepid like the other and running after gods or men promiscuously as they offer themselves but what differences his character is that he is soon reclaimed by advice hears those that are more experienced and in a word obeys minerva in all things he is assisted by the patroness of wisdom and arms as he is eminent both for prudence and valor that which characterizes his prudence is a quick sagacity and presence of mind in all emergencies and an undisturbed readiness in the very article of danger and what is particular in his valor is agreeable to these qualities his actions being always performed with remarkable dexterity activity and dispatch as the gentle and manageable turn of his mind seems drawn with an opposition to the boisterous temper of achilles so his bodily excellencies seem designed as in contraste to those of ajax who appears with great strength but heavy and unwieldy as he is forward to act in the field so is he ready to speak in the council but it is observable that his counsels still incline to war and are biased rather on the side of bravery than caution thus he advises to reject the proposals of the trojans in the seventh book and not to accept of helen her self though paris should offer her in the ninth he opposes agamemnons proposition to return to greece in so strong a manner as to declare he will stay and continue the siege himself if the general should depart and thus he hears without concern achilless refusal of a reconciliation and doubts not to be able to carry on the war without him as for his private character he appears a gallant lover of hospitality in his behavior to glaucus in the sixth book a lover of wisdom in his assistance of nestor in the eighth and his choice of ulysses to accompany him in the tenth upon the whole an open sincere friend and a generous enemy  the wonderful actions he performs in this battle seem to be the effect of a noble resentment at the reproach he had received from agamemnon in the foregoing book to which these deeds are the answer he becomes immediately the second hero of greece and dreaded equally with achilles by the trojans at the first sight of him his enemies make a question whether he is a man or a god aeneas and pandarus go against him whose approach terrifies sthenelus and the apprehension of so great a warrior marvellously exalts the intrepidity of diomed aeneas himself is not saved but by the interposing of a deity he pursues and wounds that deity and aeneas again escapes only by the help of a stronger power apollo he attempts apollo too retreats not till the god threatens him in his own voice and even then retreats but a few steps when he sees hector and mars himself in open arms against him he had not retired though he was wounded but in obedience to minerva and then retires with his face toward them but as soon as she permits him to engage with that god he conquers and sends him groaning to heaven what invention and what conduct appears in this whole episode what boldness in raising a character to such a pitch and what judgment in raising it by such degrees while the most daring flights of poetry are employed to move our admiration and at the same time the justest and closest allegory to reconcile those flights to moral truth and probability it may be farther remarked that the high degree to which homer elevates this character enters into the principal design of his whole poem which is to show that the greatest personal qualities and forces are of no effect when union is wanting among the chief rulers and that nothing can avail till they are reconciled so as to act in concert  iii verse   high on his helm celestial lightenings play this beautiful passage gave occasion to zoilus for an insipid piece of raillery who asked how it happened that the hero escaped burning by these fires that continually broke from his armor eustathius answers that there are several examples in history of fires being seen to break forth from human bodies as presages of greatness and glory among the rest plutarch in the life of alexander describes his helmet much in this manner this is enough to warrant the fiction and were there no such example the same author says very well that the imagination of a poet is not to be confined to strict physical truths but all objections may easily be removed if we consider it as done by minerva who had determined this day to raise diomed above all the heroes and caused this apparition to render him formidable the power of a god makes it not only allowable but highly noble and greatly imagined by homer as well as correspondent to a miracle in holy scripture where moses is described with a glory shining on his face at his descent from mount sinai a parallel which spondanus has taken notice of  virgil was too sensible of the beauty of this passage not to imitate it and it must be owned he has surpassed his original ardet apex capiti cristisque ac vertice flamma funditur and vastos umbo vomit aureus ignes non secus ac liquida si quando nocte cometae sanguinei lugubre rubent aut sirius ardor ille sitim morbosque ferens mortalibus aegris nascitur and laevo contristat lumine caelum in homers comparison there is no other circumstance alluded to but that of a remarkable brightness whereas virgils comparison beside this seems to foretell the immense slaughter his hero was to make by comparing him first to a comet which is vulgarly imagined a prognostic if not the real cause of much misery to mankind and again to the dog star which appearing with the greatest brightness in the latter end of summer is supposed the occasion of all the distempers of that sickly season and methinks the objection of macrobius to this place is not just who thinks the simile unseasonably applied by virgil to aeneas because he was yet on his ship and had not begun the battle one may answer that this miraculous appearance could never be more proper than at the first sight of the hero to strike terror into the enemy and to prognosticate his approaching victory  iv verse    idaeus fled left the rich chariot it is finely said by m dacier that homer appears perhaps greater by the criticisms that have been past upon him than by the praises which have been given him zoilus had a cavil at this place he thought it ridiculous in idaeus to descend from his chariot to fly which he might have done faster by the help of his horses three things are said in answer to this first that idaeus knowing the passion which diomed had for horses might hope the pleasure of seizing these would retard him from pursuing him next that homer might design to represent in this action of idaeus the common effect of fear which disturbs the understanding to such a degree as to make men abandon the surest means to save themselves and then that idaeus might have some advantage of diomed in swiftness which he had reason to confide in but i fancy one may add another solution which will better account for this passage homers word is  which i believe would be better translated non perseveravit than non sustinuit defendere fratrem interfectum and then the sense will be clear that idaeus made an effort to save his brothers body which proving impracticable he was obliged to fly with the utmost precipitation one may add that his alighting from his chariot was not that he could run faster on foot but that he could sooner escape by mixing with the crowd of common soldiers there is a particular exactly of the same nature in the book of judges chapter      where sisera alights to fly in the same manner  v verse  0 who bathe in blood it may seem something unnatural that pallas at a time when she is endeavoring to work upon mars under the appearance of benevolence and kindness should make use of terms which seem so full of bitter reproaches but these will appear very properly applied to this warlike deity for persons of this martial character who scorning equity and reason carry all things by force are better pleased to be celebrated for their power than their virtue statues are raised to the conquerors that is the destroyers of nations who are complemented for excelling in the arts of ruin demetrius the son of antigonus was celebrated by his flatterers with the title of poliorcetes a term equivalent to one here made use of  vi verse    the god of arms and martial maid retreat the retreat of mars from the trojans intimates that courage forsook them it may be said then that minervas absence from the greeks will signify that wisdom deserted them also it is true she does desert them but it is at a time when there was more occasion for gallant actions than for wise counsels eustathius  vii verse    the greeks the trojan race pursue homer always appears very zealous for the honor of greece which alone might be a proof of his being of that country against the opinion of those who would have him of other nations  it is observable through the whole ilaid that he endeavors every where to represent the greeks as superior to the trojans in valor and the art of war in the beginning of the third book he describes the trojans rushing on to the battle in a barbarous and confused manner with loud shouts and cries while the greeks advance in the most profound silence and exact order and in the latter part of the fourth book where the two armies march to the engagement the greeks are animated by pallas while mars instigates the trojans the poet attributing by this plain allegory to the former a wellconducted valor to the latter rash strength and brutal force so that the abilities of each nation are distinguished by the characters of the deities who assist them but in this place as eustathius observes the poet being willing to show how much the greeks excelled their enemies when they engaged only with their proper force and when each side was alike destitute of divine assistance takes occasion to remove the gods out of the battle and then each grecian chief gives signal instances of valor superior to the trojans  a modern critic observes that this constant superiority of the greeks in the art of war valor and number is contradictory to the main design of the poem which is to make the return of achilles appear necessary for the preservation of the greeks but this contradiction vanishes when we reflect that the affront given achilles was the occasion of jupiters interposing in favor of the trojans wherefore the anger of achilles was not pernicious to the greeks purely because it kept him inactive but because it occasioned jupiter to afflict them in such a manner as made it necessary to appease achilles in order to render jupiter propitious  viii verse    back from the car he tumbles it is in poetry as in painting the postures and attitudes of each figure ought to be different homer takes care not to draw two persons in the same posture one is tumbled from his chariot another is slain as he ascends it a third as he endeavors to escape on foot a conduct which is every where observed by the poet eustathius  ix verse    next artful phereclus this character of phereclus is finely imagined and presents a noble moral in an uncommon manner there ran a report that the trojans had formerly received an oracle commanding them to follow husbandry and not apply themselves to navigation homer from hence takes occasion to feign that the shipwright who presumed to build the fleet of paris when he took his fatal voyage to greece was overtaken by the divine vengeance so long after as in this battle one may take notice too in this as in many other places of the remarkable disposition homer shows to mechanics he never omits an opportunity either of describing a piece of workmanship or of celebrating an artist  x verse    antenor s offspring from a foreign bed whose generous spouse theano heavenly fair nursed the young stranger with a mothers care homer in this remarkable passage commends the fair theano for breeding up a bastard of her husbands with the same tenderness as her own children this lady was a woman of the first quality and as it appears in the sixth iliad the high priestess of minerva so that one cannot imagine the education of this child was imposed upon her by the authority or power of antenor homer himself takes care to remove any such derogatory notion by particularizing the motive of this unusual piece of humanity to have been to please her husband  nor ought we to lessen this commendation by thinking the wives of those times in general were more complaisant than those of our own the stories of phoenix clytemnestra medea and many others are plain instances how highly the keeping of mistresses was resented by the married ladies but there was indeed a difference between the greeks and asiaticks as to their notions of marriage for it is certain the latter allowed plurality of wives priam had many lawful ones and some of them princesses who brought great dowries theano was an asiatick and that is the most we can grant for the son she nursed so carefully was apparently not by a wife but by a mistress and her passions were naturally the same with those of the grecian women as to the degree of regard then shown to the bastards they were carefully enough educated though not like this of antenor as the lawful issue nor admitted to an equal share of inheritance megapenthes and nicostratus were excluded from the inheritance of sparta because they were born of bondwomen as pausanias says but neoptolemus a natural son of achilles by deidamia succeeded in his fathers kingdom perhaps with respect to his mothers quality who was a princess upon the whole however that matter stood homer was very favorable to bastards and has paid them more complements than one in his works if i am not mistaken ulysses reckons himself one in the odysseis agamemnon in the eighth iliad plainly accounts it no disgrace when charmed with the noble exploits of young teucer and praising him in the rapture of his heart he just then takes occasion to mention his illegitimacy as a kind of panegyric upon him the reader may consult the passage     of the original and     of the translation from all this i should not be averse to believe that homer himself was a bastard as virgil was of which i think this observation a better proof than what is said for it in the common lives of him  xi verse  00  hypsenor generous and divine sprung from the brave dolopion s mighty line who near adored scamander made abode priest of the stream and honored as a god from the number of circumstances put together here and in many other passages of the parentage place of abode profession and quality of the persons our author mentions i think it is plain he composed his poem from some records or traditions of the actions of the times preceding and complied with the truth of history otherwise these particular descriptions of genealogies and other minute circumstances would have been an affectation extremely needless and unreasonable this consideration will account for several things that seem odd or tedious not to add that one may naturally believe he took these occasions of paying a complement to many great men and families of his patrons both in greece and asia  xii verse  0  down sinks the priest homer makes him die upon the cutting off his arm which is an instance of his skill for the great flux of blood that must follow such a wound would be the immediate cause of death  xiii verse     thus torrents swift and strong this whole passage says eustathius is extremely beautiful it describes the hero carried by an enthusiastic valor into the midst of his enemies and so mingled with their ranks as if himself were a trojan and the simile wonderfully illustrates this fury proceeding from an uncommon infusion of courage from heaven in resembling it not to a constant river but a torrent rising from an extraordinary burst of rain this simile is one of those that draws along with it some foreign circumstances we must not often expect from homer those minute resemblances in every branch of a comparison which are the pride of modern similes if that which one may call the main action of it or the principal point of likeness be preserved he affects as to the rest rather to present the mind with a great image than to fix it down to an exact one he is sure to make a fine picture in the whole without drudging on the under parts like those free painters who one would think had only made here and there a few very significant strokes that give form and spirit to all the piece for the present comparison virgil in the second aeneid has inserted an imitation of it which i cannot think equal to this though scaliger prefers virgils to all our authors similitudes from rivers put together non sic aggeribus ruptis cum spumeus amnis exiit oppositasque evicit gurgite moles fertur in arva furens cumulo camposque per omnes cum stabulis armenta trahit  not with so fierce a rage the foaming flood roars when he finds his rapid course withstood bears down the dams with unresisted sway and sweeps the cattle and the cotts away dryden  xiv verse     the dart stopped short of life homer says it did not kill him and i am at a loss why m dacier translates it the wound was slight when just after the arrow is said to have pierced quite through and she herself there turns it percoit lespaule doutre en outre had it been so slight he would not have needed the immediate assistance of minerva to restore his usual vigor and enable him to continue the fight  xv verse     from mortal mists i purge thy eyes this fiction of homer says m dacier is founded upon an important truth of religion not unknown to the pagans that god only can open the eyes of men and enable them to see what they cannot discover by their own capacity there are frequent examples of this in the old testament god opens the eyes of hagar that she might see the fountain in genes       so numbers       the lord opened the eyes of balaam and he saw the angel of the lord standing in his way and his sword drawn in his hand a passage much resembling this of our author venus in virgils second aeneid performs the same office to aeneas and shows him the gods who were engaged in the destruction of troy aspice namque omnem quae nunc obducta tuenti mortales hebetat visus tibi and humida circum caligat nubem eripiam  apparent dirae facies inimicaque trojae numina magna deum  milton seems likewise to have imitated this where he makes michael open adams eyes to see the future revolutions of the world and fortunes of his posterity book     he purged with euphrasie and rue the visual nerve for he had much to see and from the well of life three drops distilled this distinguishing sight of diomed was given him only for the present occasion and service in which he was employed by pallas for we find in the sixth book that upon meeting glaucus he is ignorant whether that hero be a man or a god  xvi verse     no mystic dream this line in the original  contains as puzzling a passage for the construction as i have met with in homer most interpreters join the negative particle  with the verb  which may receive three different meanings that eurydamas had not interpreted the dreams of his children when they went to the wars or that he had foretold them by their dreams they should never return from the wars or that he should now no more have the satisfaction to interpret their dreams at their return after all this construction seems forced and no way agreeable to the general idiom of the greek language or to homers simple diction in particular if we join  with  i think the most obvious sense will be this diomed attacks the two sons of eurydamas an old interpreter of dreams his children not returning the prophet sought by his dreams to know their fate however they fall by the hands of diomed this interpretation seems natural and poetical and tends to move compassion which is almost constantly the design of the poet in his frequent short digressions concerning the circumstances and relations of dying persons  xvii verse  0  to strangers now descends his wealthy store this is a circumstance than which nothing could be imagined more tragical considering the character of the father homer says the trustees of the remote collateral relations seized the estate before his eyes according to a custom of those times which to a covetous old man must be the greatest of miseries  xviii verse     divine aeneas it is here aeneas begins to act and if we take a view of the whole episode of this hero in homer where he makes but an underpart it will appear that virgil has kept him perfectly in the same character in his poem where he shines as the first hero his piety and his valor though not drawn at so full a length are marked no less in the original than in the copy it is the manner of homer to express very strongly the character of each person in the first speech he is made to utter in the poem in this of aeneas there is a great air of piety in those strokes is he some god who punishes troy for having neglected his sacrifices and then that sentence the anger of heaven is terrible when he is in danger afterward he is saved by the heavenly assistance of two deities at once and his wounds cured in the holy temple of pergamus by latona and diana as to his valor he is second only to hector and in personal bravery as great in the greek author as in the roman he is made to exert himself on emergencies of the first importance and hazard rather than on common occasions he checks diomed here in the midst of his fury in the thirteenth book defends his friend deiphobus before it was his turn to fight being placed in one of the hindmost ranks which homer to take off all objection to his valor tells us happened because priam had an animosity to him though he was one of the bravest of the army he is one of those who rescue hector when he is overthrown by ajax in the fourteenth book and what alone were sufficient to establish him a firstrate hero he is the first that dares resist achilles himself at his return to the fight in all his rage for the loss of patroclus he indeed avoids encountering two at once in the present book and shows upon the whole a sedate and deliberate courage which if not so glaring as that of some others is yet more just it is worth considering how thoroughly virgil penetrated into all this and saw into the very idea of homer so as to extend and call forth the whole figure in its full dimensions and colors from the slightest hints and sketches which were but casually touched by homer and even in some points too where they were rather left to be understood than expressed and this by the way ought to be considered by those critics who object to virgils hero the want of that sort of courage which strikes us so much in homers achilles aeneas was not the creature of virgils imagination but one whom the world was already acquainted with and expected to see continued in the same character and one who perhaps was chosen for the hero of the latin poem not only as he was the founder of the roman empire but as this more calm and regular character better agreed with the temper and genius of the poet himself  xix verse     skilled in the bow etc we see through this whole discourse of pandarus the character of a vainglorious passionate prince who being skilled in the use of the bow was highly valued by himself and others for this excellence but having been successless in two different trials of his skill he is raised into an outrageous passion which vents itself in vain threats on his guiltless bow eustathius on this passage relates a story of a paphlagonian famous like him for his archery who having missed his aim at repeated trials was so transported by rage that breaking his bow and arrows he executed a more fatal vengeance by hanging himself  xx verse     ten polished chariots among the many pictures homer gives us of the simplicity of the heroic ages he mingles from time to time some hints of an extraordinary magnificence we have here a prince who has all these chariots for pleasure at one time with their particular sets of horses to each and the most sumptuous coverings in their stables but we must remember that he speaks of an asiatic prince those barbarians living in great luxury dacier  xxi verse     yet to thrift inclined it is eustathius his remark that pandarus did this out of avarice to save the expense of his horses i like this conjecture because nothing seems more judicious than to give a man of a perfidious character a strong tincture of avarice  xxii verse     and undissembled gore pursued the wound the greek is  he says he is sure it was real blood that followed his arrow because it was anciently a custom particularly among the spartans to have ornaments and figures of a purple color on their breastplates that the blood they lost might not be seen by the soldiers and tend to their discouragement plutarch in his instit lacon takes notice of this point of antiquity and i wonder it escaped madam dacier in her translation  xxiii verse     nor phoebus honored gift disgrace for homer tells us in the second book     of the catalogue that the bow and shafts of pandarus were given him by apollo  xxiv verse     haste seize the whip etc homer means not here that one of the heroes should alight or descend from the chariot but only that he should quit the reins to the management of the other and stand on foot upon the chariot to fight from thence as one might use the expression to descend from the ship to signify to quit the helm or oar in order to take up arms this is the note of eustathius by which it appears that most of the translators are mistaken in the sense of this passage and among the rest mr hobbes  xxv verse   0 one chief at least beneath this arm shall die it is the manner of our author to make his persons have some intimation from within either of prosperous or adverse fortune before it happens to them in the present instance we have seen aeneas astonished at the great exploits of diomed proposing to himself the means of his escape by the swiftness of his horses before he advances to encounter him on the other hand diomed is so filled with assurance that he gives orders here to sthenelus to seize those horses before they come up to him the opposition of these two as mad dacier has remarked is very observable  xxvi verse     the coursers of ethereal breed we have already observed the great delight homer takes in horses he makes some horses as well as heroes of celestial race and if he has been thought too fond of the genealogies of some of his warriors in relating them even in a battle we find him here as willing to trace that of his horses in the same circumstance these were of that breed which jupiter bestowed upon tros and far superior to the common strain of trojan horses so that according to eustathiuss opinion the translators are mistaken who turn  the trojan horses in     of the original where aeneas extolls their qualities to pandarus the same author takes notice that frauds in the case of horses have been thought excusable in all times and commends anchises for this piece of theft virgil was so well pleased with it as to imitate this passage in the seventh aeneid absenti aeneae currum geminosque jugales semine ab aethereo spirantes naribus ignem illorum de gente patri quos daedala circe supposita de matre nothos furata creavit   xxvii verse     full in his face it entered it has been asked how diomed being on foot could naturally be supposed to give such a wound as is described here were it never so improbable the express mention that minerva conducted the javelin to that part would render this passage unexceptionable but without having recourse to a miracle such a wound might be received by pandarus either if he stooped or if his enemy took the advantage of a rising ground by which means he might not impossibly stand higher though the other were in a chariot this is the solution given by the ancient scholia which is confirmed by the lowness of the chariots observed in the essay on homers battles  xxviii verse     to guard his slaughtered friend aeneas flies this protecting of the dead body was not only an office of piety agreeable to the character of aeneas in particular but looked upon as a matter of great importance in those times it was believed that the very soul of the deceased suffered by the bodys remaining destitute of the rites of sepulture as not being else admitted to pass the waters of styx haec omnis quam cernis inops inhumataque turba est portitor ille charon hi quos vehit unda sepulti nec ripas datur horrendas and rauca fluenta transportare prius quam sedibus ossa quierunt centum errant annos volitantque haec litora circum virg aen   whoever considers this will not be surprised at those long and obstinate combats for the bodies of the heroes so frequent in the iliad homer thought it of such weight that he has put this circumstance of want of burial into the proposition at the beginning of his poem as one of the chief misfortunes that befell the greeks  xxix verse     not two strong men this opinion of a degeneracy of human size and strength in the process of ages has been very general lucretius lib   jamque adeo fracta est aetas effoetaque tellus vix animalia parva creat quae cuncta creavit saecla deditque ferarum ingentia corpora partu the active life and temperance of the first men before their native powers were prejudiced by luxury may be supposed to have given them this advantage celsus in his first book observes that homer mentions no sort of diseases in the old heroic times but what were immediately inflicted by heaven as if their temperance and exercise preserved them from all besides virgil imitates this passage with a farther allowance of the decay in proportion to the distance of his time from that of homer for he says it was an attempt that exceeded the strength of twelve men instead of two  saxum circumspicit ingens  vix illud lecti bis sex cervice subirent qualia nunc hominum producit corpora tellus juvenal has made an agreeable use of this thought in his fourteenth satyr nam genus hoc vivo jam decrescebat homero terra malos homines nunc educat atque pusillos   xxx verse     hid from the foe behind her shining veil homer says she spread her veil that it might be a defense against the darts how comes it then afterward to be pierced through when venus is wounded it is manifest the veil was not impenetrable and is said here to be a defense only as it rendered aeneas invisible by being interposed this is the observation of eustathius and was thought too material to be neglected in the translation  xxxi verse  0  to bold deipylus  whom most he loved sthenelus says m dacier loved deipylus parce quil avoit la mesme humeur que luy la mesme sagesse the words in the original are  because his mind was equal and consentaneous to his own which i should rather translate with regard to the character of sthenelus that he had the same bravery than the same wisdom for that sthenelus was not remarkable for wisdom appears from many passages and particularly from his speech to agamemnon in the fourth book upon which see plutarchs remark note     xxxii verse  0  the chief in chase of venus flies we have seen with what ease venus takes paris out of the battle in the third book when his life was in danger from menelaus but here when she has a charge of more importance and nearer concern she is not able to preserve her self or her son from the fury of diomed the difference of success in two attempts so like each other is occasioned by that penetration of sight with which pallas had endud her favorite for the gods in their intercourse with men are not ordinarily seen but when they please to render themselves visible wherefore venus might think her self and her son secure from the insolence of this daring mortal but was in this deceived being ignorant of that faculty wherewith the hero was enabled to distinguish gods as well as men  xxxiii verse     her snowie hand the razing steel profaned plutarch in his symposiacks l   tells us that maximus the rhetorician proposed this farfetched question at a banquet on which of her hands venus was wounded and that zopyrion answered it by asking on which of his legs philip was lame but maximus replied it was a different case for demosthenes left no foundation to guess at the one whereas homer gives a solution of the other in saying that diomed throwing his spear across wounded her wrist so that it was her right hand he hurt her left being opposite to his right he adds another humorous reason from pallass reproaching her afterward as having got this wound while she was stroking and soliciting some grecian lady and unbuckling her zone an action says this philosopher in which no one would make use of the left hand  xxxiv verse     such stream as issues from a wounded god this is one of those passages in homer which have given occasion to that famous censure of tully and longinus that he makes gods of his heroes and mortals of his gods these taken in a general sense appeared the highest impiety to plato and pythagoras one of whom has banished homer from his commonwealth and the other said he was tortured in hell for fictions of this nature but if a due distinction be made of a difference among beings superior to mankind which both the pagans and christians have allowed these fables may be easily accounted for wounds inflicted on the dragon bruising of the serpents head and other such metaphorical images are consecrated in holy writ and applied to angelical and incorporeal natures but in our authors days they had a notion of gods that were corporeal to whom they ascribed bodies though of a more subtle kind than those of mortals so in this very place he supposes them to have blood but blood of a finer and superior nature notwithstanding the foregoing censures milton has not scrupled to imitate and apply this to angels in the christian system when satan is wounded by michael in his sixth book  then satan first knew pain and writhed him to and fro convolvd so sore the griding sword with discontinuous wound passed through him but the aetherial substance closed not long divisible and from the gash a stream of nectarous humor issuing flowed sanguin such as celestial spirits may bleed  yet soon he healed for spirits that live throughout vital in every part not as frail man in entrails head or heart liver or reins cannot but by annihilating die aristotle cap    art poet excuses homer for following fame and common opinion in his account of the gods though no way agreeable to truth the religion of those times taught no other notions of the deity than that the gods were beings of human forms and passions so that any but a real anthropomorphite would probably have past among the ancient greeks for an impious heretic they thought their religion which worshipped the gods in images of human shape was much more refined and rational than that of egypt and other nations who adored them in animal or monstrous forms and certainly gods of human shape cannot justly be esteemed or described otherwise than as a celestial race superior only to mortal men by greater abilities and a more extensive degree of wisdom and strength subject however to the necessary inconveniences consequent to corporeal beings cicero in his book de not deor urges this consequence strongly against the epicureans who though they deposed the gods from any power in creating or governing the world yet maintained their existence in human forms non enim sentitis quam multa vobis suscipienda sunt si impetraveritis ut concedamus eandem esse hominum and deorum figuram omnis cultus and curatio corporis erit eadem adhibenda deo quae adhibetur homini ingressus cursus accubatio inclinatio sessio comprehensio ad extremum etiam sermo and oration nam quod and mares deos and faeminas esse dicitis quid sequatur videtis  this particular of the wounding of venus seems to be a fiction of homers own brain naturally deducible from the doctrine of corporeal gods abovementioned and considered as poetry no way shocking yet our author as if he had foreseen some objection has very artfully inserted a justification of this bold stroke in the speech dione soon after makes to venus for as it was natural to comfort her daughter by putting her in mind that many other deities had received as ill treatment from mortals by the permission of jupiter so it was of great use to the poet to enumerate those ancient fables to the same purpose which being then generally assented to might obtain credit for his own this fine remark belongs to eustathius  xxxv verse     unlike our gross diseased terrestrial blood etc the opinion of the incorruptibility of celestial matter seems to have been received in the time of homer for he makes the immortality of the gods to depend upon the incorruptible nature of the nutriment by which they are sustained as the mortality of men to proceed from the corruptible materials of which they are made and by which they are nourished we have several instances in him from whence this may be inferred as when diomed questions glaucus if he be a god or a mortal he adds one who is sustained by the fruits of the earth lib        xxxvi verse     low at his knee she begged all the former english translators make it she fell on her knees an oversight occasioned by the want of a competent knowledge in antiquities without which no man can tolerably understand this author for the custom of praying on the knees was unknown to the greeks and in use only among the hebrews  xxxvii verse     and share those griefs inferior powers must share the word inferior is added by the translator to open the distinction homer makes between the divinity itself which he represents impassible and the subordinate celestial beings or spirits  xxxviii verse     the mighty mars etc homer in these fables as upon many other occasions makes a great show of his theological learning which was the manner of all the greeks who had traveled into egypt those who would see these allegories explained at large may consult eustathius on this place virgil speaks much in the same figure when he describes the happy peace with which augustus had blessed the world  furor impius intus saeva sedens super arma and centum vinctus aenis post tergum nodis fremit horridus ore cruento   xxxix verse     perhaps had perished some of homers censurers have inferred from this passage that the poet represents his gods subject to death when nothing but great misery is here described it is a common way of speech to use perdition and destruction for misfortune the language of scripture calls eternal punishment perishing everlastingly there is a remarkable passage to this purpose in tacitus an   which very lively represents the miserable state of a distracted tyrant it is the beginning of a letter from tiberius to the senate quid scribam vobis p c aut quomodo scribam aut quid omnino non scribam hoc tempore dii me deaeque pejus perdant quam perire quotidie sentio si scio  xl verse     no infant on his knees shall call him sire this is homers manner of foretelling that he shall perish unfortunately in battle which is infinitely a more artful way of conveying that thought than by a direct expression he does not simply say he shall never return from the war but intimates as much by describing the loss of the most sensible and affecting pleasure that a warrior can receive at his return of the like nature is the prophecy at the end of this speech of the heros death by representing it in a dream of his wifes there are many fine strokes of this kind in the prophetical parts of the old testament nothing is more natural than diones forming these images of revenge upon diomed the hope of which vengeance was so proper a topic of consolation to venus  xli verse  00 to stretch thee pale etc virgil has taken notice of this threatening denunciation of vengeance though fulfilled in a different manner where diomed in his answer to the ambassador of k latinus enumerates his misfortunes and imputes the cause of them to this impious attempt upon venus aeneid lib    invidisse deos patriis ut redditus oris conjugium optatum and pulchram calydona viderem nunc etiam horribili visu portenta sequuntur et socii amissi petierunt aequora pennis fluminibusque vagantur aves heu dira meorum supplicia and scopulos lachrymosis vocibus implent haec adeo ex illo mihi jam speranda fuerunt tempore cum ferro caelestia corpora demens appetii and veneris violavi vulnere dextram   xlii verse  0  thy distant wife the poet seems here to complement the fair sex at the expense of truth by concealing the character of aegiale whom he has described with the disposition of a faithful wife though the history of those times represents her as an abandoned prostitute who gave up her own person and her husbands crown to her lover so that diomed at his return from troy when he expected to be received with all the tenderness of a loving spouse found his bed and throne possessed by an adulterer was forced to fly his country and seek refuge and subsistence in foreign lands thus the offended goddess executed her vengeance by the proper effects of her own power by involving the hero in a series of misfortunes proceeding from the incontinence of his wife  xliii verse     the sire of gods and men superior smiled one may observe the decorum and decency our author constantly preserves on this occasion jupiter only smiles the other gods laugh out that homer was no enemy to mirth may appear from several places of his poem which so serious as it is is interspersed with many gayeties indeed more than he has been followed in by the succeeding epic poets milton who was perhaps fonder of him than the rest has given most into the ludicrous of which his paradise of fools in the third book and his jesting angels in the sixth are extraordinary instances upon the confusion of babel he says there was great laughter in heaven as homer calls the laughter of the gods in the first book  an inextinguishable laugh but the scripture might perhaps embolden the english poet which says the lord shall laugh them to scorn and the like plato is very angry at homer for making the deities laugh as a high indecency and offense to gravity he says the gods in our author represent magistrates and persons in authority and are designed as examples to such on this supposition he blames him for proposing immoderate laughter as a thing decent in great men i forgot to take notice in its proper place that the epither inextinguishable is not to be taken literally for dissolute or ceasless mirth but was only a phrase of that time to signify cheerfulness and seasonable gayety in the same manner as we may now say to die with laughter without being understood to be in danger of dying with it the place time and occasion were all agreeable to mirth it was at a banquet and plato himself relates several things that past at the banquet of agathon which had not been either decent or rational at any other season the same may be said of the present passage raillery could never be more natural than when two of the female sex had an opportunity of triumphing over another whom they hated homer makes wisdom her self not able even in the presence of jupiter to resist the temptation she breaks into a ludicrous speech and the supreme being himself vouchsafes a smile at it but this as eustathius remarks is not introduduced without judgment and precaution for we see he makes minerva first beg jupiters permission for this piece of freedom permit thy daughter gracious jove in which he asks the readers leave to enliven his narration with this piece of gayety  xliv verse   0 he dreads his fury and some steps retires diomed still maintains his intrepid character he retires but a step or two even from apollo the conduct of homer is remarkably just and rational here he gives diomed no sort of advantage over apollo because he would not feign what was entirely incredible and what no allegory could justify he wounds venus and mars as it is morally possible to overcome the irregular passions which are represented by those deities but it is impossible to vanquish apollo in whatsoever capacity he is considered either as the sun or as destiny one may shoot at the sun but not hurt him and one may strive against destiny but not surmount it eustathius  xlv verse     a phantome raised the fiction of a gods placing a phantome instead of the hero to delude the enemy and continue the engagement means no more than that the enemy thought he was in the battle this is the language of poetry which prefers a mavelous fiction to a plain and simple truth the recital whereof would be cold and unaffecting thus minervas guiding a javelin signifies only that it was thrown with art and dexterity mars taking upon him the shape of acamas that the courage of acamas incited him to do so and in like manner of the rest the present passage is copied by virgil in the tenth aeneid where the spectre of aeneas is raised by juno or the air as it is here by apollo or the sun both equally proper to be employed in forming an apparition whoever will compare the two authors on this subject will observe with what admirable art and what exquisite ornaments the latter has improved and beautified his original scaliger in comparing these places has absurdly censured the phantome of homer for its inactivity whereas it was only formed to represent the hero lying on the ground without any appearance of life or motion spencer in the eighth canto of the third book seems to have improved this imagination in the creation of his false florimel who performs all the functions of life and gives occasion for many adventures  xlvi verse     the speech of sarpedon to hector it will be hard to find a speech more warm and spirited than this of sarpedon or which comprehends so much in so few words nothing could be more artfully thought upon to pique hector who was so jealous of his countrys glory than to tell him he had formerly conceived too great a notion of the trojan valor and to exalt the auxiliaries above his countrymen the description sarpedon gives of the little concern or interest himself had in the war in opposition to the necessity and imminent danger of the trojans greatly strengthens this preference and lays the charge very home upon their honor in the latter part which prescribes hector his duty there is a particular reprimand in telling him how much it behooves him to animate and encourage the auxiliaries for this is to say in other words you should exhort them and they are forced on the contrary to exhort you  xlvii verse     ceres sacred floor homer calls the threshing floor sacred says eustathius not only as it was consecrated to ceres but in regard of its great use and advantage to human kind in which sense also he frequently gives the same epithet to cities etc this simile is of an exquisite beauty  xlviii verse     so when the embatteld clouds this simile contains as proper a comparison and as fine a picture of nature as any in homer yet however it is to be feared the beauty and propriety of it will not be very obvious to many readers because it is the description of a natural appearance which they have not had an opportunity to remark and which can be observed only in a mountainous country it happens frequently in very calm weather that the atmosphere is charged with thick vapors whose gravity is such that they neither rise nor fall but remain poised in the air at a certain height where they continue frequently for several days together in a plain country this occasions no other visible appearance but of an uniform clouded sky but in a hilly region these vapors are to be seen covering the tops and stretched along the sides of the mountains the clouded parts above being terminated and distinguished from the clear parts below by a strait line running parallel to the horizon as far as the mountains extend the whole compass of nature cannot afford a nobler and more exact representation of a numerous army drawn up in line of battle and expecting the charge the longextended even front the closeness of the ranks the firmness order and silence of the whole are all drawn with great resemblance in this one comparison the poet adds that this appearance is while boreas and the other boisterous winds which disperse and break the clouds are laid asleep this is as exact as it is poetical for when the winds arise this regular order is soon dissolved this circumstance is added to the description as an ominous anticipation of the flight and dissipation of the greeks which soon ensued when mars and hector broke in upon them  xlix verse     ye greeks be men etc if homer in the longer speeches of the iliad says all that could be said by eloquence in the shorter he says all that can be said with judgment whatever some few modern critics have thought it will be found upon due reflection that the length or brevity of his speeches is determined as the occasions either allow leisure or demand haste this concise oration of agamemnon is a masterpiece in the laconic way the exigence required he should say something very powerful and no time was to be lost he therefore warms the brave and the timorous by one and the same exhortation which at once moves by the love of glory and the fear of death it is short and full like that of the brave scotch general under gustavus who upon sight of the enemy said only this see ye those lads either fell them or they will fell you  l verse     your brave associates and your selves revere this noble exhortation of agamemnon is correspondent to the wise scheme of nestor in the second book where he advised to rank the soldiers of the same nation together that being known to each other all might be incited either by a generous emulation or a decent shame spondanus  li verse     mars urged him on this is another instance of what has been in general observed in the discourse on the battles of homer his artful manner of making us measure one hero by another we have here an exact scale of the valor of aeneas and of menelaus how much the former outweighs the latter appears by what is said of mars in these lines and by the necessity of antilochuss assisting menelaus as afterward what overbalance that assistance gave him by aeneass retreating from them both how very nicely are these degrees marked on either hand this knowledge of the difference which nature itself sets between one man and another makes our author neither blame these two heroes for going against one who was superior to each of them in strength nor that one for retiring from both when their conjunction made them an overmatch to him there is great judgment in all this  lii verse     and all his countrys glorious labors vain for as agamemnon said in the fourth book upon menelauss being wounded if he were slain the war would be at an end and the greeks think only of returning to their country spondanus  liii verse     mars stern destroyer etc there is a great nobleness in this passage with what pomp is hector introduced into the battle where mars and bellona are his attendants the retreat of diomed is no less beautiful minerva had removed the mist from his eyes and he immediately discovers mars assisting hector his surprise on this occasion is finely imagd by that of the traveller on the sudden sight of the river  live verse     what brings this lycian counselor so far there is a particular sarcasm in tlepolemuss calling sarpedon in this place  lycian counselor one better skilled in oratory than war as he was the governor of a people who had long been in peace and probably if we may guess from his character in homer remarkable for his speeches this is rightly observed by spondanus though not taken notice of by m dacier  lv verse     troy felt his arm he alludes to the history of the first destruction of troy by hercules occasioned by laomedons refusing that hero the horses which were the reward promised him for the delivery of his daughter hesione  lvi verse  0  with base reproaches and unmanly pride methinks these words  include the chief sting of sarpedons answer to tlepolemus which no commentator that i remember has remarked he tells him laomedon deserved his misfortune not only for his perfidy but for injuring a brave man with unmanly and scandalous reproaches alluding to those which tlepolemus had just before cast upon him  lvii verse     nor hector to the chief replies homer is in nothing more admirable than in the excellent use he makes of the silence of the persons he introduces it would be endless to collect all the instances of this truth throughout his poem yet i cannot but put together those that have already occurred in the course of this work and leave to the reader the pleasure of observing it in what remains the silence of the two heralds when they were to take briseis from achilles in lib   of which see note    in the third book when iris tells helen the two rivals were to fight in her quarrel and that all troy were standing spectators that guilty princess makes no answer but casts a veil over her face and drops a tear and when she comes just after into the presence of priam she speaks not till after he has in a particular manner encouraged and commanded her paris and menelaus being just upon the point to encounter the latter declares his wishes and hopes of conquest to heaven the former being engaged in an unjust cause says not a word in the fourth book when jupiter has expressed his desire to favor troy juno declaims against him but the goddess of wisdom though much concerned holds her peace when agamemnon too rashly reproves diomed that hero remains silent and in the true character of a rough warrior leaves it to his actions to speak for him in the present book when sarpedon has reproached hector in an open and generous manner hector preserving the same warlike character returns no answer but immediately hastens to the business of the field as he also does in this place where he instantly brings off sarpedon without so much as telling him he will endeavor his rescue chapman was not sensible of the beauty of this when he imagined hectors silence here proceeded from the pique he had conceived at sarpedon for his late reproof of him that translator has not scrupled to insert this opinion of his in a groundless interpolation altogether foreign to the author but indeed it is a liberty he frequently takes to draw any passage to some new farfetched conceit of his invention insomuch that very often before he translates any speech to the sense or design of which he gives some fanciful turn of his own he prepares it by several additional lines purposely to prepossess the reader of that meaning those who will take the trouble may see examples of this in what he sets before the speeches of hector paris and helena in the sixth book and innumerable other places  lviii verse     but boreas rising fresh sarpedons fainting at the extraction of the dart and reviving by the free air shows the great judgment of our author in these matters but how poetically has he told this truth in raising the god boreas to his heros assistance and making a little machine of but one line this manner of representing common things in figure and person was perhaps the effect of homers egyptian education  lix verse   0 the generous greeks etc this slow and orderly retreat of the greeks with their front constantly turned to the enemy is a fine encomium both of their courage and discipline this manner of retreat was in use among the ancient lacedaemonians as were many other martial customs described by homer this practice took its rise among that brave people from the apprehensions of being slain with a wound received in their back such a misfortune was not only attended with the highest infamy but they had found a way to punish them who suffered thus even after their death by denying them as eustathius informs us the rites of burial  lx verse     who first who last by mars and hector s hand stretched in their blood lay gasping on the sand this manner of breaking out into an interrogation amidst the description of a battle is what serves very much to awaken the reader it is here an invocation to the muse that prepares us for something uncommon and the muse is supposed immediately to answer teuthras the great etc virgil i think has improved the strength of this figure by addressing the apostrophe to the person whose exploits he is celebrating as to camilla in the eleventh book quem telo primum quem postremum aspera virgo dejicis aut quot humi morientia corpora fundis   lxi verse     and now heavens empress calls her blazing car etc homer seems never more delighted than when he has some occasion of displaying his skill in mechanics the detail he gives us of this chariot is a beautiful example of it where he takes occasion to describe every different part with a happiness rarely to be found in descriptions of this nature  lxii verse  0  pallas disrobes this fiction of pallas arraying herself with the arms of jupiter finely intimates says eustathius that she is nothing else but the wisdom of the almighty the same author tells us that the ancients marked this place with a star to distinguish it as one of those that were perfectly admirable indeed there is a greatness and sublimity in the whole passage which is astonishing and superior to any imagination but that of homer nor is there any that might better give occasion for that celebrated saying that he was the only man who had seen the forms of the gods or the only man who had shown them with what nobleness he describes the chariot of juno the armor of minerva the aegis of jupiter filled with the figures of horror affright discord and all the terrors of war the effects of his wrath against men and that spear with which his power and wisdom overturns whole armies and humbles the pride of the kings who offend him but we shall not wonder at the unusual majesty of all these ideas if we consider that they have a near resemblance to some descriptions of the same kind in the sacred writings where the almighty is represented armed with terror and descending in majesty to be avenged on his enemies the chariot the bow and the shield of god are expressions frequent in the psalms  lxiii verse     a fringe of serpents our author does not particularly describe this fringe of the aegis as consisting of serpents but that it did so may be learned from herodotus in his fourth book the greeks says he borrowed the vest and shield of minerva from the lybians only with this difference that the lybian shield was fringed with thongs of leather the grecian with serpents and virgils description of the same aegis agrees with this aen       aegidaque horriferam turbatae palladis arma certatim squamis serpentum auroque polibant connexosque angues  this note is taken from spondanus as is also ogilbys on this place but he has translated the passage of herodotus wrong and made the lybian shield have the serpents which were peculiar to the grecian by the way i must observe that ogilbys notes are for the most part a transcription of spondanuss  lxiv verse   0 so vast the wide circumference contains a hundred armies the words in the original are  which are capable of two meanings either that this helmet of jupiter was sufficient to have covered the armies of an hundred cities or that the armies of an hundred cities were engraved upon it it is here translated in such a manner that it may be taken either way though the learned are most inclined to the former sense as that idea is greater and more extraordinary indeed more agreeable to homers bold manner and not extravagant if we call in the allegory to our assistance and imagine it with m dacier an allusion to the providence of god that extends over all the universe  lxv verse     heaven gates spontaneous opened this mavelous circumstance of the gates of heaven opening themselves of their own accord to the divinities that past through them is copied by milton lib    at the gate of heaven arrived the gate selfopend wide on golden hinges turning as by work divine the sovereign architect had framed and again in the seventh book  heaven opened wide her everduring gates harmonious sound on golden hinges moving  as the fiction that the hours are the guards of those gates gave him the hint of that beautiful passage in the beginning of his sixth  the morn waked by the circling hours with rosy hand unbarrd the gates of light etc this expression of the gates of heaven is in the eastern manner where they said the gates of heaven or of earth for the entrance or extremities of heaven or earth a phrase usual in the scriptures as is observed by dacier  lxvi verse     heavens golden gates kept by the winged hours by the hours here are meant the seasons and so hobbes translates it but spoils the sense by what he adds though to the seasons jove the power gave alone to judge of early and of late which is utterly unintelligible and nothing like homers thought natalis comes explains it thus lib   c   homerus libro quinto iliadis non solum has portas coeli servare sed etiam nubes inducere and serenum facere cum libuerit quippe cum apertum coelum serenum nominent poetae at clausum tectum nubibus  lxvii verse     to tame the monstergod minerva knows for it is only wisdom that can master strength it is worth while here to observe the conduct of homer he makes minerva and not juno to fight with mars because a combat between mars and juno could not be supported by any allegory to have authorized the fable whereas the allegory of a battle between mars and minerva is very open and intelligible eustathius  lxviii verse   0 far as a shepherd etc longinus citing these verses as a noble instance of the sublime speaks to this effect in what a wonderful manner does homer exalt his deities measuring the leaps of their very horses by the whole breadth of the horizon who is there that considering the magnificence of this hyperbole would not cry out with reason that if these heavenly steeds were to make a second leap the world would want room for a third this puts me in mind of that passage in hesiods theogony where he describes the height of the heavens by saying a smiths anvil would be nine days in falling from thence to earth  lxix verse     smooth as the gliding doves this simile is intended to express the lightness and smoothness of the motion of these goddesses the doves to which homer compares them are said by the ancient scholiast to leave no impression of their steps the word  in the original may be rendered ascenderunt as well as incesserunt so may imply as m dacier translates it moving without touching the earth which milton finely calls smoothgliding without step virgil describes the gliding of one of these birds by an image parallel to that in this verse  mox aere lapsa quieto radit iter liquidum celeres neque commovet alas this kind of movement was appropriated to the gods by the egyptians as we see in heliodorus lib   homer might possibly have taken this notion from them and virgil in that passage where aeneas discovers venus by her gate et vera incessu patuit dea seems to allude to some manner of moving that distinguished divinities from mortals this opinion is likewise hinted at by him in the fifth aeneid where he so beautifully and briefly enumerates the distinguishing marks of a deity  divini signa decoris ardentesque notate oculos qui spiritus illi qui vultus vocisque sonus vel gressus eunti this passage likewise strengthens what is said in the thirtieth note on the first book  lxx verse     stentor the strong endud with brazen lungs there was a necessity for cryers whose voices were stronger than ordinary in those ancient times before the use of trumpets was known in their armies and that they were in esteem afterward may be seen from herodotus where he takes notice that darius had in his train an egyptian whose voice was louder and stronger than any mans of his age there is a farther propriety in homers attributing this voice to juno because juno is no other than the air and because the air is the cause of sound eustathius spondanus  lxxi verse     degenerate prince etc this speech of minerva to diomed derives its whole force and efficacy from the offensive comparison she makes between tydeus and his son tydeus when he was single in the city of his enemy fought and overcame the thebans even though minerva forbade him diomed in the midst of his army and with enemies inferior in number declines the fight though minerva commands him tydeus disobeys her to engage in the battle diomed disobeys her to avoid engaging and that too after he had upon many occasions experienced the assistance of the goddess madam dacier should have acknowledged this remark to belong to eustathius  lxxii verse  0   rash furious blind from these to those he flies minerva in this place very well paints the manners of mars whose business was always to fortify the weaker side in order to keep up the broil i think the passage includes a fine allegory of the nature of war mars is called inconstant and a breaker of his promises because the chance of war is wavering and uncertain victory is perpetually changing sides this latent meaning of the epithet  is taken notice of by eustathius  lxxiii verse  0   so great a god the translation has ventured to call a goddess so in imitation of the greek which uses the word  promiscuously for either gender some of the latin poets have not scrupled to do the same statius thebaid   speaking of diana nec caret umbra deo and virgil aeneid   where aeneas is conducted by venus through the dangers of the fire and the enemy descendo ac ducente deo flammam inter and hosts expedior    lxxiv verse  0   black orcus helmet as every thing that goes into the dark empire of pluto or orcus disappears and is seen no more the greeks from thence borrowed this figurative expression to put on pluto s helmet that is to say to become invisible plato uses this proverb in the tenth book of his republic and aristophanes in acharnens eustathius  lxxv verse  0   loud as the roar encountering armies yield this hyperbole to express the roaring of mars so strong as it is yet is not extravagant it wants not a qualifying circumstance or two the voice is not human but that of a deity and the comparison being taken from an army renders it more natural with respect to the god of war it is less daring to say that a god could send forth a voice as loud as the shout of two armies than that camilla a latian nymph could run so swiftly over the corn as not to bend an ear of it or to allege a nearer instance that polyphemus a mere mortal shook all the island of sicily and made the deepest caverns of aetna roar with his cries yet virgil generally escapes the censure of those moderns who are shocked with the bold flights of homer it is usual with those who are slaves to common opinion to overlook or praise the same things in one that they blame in another they think to depreciate homer in extolling the judgment of virgil who never showed it more than when he followed him in these boldnesses and indeed they who would take boldness from poetry must leave dullness in the room of it  lxxvi verse  0   as vapors blown etc mars after a sharp engagement amidst the rout of the trojans wrapped in a whirlwind of dust which was raised by so many thousand combatants flies toward olympus homer compares him in this estate to those black clouds which during a scorching southern wind in the dog days are sometimes born toward heaven for the wind at that time gathering the dust together forms a dark cloud of it the heat of the fight the precipitation of the trojans together with the clouds of dust that flew above the army and took mars from the sight of his enemy supplied homer with this noble image dacier  lxxvii verse  0   thou gavst that fury to the realms of light pernicious wild etc it is very artful in homer to make mars accuse minerva of all those faults and enormities he was himself so eminently guilty of those people who are the most unjust and violent accuse others even the best of the same crimes every irrational man is a distorted rule tries every thing by that wrong measure and forms his judgment accordingly eustathius  lxxviii verse  0   condemned to pain though fated not to die those are mistaken who imagine our author represents his gods as mortal he only represents the inferior or corporeal deities as capable of pains and punishments during the will of jupiter which is not inconsistent with true theology if mars is said in diones speech to venus to have been near perishing by otus and ephialtes it means no more than lasting misery such as jupiter threatens him with when he speaks of precipitating him into tartarus homer takes care to tell us both of this god and of pluto when paeon cured them that they were not mortal    lxxix verse  0   of all the gods  thou most unjust most odious etc jupiters reprimand of mars is worthy the justice and goodness of the great governor of the world and seems to be no more than was necessary in this place homer hereby admirably distinguishes between minerva and mars that is to say between wisdom and ungoverned fury the former is produced from jupiter without a mother to show that it proceeds from god alone and homers alluding to that fable in the preceding speech shows that he was not unacquainted with this opinion the latter is born of jupiter and juno because as plato explains it whatever is created by the ministry of second causes and the concurrence of matter partakes of that original spirit of division which reigned in the chaos and is of a corrupt and rebellious nature the reader will find this allegory pursued with great beauty in these two speeches especially where jupiter concludes with saying he will not destroy mars because he comes from himself god will not annihilate passion which he created to be of use to reason wisdom says eustathius upon this place has occasion for passion in the same manner as princes have need of guards therefore reason and wisdom correct and keep passion in subjection but do not entirely destroy and ruin it  lxxx verse   0  and all thy mother in thy soul rebels etc jupiter says of juno that she has a temper which is insupportable and knows not how to submit though he is perpetually chastising her with his reproofs homer says no more than this but m dacier adds si je ne la retenois par la severite des mes loix il nest rien quelle ne bouleversast dans lolympe and sous lolympe upon which she makes a remark to this effect that if it were not for the laws of providence the whole world would be nothing but confusion this practice of refining and adding to homers thought in the text and then applauding the author for it in the notes is pretty usual with the more florid modern translators in the third iliad in helens speech to priam     she wishes she had rather died than followed paris to troy to this is added in the french mais je neus ni assez de courage ni assez de virtue for which there is not the least hint in homer i mention this particular instance in pure justice because in the treatise de la corruption du gout exam de live   she triumphs over m de la motte as if he had omitted the sense and moral of homer in that place when in truth he only left out her own interpolation  lxxxi verse      as when the figs pressed juice etc the sudden operation of the remedy administered by paeon is well expressed by this similitude it is necessary just to take notice that they anciently made use of the juice or sap of a green fig for runnet to cause their milk to coagulate it may not be amiss to observe that homer is not very delicate in the choice of his allusions he often borrowed his similes from low life and provided they illustrated his thoughts in a just and lively manner it was all he had regard to  the allegory of this whole book lies so open is carried on with such closeness and wound up with so much fullness and strength that it is a wonder how it could enter into the imagination of any critic that these actions of diomed were only a daring and extravagant fiction in homer as if he affected the mavelous at any rate the great moral of it is that a brave man should not contend against heaven but resist only venus and mars incontinence and ungoverned fury diomed is proposed as an example of a great and enterprizing nature which would perpetually be venturing too far and committing extravagancies or impieties did it not suffer itself to be checked and guided by minerva or prudence for it is this wisdom as we are told in the very first lines of the book that raises a hero above all others nothing is more observable than the particular care homer has taken to show he designed this moral he never omits any occasion throughout the book to put it in express terms into the mouths of the gods or persons of the greatest weight minerva at the beginning of the battle is made to give this precept to diomed fight not against the gods but give way to them and resist only venus the same goddess opens his eyes and enlightens him so far as to perceive when it is heaven that acts immediately against him or when it is man only that opposes him the hero himself as soon as he has performed her dictates in driving away venus cries out not as to the goddess but as to the passion thou have no business with warriors is it not enough that thou deceivst weak women even the mother of venus while she comforts her daughter bears testimony to the moral that man says she is not longlived who contends with the gods and when diomed transported by his nature proceeds but a step too far apollo discovers himself in the most solemn manner and declares this truth in his own voice as it were by direct revelation mortal forbear consider and know the vast difference there is between the gods and thee they are immortal and divine but man a miserable reptile of the dust  the sixth book of the iliad the argument the episodes of glaucus and diomed and of hector and andromache the gods having left the field the grecians prevail helenus the chief augur of troy commands hector to return to the city in order to appoint a solemn procession of the queen and the trojan matrons to the temple of minerva to entreat her to remove diomed from the fight the battle relaxing during the absence of hector glaucus and diomed have an interview between the two armies where coming to the knowledge of the friendship and hospitality past between their ancestors they make exchange of their arms hector having performed the orders of helenus prevailed upon paris to return to the battle and taken a tender leave of his wife andromache hastens again to the field  the scene is first in the field of battle between the rivers simois and scamander and then changes to troy  the sixth book of the iliad now heaven forsakes the fight the immortals yield to human force and human skill the field dark showers of javelins fly from foes to

mows whole troops and makes all troy retire not thus achilles taught our hosts to dread sprung though he was from more than mortal bed not thus resistless ruled the stream of fight in rage unbounded

rage recruited the bold trojans glow and turn the tide of conflict on the foe fierce in the front he shakes two dazzling spears all greece recedes and midst her triumph fears some god they thought who

godlike hector gone when daring glaucus and great tydeus son between both armies met the chiefs from far observed each other and had marked for war near as they drew tydides thus began what art thou boldest of the race of man our eyes till now that aspect never beheld where fame is reaped amid the embatteld field yet far before the troops thou dare appear and meet a lance the fiercest heroes fear unhappy they and born of luckless sires who tempt our fury when minerva fires but if from heaven celestial thou descend know with immortals we no more contend not long lycurgus viewed the golden light that daring man who mixed with gods in fight bacchus and bacchus votaries he drove with brandished steel from nyssas sacred grove their consecrated spears lay scattered round with curling vines and twisted ivy bound while bacchus headlong sought the briny flood and thetis arms received the trembling god nor failed the crime the immortals wrath to move the immortals blessed with endless ease above deprived of sight by their avenging doom chearless he breathed and wandered in the gloom then sunk unpitied to the dire abodes a wretch accursed and hated by the gods i brave not heaven but if the fruits of earth sustain thy life and human be thy birth bold as thou art too prodigal of breath approach and enter the dark gates of death what or from whence i am or who my sire replied the chief can tydeus son enquire like leaves on trees the race of man is found now green in youth now withering on the ground another race the following spring supplies they fall successive and successive rise so generations in their course decay so flourish these when those are past away but if thou still persist to search my birth then hear a tale that fills the spacious earth a city stands on argos utmost bound  argos the fair for warlike steeds renowned aeolian sysiphus with wisdom blessed in ancient time the happy walls possessed then called ephyre glaucus was his son great glaucus father of bellerophon who over the sons of men in beauty shined loved for that valor which preserves mankind then mighty praetus argos sceptres swayed whose hard commands bellerophon obeyed with direful jealousy the monarch raged and the brave prince in numerous toils engaged for him antaea burned with lawless flame and strove to tempt him from the paths of fame in vain she tempted the relentless youth endud with wisdom sacred fear and truth fired at his scorn the queen to praetus fled and begged revenge for her insulted bed incensed he heard resolving on his fate but hospitable laws restrained his hate to lycia the devoted youth he sent with tablets sealed that told his dire intent now blessed by every power who guards the good the chief arrived at xanthus silver flood there lycias monarch paid him honors due nine days he feasted and nine bulls he slew but when the tenth bright morning orient glowed the faithful youth his monarchs mandate showed the fatal tablets till that instant sealed the deathful secret to the king revealed first dire chymaeras conquest was enjoined a mingled monster of no mortal kind behind a dragons fiery tail was spread a goats rough body bore a lions head her pitchy nostrils flaky flames expire her gaping throat emits infernal fire this pest he slaughtered for he read the skies and trusted heavens informing prodigies then met in arms the solymaean crew fiercest of men and those the warrior slew next the bold amazons whole force defied and conquered still for heaven was on his side nor ended here his toils his lycian foes at his return a treacherous ambush rose with levelled spears along the winding shore there fell they breathless and returned no more at length the monarch with repentant grief confessed the gods and goddescended chief his daughter gave the stranger to detain with half the honors of his ample reign the lycians grant a chosen space of ground with woods with vineyards and with harvests crowned there long the chief his happy lot possessed with two brave sons and one fair daughter blessed fair even in heavenly eyes her fruitful love crowned with sarpedons birth the embrace of jove but when at last distracted in his mind forsook by heaven forsaking humankind wide over the aleian field he chose to stray a long forlorn uncomfortable way woes heaped on woes oppressed his wasted heart his beauteous daughter fell by phoebes dart his eldestborn by raging mars was slain in combat on the solymaean plain hippolochus survived from him i came the honored author of my birth and name by his decree i sought the trojan town by his instructions learn to win renown to stand the first in worth as in command to add new honors to my native land before my eyes my mighty sires to place and emulate the glories of our race he spoke and transport filled tydides heart in earth the generous warrior fixed his dart then friendly thus the lycian prince addressed welcome my brave hereditary guest thus ever let us meet with kind embrace nor stain the sacred friendship of our race know chief our grandsires have been guests of old oeneus the strong bellerophon the bold our ancient seat his honored presence graced where twenty days in genial rites he passed the parting heroes mutual presents left a golden goblet was thy grandsires gift oeneus a belt of matchless work bestowed that rich with tyrian dye

of this in friendship let us join if heaven our steps to foreign lands incline my guest in argos thou and i in lycia thine enough of trojans to this lance shall yield in the full harvest of yon ample field enough of greeks shall die thy spear with gore but thou and diomed be foes no more now change we arms and prove to either host we guard the friendship of the line we boast thus having said the gallant chiefs alight their hands they join their mutual faith they plight brave glaucus then each narrow thought resigned  jove warmed his bosom and enlarged his mind for diomeds brass arms of mean device for which nine oxen paid a vulgar price he gave his own of gold divinely wrought a hundred beeves the shining purchase bought meantime the guardian of the trojan state great hector entered at the scaean gate beneath the beechtrees consecrated shades the trojan matrons and the trojan maids around him flocked all pressed with pious care for husbands brothers sons engaged in war he bids the train in long procession go and seek the gods to avert the impending woe and now to priams stately courts he came raised on arched columns of stupendous frame over these a range of marble structure runs the rich pavillions of his fifty sons in fifty chambers lodged and rooms of state opposed to those where priams daughters sat twelve domes for them and their loved spouses shone of equal beauty and of polished stone hither great hector passed nor passed unseen of royal hecuba his mother queen with her laodice whose beauteous face surpassed the nymphs of troys illustrious race long in a strict embrace she held her son and pressed his hand and tender thus begun o hector say what great occasion calls my son from fight when greece surrounds our walls come thou to supplicate the almighty

plenteous draught refresh thy soul and draw new spirits from the generous bowl spent as thou art with long laborious fight the brave defender of thy countrys right far hence be bacchus gifts the chief rejoined inflaming wine pernicious to mankind unnerves the limbs and dulls the noble mind let chiefs abstain and spare the sacred juice to sprinkle to the gods its better use by me that holy office

ruin of our race deep to the dark abyss might he descend troy yet should flourish and my sorrows end this heard she gave command and summoned came each noble matron and illustrious dame the phrygian queen to her rich wardrobe went where treasured odors breathed a costly scent there lay the vestures of no vulgar art sidonian maids embroidered every part whom from soft sidon youthful paris bore with helen touching on the tyrian shore here as the queen revolved with careful eyes the various textures and the various dies she chose a veil that shone superior far and glowed refulgent as the morning star herself with this the long procession leads the train majestically slow proceeds soon as to ilions topmost tower they come and awful reach the high palladian dome antenors consort fair theano waits as pallas priestess and unbars the gates with hands uplifted and imploring eyes they fill the dome with supplicating cries the priestess then the shining veil displays placed on minervas knees and thus she prays oh awful goddess everdreadful maid troys strong defense unconquered pallas aid break thou tydides spear and let him fall prone on the dust before the trojan wall so twelve young heifers guiltless of the yoke shall fill thy temple with a grateful smoke but thou attond by penitence and prayer our selves our infants and our city spare so prayed the priestess in her holy fane so vowed the matrons but they vowed in vain while these appear before the power with prayers hector to paris lofty dome repairs himself the mansion raised from every part assembling architects of matchless art near priams court and hectors palace stands the pompous structure and the town commands a spear the hero bore of wondrous strength of full ten cubits was the lances length the steely point with golden ringlets joined before him brandished at each motion shined thus entering in the glittering rooms he found his brotherchief whose useless arms lay round his eyes delighting with their splendid show brightning the shield and polishing the bow beside him helen with her virgins stands guides their rich labors and instructs their hands him thus unactive with an ardent look the prince beheld and highresenting spoke thy hate to troy is this the time to show oh wretch illfated and thy countrys foe paris and greece against us both conspire thy close resentment and their vengeful ire for thee great ilions guardian heroes fall till heaps of dead alone defend her wall for thee the soldier bleeds the matron mourns and wastful war in all its fury burns ungrateful man deserves not this thy care our troops to hearten and our toils to share rise or behold the conquering flames ascend and all the phrygian glories at an end brother it is just replied the beauteous youth thy free remonstrance proves thy worth and truth yet charge my absence less oh generous chief on hate to troy than conscious shame and grief here hid from human eyes thy brother sat and mourned in secret his and ilions fate it is now enough now glory spreads her charms and beauteous helen calls her chief to arms conquest to day my happier sword may bless it is mans to fight but heavens to give success but while i arm contain thy ardent mind or go and paris shall not lag behind he said nor answered priams warlike son when helen thus with lowly grace begun oh generous brother if the guilty dame that caused these woes deserve a sisters name would heaven ere all these dreadful deeds were done the day that showed me to the golden sun had seen my death why did not whirlwinds bear the fatal infant to the fowls of air why sunk i not beneath the whelming tide and midst the roarings of the waters died heaven filled up all my ills and i accursed bore all and paris of those ills the worst helen at least a braver spouse might claim warmed with some virtue some regard of fame now tired with toils thy fainting limbs recline with toils sustained for paris sake and mine the gods have linked our miserable doom our present woe and infamy to come wide shall it spread and last through ages long example sad and theme of future song the chief replied this time forbids to rest the trojan bands by hostile fury pressed demand their hector and his arm require the combat urges and my souls on fire urge thou thy knight to march where glory calls and timely join me ere i leave the walls ere yet i mingle in the direful fray my wife my infant claim a moments stay this day perhaps the last that sees me here demands a parting word a tender tear this day some god who hates our trojan land may vanquish hector by a grecian hand he said and past with sad presaging heart to seek his spouse his souls far dearer part at home he sought her but he sought in vain she with one maid of all her menial train had thence retired and with her second joy the young astyanax the hope of troy pensive she stood on ilions towry height beheld the war and sickend at the sight there her sad eyes in vain her lord explore or weep the wounds her bleeding country bore but he who found not whom his soul desired whose virtue charmed him as her beauty fired stood in the gates and asked what way she bent her parting step if to the fane she went where late the mourning matrons made resort or sought her sisters in the trojan court not to the court replied the attendant train nor mixed with matrons to minervas fane to ilions steepy tower she bent her way to mark the fortunes of the doubtful day troy fled she heard before the grecian sword she heard and trembled for her absent lord distracted with surprise she seemed to fly fear on her cheek and sorrow in her eye the nurse attended with her infant boy the young astyanax the hope of troy hector this heard returned without delay swift through the town he trod his former way through streets of palaces and walks of state and met the mourner at the scaean gate with haste to meet him sprung the joyful fair his blameless wife aetions wealthy heir  cilician thebe great aetion swayed and hippoplacus wideextended shade the nurse stood near in whose embraces pressed his only hope hung smiling at her breast whom each soft charm and early grace adorn fair as the newborn star that gilds the morn to this loved infant hector gave the name scamandrius from scamanders honored stream astyanax the trojans called the boy from his great father the defense of troy silent the warrior smiled and pleased resigned to tender passions all his mighty mind his beauteous princess cast a mournful look hung on his hand and then dejected spoke her bosom labored with a boding sigh and the big tear stood trembling in her eye too daring prince ah whither do thou run ah too forgetful of thy wife and son and think thou not how wretched we shall be a widow i an helpless orphan he for sure such courage length of life denies and thou must fall thy virtues sacrifice greece in her single heroes strove in vain now hosts oppose thee and thou must be slain oh grant me gods ere hector meets his doom all i can ask of heaven an early tomb so shall my days in one sad tenor run and end with sorrows as they first begun no parent now remains my griefs to share no fathers aid no mothers tender care the fierce achilles wrapped our walls in fire laid thebe waste and slew my warlike sire his fate compassion in the victor bred stern as he was he yet revered the dead his radiant arms preserved from hostile spoil and laid him decent on the funeral pyle then raised a mountain where his bones were burned the mountain nymphs the rural tomb adorned joves sylvan daughters bade their elms bestow a barren shade and in his honor grow by the same arm my sevn brave brothers fell in one sad day beheld the gates of hell while the fat herds and snowie flocks they fed amid their fields the hapless heroes bled my mother lived to bear the victors bands the queen of hippoplacias sylvan lands redeemed too late she scarce beheld again her pleasing empire and her native plain when ah oppressed by lifeconsuming woe she fell a victim to dianas bow yet while my hector still survives i see my father mother brethren all in thee alas my parents brothers kindred all once more will perish if my hector fall thy wife thy infant in thy danger share oh prove a husbands and a fathers care that quarter most the skillful greeks annoy where yon wild fig trees join the wall of troy thou from this tower defend the important post there agamemnon points his dreadful host that pass tydides ajax strive to gain and there the vengeful spartan fires his train thrice our bold foes the fierce attack have given or led by hopes or dictated from heaven let others in the field their arms employ but stay my hector here and guard his troy the chief replied that post shall be my care nor that alone but all the works of war how would the sons of troy in arms renowned and troys proud dames whose garments sweep the ground attaint the luster of my former name should hector basely quit the field of fame my early youth was bred to martial pains my soul impells me to the embatteld plains let me be foremost to defend the throne and guard my fathers glories and my own yet come it will the day decreed by fates how my heart trembles while my tongue relates the day when thou imperial troy must bend and see thy warriors fall thy glories end and yet no dire prefage so wounds my mind my mothers death the ruin of my kind not priams hoary hairs defiled with gore not all my brothers gasping on the shore as thine andromache thy griefs i dread i see thee trembling weeping captive led in argive looms our battles to design and woes of which so large a part was thine to bear the victors hard commands or bring the weight of waters from hyperias spring there while you groan beneath the load of life they cry behold the mighty hectors wife some haughty greek who lives thy tears to see embitters all thy woes by naming me the thoughts of glory past and present shame a thousand griefs shall waken at the name may i lie cold before that dreadful day pressed with a load of monumental clay thy hector wrapped in everlasting sleep shall neither hear thee sigh nor see thee weep thus having spoke the illustrious chief of troy stretched his fond arms to clasp the lovely boy the babe clung crying to his nurses breast scared at the dazzling helm and nodding crest with secret pleasure each fond parent smiled and hector hasted to relieve his child the glittering terrors from his brows unbound and placed the beaming helmet on the ground then kissed the child and lifting high in air thus to the gods preferred a fathers prayer o thou whose glory fills the aetherial throne and all ye deathless powers protect my son grant him like me to purchase just renown to guard the trojans to defend the crown against his countrys foes the war to wage and rise the hector of the future age so when triumphant from successful toils of heroes slain he bears the reeking spoils whole hosts may hail him with deserved acclaim and say this chief transcends his fathers fame while pleased amidst the general shouts of troy his mothers conscious heart overflows with joy he spoke and fondly gazing on her charms restored the pleasing burden to her arms soft on her fragrant breast the babe she laid hushed to repose and with a smile surveyed the troubled pleasure soon chastisd by fear she mingled with the smile a tender tear the softened chief with kind compassion viewed and dried the falling drops and thus pursued andromache my souls far better part why with untimely sorrows heaves thy heart no hostile hand can antedate my doom till fate condemns me to the silent tomb fixed is the term to all the race of earth and such the hard condition of our birth no force can then resist no flight can save all sink alike the fearful and the brave no more  but hasten to thy tasks at home there guide the spindle and direct the loom me glory summons to the martial scene the field of combat is the sphere for men where heroes war the foremost place i claim the first in danger as the first in fame thus having said the glorious chief resumes his towry helmet black with shading plumes his princess parts with a prophetic sigh unwilling parts and often reverts her eye that streamed at every look then moving slow sought her own palace and indulged her woe there while her tears deplored the godlike man through all her train the soft infection ran the pious maids their mingled sorrows shed and mourn the living hector as the dead but now no longer deaf to honors call forth issues paris from the palace wall in brazen arms that cast a gleamy ray swift through the town the warrior bends his way the wanton courser thus with reins unbound breaks from his stall and beats the trembling ground pampered and proud he seeks the wonted tides and laves in height of blood his shining sides his head now freed he tosses to the skies his mane disheveled over his shoulders flies he snuffs the females in the distant plain and springs exulting to his fields again with equal triumph sprightly bold and gay in arms refulgent as the god of day the son of priam glorying in his might rushed forth with hector to the fields of fight and now the warriors passing on the way the graceful paris first excused his stay to whom the noble hector thus replied o chief in blood and now in arms allied thy power in war with justice none contest known is thy courage and thy strength confessed what pity sloth should seize a soul so brave or godlike paris live a womans slave my heart weeps blood at what the trojans say and hopes thy deeds shall wipe the stain away haste then in all their glorious labors share for much they suffer for thy sake in war these ills shall cease whenever by joves decree we crown the bowl to heaven and liberty while the proud foe his frustrate triumphs mourns and greece indignant through her seas returns observations on the sixth book observations on the sixth book i verse   first ajax ajax performs his exploits immediately upon the departure of the gods from the battle it is observed that this hero is never assisted by the deities as most of the rest are see his character in the notes on the seventh book the expression of the greek is that he brought light to his troops which m dacier takes to be metaphorical i do not see but it may be literal he broke the thick squadrons of the enemy and opened a passage for the light  ii verse   the thracian acamas this thracian prince is the same in whose likeness mars appears in the preceding book rallying the trojans and forcing the greeks to retire in the present description of his strength and size we see with what propriety this personage was selected by the poet as fit to be assumed by the god of war  iii verse    axylus hospitable this beautiful character of axylus has not been able to escape the misunderstanding of some of the commentators who thought homer designed it as a reproof of an undistinguished generosity it is evidently a panegyric on that virtue and not improbably on the memory of some excellent but unfortunate man in that country whom the poet honors with the noble title of a friend to mankind it is indeed a severe reproof of the ingratitude of men and a kind of satyr on human race while he represents this lover of his species miserably perishing without assistance from any of those numbers he had obliged this death is very moving and the circumstance of a faithful servants dying by his side well imagined and natural to such a character his manner of keeping house near a frequented highway and relieving all travelers is agreeable to that ancient hospitality which we now only read of there is abundance of this spirit every where in the odysseis the patriarchs in the old testament sit at their gates to see those who pass by and entreat them to enter into their houses this cordial manner of invitation is particularly described in the    th and    th chapters of genesis the eastern nations seem to have had a peculiar disposition to these exercises of humanity which continues in a great measure to this day it is yet a piece of charity frequent with the turks to erect caravanserahs or inns for the reception of travelers since i am upon this head i must mention one or two extraordinary examples of ancient hospitality diodorus siculus writes of gallias of agrigentum that having built several inns for the relief of strangers he appointed persons at the gates to invite all who traveled to make use of them and that this example was followed by many others who were inclined after the ancient manner to live in a human and beneficent correspondence with mankind that this gallias entertained and clothed at one time no less than five hundred horsemen and that there were in his cellars three hundred vessels each of which contained an hundred hogsheads of wine the same author tells us of another agrigentine that at the marriage of his daughter feasted all the people of his city who at that time were above twenty thousand  herodotus in his seventh book has a story of this kind which is prodigious being of a private man so immensely rich as to entertain xerxes and his whole army i shall transcribe the passage as i find it translated to my hands   pythius the son of atys a lydian then residing in celaene entertained the king and all his army with great magnificence and offered him his treasures toward the expense of the war which liberality xerxes communicating to the persians about him and asking who this pythius was and what riches he might have to enable him to make such an offer received this answer pythius said they is the person who presented your father darius with a planetree and vine of gold and after you is the richest man we know in the world xerxes surpised with these last words asked him to what sum his treasures might amount i shall conceal nothing from you said pythius nor pretend to be ignorant of my own wealth but being perfectly informed of the state of my accounts shall tell you the truth with sincerity when i heard you was ready to begin the march toward the grecian sea i resolved to present you with a sum of money toward the charge of the war and to that end having taken an account of my riches i found by computation that i had two thousand talents of silver and three millions nine hundred ninety three thousand pieces of gold bearing the stamp of darius these treasures i freely give you because i shall be sufficiently furnished with whatever is necessary to life by the labor of my servants and husbandmen   xerxes heard these words with pleasure and in answer to pythius said my lydian host since i parted from susa i have not found a man besides your self who has offered to entertain my army or voluntarily to contribute his treasures to promote the present expedition you alone have treated my army magnificently and readily offered me immense riches therefore in return of your kindness i make you my host and that you may be master of the entire sum of four millions in gold i will give you seven thousand darian pieces out of my own treasure keep then all the riches you now possess and if you know how to continue always in the same good disposition you shall never have reason to repent of your affection to me either now or in future time    the sum here offered by pythius amounts by brerewoods computation to three millions three hundred seventy five thousand pounds sterling according to the lesser valuation of talents i make no apology for inserting so remarkable a passage at length but shall only add that it was at last the fate of this pythius like our axylus to experience the ingratitude of man his eldest son being afterward cut in pieces by the same xerxes  iv verse    oh spare my youth etc this passage where agamemnon takes away that trojans life whom menelaus had pardoned and is not blamed by homer for so doing must be ascribed to the uncivilized manners of those times when mankind was not united by the bonds of a rational society and is not therefore to be imputed to the poet who followed nature as it was in his days the historical books of the old testament abound in instances of the like cruelty to conquered enemies  virgil had this part of homer in his view when he described the death of magus in the tenth aeneid those lines of his prayer where he offers a ransom are translated from this of adrastus but both the prayer and the answer aeneas makes when he refuses him mercy are very much heightened and improved they also receive a great addition of beauty and propriety from the occasion on which he inserts them young pallas is just killed and aeneas seeking to be revenged upon turnus meets this magus nothing can be a more artful piece of address than the first lines of that supplication if we consider the character of aeneas to whom it is made per patrios manes per spes surgentis juli te precor hanc animam serves natoque patrique and what can exceed the closeness and fullness of that reply to it  belli commercia turnus sustulit ista prior jam tum pallante perempto hoc patris anchisae manes hoc sentit julus this removes the imputation of cruelty from aeneas which had less agreed with his character than it does with agamemnons whose reproof to menelaus in this place is not unlike that of samuel to saul for not killing agag  v verse    her infants at the breast shall fall or her infants yet in the womb for it will bear either sense but i think madam dacier in the right in her affirmation that the greeks were not arrived to that pitch of cruelty to rip up the wombs of women with child homer says she to remove all equivocal meaning from this phrase adds the words  juvenem puerulum existentem which would be ridiculous were it said of a child yet unborn besides he would never have represented one of his first heroes capable of so barbarous a crime or at least would not have commended him as he does just after for such a wicked exhortation  vi verse    first gain the conquest then divide the spoil this important maxim of war is very naturally introduced upon nestors having seen menelaus ready to spare an enemy for the sake of a ransom it was for such lessons as these says m dacier that alexander so much esteemed homer and studied his poem he made his use of this precept in the battle of arbela when parmenio being in danger of weakening the main body to defend the baggage he sent this message to him leave the baggage there for if we carry the victory we shall not only recover what is our own but be masters of all that is the enemys histories ancient and modern are filled with examples of enterprises that have miscarried and battles that have been lost by the greediness of soldiers for pillage  vii verse    wise to consult and active to defend this is a twofold branch of praise expressing the excellence of these princes both in council and in battle i think madam daciers translation does not come up to the sense of the original les plus hardis and les plus experimentez des nos capitains  viii verse  0  thou hector to the town it has been a modern objection to homers conduct that hector upon whom the whole fate of the day depended is made to retire from the battle only to carry a message to troy concerning a sacrifice which might have been done as well by any other they think it absurd in helenus to advise this and in hector to comply with it what occasioned this false criticism was that they imagined it to be a piece of advice and not a command helenus was a priest and augur of the highest rank he enjoins it as a point of religion and hector obeys him as one inspired from heaven the trojan army was in the utmost distress occasioned by the prodigious slaughter made by diomed there was therefore more reason and necessity to propitiate minerva who assisted that hero which helenus might know though hector would have chosen to have stayed and trusted to the arm of flesh here is nothing but what may agree with each of their characters hector goes as he was obliged in religion but not before he has animated the troops reestablished the combat repulsed the greeks to some distance received a promise from helenus that they would make a stand at the gates and given one himself to the army that he would soon return to the fight all which homer has been careful to specify to save the honor and preserve the character of this hero as to helenus his part he saw the straits his countrymen were reduced to he knew his authority as a priest and designed to revive the courage of the troops by a promise of divine assistance nothing adds more courage to the minds of men than superstition and perhaps it was the only expedient then left much like a modern practice in the army to enjoin a fast when they wanted provision helenus could no way have made his promise more credible than by sending away hector which looked like an assurance that nothing could prejudice them during his absence on such a religious account no leader of less authority than hector could so properly have enjoined this solemn act of religion and lastly no other whose valor was less known than his could have left the army in this juncture without a taint upon his honor homer makes this piety succeed paris is brought back to the fight the trojans afterward prevail and jupiter appears openly in their favor l   though after all i cannot dissemble my opinion that the poets chief intention in this was to introduce that fine episode of the parting of hector and andromache this change of the scene to troy furnishes him with a great number of beauties by this means says eustathius his poem is for a time divested of the fierceness and violence of battles and being as it were washed from slaughter and blood becomes calm and smiling by the beauty of these various episodes  ix verse     if so the power attond the poet here plainly supposes helenus by his skill in augury or some other divine inspiration well informed that the might of diomed which wrought such great destruction among the trojans was the gift of pallas incensed against them the prophet therefore directs prayers offerings and sacrifices to be made to appease the anger of this offended goddess not to invoke the mercy of any propitious deity this is conformable to the whole system of pagan superstition the worship whereof being grounded not on love but fear seems directed rather to avert the malice and anger of a wrathful and mischievous demon than to implore the assistance and protection of a benevolent being in this strain of religion this same prophet is introduced by virgil in the third aeneid giving particular direction to aeneas to appease the indignation of juno as the only means which could bring his labors to a prosperous end unum illud tibi nate dea praeque omnibus unum praedicam and repetens iterumque iterumque monebo junonis magnae primum prece numen adora junoni cane vota libens dominamque potentem supplicibus supera donis    x verse     the interview of glaucus and diomed no passage in our author has been the subject of more severe and groundless criticisms than this where these two heroes enter into a long conversation as they will have it in the heat of a battle monsieur daciers answer in defense of homer is so full that i cannot do better than to translate it from his remarks on the    th chapter of aristotles poetic there can be nothing more unjust than the criticisms past upon things that are the effect of custom it was usual in ancient times for soldiers to talk together before they encountered homer is full of examples of this sort and he very well deserves we should be so just as to believe he had never done it so often but that it was agreeable to the manners of his age but this is not only a thing of custom but founded in reason itself the ties of hospitality in those times were held more sacred than those of blood and it is on that account diomed gives so long an audience to glaucus whom he acknowledges to be his guest with whom it was not lawful to engage in combat homer makes an admirable use of this conjuncture to introduce an entertaining history after so many battles as he has been describing and to unbend the mind of his reader by a recital of so much variety as the story of the family of sisyphus it may be farther observed with what address and management he places this long conversation it is not during the heat of an obstinate battle which had been too unseasonable to be excused by any custom whatever but he brings it in after he has made hector retire into troy when the absence of so powerful an enemy had given diomed that leisure which he could not have had otherwise one need only read the judicious remark of eustathius upon this place the poet says he after having caused hector to go out of the fight interrupts the violence of wars and gives some relaxation to the reader in causing him to pass from the confusion and disorder of the action to the tranquillity and security of an historical narration for by means of the happy episode of glaucus he casts a thousand pleasing wonders into his poem as fables that include beautiful allegories histories genealogies sentences ancient customs and several other graces that tend to the diversifying of his work and which by breaking as one may say the monotomy of it agreeably instruct the reader let us observe in how fine a manner homer has hereby praised both diomed and hector for he makes us know that as long as hector is in the field the greeks have not the least leisure to take breath and that as soon as he quits it all the trojans however they had regained all their advantages were not able to employ diomed so far as to prevent his entertaining himself with glaucus without any danger to his party some may think after all that though we may justify homer we cannot excuse the manners of his time it not being natural for men with swords in their hands to dialogue together in cold blood just before they engage but not to allege that these very manners yet remain in those countries which have not been corrupted by the commerce of other nations which is a great sign of their being natural what reason can be offered that it is more natural to fall on at first sight with rage and fierceness than to speak to an enemy before the encounter thus far monsieur dacier and st evremont asks humourously if it might not be as proper in that country for men to harangue before they fought as it is in england to make speeches before they are hanged  that homer is not in general apt to make unseasonable harangues as these censurers would represent may appear from that remarkable care he has shown in many places to avoid them as when in the fifth book aeneas being cured on a sudden in the middle of the fight is seen with surprise by his soldiers he specifies with particular caution that they asked him no questions how he became cured in a time of so much business and action again when there is a necessity in the same book that minerva should have a conference with diomed in order to engage him against mars after her prohibition to him to fight with the gods homer chooses a time for that speech just when the hero is retired behind his chariot to take breath which was the only moment that could be spared during the hurry of that whole engagement one might produce many instances of the same kind  the discourse of glaucus to diomed is severely censured not only on account of the circumstance of time and place but likewise on the score of the subject which is taxed as improper and foreign to the end and design of the poem but the critics who have made this objection seem neither to comprehend the design of the poet in general nor the particular aim of this discourse many passages in the best ancient poets appear unaffecting at present which probably gave the greatest delight to their first readers because they were nearly interested in what was there related it is very plain that homer designed this poem as a monument to the honor of the greeks who though consisting of several independent societies were yet very national in point of glory being strongly affected with every thing that seemed to advance the honor of their common country and resentful of any indignity offered to it this disposition was the ground of that grand alliance which is the subject of this poem to men so fond of their countrys glory what could be more agreeable than to read a history filled with wonders of a noble family transplanted from greece into asia they might here learn with pleasure that the grecian virtues did not degenerate by removing into distant climes but especially they must be affected with uncommon delight to find that sarpedon and glaucus the bravest of the trojan auxiliaries were originally greeks  tasso in this manner has introduced an agreeable episode which shows clorinda the offspring of christian parents though engaged in the service of the infidels cant     xi verse     between both armies met etc it is usual with homer before he introduces a hero to make as it were a halt to render him the more remarkable nothing could more prepare the attention and expectation of the reader than this circumstance at the first meeting of diomed and glaucus just at the time when the mind begins to be weary with the battle it is diverted with the prospect of a single combat which of a sudden turns to an interview of friendship and an unexpected scene of sociable virtue the whole air of the conversation between these two heroes has something heroically solemn in it  xii verse     but if from heaven etc a quick change of mind from the greatest impiety to as great superstition is frequently observable in men who having been guilty of the most heinous crimes without any remorse on the sudden are filled with doubts and scruples about the most lawful or indifferent actions this seems the present case of diomed who having knowingly wounded and insulted the deities is now afraid to engage the first man he meets lest perhaps a god might be concealed in that shape this disposition of diomed produces the question he puts to glaucus which without this consideration will appear impertinent and so naturally occasions that agreeable episode of bellerophon which glaucus relates in answer to diomed  xiii verse     not long lycurgus etc what diomed here says is the effect of remorse as if he had exceeded the commission of pallas in encountering with the gods and dreaded the consequences of proceeding too far at least he had no such commission now and besides was no longer capable of distinguishing them from men a faculty she had given him in the foregoing book he therefore mentions this story of lycurgus as an example that sufficed to terrify him from so rash an undertaking the ground of the fable they say is this lycurgus caused most of the vines of his country to be rooted up so that his subjects were obliged to mix it with water when it was less plentiful hence it was feigned that thetis received bacchus into her bosom  xiv verse   0 immortals blessed with endless ease though daciers and most of the versions take no notice of the epithet used in this place  dii facile seu beat viventes the translator thought it a beauty which he could not but endeavor to preserve  xv verse     approach and enter the dark gates of death this haughty air which homer gives his heroes was doubtless a copy of the manners and hyperbolical speeches of those times thus goliath to david sam   chapter    approach and i will give thy flesh to the fowls of the air and the beasts of the field the orientals speak the same language to this day  xvi verse     like leaves on trees there is a noble gravity in the beginning of this speech of glaucus according to the true style of antiquity few and evil are our days this beautiful thought of our author whereby the race of men are compared to the leaves of trees is celebrated by simonides in a fine fragment extant in stobaeus the same thought may be found in ecclesiasticus chapter       almost in the same words as of the green leaves on a thick tree some fall and some grow so is the generation of flesh and blood one comes to an end and another is born  the reader who has seen so many passages imitated from homer by succeeding poets will no doubt be pleased to see one of an ancient poet which homer has here imitated this is a fragment of musaeus preserved by clemens alexandrinus in his stromata lib      though this comparison be justly admired for its beauty in this obvious application to the mortality and succession of human life it seems however designed by the poet in this place as a proper emblem of the transitory state not of men but of families which being by their misfortunes or follies fallen and decayed do again in a happier season revive and flourish in the fame and virtues of their posterity in this sense it is a direct answer to what diomed had asked as well as a proper preface to what glaucus relates of his own family which having been extinct in corinth had recovered new life in lycia  xvii verse     then called ephyre it was the same which was afterward called corinth and had that name in homers time as appears from this catalogue     xviii verse     loved for that valor which preserves mankind this distinction of true valor which has the good of mankind for its end in opposition to the valor of tyrants or oppressors is beautifully hinted by homer in the epithet  amiable valor such as was that of bellerophon who freed the land from monsters and creatures destructive to his species it is applied to this young hero with particular judgment and propriety if we consider the innocence and gentleness of his manners appearing from the following story which every one will observe has a great resemblance with that of joseph in the scriptures  xix verse     the faithful youth his monarchs mandate showed plutarch much commends the virtue of bellerophon who faithfully carried those letters he might so justly suspect of ill consequence to him the passage is in his discourse of curiosity and worth transcribing a man of curiosity is void of all faith and it is better to trust letters or any important secrets to servants than to friends and familiars of an inquisitive temper bellerophon when he carried letters that ordered his own destruction did not unseal them but forbore touching the kings dispatches with the same continence as he had refrained from injuring his bed for curiosity is an incontinence as well as adultery  xx verse     first dire chimaera chimaera was feigned to have the head of a lion breathing flames the body of a goat and the tail of a dragon because the mountain of that name in lycia had a vulcano on its top and nourished lions the middle part afforded pasture for goats and the bottom was infested with serpents bellerophon destroying these and rendering the mountain habitable was said to have conquered chimaera he calls this monster  in the manner of the hebrews who gave to any thing vast or extraordinary the appellative of divine so the psalmist says the mountains of god etc  xxi verse     the solymaean crew these solymi were an ancient nation inhabiting the mountainous parts of asia minor between lycia and pisidia pliny mentions them as an instance of a people so entirely destroyed that no footsteps of them remained in his time some authors both ancient and modern from a resemblance in sound to the latin name of jerusalem have confounded them with the jews tacitus speaking of the various opinions concerning the origin of the jewish nation has these words clara alii tradunt judaeorum initia solymos carminibus homeri celebratum gentem conditae urbi hierosolymam nomen e suo fecisse hist lib    xxii verse     the lycians grant a chosen space of ground it was usual in the ancient times upon any signal piece of service performed by the kings or great men to have a portion of land decreed by the public as a reward to them thus when sarpedon in the twelfth book incites glaucus to behave himself valiantly he puts him in mind of these possessions granted by his countrymen   etc   in the same manner in the ninth book of virgil nisus is promised by ascanius the fields which were possessed by latinus as a reward for the service he undertook  campi quod rex habet ipse latinus   chapman has an interpolation in this place to tell us that this field was afterward called by the lycians the field of wanderings from the wanderings and distraction of bellerophon in the latter part of his life but they were not these fields that were called  but those upon which he fell from the horse pegasus when he endeavored as the fable has it to mount to heaven  xxiii verse     but when at last etc the same critics who have taxed homer for being too tedious in this story of bellerophon have censured him for omitting to relate the particular offense which had raised the anger of the gods against a man formerly so highly favored by them but this relation coming from the mouth of his grandson it is with great decorum and propriety he passes over in silence those crimes of his ancestor which had provoked the divine vengeance against him milton has interwoven this story with what homer here relates of bellerophon lest from this flying steed unreind as once bellerophon though from a lower clime dismounted on the aleian field i fall erroneous there to wander and forlorn parad lost b    tully in his third book of tusculane questions having observed that persons oppressed with woe naturally seek solitude instances this example of bellerophon and gives us his translation of two of these lines qui miser in campos moerens errabat aleis ipse suum cor edens hominum vestigia vitans   xxiv verse     our grandsires have been guests of old the laws of hospitality were anciently held in great veneration the friendship contracted hereby was so sacred that they preferred it to all the bands of consanguinity and alliance and accounted it obligatory even to the third and fourth generation we have seen in the foregoing story of bellerophon that proetus a prince under the supposition of being injured in the highest degree is yet afraid to revenge himself upon the criminal on this account he is forced to send him into lycia rather than be guilty of a breach of this law in his own country and the king of lycia having entertained the stranger before he unsealed the letters puts him upon expeditions abroad in which he might be destroyed rather than at his court we here see diomed and glaucus agreeing not to be enemies during the whole course of a war only because their grandfathers had been mutual guests and we afterward find teaer engaged with the greeks on this account against the trojans though he was himself of trojan extraction the nephew of priam by the mothers side and cousin german of hector whose life he pursues with the utmost violence they preserved in their families the presents which had been made on these occasions as obliged to transmit to their children the memorials of this right of hospitality eustathius  xxv verse     jove warmed his bosom and enlarged his mind the words in the original are  which may equally be interpreted he took away his sense or he elevated his mind the former being a reflection upon glaucuss prudence for making so unequal an exchange the latter a praise of the magnanimity and generosity which induced him to it porphyry contends for its being understood in this last way and eustathius monsieur and madam dacier are of the same opinion notwithstanding it is certain that homer uses the same words in the contrary sense in the seventeenth iliad   0 and in the nineteenth     and it is an obvious remark that the interpretation of porphyry as much dishonours diomed who proposed this exchange as it does honor to glaucus for consenting to it however i have followed it if not as the juster as the most heroic sense and as it has the nobler air in poetry  xxvi verse     a hundred beeves i wonder the curious have not remarked from this place that the proportion of the value of gold to brass in the time of the trojan war was but as an hundred to nine allowing these armours of equal weight which as they belonged to men of equal strength is a reasonable supposition as to this manner of computing the value of the armor by beeves or oxen it might be either because the money was anciently stamped with those figures or which is most probable in this place because in those times they generally purchased by exchange of commodities as we see by a passage near the end of the seventh book  xxvii verse     far hence be bacchus gifts  enflaming wine this maxim of hectors concerning wine has a great deal of truth in it it is a vulgar mistake to imagine the use of wine either raises the spirits or increases strength the best physicians agree with homer in the point whatever our modern soldiers may object to this old heroic regimen one may take notice that sampson as well as hector was a waterdrinker for he was a nazarite by vow and as such was forbid the use of wine to which milton alludes in his sampson agonistes wherever fountain or fresh current flowed against the eastern ray translucent pure with touch ethereal of heavens fiery rod i drank from the clear milky juice allaying thirst and refreshed nor envied them the grape whose heads that turbulent liquor fills with fumes   xxviii verse     ill fits it me with human gore distained etc the custom which prohibits persons polluted with blood to perform any offices of divine worship before they were purified is so ancient and universal that it may in some sort be esteemed a precept of natural religion tending to inspire an uncommon dread and religious horror of bloodshed there is a fine passage in euripides where iphigenia argues how impossible it is that human sacrifices should be acceptable to the gods since they do not permit any defiled with blood or even polluted with the touch of a dead body to come near their altars iphig in tauris   0 virgil makes his aeneas say the same thing hector does here me bello e tanto digressum and caede recenti attrectare nefas donec me flumine vivo abluero    xxix verse     sidonian maids dictys cretensis lib   acquaints us that paris returned not directly to troy after the rape of helen but fetched a compass probably to avoid pursuit he touched at sidon where he surprised the king of phoenicia by night and carried off many of his treasures and captives among which probably were these sidonian women the author of the ancient poem of the cypriacks says he sailed from sparta to troy in the space of three days from which passage herodotus concludes that poem was not homers we find in the scriptures that tire and sidon were famous for works in gold embroidery etc and for whatever regarded magnificence and luxury  xxx verse     with hands uplifted the only gesture described by homer as used by the ancients in the invocation of the gods is the lifting up their hands to heaven virgil frequently alludes to this practice particularly in the second book there is a passage the beauty of which is much raised by this consideration ecce trahebatur passis priameia virgo crinibus a templo cassandra adytisque minervae ad caelum tendens ardentia lumina frustra lumina nam teneras arcebant vincula palmas   xxxi verse     oh awful goddess etc this procession of the trojan matrons to the temple of minerva with their offering and the ceremonies though it be a passage some moderns have criticisd upon seems to have particularly pleased virgil for he has not only introduced it among the figures in the picture at carthage interea ad templum non aequae palladis ibant crinibus iliades passis peplumque ferebant suppliciter tristes and tunsis pectora palmis diva solo fixos oculos aversa tenebat but he has again copied it in the eleventh book where the latian dames make the same procession upon the approach of aeneas to their city the prayer to the goddess is translated almost word for word armipotens praeses belli tritonia virgo frange manu telum phrygii praedonis and ipsum pronum stern solo portisque effunde sub altis this prayer in the latin poet seems introduced with less propriety since pallas appears no where interested in the conduct of affairs through the whole aeneid the first line of the greek here is translated more literally than the former versions  i take the first epithet to allude to minervas being the particular protectress of troy by means of the palladium and not as mr hobbes understands it the protectress of all cities in general  xxxii verse     but they vowed in vain for helenus only ordered that prayers should be made to minerva to drive diomed from before the walls but theano prays that diomed may perish and perish flying which is included in his falling forward madam dacier is so free as to observe here that women are seldom moderate in the prayers they make against their enemies and therefore are seldom heard  xxxiii verse   0 himself the mansion raised i must own my self not so great an enemy to paris as some of the commentators his blind passion is the unfortunate occasion of the ruin of his country and he has the ill fate to have all his fine qualities swallowed up in that and indeed i cannot say he endeavors much to be a better man than his nature made him but as to his parts and turn of mind i see nothing that is either weak or wicked the general manners of those times considered on the contrary a gentle soul patient of good advice though indolent enough to forget it and liable only to that frailty of love which methinks might in his case as well as helens be charged upon the stars and the gods so very amorous a constitution and so incomparable a beauty to provoke it might be temptation enough even to a wise man and in some degree make him deserve compassion if not pardon it is remarkable that homer does not paint him and helen as some other poets would have done like monsters odious to gods and men but allows their characters such esteemable qualifications as could consist and in truth generally do with tender frailties he gives paris several polite accomplishments and in particular a turn to those sciences that are the result of a fine imagination he makes him have a taste and addiction to curious works of all sorts which caused him to transport sidonian artists to troy and employ himself at home in adorning and finishing his armor and now we are told that he assembled the most skilful builders from all parts of the country to render his palace a complete piece of architecture this together with what homer has said elsewhere of his skill in the harp which in those days included both music and poetry may i think establish him a belesprit and a fine genius  xxxiv verse  0  thy hate to troy etc all the commentators observe this speech of hector to be a piece of artifice he seems to imagine that the retirement of paris proceeds only from his resentment against the trojans and not from his indolence luxury or any other cause plutarch thus discourses upon it as a discreet physician rather chooses to cure his patient by diet or rest than by castoreum or scammony so a good friend a good master or a good father are always better pleased to make use of commendation than reproof for the reformation of manners for nothing so much assists a man who reprehends with frankness and liberty nothing renders him less offensive or better promotes his good design than to reprove with calmness affection and temper he ought not therefore to urge them too severely if they deny the fact nor forestall their justification of themselves but rather try to help them out and furnish them artificially with honest and colorable pretenses to excuse them and though he sees that their fault proceeded from a more shameful cause he should yet impute it to something less criminal thus hector deals with paris when he tells him this is not the time to manifest your anger against the trojans as if his retreat from the battle had not been absolutely a flight but merely the effect of resentment and indignation plut of knowing a flatterer from a friend juxta fin  xxxv verse     brother it is just etc paris readily lays hold of the pretext hector had furnished him with and confesses he has partly touched upon the true reason of his retreat but that it was also partly occasioned by the concern he felt at the victory of his rival next he professes his readiness for the fight but nothing can be a finer trait if we consider his character than what homer puts into his mouth just in this place that he is now exhorted to it by helen which shows that not the danger of his country and parents neither private shame nor public hatred could so much prevail upon him as the commands of his mistress to go and recover his honor  xxxvi verse     helen s speech the repentance of helena which we have before observed homer never loses an opportunity of manifesting is finely touched again here upon the whole we see the gods are always concerned in what befalls an unfortunate beauty her stars foredoomd all the mischief and heaven was to blame in suffering her to live then she fairly gets quit of the infamy of her lover and shows she has higher sentiments of honor than he how very natural is all this in the like characters to this day  xxxvii verse     the episode of hector and andromache homer undoubtedly shines most upon the great subjects in raising our admiration or terror pity and the softer passions are not so much of the nature of his poem which is formed upon anger and the violence of ambition but we have cause to think his genius was no less capable of touching the heart with tenderness than of firing it with glory from the few sketches he has left us of his excellency that way too in the present episode of the parting of hector and andromache he assembled all that love grief and compassion could inspire the greatest censurers of homer have acknowledged themselves charmed with this part even monsieur perault translated it into french verse as a kind of penitential sacrifice for the sacrileges he had committed against this author  this episode tends very much to raise the character of hector and endear him to every reader this hero though doubtful if he should ever see troy again yet goes not to his wife and child till after he has taken care for the sacrifice exhorted paris to the fight and discharged every duty to the gods and to his country his love of which as we formerly remarked makes his chief character what a beautiful contraste has homer made between the manners of paris and those of hector as he here shows them one after the other in this domestic light and in their regards to the fair sex what a difference between the characters and behavior of helen and of andromache and what an amiable picture of conjugal love opposed to that of unlawful passion  i must not forget that mr dryden has formerly translated this admirable episode and with so much success as to leave me at least no hopes of improving or equalling it the utmost i can pretend is to have avoided a few modern phrases and deviations from the original which have escaped that great man i am unwilling to remark upon an author to whom every english poet owes so much and shall therefore only take notice of a criticism of his which i must be obliged to answer in its place as it is an accusation of homer himself  xxxviii verse     pensive she stood on ilion s towry height it is a fine imagination to represent the tenderness of andromache for hector by her standing upon the tower of troy and watching all his motions in the field even the religious office of the procession to minervas temple could not draw her from this place at a time when she thought her husband in danger  xxxix verse     whose virtue charmed him etc homer in this verse particularizes the virtue of andromache in the epithet  blameless or without a fault i have used it literally in another part of this episode  xl verse     hector this heard returned hector does not stay to seek his wife on the tower of ilion but hastens where the business of the field calls him homer is never wanting in point of honor and decency and while he constantly obeys the strictest rules finds a way to make them contribute to the beauty of his poem here for instance he has managed it so that this observance of hectors is the cause of a very pleasing surprise to the reader for at first he is not a little disappointed to find that hector does not meet andromache and is no less pleased afterward to see them encounter by chance which gives him a satisfaction he thought he had lost dacier  xli verse  0  scamandrius from scamander s honored stream etc this manner of giving proper names to children derived from any place accident or quality belonging to them or their parents is very ancient and was customary among the hebrews the trojans called the son of hector astyanax because as it is said here and at the end of the twenty second book his father defended the city there are many instances of the same kind in the thirtieth chapter of genesis where the names given to jacobs children and the reasons of those names are enumerated  xlii verse     the fierce achilles etc mr dryden in the preface to the third volume of miscellany poems has past a judgment upon part of this speech which is altogether unworthy of him  andromache says he in the midst of her concernment and fright for hector runs off her biass to tell him a story of her pedigree and of the lamentable death of her father her mother and her seven brothers the devil was in hector if he knew not all this matter as well as she who told it him for she had been his bedfellow for many years together and if he knew it then it must be confessed that homer in this long digression has rather given us his own character than that of the fair lady whom he paints his dear friends the commentators who never fail him at a pinch will needs excuse him by making the present sorrow of andromache to occasion the remembrance of all the past but others think that she had enough to do with that grief which now oppressed her without running for assistance to her family but may not it be answered that nothing was more natural in andromache than to recollect her past calamities in order to represent her present distress to hector in a stronger light and show her utter desertion if he should perish what could more effectually work upon a generous and tender mind like that of hector what could therefore be more proper to each of their characters if hector be induced to refrain from the field it proceeds from compassion to andromache if andromache endeavor to persuade him it proceeds from her fear for the life of hector homer had yet a farther view in this recapitulation it tends to raise his chief hero achilles and acquaints us with those great achievements of his which preceded the opening of the poem since there was a necessity that this hero should be absent from the action during a great part of the iliad the poet has shown his art in nothing more than the methods he takes from time to time to keep up our great idea of him and to awaken our expectation of what he is to perform in the progress of the work his greatest enemies cannot upbraid or complain of him but at the same time they confess his glory and describe his victories when apollo encourages the trojans to fight it is by telling them achilles fights no more when juno animates the greeks it is by putting them in mind that they have to do with enemies who durst not appear out of their walls while achilles engaged when andromache trembles for hector it is with remembrance of the resistless force of achilles and when agamemnon would bribe him to a reconciliation it is partly with those very treasures and spoils which had been won by achilles himself  xliii verse     his arms preserved from hostile spoil this circumstance of aetions being burned with his arms will not appear trivial in this relation when we reflect with what eager passion these ancient heroes fought to spoil and carry off the armor of a vanquished enemy and therefore this action of achilles is mentioned as an instance of uncommon favor and generosity thus aeneas in virgil having slain lausus and being moved with compassion for this unhappy youth gives him a promise of the like favor arma quibus laetatus habe tua teque parentum manibus and cineri si qua est ea cura remitto   xliv verse     joves s sylvan daughters bade their elms bestow a barren shade etc it was the custom to plant about tombs only such trees as elms alders etc that bear no fruit as being most suitable to the dead this passage alludes to that piece of antiquity  xlv verse     a victim to diana s bow the greeks ascribed all sudden deaths of women to diana so ulysses in odyss    asks antyclia among the shades if she died by the darts of diana and in the present book laodame the daughter of bellerophon is said to have perished young by the arrows of this goddess or perhaps it may allude to some disease fatal to women such as macrobius speaks of sat      foeminas certis afflictas morbis  vocant  xlvi verse   0 that quarter most  where yon wild figtrees the artifice andromache here uses to detain hector in troy is very beautifully imagined she takes occasion from the three attacks that had been made by the enemy upon this place to give him an honorable pretense for staying at that rampart to defend it if we consider that those attempts must have been known to all in the city we shall not think she talks like a soldier but like a woman who naturally enough makes use of any incident that offers to persuade her lover to what she desires the ignorance too which she expresses of the reasons that moved the greeks to attack this particular place was what i doubt not homer intended to reconcile it the more to a female character  xlvii verse     hyperia s spring drawing water was the office of the meanest slaves this appears by the holy scripture where the gibeonites who had deceived josuah are made slaves and subjected to draw water josuah pronounces the curse against them in these words now therefore ye are cursed and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen and hewers of wood and drawers of water josh chapter   v    dacier  xlviii verse     stretched his fond arms there never was a finer piece of painting than this hector extends his arms to embrace his child the child affrighted at the glittering of his helmet and the shaking of the plume shrinks backward to the breast of his nurse hector unbraces his helmet lays it on the ground takes the infant in his arms lifts him toward heaven and offers a prayer for him to the gods then returns him to the mother andromache who receives him with a smile of pleasure but at the same instant the fears for her husband make her burst into tears all these are but small circumstances but so artfully chosen that every reader immediately feels the force of them and represents the whole in the utmost liveliness to his imagination this alone might be a confutation of that false criticism some have fallen into who affirm that a poet ought only to collect the great and noble particulars in his paintings but it is in the images of things as in the characters of persons where a small action or even a small circumstance of an action lets us more into the knowledge and comprehension of them than the material and principal parts themselves as we find this in a history so we do in a picture where sometimes a small motion or turning of a finger will express the character and action of the figure more than all the other parts of the design longinus indeed blames an authors insisting too much on trivial circumstances but in the same place extols homer as the poet who best knew how to make use of important and beautiful circumstances and to avoid the mean and superfluous ones there is a vast difference betwixt a small circumstance and a trivial one and the smallest become important if they are well chosen and not confused  xlix verse  0  hector s prayer for his son it may be asked how hectors prayer that his son might protect the trojans could be consistent with what he had said just before that he certainly knew troy and his parents would perish we ought to reflect that this is only a prayer hector in the excess of a tender emotion for his son entreats the gods to preserve troy and permit astyanax to rule there it is at all times allowable to beseech heaven to appease its anger and change its decrees and we are taught that prayers can alter destiny dacier besides it cannot be inferred from hence that hector had any divine foreknowledge of his own fate and the approaching ruin of his country since in many following passages we find him possessed with strong hopes and firm assurances to raise the siege by the flight or destruction of the greeks so that these forebodings of his fate were only the apprehensions and misgivings of a soul dejected with sorrow and compassion by considering the great dangers to which he saw all that was dear to him exposed  l verse     transcends his fathers fame the commendation hector here gives himself is not only agreeable to the openness of a brave man but very becoming on such a solemn occasion and a natural effect from the testimony of his own heart to his honor at this time especially when he knew not but he was speaking his last words virgil has not scrupled it in what he makes aeneas say to ascanius at his parting for the battle et pater aeneas and avunculus excitet hector disce puer virtutem ex me verumque laborem fortunam ex aliis  aen    i believe he had this of homer in his eye though the pathetical mention of fortune in the last line seems an imitation of that prayer of sophocles copied also from hence where ajax wishes his son may be like him in all things but in his misfortunes  li verse     his mothers conscious heart though the chief beauty of this prayer consists in the paternal piety shown by hector yet it wants not a fine stroke at the end to continue him in the character of a tender lover of his wife when he makes one of the motives of his wish to be the joy she shall receive on hearing her son applauded  lii verse     fixed is the term the reason which hector here urges to allay the affliction of his wife is grounded on a very ancient and common opinion that the fatal period of life is appointed to all men at the time of their birth which as no precaution can avoid so no danger can hasten this sentiment is as proper to give comfort to the distressed as to inspire courage to the desponding since nothing is so fit to quiet and strengthen our minds in times of difficulty as a firm assurance that our lives are exposed to no real hazards in the greatest appearances of danger  liii verse     forth issues paris paris stung by the reproaches of hector goes to the battle it is a just remark of eustathius that all the reproofs and remonstrances made in homer have constantly their effect the poet by this shows the great use of reprehensions when properly applied and finely intimates that every worthy mind will be the better for them  live verse     the wanton courser thus etc this beautiful comparison being translated by virgil in the eleventh aeneid i shall transcribe the originals that the reader may have the pleasure of comparing them       qualis ubi abruptis fugit praesepia vinclis tandem liber equus campoque potitus aperto aut ille in pastus armentaque tendit equarum aut assuetus aquae perfundi flumine noto emicat arrectisque fremit cervicibus alte luxurians luduntque jubae per colla per armos though nothing can be translated better than this is by virgil yet in homer the simile seems more perfect and the place more proper paris had been indulging his ease within the walls of his palace as the horse in his stable which was not the case of turnus the beauty and wantonness of the steed agrees more exactly with the character of paris than with the other and the insinuation of his love of the mares has yet a nearer resemblance the languishing flow of that verse  finely corresponds with the ease and luxuriancy of the pampered courser bathing in the flood a beauty which scaliger did not consider when he criticisd particularly upon that line tasso has also imitated this simile cant   come destrier che da la regie stalle ove a luso de larme si reserba fugge e libero alfin per largo call va tra glarmenti o al fiume usato o a lerba scherzau su l collo i crini e su le spalle si scote la cervice alta e superba suonano i pie nel corso e par chauvampi di sonori nitriti empiendo i campi   lv verse     paris excused his stay here in the original is a short speech of paris containing only these words brother i have detained you too long and should have come sooner as you desired me this and some few others of the same nature in the iliad the translator has ventured to omit expressing only the sense of them a living author whom future times will quote and therefore i shall not scruple to do it says that these short speeches though they may be natural in other languages cannot appear so well in ours which is much more stubborn and unpliant and therefore are but as so many rubs in the story that are still turning the narration out of its proper course  lvi verse     known is thy courage etc hector here confesses the natural valor of paris but observes it to be overcome by the indolence of his temper and the love of pleasure an ingenious french writer very well remarks that the true character of this hero has a great resemblance with that of marc anthony see the   th and    th notes on the third book  lvii verse     we crown the bowl to heaven and liberty the greek is  the free bowl in which they made libations to jupiter after the recovery of their liberty the expression is observed by m dacier to resemble those of the hebrews the cup of salvation the cup of sorrow the cup of benediction etc athenaeus mentions those cups which the greeks called  and were consecrated to the gods in memory of some success he gives us the inscription of one of this sort which was   the seventh book of the iliad the argument the single combat of hector and ajax the battle renewing with double ardour upon the return of hector minerva is under apprehensions for the greeks apollo seeing her descend from olympus joins her near the scaean gate they agree to put off the general engagement for that day and incite hector to challenge the greeks to a single combat nine of the princes accepting the challenge the lot is cast and falls upon ajax these heroes after several attacks are parted by the night the trojans calling a council antenor proposes the delivery of helen to the greeks to which paris will not consent but offers to restore them her riches priam sends a herald to make this offer and to demand a truce for burning the dead the last of which only is agreed to by agamemnon when the funerals are performed the greeks pursuant to the advice of nestor erect a fortification to protect their fleet and camp flanked with towers and defended by a ditch and palisades neptune testifies his jealousy at this work but is pacified by a promise from jupiter both armies pass the night in feasting but jupiter disheartens the trojans with thunder and other signs of his wrath  the three and twentieth day ends with the duel of hector and ajax the next day the truce is agreed another is taken up in the funeral rites of the slain and one more in building the fortification before the ships so that somewhat above three days is employed in this book the scene lies wholly in the field  the seventh book of the iliad so spoke the guardian of the trojan state then rushed impetuous through the scaean gate him paris followed to the dire alarms both breathing slaughter both resolved in arms as when to sailors laboring through the main that long had heaved the weary oar in vain jove bids at length the expected gales arise the gales blow grateful and the vessel flies so welcome these to troys desiring train the bands are cheered the war awakes again bold paris first the work of death begun on great menesthius areithous son sprung from the fair philomedas embrace the pleasing arne was his native place then sunk eioneus to the shades below beneath his steely casque he felt the blow full on his neck from hectors weighty hand and rolled with limbs relaxed along the land by glaucus spear the bold iphinous bleeds fixed in the shoulder as he mounts his steeds headlong he tumbles his slack nerves unbound drop the cold useless members on the ground when now minerva saw her argives slain from vast olympus to the gleaming plain fierce she descends apollo marked her flight nor shot less swift from ilions towry height radiant they met beneath the beechen shade when thus apollo to the blueeyd maid what cause o daughter of almighty jove thus wings thy progress from the realms above once more impetuous do thou bend thy way to give to greece the longdivided day too much has troy already felt thy hate now breathe thy rage and hush the stern debate this day the business of the field suspend war soon shall kindle and great ilion bend since vengeful goddesses confedrate join to raze her walls though built by hands divine to whom the progeny of jove replies i left for this the council of the skies but who shall bid conflicting hosts forbear what art shall calm the furious sons of war to her the god great hectors soul incite to dare the boldest greek to single fight till greece provoked from all her numbers show a warrior worthy to be hectors foe at this agreed the heavenly powers withdrew sage helenus their secret counsels knew hector inspired he sought to him addressed thus told the dictates of his sacred breast o son of priam let thy faithful ear receive my words thy friend and brother hear go forth persuasive and a while engage the warring nations to suspend their rage then dare the boldest of the hostile train to mortal combat on the listed plain for not this day shall end thy glorious date the gods have spoke it and their voice is fate he said the warrior heard the word with joy then with his spear restrained the youth of troy held by the midst athwart on either hand the squadrons part the expecting trojans stand great agamemnon bids the greeks forbear they breathe and hush the tumult of the war the athenian maid and glorious god of day with silent joy the settling hosts survey in form like vulturs on the beeches height they sit concealed and wait the future fight the thronging troops obscure the dusky fields horrid with bristling spears and gleaming shields as when a general darkness veils the main soft zephyr curling the wide watery plain the waves scarce heave the face of ocean sleeps and a still horror saddens all the deeps thus in thick orders settling wide around at length composed they sit and shade the ground great hector first amidst both armies broke the solemn silence and their powers bespoke hear all ye trojan all ye grecian bands what my soul prompts and what some god commands great jove averse our warfare to compose oerwhelms the nations with new toils and woes war with a fiercer tide once more returns till ilion falls or till yon navy burns you then o princes of the greeks appear it is hector speaks and calls the gods to hear from all your troops select the boldest knight and him the boldest hector dares to fight here if i fall by chance of battle slain be his my spoil and his these arms remain but let my body to my friends returned by trojan hands and trojan flames be burned and if apollo in whose aid i trust shall stretch your daring champion in the dust if mine the glory to despoil the foe on phoebus temple i will his arms bestow the breathless carcass to your navy sent greece on the shore shall raise a monument which when some future mariner surveys washed by broad hellesponts resounding seas thus shall he say a valiant greek lies there by hector slain the mighty man of war the stone shall tell your vanquished heros name and distant ages learn the victors fame this fierce defiance greece astonished heard blushed to refuse and to accept it feared stern menelaus first the silence broke and inly groaning thus opprobrious spoke women of greece oh scandal of your race whose coward souls your manly form disgrace how great the shame when every age shall know that not a grecian met this noble foe go then resolve to earth from whence ye grew a heartless spiritless inglorious crew be what ye seem unanimated clay my self will dare the danger of the day it is mans bold task the generous strife to try but in the hands of god is victory these words scarce spoke with generous ardour pressed his manly limbs in azure arms he dressed that day atrides a superior hand had stretched thee breathless on the hostile strand but all at once thy fury to compose the kings of greece an awful band arose even he their chief great agamemnon pressed thy daring hand and this advice addressed whither o menelaus would thou run and tempt a fate which prudence bids thee shun grieved though thou art forbear the rash design great hectors arm is mightier far than thine even fierce achilles learned its force to fear and trembling met this dreadful son of war sit thou secure amidst thy social band greece in our cause shall arm some powerful hand the mightiest warrior of the achaian name though bold and burning with desire of fame content the doubtful honor might foregoe so great the danger and so brave the foe he said and turned his brothers vengeful mind he stooped to reason and his rage resigned no longer bent to rush on certain harms his joyful friends unbrace his azure arms he from whose lips divine persuasion flows grave nestor then in graceful act arose thus to the kings he spoke what grief what shame attend on greece and all the grecian name how shall alas her hoary heroes mourn their sons degenerate and their race a scorn what tears shall down thy silver beard be rolled oh peleus old in arms in wisdom old once with what joy the generous prince would hear of every chief who sought this glorious war participate their fame and pleased enquire each name each action and each heros sire gods should he see our warriors trembling stand and trembling all before one hostile hand how would he lift his aged arms on high lament inglorious greece and beg to die oh would to all the immortal powers above minerva phoebus and almighty jove years might again roll back my youth renew and give this arm the spring which once it knew when fierce in war where jardans waters fall i led my troops to pheas trembling wall and with the arcadian spears my prowess tried where celadon rolls down his rapid tide there ereuthalion braved us in the field proud areithous dreadful arms to wield great areithous known from shore to shore by the huge knotted ironmace he bore no lance he shook nor bent the twanging bow but broke with this the battle of the foe him not by manly force lycurgus slew whose guileful javelin from the thicket flew deep in a winding way his breast assailed nor ought the warriors thundering mace availed supine he fell those arms which mars before had given the vanquished now the victor bore but when old age had dimmed lycurgus eyes to ereuthalion he consigned the prize furious with this he crushed our levelled bands and dared the trial of the strongest hands nor could the strongest hands his fury stay all saw and feared his huge tempestuous sway till i the youngest of the host appeared and youngest met whom all our army feared i fought the chief my arms minerva crowned prone fell the giant over a length of ground what then i was oh were your nestor now not hectors self should want an equal foe but warriors you that youthful vigor boast the flower of greece the examples of our host sprung from such fathers who such numbers sway can you stand trembling and desert the day his warm reproofs the listening kings inflame and nine the noblest of the grecian name upstarted fierce but far before the rest the king of men advanced his dauntless breast then bold tydides great in arms appeared and next his bulk gigantic ajax reared oileus followed idomen was there and merion dreadful as the god of war with these eurypylus and thoas stand and wise ulysses closed the daring band all these alike inspired with noble rage demand the fight to whom the pylian sage lest thirst of glory your brave souls divide what chief shall combat let the lots decide whom heaven shall choose be his the chance to raise his countrys fame his own immortal praise the lots produced each hero signs his own then in the generals helm the fates are thrown the people pray with lifted eyes and hands and vows like these ascend from all the bands grant thou almighty in whose hand is fate a worthy champion for the grecian state this task let ajax or tydides prove or he the king of kings beloved by jove old nestor shook the casque by heaven inspired leaped forth the lot of every greek desired this from the right to left the herald bears held out in order to the grecian peers each to his rival yields the mark unknown till godlike ajax finds the lot his own surveys the inscription with rejoicing eyes then casts before him and with transport cries warriors i claim the lot and arm with joy be mine the conquest of this chief of troy now while my brightest arms my limbs invest to saturns son be all your vows addressed but pray in secret lest the foes should hear and deem your prayers the mean effect of fear said i in secret no your vows declare in such a voice as fills the earth and air lives there a chief whom ajax ought to dread ajax in all the toils of battle bred from warlike salamis i drew my birth and born to combats fear no force of earth he said the troops with elevated eyes implore the god whose thunder rends the skies o father of mankind superior lord on lofty idas holy hill adored who in the highest heaven have fixed thy throne supreme of gods unbounded and alone grant thou that telamon may bear away the praise and conquest of this doubtful day or if illustrious hector be thy care that both may claim em and that both may share now ajax braced his dazzling armor on sheathed in bright steel the giantwarrior shone he moves to combat with majestic pace so stalks in arms the grizly god of thrace when jove to punish faithless men prepares and gives whole nations to the waste of wars thus marched the chief tremendous as a god grimly he smiled earth trembled as he strode his massy javelin quivering in his hand he stood the bulwark of the grecian band through every argive heart new transport ran all troy stood trembling at the mighty man even hector paused and with new doubt oppressed felt his great heart suspended in his breast twas vain to seek retreat and vain to fear himself had challenged and the foe drew near stern telamon behind his ample shield as from a brazen tower oerlookd the field huge was its orb with sevn thick folds overcast of tough bullhides of solid brass the last the work of tychius who in hyle dwelld and all in arts of armoury excelled this ajax bore before his manly breast and threatening thus his adverse chief addressed hector approach my arm and singly know what strength thou have and what the grecian foe achilles shuns the fight yet some there are not void of soul and not unskilled in war let him unactive on the seabeat shore indulge his wrath and aid our arms no more whole troops of heroes greece has yet to boast and sends thee one a sample of her host such as i am i come to prove thy might no more  be sudden and begin the fight o son of telamon thy countrys pride to ajax thus the trojan prince replied me as a boy or woman would thou fright new to the field and trembling at the fight thou meetst a chief deserving of thy arms to combat born and bred amidst alarms i know to shift my ground remount the car turn charge and answer every call of war to right to left the dextrous lance i wield and bear thick battle on my sounding shield but open be our fight and bold each blow i steal no conquest from a noble foe he said and rising high above the field whirled the long lance against the sevnfold shield full on the brass descending from above through six bullhides the furious weapon drove till in the sevnth it fixed then ajax threw through hectors shield the forceful javelin flew his corslet enters and his garment rends and glancing downwards near his flank descends the wary trojan shrinks and bending low beneath his buckler disappoints the blow from their bored shields the chiefs the javelins drew then close impetuous and the charge renew fierce as the mountainlions bathed in blood or foaming boars the terror of the wood at ajax hector his long lance extends the blunted point against the buckler bends but ajax watchful as his foe drew near drove through the trojan targe the knotty spear it reached his neck with matchless strength impelled spouts the black gore and dimms his shining shield yet ceased not hector thus but stooping down in his strong hand upheavd a flinty stone black craggy vast to this his force he bends full on the brazen boss the stone descends the hollow brass resounded with the shock then ajax seized the fragment of a rock applied each nerve and swinging round on high with force tempestuous let the ruin fly the huge stone thundering through his buckler broke his slackened knees received the numbing stroke great hector falls extended on the field his bulk supporting on the shattered shield nor wanted heavenly aid apollos might confirmed his sinews and restored to fight and now both heroes their broad faulchions drew in flaming circles round their heads they flew but then by heralds voice the word was given the sacred ministers of earth and heaven divine talthybius whom the greeks employ and sage idaeus on the part of troy between the swords their peaceful sceptres reared when thus idaeus awful voice was heard forbear my sons your farther force to prove both dear to men and both beloved of jove to either host your matchless worth is known each sounds your praise and war is all your own but now the night extends her awful shade the goddess parts you be the night obeyed to whom great ajax his high soul expressed o sage to hector be these words addressed let him who first provoked our chiefs to fight let him demand the sanction of the night if first he ask it i content obey and cease the strife when hector shows the way oh first of greeks his noble foe rejoined whom heaven adorns superior to thy kind with strength of body and with worth of mind now martial law commands us to forbear hereafter we shall meet in glorious war some future day shall lengthen out the strife and let the gods decide of death or life since then the night extends her gloomy shade and heaven enjoins it be the night obeyed return brave ajax to thy grecian friends and joy the nations whom thy arm defends as i shall glad each chief and trojan wife who wearies heaven with vows for hectors life but let us on this memorable day exchange some gift that greece and troy may say not hate but glory made these chiefs contend and each brave foe was in his soul a friend with that a sword with stars of silver graced the baldric studded and the sheath enchasd he gave the greek the generous greek bestowed a radiant belt that rich with purple glowed then with majestic grace they quit the plain this seeks the grecian that the phrygian train the trojan bands returning hector wait and hail with joy the champion of their state escaped great ajax they surveyed him round alive unharmd and vigorous from his wound to troys high gates the godlike chief they bear their present triumph as their late despair but ajax glorying in his hardy deed the wellarmd greeks to agamemnon lead a steer for sacrifice the king designed of full five years and of the nobler kind the victim falls they strip the smoking hide the beast they quarter and the joints divide then spread the tables the repast prepare each takes his seat and each receives his share the king himself an honorary sign before great ajax placed the mighty chine when now the rage of hunger was removed nestor in each persuasive art approved the sage whose counsels long had swayed the rest in words like these his prudent thought expressed how dear o kings this fatal day has cost what greeks are perished what a people lost what tides of blood have drenched scamanders shore what crowds of heroes sunk to rise no more then hear me chief nor let the morrows light awake thy squadrons to new toils of fight some space at least permit the war to breathe while we to flames our slaughtered friends bequeathe from the red field their scattered bodies bear and nigh the fleet a funeral structure rear so decent urns their snowy bones may keep and pious children over their ashes weep here where on one promiscuous pile they blazed high over them all a general tomb be raised next to secure our camp and naval powers raise an embatteld wall with lofty towers from space to space be ample gates around for passing chariots and a trench profound so greece to combat shall in safety go nor fear the fierce incursions of the foe twas thus the sage his wholesome counsel moved the sceptred kings of greece his words approved meanwhile convened at priams palace gate the trojan peers in nightly council sat a senate void of union as of choice their hearts were fearful and confused their voice antenor rising thus demands their ear ye trojans dardans and auxiliars hear it is heaven the counsel of my breast inspires and i but move what every god requires let spartas treasures be this hour restored and argive helen own her ancient lord the ties of faith the sworn alliance broke our impious battles the just gods provoke as this advice ye practice or reject so hope success or dread the dire effect the senior spoke and sat to whom replied the graceful husband of the spartan bride cold counsels trojan may become thy years but sound ungrateful in a warriors ears old man if void of fallacy or art thy words express the purpose of thy heart thou in thy time more sound advice have given but wisdom has its date assigned by heaven then hear me princes of the trojan name their treasures i will restore but not the dame my treasures too for peace i will resign but be this bright possession ever mine twas then the growing discord to compose slow from his seat the reverend priam rose his godlike aspect deep attention drew he paused and these pacific words ensue ye trojans dardans and auxiliar bands now take refreshment as the hour demands guard well the walls relieve the watch of night till the new sun restores the cheerful light then shall our herald to the atrides sent before their ships proclaim my sons intent next let a truce be asked that troy may burn her slaughtered heroes and their bones inurn that done once more the fate of war be tried and whose the conquest mighty jove decide the monarch spoke the warriors snatched with haste each at his post in arms a short repaste soon as the rosy morn had waked the day to the black ships idaeus bent his way there to the sons of mars in council found he raised his voice the hosts stood listening round ye sons of atreus and ye greeks give ear the words of troy and troys great monarch hear pleased may ye hear so heaven succeed my prayers what paris author of the war declares the spoils and treasures he to ilion bore oh had he perished ever they touched our shore he proffers injured greece with large increase of added trojan wealth to buy the peace but to restore the beauteous bride again this greece demands and troy requests in vain next o ye chiefs we ask a truce to burn our slaughtered heroes and their bones inurn that done once more the fate of war be tried and whose the conquest mighty jove decide the greeks gave ear but none the silence broke at length tydides rose and rising spoke oh take not friends defrauded of your fame their proffered wealth nor even the spartan dame let conquest make them ours fate shakes their wall and troy already totters to her fall the admiring chiefs and all the grecian name with general shouts returned him loud acclaim then thus the king of kings rejects the peace herald in him thou hearst the voice of greece for what remains let funeral flames be fed with heroes corpse i war not with the dead go search your slaughtered chiefs on yonder plain and gratify the manes of the slain be witness jove whose thunder rolls on high he said and reared his scepter to the sky to sacred troy where all her princes lay to wait the event the herald bent his way he came and standing in the midst explained the peace rejected but the truce obtained strait to their several cares the trojans move some search the plain some fell the sounding grove nor less the greeks descending on the shore hewed the green forests and the bodies bore and now from forth the chambers of the main to shed his sacred light on earth again arose the golden chariot of the day and tipped the mountains with a purple ray in mingled throngs the greek and trojan train through heaps of carnage searched the mournful plain scarce could the friend his slaughtered friend explore with dust dishonored and deformed with gore the wounds they washed their pious tears they shed and laid along their cars deplored the dead sage priam checked their grief with silent haste the bodies decent on the piles were placed with melting hearts the cold remains they burned and sadly slow to sacred troy returned nor less the greeks their pious sorrows shed and decent on the pile dispose the dead the cold remains consume with equal care and slowly sadly to their fleet repair now ere the morn had streaked with redning light the doubtful confines of the day and night about the dying flames the greeks appeared and round the pile a general tomb they reared then to secure the camp and naval powers they raised embatteld walls with lofty towers from space to space were ample gates around for passing chariots and a trench profound of large extent and deep in earth below strong piles infixd stood adverse to the foe so toiled the greeks meanwhile the gods above in shining circle round their father jove amazed beheld the wondrous works of man then  he whose trident shakes the earth began what mortals henceforth shall our power adore our fanes frequent our oracles implore if the proud grecians thus successful boast their rising bulwarks on the seabeat coast see the long walls extending to the main no god consulted and no victim slain their fame shall fill the worlds remotest ends wide as the morn her golden beam extends while old laomedons divine abodes those radiant structures raised by laboring gods shall razed and lost in long oblivion sleep thus spoke the hoary monarch of the deep the almighty thundrer with a frown replies that clouds the world and blackens half the skies strong god of ocean thou whose rage can make the solid earths eternal basis shake what cause of fear from mortal works could move the meanest subject of our realms above wherever the suns refulgent rays are cast thy power is honored and thy fame shall last but yon proud work no future age shall view no trace remain where once the glory grew the sappd foundations by thy force shall fall and whelmed beneath thy waves drop the huge wall vast drifts of sand shall change the former shore the ruin vanished and the name no more thus they in heaven while over the grecian train the rolling sun descending to the main beheld the finished work their bulls they slew black from the tents the savry vapors flew and now the fleet arrived from lemnos strands with bacchus blessings cheered the generous bands of fragrant wines the rich eunaeus sent a thousand measures to the royal tent  eunaeus whom hypsipyle of yore to jason shepherd of his people bore the rest they purchased at their proper cost and well the plenteous freight supplied the host each in exchange proportioned treasures gave some brass or iron some an ox or slave all night they feast the greek and trojan powers those on the fields and these within their towers but jove averse the signs of wrath displayed and shot red lightenings through the gloomy shade humbled they stood pale horror seized on all while the deep thunder shook the aerial hall each poured to jove before the bowl was crowned and large libations drenched the thirsty ground then late refreshed with sleep from toils of fight enjoyed the balmy blessings of the night observations on the seventh book observations on the seventh book i verse   through the scaean gate this gate is not here particularized by homer but it appears by the    d verse of the sixth book that it could be no other eustathius takes notice of the difference of the words  and  the one applied to hector the other to paris by which the motion of the former is described as an impetuous sallying forth agreeable to the violence of a warrior and that of the latter as a calmer movement correspondent to the gentler character of a lover but perhaps this remark is too refined since homer plainly gives paris a character of bravery in what immediately precedes and follows this verse  ii verse   as when to sailors etc this simile makes it plain that the battle had relaxed during the absence of hector in troy and consequently that the conversation of diomed and glaucus in the former book was not as homers censurers would have it in the heat of the engagement  iii verse    when now minerva etc this machine of the two deities meeting to part the armies is very noble eustathius tells us it is an allegorical minerva and apollo minerva represents the prudent valor of the greeks and apollo who stood for the trojans the power of destiny so that the meaning of the allegory may be that the valor and wisdom of the greeks had now conquered troy had not destiny withstood minerva therefore complies with apollo an intimation that wisdom can never oppose fate but if you take them in the literal sense as a real god and goddess it may be asked what necessity there was for the introduction of two such deities to this eustathius answers that the last book was the only one in which both armies were destitute of the aid of the gods in consequence of which there is no gallant action achieved nothing extraordinary done especially after the retreat of hector but here the gods are again introduced to usher in a new scene of great actions the same author offers this other solution hector finding the trojan army overpowered considers how to stop the fury of the present battle this he thinks may best be done by the proposal of a single combat thus minerva by a very easy and natural fiction may signify that wisdom or courage she being the goddess of both which suggests the necessity of diverting the war and apollo that seasonable stratagem by which he effected it  iv verse    vengesul goddesses  in this place must signify minerva and juno the word being of the feminine gender eustathius  v verse    sage helenus their sacred counsels knew helenus was the priest of apollo and might therefore be supposed to be informed of this by his god or taught by an oracle that such was his will or else being an augur he might learn it from the flight of those birds into which the deities are here feigned to transform themselves perhaps for that reason as it would be a very poetical manner of expressing it the fiction of these divinities sitting on the beechtree in the shape of vulturs is imitated by milton in the fourth book of paradise lost where satan leaping over the boundaries of eden sits in the form of a cormorant upon the tree of life  vi verse    for not this day shall end thy glorious date eustathius justly observes that homer here takes from the greatness of hectors intrepidity by making him foreknow that he should not fall in this combat whereas ajax encounters him without any such encouragement it may perhaps be difficult to give a reason for this management of the poet unless we ascribe it to that commendable prejudice and honorable partiality he bears his countrymen which makes him give a superiority of courage to the heroes of his own nation  vii verse  0 then with his spear restrained the youth of troy held by the midst athwart   the remark of eustathius here is observable he tells us that the warriors of those times having no trumpets and because the voice of the loudest herald would be drowned in the noise of a battle addressed themselves to the eyes and that grasping the middle of the spear denoted a request that the fight might a while be suspended the holding the spear in that position not being the posture of a warrior and thus agamemnon understands it without any farther explication but however it be we have a lively picture of a general who stretches his spear across and presses back the most advanced soldiers of his army  viii verse    as when a general darkness etc the thick ranks of the troops composing themselves in order to sit and hear what hector was about to propose are compared to the waves of the sea that are just stirred by the west wind the simile partly consisting in the darkness and stillness this is plainly different from those images of the sea given us on other occasions where the armies in their engagement and confusion are compared to the waves in their agitation and tumult and that the contrary is the drift of this simile appears particularly from homers using the word  sedebant twice in the application of it all the other versions seem to be mistaken here what caused the difficulty was the expression  which may signify the west wind blowing on a sudden as well as first rising but the design of homer was to convey an image both of the gentle motion that arose over the field from the helmets and spears before their armies were quite settled and of the repose and awe which ensued when hector began to speak  ix verse    hear all ye trojan all ye grecian bands the appearance of hector his formal challenge and the affright of the greeks upon it have a near resemblance to the description of the challenge of goliath in the first book of samuel chapter    and he stood and cried to the armies of israel  choose you a man for you and let him come down to me if he be able to fight with me and to kill me then will we be your servants but if i prevail against him and kill him then shall ye be our servants  when saul and all israel heard the words of the philistinc they were dismayed and greatly afraid etc  there is a fine air of gallantry and bravery in this challenge of hector if he seems to speak too vainly we should consider him under the character of a challenger whose business it is to defy the enemy yet at the same time we find a decent modesty in his manner of expressing the conditions of the combat he says simply if my enemy kills me but of himself if apollo grant me victory it was an imagination equally agreeable to a man of generosity and a lover of glory to mention the monument to be erected over his vanquished enemy though we see he considers it not so much an honor paid to the conquered as a trophie to the conqueror it was natural too to dwell most upon the thought that pleased him best for he takes no notice of any monument that should be raised over himself if he should fall unfortunately he no sooner allows himself to expatiate but the prospect of glory carries him away thus far beyond his first intention which was only to allow the enemy liberty to inter their champion with decency  x verse    on phoebus temple i will his arms bestow it was the manner of the ancients to dedicate trophies of this kind to the temples of the gods the particular reason for consecrating the arms in this place to apollo is not only as he was the constant protector of troy but as this thought of the challenge was inspired by him  xi verse    greece on the shore shall raise a monument homer took the hint of this from several tombs of the ancient heroes who had fought at troy remaining in his time upon the shore of the hellespont he gives that sea the epithet broad to distinguish the particular place of those tombs which was on the rhoetean or sigaean coast where the hellespont which in other parts is narrow opens itself to the aegean sea strabo gives an account of the monument of ajax near rhoeteum and of achilles at the promontory of sigaeum this is one among a thousand proofs of our authors exact knowledge in geography and antiquities time says eustathius has destroyed those tombs which were to have preserved hectors glory but homers poetry more lasting than monuments and proof against ages will for ever support and convey it to the latest posterity  xii verse  0  all greece astonished heard it seems natural to enquire why the greeks before they accepted hectors challenge did not demand reparation for the former treachery of pandarus and insist upon delivering up the author of it which had been the shortest way for the trojans to have wiped off that stain it was very reasonable for the greeks to reply to this challenge that they could not venture a second single combat for fear of such another insidious attempt upon their champion and indeed i wonder that nestor did not think of this excuse for his countrymen when they were so backward to engage one may make some sort of answer to this if we consider the clearness of hectors character and his words at the beginning of the foregoing speech where he first complains of the revival of the war as a misfortune common to them both which is at once very artful and decent and lays the blame of it upon jupiter though by the way his charging the trojans breach of faith upon the deity looks a little like the reasoning of some modern saints in the doctrine of absolute reprobation making god the author of sin and may serve for some instance of the antiquity of that false tenet  xiii verse  0  women of greece etc there is a great deal of fire in this speech of menelaus which very well agrees with his character and circumstances methinks while he speaks one sees him in a posture of emotion pointing with contempt at the commanders about him he upbraids their cowardice and wishes they may become according to the literal words earth and water that is be resolved into those principles they sprung from or die thus eustathius explains it very exactly from a verse he cites of zenophanes    xiv verse     even fierce achilles learned his force to fear the poet every where takes occasion to set the brotherly love of agamemnon toward menelaus in the most agreeable light when menelaus is wounded agamemnon is more concerned than he and here dissuades him from a danger which he offers immediately after to undertake himself he makes use of hectors superior courage to bring him to a compliance and tells him that even achilles dares not engage with hector this says eustathius is not true but only the affection for his brother thus breaks out into a kind extravagance agamemnon likewise consults the honor of menelaus for it will be no disgrace to him to decline encountering a man whom achilles himself is afraid of thus he artfully provides for his safety and honor at the same time  xv verse     the mightiest warrior etc it cannot with certainty be concluded from the words of homer who is the person to whom agamemnon applies the last lines of this speech the interpreters leave it as undetermined in their translations as it is in the original some would have it understood of hector that the greeks would send such an antagonist against him from whose hands hector might be glad to escape but this interpretation seems contrary to the plain design of agamemnons discourse which only aims to deter his brother from so rash an undertaking as engaging with hector so that instead of dropping any expression which might depreciate the power or courage of this hero he endeavors rather to represent him as the most formidable of men and dreadful even to achilles this passage therefore will be most consistent with agamemnons design if it be considered as an argument offered to menelaus at once to dissuade him from the engagement and to comfort him under the appearance of so great a disgrace as refusing the challenge by telling him that any warrior how bold and intrepid soever might be content to sit still and rejoice that he is not exposed to so hazardous an engagement the words  signify not to escape out of the combat as the translators take it but to avoid entering into it  the phrase of  which is literally to bend the knee means according to eustathius to rest to sit down  and is used so by aeschylus in prometheo those interpreters were greatly mistaken who imagined it signified to kneel down to thank the gods for escaping from such a combat whereas the custom of kneeling in prayer as we before observed was not in use among these nations  xvi verse     the speech of nestor this speech if we consider the occasion of it could be made by no person but nestor no young warrior could with decency exhort others to undertake a combat which himself declined nothing could be more in his character than to represent to the greeks how much they would suffer in the opinion of another old man like himself in naming peleus he sets before their eyes the expectations of all their fathers and the shame that must afflict them in their old age if their sons behaved themselves unworthily the account he gives of the conversations he had formerly held with that king and his jealousy for the glory of greece is a very natural picture of the warm dialogues of two old warriors upon the commencement of a new war upon the whole nestor never more displays his oratory than in this place you see him rising with a sigh expressing a pathetick sorrow and wishing again for his youth that he might wipe away this disgrace from his country the humor of storytelling so natural to old men is almost always marked by homer in the speeches of nestor the apprehension that their age makes them contemptible puts them upon repeating the brave deeds of their youth plutarch justifies the praises nestor here gives himself and the vaunts of his valor which on this occasion were only exhortations to those he addressed them to by these he restores courage to the greeks who were astonished at the bold challenge of hector and causes nine of the princes to rise and accept it if any man had a right to commend himself it was this venerable prince who in relating his own actions did no more than propose examples of virtue to the young virgil without any such softening qualification makes his hero say of himself sum pius aeneas fama super aethera notus and comfort a dying warrior with these words aeneae magni dextra cadis  the same author also imitates the wish of nestor for a return of his youth where evander cries out o mihi praeteritos referat si jupiter annos qualis eram cum primam aciem praeneste sub ipsa stravi scutorumque incendi victor acervos et regem hac herilum dextra sub tartara misi as for the narration of the arcadian war introduced here it is a part of the true history of those times as we are informed by pausanias  xvii verse     those arms which mars before had given homer has the peculiar happiness of being able to raise the obscurest circumstance into the strongest point of light areithous had taken these arms in battle and this gives occasion to our author to say they were the present of mars eustathius  xviii verse     prone fell the giant over a length of ground nestors insisting upon this circumstance of the fall of ereuthalion which paints his vast body lying extended on the earth has a particular beauty in it and recalls into the old mans mind the joy he felt on the sight of his enemy after he was slain these are the fine and natural strokes that give life to the descriptions of poetry  xix verse     and nine the noblest etc in this catalogue of the nine warriors who offer themselves as champions for greece one may take notice of the first and the last who rises up agamemnon advanced foremost as it best became the general and ulysses with his usual caution took time to deliberate till seven more had offered themselves homer gives a great encomium of the eloquence of nestor in making it produce so sudden an effect especially when agamemnon who did not proffer himself before even to save his brother is now the first that steps forth one would fancy this particular circumstance was contrived to show that eloquence has a greater power than even nature itself  xx verse  0  let the lots decide this was a very prudent piece of conduct in nestor he does not choose any of these nine himself but leaves the determination entirely to chance had he named the hero the rest might have been grieved to have seen another preferred before them and he well knew that the lot could not fall upon a wrong person where all were valiant eustathius  xxi verse  0  whom heaven shall choose be his the chance to raise his countrys fame his own immortal praise the original of this passage is somewhat confused the interpreters render it thus cast the lots and he who shall be chosen if he escapes from this dangerous combat will do an eminent service to the greeks and also have cause to be greatly satisfied himself but the sense will appear more distinct and rational if the words  and  be not understood of the same person and the meaning of nestor will then be he who is chosen for the engagement by the lot will do his country great service and he likewise who is not will have reason to rejoice for escaping so dangerous a combat the expression  is the same homer uses in         of this book which we explained in the same sense in note     xxii verse     the people pray homer who supposes every thing on earth to proceed from the immediate disposition of heaven allows not even the lots to come up by chance but places them in the hands of god the people pray to him for the disposal of them and beg that ajax diomed or agamemnon may be the person in which the poet seems to make the army give his own sentiments concerning the preference of valor in his heroes to avoid an odious comparison in downright terms which might have been inconsistent with his design of complementing the grecian families they afterward offer up their prayers again just as the combat is beginning that if ajax does not conquer at least he may divide the glory with hector in which the commentators observe homer prepares the readers for what is to happen in the sequel  xxiii verse     surveys the inscription there is no necessity to suppose that they put any letters upon these lots at least not their names because the herald could not tell to whom the lot of ajax belonged till he claimed it himself it is more probable that they made some private mark or signet each upon his own lot the lot was only a piece of wood a shell or any thing that lay at hand eustathius  xxiv verse     warriors i claim the lot this is the first speech of ajax in the iliad he is no orator but always expresses himself in short generally bragging or threatening and very positive the appellation of  the bulwark of the greeks which homer almost constantly gives him is extremely proper to the bulk strength and immobility of this heavy hero who on all occasions is made to stand to the business and support the brunt these qualifications are given him that he may last out when the rest of the chief heroes are wounded this makes him of excellent use in iliad    etc he there puts a stop to the whole force of the enemy and a long time prevents the firing of the ships it is particularly observable that he is never assisted by any deity as the others are yet one would think mars had been no improper patron for him there being some resemblance in the boisterous character of that god and this hero however it be this consideration may partly account for a particular which else might very well raise a question why ajax who is in this book superior in strength to hector should afterward in the iliad shun to meet him and appear his inferior we see the gods make this difference hector is not only assisted by them in his own person but his men second him whereas those of ajax are dispirited by heaven to which one may add another which is a natural reason hector in this book expressly tells ajax he will now make use of no skill or art in fighting with him the greek in bare brutal strength proved too hard for hector and therefore he might be supposed afterward to have exerted his dexterity against him  xxv verse   0 he moves to combat etc this description is full of the sublime imagery so peculiar to our author the grecian champion is drawn in all that terrible glory with which he equals his heroes to the gods he is no less dreadful than mars moving to battle to execute the decrees of jove upon mankind and determine the fate of nations his march his posture his countenance his bulk his towrlike shield in a word his whole figure strikes our eyes in all the strongest colors of poetry we look upon him as a deity and are not astonished at those emotions which hector feels at the sight of him  xxvi verse     the work of tychius i shall ask leave to transcribe here the story of this tychius as we have it in the ancient life of homer attributed to herodotus  homer falling into poverty determined to go to cuma and as he past through the plain of hermus came to a place called the new wall which was a colony of the cumaeans here  after he had recited five verses in celebration of cuma he was received by a leatherdresser whose name was tychius into his house where he showed to his host and his company a poem on the expedition of amphiaraus and his hymns the admiration he there obtained procured him a present subsistence they show to this day with great veneration the place where he sat when he recited his verses and a poplar which they affirm to have grown there in his time if there be any thing in this story we have reason to be pleased with the grateful temper of our poet who took this occasion of immortalizing the name of an ordinary tradesman who had obliged him the same account of his life takes notice of several other instances of his gratitude in the same kind  xxvii verse   0 in arts of armoury i have called tychius an armourer rather than a leatherdresser or currier his making the shield of ajax authorizes one expression as well as the other and though that which homer uses had no lowness or vulgarity in the greek it was not to be admitted into english heroic verse  xxviii verse     hector approach my arm etc i think it needless to observe how exactly this speech of ajax corresponds with his blunt and soldierlike character the same propriety in regard to this hero is maintained throughout the iliad the business he is about is all that employs his head and he speaks of nothing but fighting the last line is an image of his mind at all times no more  be sudden and begin the fight   xxix verse     me as a boy or woman would thou fright this reply of hector seems rather to allude to some action ajax had used in his approach to him as shaking his spear or the like than to any thing he had said in his speech for what he had told him amounts to no more than that there were several in the grecian army who had courted the honor of this combat as well as himself i think one must observe many things of this kind in homer that allude to the particular attitude or action in which the author supposes the person to be in at that time  xxx verse   0 turn charge and answer every call of war the greek is to move my feet to the sound of mars which seems to show that those military dances were in use even in homers time which were afterward practiced in greece  xxxi verse  0  from their bored shields the chiefs their javelins drew homer in this combat makes his heroes perform all their exercises with all sorts of weapons first darting lances at distance then advancing closer and pushing with spears then casting stones and lastly attacking with swords in every one of which the poet gives the superiority to his countryman it is farther observable as eustathius remarks that ajax allows hector an advantage in throwing the first spear  xxxii verse     apollo s might in the beginning of this book we left apollo perched upon a tree in the shape of a vultur to behold the combat he comes now very opportunely to save his favorite hector eustathius says that apollo is the same with destiny so that when homer says apollo saved him he means no more than that it was not his fate yet to die as helenus had foretold him  xxxiii verse     heralds the sacred ministers etc the heralds of old were sacred persons accounted the delegates of mercury and inviolable by the law of nations the ancient histories have many examples of the severity exercised against those who committed any outrage upon them their office was to assist in the sacrifices and councils to proclaim war or peace to command silence at ceremonies or single combats to part the combatants and to declare the conqueror etc  xxxiv verse     divine talthybius etc this interposition of the two heralds to part the combatants on the approach of the night is applied by tasso to the single combat of tancred and argantes in the sixth book of his jerusalem the heralds speech and particularly that remarkable injunction to obey the night are translated literally by that author the combatants there also part not without a promise of meeting again in battle on some more favorable opportunity  xxxv verse     and first idaeus homer observes a just decorum in making idaeus the trojan herald speak first to end the combat wherein hector had the disadvantage ajax is very sensible of this difference when in his reply he requires that hector should first ask for a cessation as he was the challenger eustathius  xxxvi verse   0 o first of greeks etc hector how hardly soever he is pressed by his present circumstance says nothing to obtain a truce that is not strictly consistent with his honor when he praises ajax it lessens his own disadvantage and he is careful to extol him only above the greeks without acknowledging him more valiant than himself or the trojans hector is always jealous of the honor of his country in what follows we see he keeps himself on a level with his adversary hereafter we shall meet  go thou and give the same joy to thy grecians for thy escape as i shall to my trojans the point of honor in all this is very nicely preserved  xxxvii verse     who wearies heaven with vows for hector s life eustathius gives many solutions of the difficulty in these words  they mean either that the trojan ladies will pray to the gods for him  or certatim with the utmost zeal and transport or that they will go in procession to the temples for him  coetum deorum or that they will pray to him as to a god   xxxviii verse     exchange some gift there is nothing that gives us a greater pleasure in reading an heroic poem than the generosity which one brave enemy shows to another the proposal made here by hector and so readily embraced by ajax makes the parting of these two heroes more glorious to them than the continuance of the combat had been a french critic is shocked at hectors making proposals to ajax with an air of equality he says a man that is vanquished instead of talking of presents ought to retire with shame from his conqueror but that hector was vanquished is by no means to be allowed homer had told us that his strength was restored by apollo and that the two combatants were engaging again upon equal terms with their swords so that this criticism falls to nothing for the rest it is said that this exchange of presents between hector and ajax gave birth to a proverb that the presents of enemies are generally fatal for ajax with this sword afterward killed himself and hector was dragged by this belt at the chariot of achilles  xxxix verse     before great ajax placed the mighty chine this is one of those passages that will naturally fall under the ridicule of a true modern critic but what agamemnon here bestows on ajax was in former times a great mark of respect and honor not only as it was customary to distinguish the quality of their guests by the largeness of the portions assigned them at their tables but as this part of the victim peculiarly belonged to the king himself it is worth remarking on this occasion that the simplicity of those times allowed the eating of no other flesh but beef mutton or kid this is the food of the heroes of homer and the patriarchs and warriors of the old testament fishing and fowling were the arts of more luxurious nations and came much later into greece and israel  one cannot read this passage without being pleased with the wonderful simplicity of the old heroic ages we have here a gallant warrior returning victorious for that he thought himself so appears from those words  from a single combat with the bravest of his enemies and he is no otherwise rewarded than with a larger portion of the sacrifice at supper thus an upper seat or a more capacious bowl was a recompense for the greatest actions and thus the only reward in the olympic games was a pinebranch or a chaplet of parsley or wild olive the latter part of this note belongs to eustathius  xl verse     while we to flames etc there is a great deal of artifice in this counsel of nestor of burning the dead and raising a fortification for though piety was the specious pretext their security was the real aim of the truce which they made use of to finish their works their doing this at the same time they erected the funeral piles made the imposition easy upon the enemy who might naturally mistake one work for the other and this also obviates a plain objection viz why the trojans did not interrupt them in this work the truce determined no exact time but as much as was needful for discharging the rites of the dead  i fancy it may not be unwelcome to the reader to enlarge a little upon the way of disposing the dead among the ancients it may be proved from innumerable instances that the hebrews interred their dead thus abrahams buryingplace is frequently mentioned in scripture and that the egyptians did the same is plain from their embalming them some have been of opinion that the usage of burning the dead was originally to prevent any outrage to the bodies from their enemies which imagination is rendered not improbable by that passage in the first book of samuel where the israelites burn the bodies of saul and his sons after they had been misused by the philistines even though their common custom was to bury their dead and so sylla among the romans was the first of his family who ordered his body to be burnt for fear the barbarities he had exercised on that of marius might be retaliated upon his own tully de legibus lib   proculdubio cremandi ritus a graecis venit nam sepultum legimus numam ad anienis fontem totique genti corneliae solenne fuisse sepulcrum usque ad syllam qui primus ex ea gente crematus est the greeks used both ways of interring and burning patroclus was burned and ajax laid in the ground as appears from sophocless ajax lin         hasten says the chorus to prepare a hollow hole a grave for this man  thucidydes in his second book mentions  coffins or chests made of cypress wood in which the athenians kept the bones of their friends that died in the wars  the romans derived from the greeks both these customs of burning and burying in urbe neve sepelito neve urito says the law of the twelve tables the place where they burned the dead was set apart for this religious use and called glebe from which practice the name is yet applied to all the grounds belonging to the church  plutarch observes that homer is the first who mentions one general tomb for a number of dead persons here is a tumulus built round the pyre not to bury their bodies for they were to be burned nor to receive the bones for those were to be carried to greece but perhaps to inter their ashes which custom may be gathered from a passage in iliad        or it might be only a cenotaph in remembrance of the dead  xli verse     the trojan peers in nightly council sat there is a great beauty in the two epithets homer gives to this council   timida turbulenta the unjust side is always fearful and discordant i think m dacier has not entirely done justice to this thought in her translation horace seems to have accounted this an useful and necessary part that contained the great moral of the iliad as may be seen from his selecting it in particular from the rest in his epistle to lollius fabula qua paridis propter narratur amorem graecia barbariae lento collisa duello stultorum regum and populorum continet aestus antenor censet belli praecidere causam quid paris ut salvus regnet vivatque beatus cogi posse negat    xlii verse     the reverend priam rose priam rejects the wholesome advice of antenor and complies with his son this is indeed extremely natural to the indulgent character and easy nature of the old king of which the whole trojan war is a proof but i could wish homer had not just in this place celebrated his wisdom in calling him  spondanus refers this blindness of priam to the power of fate the time now approaching when troy was to be punished for its injustice something like this weak fondness of a father is described in the scripture in the story of david and absalom  xliii verse   0 next let a truce be asked the conduct of homer in this place is remarkable he makes priam propose in council to send to the greeks to ask a truce to bury the dead this the greeks themselves had before determined to propose but it being more honorable to his country the poet makes the trojan herald prevent any proposition that could be made by the greeks thus they are requested to do what they themselves were about to request and have the honor to comply with a proposal which they themselves would otherwise have taken as a favor eustathius  xliv verse     each at his post in arms we have here the manner of the trojans taking their repast not promiscuously but each at his post homer was sensible that military men ought not to remit their guard even while they refresh themselves but in every action display the soldier eustathius  xlv verse   0 the speech of idaeus the proposition of restoring the treasures and not helen is sent as from paris only in which his father seems to permit him to treat by himself as a sovereign prince and the sole author of the war but the herald seems to exceed his commission in what he tells the greeks paris only offered to restore the treasures he took from greece not including those he brought from sidon and other coasts where he touched in his voyage but idaeus here proffers all that he brought to troy he adds as from himself a wish that paris had perished in that voyage some ancient expositors suppose those words to be spoken aside or in a low voice as it is usual in dramatic poetry but without that salvo a generous love for the welfare of his country might transport idaeus into some warm expressions against the author of its woes he lays aside the herald to act the patriot and speaks with a noble indignation against paris that he may influence the grecian captains to give a favorable answer eustathius  xlvi verse     the greeks gave ear but none the silence broke this silence of the greeks might naturally proceed from their opinion that however desirous they were to put an end to this long war menelaus would never consent to relinquish helen which was the thing insisted upon by paris eustathius accounts for it in another manner and it is from him m dacier has taken her remark the princes says he were silent because it was the part of agamemnon to determine in matters of this nature and agamemnon is silent being willing to hear the inclinations of the princes by this means he avoided the imputation of exposing the greeks to dangers for his advantage and glory since he only gives the answer which is put into his mouth by the princes with the general applause of the army  xlvii verse     oh take not greeks etc there is a peculiar decorum in making diomed the author of this advice to reject even helen herself if she were offered this had not agreed with an amorous husband like menelaus nor with a cunning politician like ulysses nor with a wise old man like nestor but it is proper to diomed not only as a young fearless warrior but as he is in particular an enemy to the interests of venus  xlviii verse  0  and laid along the cars these probably were not chariots but carriages for homer makes nestor say in     that this was to be done with mules and oxen which were not commonly joined to chariots and the word  there may be applied to any vehicle that runs on wheels  signifies indifferently plaustrum or currus and our english word car implies either but if they did use chariots in bearing their dead it is at least evident that those chariots were drawn by mules and oxen at funeral solemnities homers using the word  and not  confirms this opinion  xlix verse   0 then to secure the camp etc homer has been accused of an offense against probability in causing this fortification to be made so late as in the last year of the war mad dacier answers to this objection that the greeks had no occasion for it till the departure of achilles he alone was a greater defense to them and homer had told the reader in a preceding book that the trojans never durst venture out of the walls of troy while achilles fought these intrenchments therefore serve to raise the glory of his principal hero since they become necessary as soon as he withdraws his aid she might have added that achilles himself says all this and makes homers apology in the ninth book     the same author speaking of this fortification seems to doubt whether the use of intrenching camps was known in the trojan war and is rather inclined to think homer borrowed it from what was practiced in his own time but i believe if we consider the caution with which he has been observed in some instances already given to preserve the manners of the age he writes of in contradistinction to what was practiced in his own we may reasonably conclude the art of fortification was in use even so long before him and in the degree of perfection that he here describes it if it was not and if homer was fond of describing an improvement in this art made in his own days nothing could be better contrived than his feigning nestor to be the author of it whose wisdom and experience in war rendered it probable that he might carry his projects farther than the rest of his contemporaries we have here a fortification as perfect as any in the modern times a strong wall is thrown up towers are built upon it from space to space gates are made to issue out at and a ditch sunk deep wide and long to all which palisades are added to complete it  l verse     meanwhile the gods the fiction of this wall raised by the greeks has given no little advantage to homers poem in furnishing him with an opportunity of changing the scene and in a great degree the subject and accidents of his battles so that the following descriptions of war are totally different from all the foregoing he takes care at the first mention of it to fix in us a great idea of this work by making the gods immediately concerned about it we see neptune jealous lest the glory of his own work the walls of troy should be effaced by it and jupiter comforting him with a prophecy that it shall be totally destroyed in a short time homer was sensible that as this was a building of his imagination only and not founded like many other of his descriptions upon some antiquities or traditions of the country so posterity might convict him of a falsity when no remains of any such wall should be seen on the coast therefore as aristotle observes he has found this way to elude the censure of an improbable fiction the word of jove was fulfilled the hands of the gods the force of the rivers and the waves of the sea demolished it in the twelfth book he digresses from the subject of his poem to describe the execution of this prophecy the verses there are very noble and have given the hint to milton for those in which he accounts after the same poetical manner for the vanishing of the terrestrial paradise  all fountains of the deep broke up shall heave the ocean to usurp beyond all bounds till inundation rise above the highest hills then shall this mount of paradise by might of waves be moved out of its place pushed by the horned flood with all its verdure spoiled and trees adrift down the great river to the opening gulf and there take root an island salt and bare the haunt of seals and orcs and seamews clang   li verse   0 and now the fleet etc the verses from hence to the end of the book afford us the knowledge of some points of history and antiquity as that jason had a son by hypsipyle who succeeded his mother in the kingdom of lemnos that the isle of lemnos was anciently famous for its wines and drove a traffic in them and that coined money was not in use in the time of the trojan war but the trade of countries carried on by exchange in gross brass oxen slaves etc i must not forget the particular term used here for slave  which is literally the same with our modern word footman  lii verse     but jove averse etc the signs by which jupiter here shows his wrath against the grecians are a prelude to those more open declarations of his anger which follow in the next book and prepare the mind of the reader for that machine which might otherwise seem too bold and violent  the eighth book of the iliad the argument the second battle and the distress of the greeks jupiter assembles a council of the deities and threatens them with the pains of tartarus if they assist either side minerva only obtains of him that she may direct the greeks by her counsels the armies join battle jupiter on mount ida weighs in his balances the fates of both and affrights the greeks with his thunders and lightnings nestor alone continues in the field in great danger diomed relieves him whose exploits and those of hector are excellently described juno endeavors to animate neptune to the assistance of the greeks but in vain the acts of teucer who is at length wounded by hector and carried off juno and minerva prepare to aid the grecians but are restrained by iris sent from jupiter the night puts an end to the battle hector keeps the field the greeks being driven to their fortification before the ships and gives orders to keep the watch all night in the camp to prevent the enemy from reimbarking and escaping by flight they kindle fires through all the field and pass the night under arms  the time of seven and twenty days is employed from the opening of the poem to the end of this book the scene here except of the celestial machines lies in the field toward the sea shore  the eighth book of the iliad aurora now fair daughter of the dawn sprinkled with rosy light the dewy lawn when jove convened the senate of the skies where high olympus cloudy tops arise the sire of gods his awful silence broke the heavens attentive trembled as he spoke celestial states immortal gods give ear hear our decree and reverence what ye hear the fixed decree which not all heaven can move thou fate fulfill it and ye powers approve what god but enters yon forbidden field who yields assistance or but wills to yield back to the skies with shame he shall be driven gashd with dishonest wounds the scorn of heaven or far oh far from steep olympus thrown low in the dark tartarean gulf shall groan with burning chains fixed to the brazen floors and locked by hells inexorable doors as deep beneath the infernal center hurled as from that center to the ethereal world let him who tempts me dread those dire abodes and

earth and main strive all of mortal and immortal birth to drag by this the thundrer down to earth ye strive in vain if i but stretch this hand i heave the gods the ocean and the land i fix the chain to great olympus height and the vast world hangs trembling in my sight for such i reign unbounded and above and such are men and gods compared to jove the almighty spoke nor durst the powers reply a

over her pointed summits proudly raised his fane breathed odours and his altar blazed there from his radiant car the sacred sire of gods and men released the steeds of fire blue ambient mists the immortal steeds embraced high on the cloudy point his seat he placed thence his broad eye the subject world surveys the town the tents and navigable seas now had the grecians snatched a short repaste

heroes lost not even a phrygian dame who dreads the sword that laid in dust her loved lamented lord he said and hasty over the gasping throng drives the swift steeds the chariot smoaks along the shouts of trojans thicken in the wind the storm of hissing javelins pours behind then with a voice that shakes the solid skies pleased hector braves the warrior as he flies go mighty hero graced above

and see his trojans to the shades descend such be the scene from his idaean bower ungrateful prospect to the sullen power neptune with wrath rejects the rash design what rage what madness furious queen is thine i war not with the highest all above submit and tremble at the hand of jove now godlike hector to whose matchless might jove gave the glory of the destined fight squadrons on squadrons drives and fills the fields with closerangd chariots and with thickened shields where the deep trench in length extended lay compacted troops stand wedged in firm array a dreadful front they shake the

robe bright ensign of command high on the midmost bark the king appeared there from ulysses deck his voice was heard to ajax and achilles reached the sound whose distant ships the guarded navy bound oh argives shame of human race he cried the hollow vessels to his voice replied where now are all our glorious boasts of yore our hasty triumphs on the lemnian shore each fearless hero dares an hundred foes while the feast lasts and while the goblet flows but who to meet one martial man is found when the fight rages and the flames surround oh mighty jove oh sire of the distressed was ever king like me like me oppressed with power immense with justice armed in vain my glory ravished and my people slain to thee my vows were breathed from every shore what altar smoked not with our victims gore with fat of bulls i fed the constant flame and asked destruction to the trojan name now gracious god far humbler our demand give these at least to scape from hectors hand and save the relics of the grecian land thus prayed the king and heavens great father heard his vows in bitterness of soul preferred the wrath appeased by happy signs declares and gives the people to their monarchs prayers his eagle sacred bird of heaven he sent a fawn his talons trussed divine portent high over the wondering hosts he soared above who paid their vows to panomphaean jove then let the prey before his altar fall the greeks beheld and transport seized on all encouraged by the sign the troops revive and fierce on troy with doubled fury drive tydides first of all the grecian force over the broad ditch impelled his foaming horse pierced the deep ranks their strongest battle tore and died his javelin red with trojan gore young agelaus  phradmon was his sire with flying coursers shunned his dreadful

whom thy eyes approve shall recompense the warriors toils with love to this the chief with praise the rest inspire nor urge a soul already filled with fire what strength i have be now in battle tried till every shaft in phrygian blood be died since rallying from our wall we forced the foe still aimed at hector have i bent my bow eight forky arrows from this hand have fled and eight bold heroes by their points lie dead but sure some god denies me to destroy this fury of the field this dog of troy he said and twangd the string the weapon flies at hectors breast and sings along the skies he missed the mark but pierced gorgythios heart and drenched in royal blood the thirsty dart fair castianira nymph of form divine this offspring added to king priams line as full blown poppies overcharged with rain decline the head and drooping kiss the plain so sinks the youth his beauteous head depressed beneath his helmet drops upon his breast another shaft the raging archer drew that other shaft with erring fury flew from hector phoebus turned the flying wound yet fell not dry or guiltless to the ground thy breast brave archeptolemus it tore and dipped its feathers in no vulgar gore headlong he falls his sudden fall alarms the steeds that startle at his sounding arms hector with grief his charioteer beheld and eyed him breathless on the sanguin field then bids cebriones direct the rein quits his bright car and issues on the plain dreadful he shouts from earth a stone he took and rushed on teucer with the lifted rock the youth already strained the forceful yew the shaft already to his shoulder drew the feather in his hand just winged for flight touched where the neck and hollow chest unite there where the juncture knits the channel bone the furious chief discharged the craggy stone the tendon burst beneath the pondrous blow and his numbed hand dismissed his useless bow he fell but ajax his broad shield displayed and screend his brother with the mighty shade till great alastor and mecistheus bore the battered archer groaning to the shore troy yet found grace before the olympian sire he armed their hands and filled their breasts with fire the greeks repulsed retreat behind their wall or in the trench on heaps confusedly fall first of the foe great hector marched along with terror clothed and more than mortal strong as the bold hound that gives the lion chase with beating bosom and with eager pace hangs on his haunch or fastens on his heels guards as he turns and circles as he wheels thus often the grecians turned but still they flew thus following hector still the hindmost slew when flying they had passed the trench profound and many a chief lay gasping on the ground before the ships a desperate stand they made and fired the troops and called the gods to aid fierce on his rattling chariot hector came his eyes like gorgon shot a sanguin flame that withered all their host like mars he stood dire as the monster dreadful as the god their strong distress the wife of jove surveyed then pensive thus to wars triumphant maid oh daughter of that god whose arm can wield the avenging bolt and shake the sable shield now in this moment of her last despair shall wretched greece no more confess our care condemned to suffer the full force of fate and drain the dregs of heavens relentless hate gods shall one raging hand thus level all what numbers fell what numbers yet shall fall what power divine shall hectors wrath assuage still swells the slaughter and still grows the rage so spoke the imperial regent of the skies to whom the goddess with the azure eyes long since had hector stained these fields with gore stretched by some argive on his native shore but he above the sire of heaven withstands mocks our attempts and slights our just demands the stubborn god inflexible and hard forgets my service and deserved reward saved i for this his favorite hercules son distressed by stern eurystheus with long labors prefsd he begged with tears he begged in deep dismay i shot from heaven and gave his arm the day oh had my wisdom known this dire event when to grim plutos gloomy gates he went the triple dog had never felt his chain nor styx been crossed nor hell explored in vain averse to me of all his heaven of gods at thetis suit the partial thundrer nods to grace her gloomy fierce resenting son my hopes are frustrate and my greeks undone some future day perhaps he may be moved to call his blueeyd maid his bestbelovd haste launch thy chariot through yon ranks to ride my self will arm and thunder at thy side then goddess say shall hector glory then that terror of the greeks that man of men when junos self and pallas shall appear all dreadful in the crimson walks of war what mighty trojan then on yonder shore expiring pale and terrible no more shall feast the fowls and glut the dogs with gore she ceased and juno reind her steeds with care heavens awful empress saturns other heir pallas meanwhile her various veil unbound with flowers adorned with art immortal crowned the radiant robe her sacred fingers wove floats in rich waves and spreads the court of jove her fathers arms her mighty limbs invest his cuirass blazes on her ample breast the vigorous power the trembling car ascends shook by her arm the massy javelin bends huge ponderous strong that when her fury burns proud tyrants humbles and whole hosts oerturns saturnia lends the lash the coursers fly smooth glides the chariot through the liquid sky heavngates spontaneous open to the powers heavens golden gates kept by the winged hours commissioned in alternate watch to stand the suns bright portals and the skies command close or unfold the eternal gates of day bar heaven with clouds or roll those clouds away the sounding hinges ring the clouds divide pronedown the steep of heaven their course they guide but jove incensed from idas top surveyed and thus enjoined the manycolourd maid thaumantia mount the winds and stop their car against the highest who shall wage the war if furious yet they dare the vain debate thus have i spoke and what i spoke is fate their coursers crushed beneath the wheels shall lie their car in fragments scattered over the sky my lightning these rebellious shall confound and hurl them flaming headlong to the ground condemned for ten revolving years to weep the wounds impressed by burning thunder deep so shall minerva learn to sear our ire nor dare to combat here is and natures sire for juno headstrong and imperious still she claims some title to transgress our will swift as the wind the variouscolourd maid from idas top her golden wings displayed to great olympus shining gates she flies there meets the chariot rushing down the skies restrains their progress from the bright abodes and speaks the mandate of the sire of gods what frenzy goddesses what rage can move celestial minds to tempt the wrath of jove desist obedient to his high command this is his word and know his word shall stand his lightning your rebellion shall confound and hurl ye headlong flaming to the ground your horses crushed beneath the wheels shall lie your car in fragments scattered over the sky your selves condemned ten rolling years to weep the wounds impressed by burning thunder deep so shall minerva learn to fear his ire nor dare to combat here is and natures sire for juno headstrong and imperious still she claims some title to transgress his will but thee what desperate insolence has driven to lift thy lance against the sire of heaven then mounting on the pinions of the wind she flew and juno thus her rage resigned o daughter of that god whose arm can wield the avenging bolt and shake the dreadful shield no more let beings of superior birth contend with jove for this low race of earth triumphant now now miserably slain they breathe or perish as the fates ordain but joves high counsels full effect shall find and ever constant ever rule mankind she spoke and backward turned her steeds of light adorned with manes of gold and heavenly bright the hours unloosd them panting as they stood and heaped their mangers with ambrosial food there tied they rest in high celestial stalls the chariot propt against the crystal walls the pensive goddesses abashed controlled mix with the gods and fill their seats of gold and now the thundrer meditates his flight from idas summits to the olympian height swifter than thought the wheels instinctive fly flame through the vast of air and reach the sky twas neptunes charge his coursers to unbrace and fix the car on its immortal base there stood the chariot beaming forth its rays till with a snowy veil he screend the blaze he whose allconscious eyes the world behold the eternal thunderer sat throned in gold high heaven the footstool of his feet he makes and wide beneath him all olympus shakes trembling afar the offending powers appeared confused and silent for his frown they feared he saw their soul and thus his word imparts pallas and juno say why heave your hearts soon was your battle over proud troy retired before your face and in your wrath expired but know whoever almighty power withstand unmatched our force unconquered is our hand who shall the sovereign of the skies control not all the gods that crown the starry pole your hearts shall tremble if our arms we take and each immortal nerve with horror shake for thus i speak and what i speak shall stand what power soever provokes our lifted hand on this our hill no more shall hold his place cut off and exiled from thaethereal race juno and pallas grieving hear the doom but feast their souls on ilions woes to come though secret anger swelled minervas breast the prudent goddess yet her wrath represt but juno impotent of rage replies what have thou said oh tyrant of the skies strength and omnipotence invest thy throne it is thine to punish ours to grieve alone for greece we grieve abandoned by her fate to drink the dregs of thy unmeasured hate from fields forbidden we submiss refrain with arms unaiding see our argives slain yet grant our counsels still their breasts may move lest all should perish in the rage of jove the goddess thus and thus the god replies who swells the clouds and blackens all the skies the morning sun awaked by loud alarms shall see the almighty thunderer in arms what heaps of argives then shall load the plain these radiant eyes shall view and view in vain nor shall great hector cease the rage of fight the navy flaming and thy greeks in flight even till the day when certain fates ordain that stern achilles his patroclus slain shall rise in vengeance and lay waste the plain for such is fate nor can thou turn its course with all thy rage with all thy rebel force fly if thou will to earths remotest bound where on her utmost verge the seas resound where cursed iapetus and saturn dwell fast by the brink within the steams of hell no sun ever gilds the gloomy horrors there no cheerful gales refresh the lazy air there arm once more the bold titanian band and arm in vain for what i will shall stand now deep in ocean sunk the lamp of light and drew behind the cloudy veil of night the conquering trojans mourn his beams decayed the greeks rejoicing bless the friendly shade the victors keep the field and hector calls a martial council near the navywalls these to scamanders bank apart he led where thinly scattered lay the heaps of dead the assembled chiefs descending on the ground attend his order and their prince surround a massy spear he bore of mighty strength of full ten cubits was the lances length the point was steel refulgent to behold fixed to the wood with circling rings of gold the noble hector on this lance reclined and bending forward thus revealed his mind ye valiant trojans with attention hear ye dardan bands and generous aids give ear this day we hoped would wrap in conquering flame greece with her ships and crown our toils with fame but darkness now to save the cowards falls and guards them trembling in their wooden walls obey the night and use her peaceful hours our steeds to forage and refresh our powers strait from the town be sheep and oxen sought and strengthening bread and generous wine be brought wide over the field highblazing to the sky let numerous fires the absent sun supply the flaming piles with plenteous fuel raise till the bright morn her purple beam displays lest in the silence and the shades of night greece on her sable ships attempt her flight not unmolested let the wretches gain their lofty decks and safely cleave the main some hostile wound let every dart bestow some lasting token of the phrygian foe wounds that long hence may ask their spouses care and warn their children from a trojan war now through the circuit of our ilian wall let sacred heralds sound the solemn call to bid the sires with hoary honors crowned and beardless youths the battlements surround firm be the guard while distant lie our powers and let the matrons hang with lights the towers lest under covert of the midnight shade the insidious foe the naked town invade suffice to night these orders to obey a nobler charge shall rowze the dawning day the gods i trust shall give to hectors hand from these detested foes to free the land who plowed with fates averse the watery way for trojan vulturs a predestined prey our common safety must be now the care but soon as morning paints the fields of air sheathed in bright arms let every troop engage and the fired fleet behold the battle rage then then shall hector and tydides prove whose fates are heaviest in the scale of jove to morrows light oh haste the glorious morn shall see his bloody spoils in triumph born with this keen javelin shall his breast be gored and prostrate heroes bleed around their lord certain as this oh might my days endure from age inglorious and black death secure so might my life and glory know no bound like pallas worshipped like the sun renowned as the next dawn the last they shall enjoy shall crush the greeks and end the woes of troy the leader spoke from all his hosts around shouts of applause along the shores resound each from the yoke the smoking steeds untied and fixed their headstalls to his chariotside fat sheep and oxen from the town are led with generous wine and allsustaining bread full hecatombs lay burning on the shore the winds to heaven the curling vapors bore ungrateful offering to the immortal powers whose wrath hung heavy over the trojan towers nor priam nor his sons obtained their grace proud troy they hated and her guilty race the troops exulting sat in order round and beaming fires illumined all the ground as when the moon refulgent lamp of night over heavens clear azure sheds her sacred light when not a breath disturbs the deep serene and not a cloud oercasts the solemn scene around her throne the vivid planets roll and stars unnumberd gild the glowing pole over the dark trees a yellower verdure shed and tip with silver every mountains head then shine the vales the rocks in prospect rise a flood of glory bursts from all the skies the conscious swains rejoicing in the sight eye the blue vault and bless the useful light so many flames before proud ilion blaze and lighten glimmering xanthus with their rays the long reflections of the distant fires gleam on the walls and tremble on the spires a thousand piles the dusky horrors gild and shoot a shady luster over the field full fifty guards each flaming pile attend whose umberd arms by fits thick flashes send loud neigh the coursers over their heaps of corn and ardent warriors wait the rising morn observations on the eighth book observations on the eighth book i homer like most of the greeks is thought to have traveled into egypt and brought from the priests there not only their learning but their manner of conveying it in fables and hieroglyphics this is necessary to be considered by those who would thoroughly penetrate into the beauty and design of many parts of this author for whoever reflects that this was the mode of learning in those times will make no doubt but there are several mysteries both of natural and moral philosophy involved in his fictions which otherwise in the literal meaning appear too trivial or irrational and it is but just when these are not plain or immediately intelligible to imagine that something of this kind may be hid under them nevertheless as homer traveled not with a direct view of writing philosophy or theology so he might often use these hieroglyphical fables and traditions as embellishments of his poetry only without taking the pains to open their mystical meaning to his readers and perhaps without diving very deeply into it himself  ii verse    let down our golden everlasting chain the various opinions of the ancients concerning this passage are collected by eustathius jupiter says if he holds this chain of gold the force of all the gods is unable to draw him down but that he can draw up them the seas and the earth and cause the whole universe to hang unactive some think that jupiter signifies the ether the golden chain the sun if the ether did not temper the rays of the sun as they pass through it his beams would not only drink up and exhale the ocean in vapors but also exhale the moisture from the veins of the earth which is the cement that holds it together by which means the whole creation would become unactive and all its powers be suspended  others affirm that by this golden chain may be meant the days of the worlds duration  which are as it were painted by the luster of the sun and follow one another in a successive chain till they arrive at their final period while jupiter or the ether which the ancients called the soul of all things still remains unchanged  plato in his theaetetus says that by this golden chain is meant the sun whose rays enliven all nature and cement the parts of the universe  the stoics will have it that by jupiter is implied destiny which overrules every thing both upon and above the earth  others delighted with their own conceits imagine that homer intended to represent the excellence of monarchy that the scepter ought to be swayed by one hand and that all the wheels of government should be put in motion by one person  but i fancy a much better interpretation may be found for this if we allow as there is great reason to believe that the egyptians understood the true system of the world and that pythagoras first learned it from them they held that the planets were kept in their orbits by gravitation upon the sun which was therefore called jovis carcer and sometimes by the sun as macrobius informs us is meant jupiter himself we see too that the most prevailing opinion of antiquity fixes it to the sun so that i think it will be no strained interpretation to say that by the inability of the gods to pull jupiter out of his place with this catena may be understood the superior attractive force of the sun whereby he continues unmoved and draws all the rest of the planets toward him  iii verse    low in the dark tartarean gulf etc this opinion of tartarus the place of torture for the impious after death might also be taken from the egyptians for it seems not improbable as some writers have observed that some tradition might then be spread in the eastern parts of the world of the fall of the angels the punishment of the damned and other sacred truths which were afterward more fully explained and taught by the prophets and apostles these homer seems to allude to in this and other passages as where vulcan is said to be precipitated from heaven in the first book where jupiter threatens mars with tartarus in the fifth and where the demon of discord is cast out of heaven in the nineteenth virgil has translated a part of these lines into the sixth aeneid  tum tartarus ipse bis patet in praeceps tantum tenditque sub umbras quantus ad aethereum coeli suspectus olympum and milton in his first book as far removed from god and light of heaven as from the center thrice to the utmost pole it may not be unpleasing just to observe the gradation in these three great poets as if they had vied with each other in extending this idea of the depth of hell homer says as far virgil twice as far milton thrice  iv verse    the almighty spoke homer in this whole passage plainly shows his belief of one supreme omnipotent god whom he introduces with a majesty and superiority worthy the great ruler of the universe accordingly justin martyr cites it as a proof of our authors attributing the power and government of all things to one first god whose divinity is so far superior to all other deities that if compared to him they may be ranked among mortals admon ad gentes upon this account and with the authority of that learned father i have ventured to apply to jupiter in this place such appellatives as are suitable to the supreme deity a practice i would be cautious of using in many others where the notions and descriptions of our author must be owned to be unworthy of the divinity  v verse    o first and greatest etc homer is not only to be admired for keeping up the characters of his heroes but for adapting his speeches to the characters of his gods had juno here given the reply she would have begun with some mark of resentment but pallas is all submission juno would probably have contradicted him but pallas only begs leave to be sorry for those whom she must not assist juno would have spoken with the prerogative of a wife but pallas makes her address with the obsequiousness of a prudent daughter eustathius  vi verse  0 for on this dreadful day the fate of fathers wives and infants lay it may be necessary to explain why the trojans thought themselves obliged to fight in order to defend their wives and children one would think they might have kept within their walls the grecians made no attempt to batter them neither were they invested and the country was open on all sides except toward the sea to give them provisions the most natural thought is that they and their auxiliaries being very numerous could not subsist but from a large country about them and perhaps not without the sea and the rivers where the greeks encamped that in time the greeks would have surrounded them and blocked up every avenue to their town that they thought themselves obliged to defend the country with all the inhabitants of it and that indeed at first this was rather a war between two nations and became not properly a siege till afterward  vii verse    the gates unfolding etc there is a wonderful sublimity in these lines one sees in the description the gates of a warlike city thrown open and an army pouring forth and one hears the trampling of men and horses rushing to the battle  these verses are as eustathius observes only a repetition of a former passage which shows that the poet was particularly pleased with them and that he was not ashamed of a repetition when he could not express the same image more happily than he had already done  viii verse    the sacred light homer describing the advance of the day from morning till noon calls it  or sacred says eustathius who gives this reason for it because that part of the day was allotted to sacrifice and religious worship  ix verse    the sire of gods his golden scales suspends this figure representing god as weighing the destinies of men in his balances was first made use of in holy writ in the book of job which is acknowledged to be one of the most ancient of all the scriptures he prays to be weighed in an even balance that god may know his integrity daniel declares from god to belshazzar thou art weighed in the balances and sound light and proverbs chapter       a just weight and balance are the lords our author has it again in the twenty second iliad and it appeared so beautiful to succeeding poets that aeschylus as we are told by plutarch de and poetis writ a whole tragedy upon this foundation which he called psychostasia or the weighing of souls in this he introduced thetis and aurora standing on either side of jupiters scales and praying each for her son while the heroes fought    it has been copied by virgil in the last aeneid jupiter ipse duas aequato examine lances sustinet and fata imponit diversa duorum quem damnet labor and quo vergat pondere lethum i cannot agree with madam dacier that these verses are inferior to homers but macrobius observes with some color that the application of them is not so just as in our author for virgil had made juno say before that turnus would certainly perish nunc juvenem imparibus video concurrere fatis parcarumque dies and vis inimica propinquat so that there was less reason for weighing his fate with that of aeneas after that declaration scaliger trifles miserably when he says juno might have learned this from the fates though jupiter did not know it before he consulted them by weighing the scales but macrobiuss excuse in behalf of virgil is much better worth regard i shall transcribe it entire as it is perhaps the finest period in all that author haec and alia ignoscenda virgilio qui studii circa homerum nimietate excedit modum et revera non poterat non in aliquibus minor videri qui per omnem poesim suam hoc uno est praecipue usus archetypo acriter enim in homerum oculos intendit ut aemularetur ejus non modo magnitudinem sed and simplicitatem and praesentiam orationis and tacitam majestatem hinc diversarum inter heroas suos personarum varia magnificatio hinc deorum interpositio hinc autoritas fabulosa hinc affectuum naturalium expressio hinc monumentorum persecutio hinc parabolarum exaggeratio hinc torrentis orationis sonitus hinc rerum singularum cum splendore fastigium sat l   c     as to the ascent or descent of the scales eustathius explains it in this manner the descent of the scale toward earth signifies unhappiness and death the earth being the place of misfortune and mortality the mounting of it signifies prosperity and life the superior regions being the seats of felicity and immortality  milton has admirably improved upon this fine fiction and with an alteration agreeable to a christian poet he feigns that the almighty weighed satan in such scales but judiciously makes this difference that the mounting of his scale denoted ill success whereas the same circumstance in homer points the victory his reason was because satan was immortal and therefore the sinking of his scale could not signify death but the mounting of it did his lightness conformable to the expression we just now cited from daniel the eternal to prevent such horrid fray hung forth in heaven his golden scales yet seen between astraea and the scorpion sign wherein all things created first he weighed the pendulous round earth with balanced air in counterpoise now ponders all events battles and realms in these he put two weights the sequel each of parting and of fight the latter quick upflew and kicked the beam i believe upon the whole this may with justice be preferred both to homers and virgils on account of the beautiful allusion to the sign of libra in the heavens and that noble imagination of the makers weighing the whole world at the creation and all the events of it since so correspondent at once to philosophy and to the style of the scriptures  x verse    then jove from ida s top etc this distress of the greeks being supposed jupiters presence was absolutely necessary to bring them into it for the inferior gods that were friendly to greece were rather more in number and superior in force to those that favored troy and the poet had showed before when both armies were left to themselves that the greeks could overcome the trojans besides it would have been an indelible reflection upon his countrymen to have been vanquished by a smaller number therefore nothing less than the immediate interposition of jupiter was requisite which shows the wonderful address of the poet in his machinery virgil makes turnus say in the last aeneid  dii me terrent and jupiter hostis and indeed this defeat of the greeks seems more to their glory than all their victories since even jupiters omnipotence could with difficulty effect it  xi verse    thick lightenings flash this notion of jupiters declaring against the greeks by thunder and lightning is drawn says dacier from truth itself sam   chapter   and as samuel was offering up the burntoffering the philistines drew near to battle against israel but the lord thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the philistines and discomfited them and they were smitten before israel to which may be added that in the    th psalm the lord thundered in the heavens and the highest gave his voice hailstones and coals of fire yea he sent out his arrows and scattered them he shot out lightnings and discomfited them  upon occasion of the various successes given by jupiter now to grecians now to trojans whom he suffers to perish interchangeably some have fancied this supposition injurious to the nature of the sovereign being as representing him variable or inconstant in his rewards and punishments it may be answered that as god makes use of some people to chastise others and none are totally void of crimes he often decrees to punish those very persons for lesser sins whom he makes his instruments to punish others for greater so purging them from their own iniquities before they become worthy to be chastisers of other mens this is the case of the greeks here whom jupiter permits to suffer many ways though he had destined them to revenge the rape of helen upon troy there is a history in the bible just of this nature in the  0 th chapter of judges the israelites are commanded to make war against the tribe of benjamin to punish a rape on the wife of a levite committed in the city of gibeah when they have laid siege to the place the benjamites sally upon them with so much vigor that a great number of the besiegers are destroyed they are astonished at these defeats as having undertaken the siege in obedience to the command of god but they are still ordered to persist till at length they burn the city and almost extinguish the race of benjamin there are many instances in scripture where heaven is represented to change its decrees according to the repentance or relapses of men hezechias is ordered to prepare for death and afterward fifteen years are added to his life it is foretold to achab that he shall perish miserably and then upon his humiliation god defers the punishment till the reign of his successor etc  i must confess that in comparing passages of the sacred books with our author one ought to use a great deal of caution and respect if there are some places in scripture that in compliance to human understanding represent the deity as acting by motives like those of men there are infinitely more that show him as he is all perfection justice and beneficence whereas in homer the general tenor of the poem represents jupiter as a being subject to passion inequality and imperfection i think m dacier has carried these comparisons too far and is too zealous to defend him upon every occasion in the points of theology and doctrine  xii verse     but diomed beheld the whole following story of nestor and diomed is admirably contrived to raise the character of the latter he maintains his intrepidity and ventures singly to bring off the old hero notwithstanding the general consternation the art of homer will appear wonderful to any one who considers all the circumstances of this part and by what degrees he reconciles this flight of diomed to that undaunted character the thunderbolt falls just before him that is not enough nestor advises him to submit to heaven this does not prevail he cannot bear the thoughts of flight nestor drives back the chariot without his consent he is again inclined to go on till jupiter again declares against him these two heroes are very artfully placed together because none but a person of nestors authority and wisdom could have prevailed upon diomed to retreat a younger warrior could not so well in honor have given him such counsel and from no other would he have taken it to cause diomed to fly required both the counsel of nestor and the thunder of jupiter  xiii verse     oh turn and save etc there is a decorum in making diomed call ulysses to the assistance of his brother sage for who better knew the importance of nestor than ulysses but the question is whether ulysses did not drop nestor as one great minister would do another and fancied he should be the wise man when the other was gone eustathius indeed is of opinion that homer meant not to cast any aspersion on ulysses nor would have given him so many noble appellations when in the same breath he reflected upon his courage but perhaps the contrary opinion may not be ill grounded if we observe the manner of homers expression diomed called ulysses but ulysses was deaf he did not hear and whereas the poet says of the rest that they had not the hardiness to stay ulysses is not only said to fly but  to make violent haste toward the navy  ovid at least understood it thus for he puts an objection in ajaxs mouth metam    drawn from this passage which would have been improper had not ulysses made more speed than he ought since ajax on the same occasion retreated as well as he  xiv verse     the thirsty fury of my flying spear homer has figures of that boldness which it is impossible to preserve in another language the words in the original are  hector shall see if my spear is mad in my hands the translation pretends only to have taken some shadow of this in animating the spear giving it fury and strengthening the figure with the epithet thirsty  xv verse     and now had death etc eustathius observes how wonderfully homer still advances the character of diomed when all the leaders of greece were retreated the poet says that had not jupiter interposed diomed alone had driven the whole army of troy to their walls and with his single hand have vanquished an army  xvi verse     the ground before him flamed here is a battle described with so much fire that the warmest imagination of an able painter cannot add a circumstance to heighten the surprise or horror of the picture here is what they call the fracas or hurry and tumult of the action in the utmost strength of coloring upon the foreground and the repose or solemnity at a distance with great propriety and judgment first in the eloignement we behold jupiter in golden armor surrounded with glory upon the summit of mount ida his chariot and horses by him wrapped in dark clouds in the next place below the horizon appear the clouds rolling and opening through which the lightning flashes in the face of the greeks who are flying on all sides agamemnon and the rest of the commanders in the rear in postures of astonishment toward the middle of the piece we see nestor in the utmost distress one of his horses having a deadly wound in the forehead with a dart which makes him rear and writhe and disorder the rest nestor is cutting the harness with his sword while hector advances driving full speed diomed interposes in an action of the utmost fierceness and intrepidity these two heroes make the principal figures and subject of the picture a burning thunderbolt falls just before the feet of diomeds horses from whence a horrid flame of sulphur arises  this is only a specimen of a single picture designed by homer out of the many with which he has beautified the iliad and indeed every thing is so natural and so lively that the historypainter would generally have no more to do but to delincate the forms and copy the circumstances just as he finds them described by this great master we cannot therefore wonder at what has been so often said of homers furnishing ideas to the most famous painters of antiquity  xvii verse     the solid skies homer sometimes calls the heavens brazen  and jupiters palace  one might think from hence that the notion of the solidity of the heavens which is indeed very ancient had been generally received the scripture uses expressions agreeable to it a heaven of brass and the firmament  xviii verse     heard ye the voice of jove it was a noble and effectual manner of encouraging the troops by telling them that god was surely on their side this it seems has been an ancient practice as it has been used in modern times by those who never read homer  xix verse     now xanthus aethon etc there have been those who blame this manner introduced by homer and copied by virgil of making a hero address his discourse to his horses virgil has given human sentiments to the horse of pallas and made him weep for the death of his master in the tenth aeneid mezentius speaks to his horse in the same manner as hector does here nay he makes turnus utter a speech to his spear and invoke it as a divinity all this is agreeable to the art of oratory which makes it a precept to speak to every thing and make every thing speak of which there are innumerable applauded instances in the most celebrated orators nothing can be more spirited and affecting than this enthusiasm of hector who in the transport of his joy at the sight of diomed flying before him breaks out into this apostrophe to his horses as he is pursuing and indeed the air of this whole speech is agreeable to a man drunk with the hopes of success and promising himself a series of conquests he has in imagination already forced the grecian retrenchments set the fleet in flames and destroyed the whole army  xx verse     for this my spouse there is says m dacier a secret beauty in this passage which perhaps will only be perceived by those who are particularly versed in homer he describes a princess so tender in her love to her husband that she takes care constantly to go and meet him at his return from every battle and in the joy of seeing him again runs to his horses and gives them bread and wine as a testimony of her acknowledgment to them for bringing him back notwithstanding the raillery that may be past upon this remark i take a lady to be the best judge to what actions a woman may be carried by fondness to her husband homer does not expressly mention bread but wheat and the commentators are not agreed whether she gave them wine to drink or steeped the grain in it hobbes translates it as i do  xxi verse     vulcanian arms the labor of a god these were the arms that diomed had received from glaucus and a prize worthy hector being as we were told in the sixth book entirely of gold i do not remember any other place where the shield of nestor is celebrated by homer  xxii verse     yet aegae helice these were two cities of greece in which neptune was particularly honored and in each of which there was a temple and statue of him  xxiii verse     where the deep trench that is to say the space betwixt the ditch and the wall was filled with the men and chariots of the greeks hector not having yet past the ditch eustathius  xxiv verse     his purple robe agamemnon here addresses himself to the eyes of the army his voice might have been lost in the confusion of a retreat but the motion of this purple robe could not fail of attracting the regards of the soldiers his speech also is very remarkable he first endeavors to shame them into courage and then begs of jupiter to give that courage success at least so far as not to suffer the whole army to be destroyed eustathius  xxv verse   0 high on the midmost bark etc we learn from hence the situation of the ships of ulysses achilles and ajax the two latter being the strongest heroes of the army were placed to defend either end of the fleet as most obnoxious to the incursions or surprises of the enemy and ulysses being the ablest head was allotted the middle place as more safe and convenient for the council and that he might be the nearer if any emergency required his advice eustathius spondanus  xxvi verse     thus prayed the king and heavens great father heard it is to be observed in general that homer hardly ever makes his heroes succeed unless they have first offered a prayer to heaven whether they engage in war go upon an embassy undertake a voyage in a word whatever they enterprise they almost always supplicate some god and whenever we find this omitted we may expect some adversity to befall them in the course of the story  xxvii verse     the eagle sacred bird jupiter upon the prayers of agamemnon sends an omen to encourage the greeks the application of it is obvious the eagle signified hector the fawn denoted the fear and flight of the greeks and being dropped at the altar of jupiter showed that they would be saved by the protection of that god the word  says eustathius has a great significancy in this place the greeks having just received this happy omen from jupiter were offering oblations to him under the title of the father of oracles there may also be a natural reason for this appellation as jupiter signified the ether which is the vehicle of all sounds  virgil has a fine imitation of this passage but diversified with many more circumstances where he make juturna show a prodigy of the like nature to encourage the latins aen    namque volans rubra sulvus jovis ales in aethra litoreas agitabat aves turbamque sonantem agminis aligeri subito cum lapsus ad undas cycnum excellentem pedibus rapit improbus uncis arrexere animos itali cunctaeque volucres convertunt clamore fugam mirabile visu aetheraque obscurant pennis hostemque per auras facta nube premunt donec vi victus and ipso pondere defecit praedamque ex unguibus ales projecit fluvio penitusque in nubila fugit   xxviii verse  0  tydides first diomed as we have before seen was the last that retreated from the thunder of jupiter he is now the first that returns to the battle it is worth while to observe the behavior of the hero upon this occasion he retreats with the utmost reluctance and advances with the greatest ardour he flies with greater impatience to meet danger than he could before to put himself in safety eustathius  xxix verse   0 secure behind the telamonian shield eustathius observes that teucer being an excellent archer and using only the bow could not wear any arms which would incumber him and render him less expedite in his archery homer to secure him from the enemy represents him as standing behind ajaxs shield and shooting from thence thus the poet gives us a new circumstance of a battle and though ajax atchieves nothing himself he maintains a superiority over teucer ajax may be said to kill these trojans with the arrows of teucer  there is also a wonderful tenderness in the simile with which he illustrates the retreat of teucer behind the shield of ajax such tender circumstances soften the horrors of a battle and diffuse a dawn of serenity over the soul of the reader  xxx verse     great agamemnon views eustathius observes that homer would here teach the duty of a general in a battle he must observe the behavior of his soldiers he must honor the hero reproach the coward reduce the disorderly and for the encouragement of the deserving he must promise rewards that desert in arms may not only be paid with glory  xxxi verse     sprung from an aliens bed agamemnon here in the height of his commendations of teucer tells him of his spurious birth this says eustathius was reckoned no disgrace among the ancients nothing being more common than for heroes of old to take their female captives to their beds and as such captives were then given for a reward of valor and as a matter of glory it could be no reproach to be descended from them thus teucer says eustathius was descended from telamon and hesione the sister of priam a female captive  xxxii verse     this dog of troy this is literal from the greek and i have ventured it as no improper expression of the rage of teucer for having been so often disappointed in his aim and of his passion against that enemy who had so long prevented all the hopes of the grecians milton was not scrupulous of imitating even these which the modern refiners call unmannerly strokes of our author who knew to what extremes human passions might proceed and was not ashamed to copy them he has put this very expression into the mouth of god himself who upon beholding the havoc which sin and death made in the world is moved in his indignation to cry out see with what heat these dogs of hell advance   xxxiii verse     he missed the mark these words says eustathius are very artfully inserted the reader might wonder why so skilful an archer should so often miss his mark and it was necessary that teucer should miss hector because homer could not falsify the history this difficulty he removes by the intervention of apollo who wafts the arrow aside from him the poet does not tell us that this was done by the hand of a god till the arrow of teucer came so near hector as to kill his charioteer which made some such contrivance necessary  xxxiv verse   0 as fullblown poppies this simile is very beautiful and exactly represents the manner of gorgythions death there is such a sweetness in the comparison that it makes us pity the youths fall and almost feel his wound virgil has applied it to the death of euryalus  inque humeros cervix collapsa recumbit purpureus veluti cum flos succisus aratro languescit moriens lassove papavera collo demisere caput pluvia cum forte gravantur this is finely improved by the roman author with the particulars of succisus aratro and lasso collo but it may on the other hand be observed in the favor of homer that the circumstance of the head being oppressed and weighed down by the helmet is so remarkably just that it is a wonder virgil omitted it and the rather because he had particularly taken notice before that it was the helmet of euryalus which occasioned the discovery and unfortunate death of this young hero and his friend  one may make a general observation that homer in those comparisons that breath an air of tenderness is very exact and adapts them in every point to the subject which he is to illustrate but in other comparisons where he is to inspire the soul with sublime sentiments he gives a loose to his fancy and does not regard whether the images exactly correspond i take the reason of it to be this in the first the copy must be like the original to cause it to affect us the glass needs only to return the real image to make it beautiful whereas in the other a succession of noble ideas will cause the like sentiments in the soul and though the glass should enlarge the image it only strikes us with such thoughts as the poet intended to raise sublime and great  xxxv verse     there where the juncture knits the channel bone hector struck teucer it seems just about the articulation of the arm with the shoulder which cut the tendon or wounded it so that the arm lost its force this is a true description of the effect of such a blow  xxxvi verse  0  as the bold hound that gives the lion chase this simile is the justest imaginable and gives the most lively picture of the manner in which the grecians fled and hector pursued them still slaughtering the hindmost gratius and oppian have given us particular descriptions of those sort of dogs of prodigious strength and size which were employed to hunt and tear down wild beasts to one of these fierce animals he compares hector and one cannot but observe his care not to disgrace his grecian countrymen by an unworthy comparison though he is obliged to represent them flying he makes them fly like lions and as they fly turn frequently back upon their pursuer so that it is hard to say if they or he be in the greater danger on the contrary when any of the grecian heroes pursue the trojans it is he that is the lion and the flyers are but sheep or trembling deer  xxxvii verse     the stubborn god inflexible and hard it must be owned that this speech of minerva against jupiter shocks the allegory more than perhaps any in the poem unless the deities may sometimes be thought to mean no more than beings that presided over those parts of nature or those passions and faculties of the mind thus as venus suggests unlawful as well as lawful desires so minerva may be described as the goddess not only of wisdom but of craft that is both of true and false wisdom so the moral of minervas speaking rashly of jupiter may be that the wisest of finite beings is liable to passion and indiscretion as the commentators have already observed  xxxviii verse   0 what mighty trojan then on yonder shore she means hector whose death the poet makes her foresee is such a lively manner as if the image of the hero lay bleeding before her this picture is noble and agreeable to the observation we formerly made of homers method of prophesying in the spirit of poetry  xxxix verse     floats in rich waves the greek word is  pours the veil on the pavement i must just take notice that here is a repetition of the same beautiful verses which the author had used in the fifth book  xl verse     smooth glides the chariot etc one would almost think homer made his gods and goddesses descend from olympus only to mount again and mount only to descend again he is so remarkably delighted with the descriptions of their horses and their manner of flight we have no less than three of these in the present book  xli verse  00 for juno headstrong and imperious still she claims etc eustathius observes here if a good man does us a wrong we are justly angry at it but if it proceeds from a bad one it is no more than we expected we are not at all surprised and we bear it with patience  there are many such passages as these in homer which glance obliquely at the fair sex and jupiter is here forced to take upon himself the severe husband to teach juno the duty of a wife  xlii verse     but thee what desperate insolence it is observable that homer generally makes his messengers divine as well as human very punctual in delivering their messages in the very words of the persons who commissioned them iris however in the close of her speech has ventured to go beyond her instructions and all rules of decorum by adding these expressions of bitter reproach to a goddess of superior rank the words of the original  are too gross to be literally translated  xliii verse     juno her rage resigned homer never intended to give us the picture of a good wife in the description of juno she obeys jupiter but it is a forced obedience she submits rather to the governor than to the husband and is more afraid of his lightning than his commands  her behavior in this place is very natural to a person under a disappointment she had set her heart upon preferring the greeks but failing in that point she assumes an air of indifference and says whether they live or die she is unconcerned  xliv verse   0 they breathe or perish as the fates ordain the translator has turned this line in compliance to an old observation upon homer which macrobius has written and several others have since fallen into they say he was so great a fatalist as not so much as to name the word fortune in all his works but constantly fate instead of it this remark seems curious enough and indeed does agree with the general tenor and doctrine of this poet but unluckily it is not true the word which they have proscribed being implied in the original of this   0   xlv verse     and fix the car on its immortal base it is remarked by eustathius that the word  signifies not only altars but pedestals or bases of statues etc i think our language will bear this literally though m dacier durst not venture it in the french the solemnity with which this chariot of jupiter is set up by the hands of a god and covered with a fine veil makes it easy enough to imagine that this distinction also might be shown it  xlvi verse     juno and pallas in the beginning of this book juno was silent and minerva replied here says eustathius homer makes juno reply with great propriety to both their characters minerva resents the usage of jupiter but the reverence she bears to her father and her king keeps her silent she has not less anger than juno but more reason minerva there spoke with all the submission and deference that was owing from a child to a father or from a subject to a king but juno is more free with her husband she is angry and lets him know it by the first word she utters  juno here repeats the same words which had been used by minerva to jupiter near the beginning of this book what is there uttered by wisdom herself and approved by him is here spoken by a goddess who as homer tells us at this very time imprudently manifested her passion and whom jupiter answers with anger to deal fairly i cannot defend this in my author any more than some other of his repetitions as when ajax in the fifteenth iliad     uses the same speech word for word to encourage the greeks which agamemnon had made in the fifth     i think it equally an extreme to vindicate all the repetitions of homer and to excuse none however eustathius very ingeniously excuses this by saying that the same speeches become entirely different by the different manner of introducing them minerva addressed herself to jupiter with words full of respect but juno with terms of resentment this says he shows the effect of opening our speeches with art it prejudices the audience in our favor and makes us speak to friends whereas the auditor naturally denies that favor which the orator does not seem to ask so that what he delivers though it has equal merit labors under this disadvantage that his judges are his enemies  xlvii verse   0 nor shall great hector cease etc here says eustathius the poet prepares the reader for what is to succeed he gives us the outlines of his piece which he is to fill up in the progress of the poem this is so far from cloying the readers appetite that it raises it and makes him desirous to see the picture drawn in its full length  xlviii verse   0 ye valiant trojans etc eustathius observes that hector here speaks like a soldier he bears a spear not a scepter in his hand he harangues like a warrior but like a victor he seems to be too much pleased with himself and in this vein of selfflattery he promises a complete conquest over the greeks  xlix verse     and let the matrons i have been more observant of the decorum in this line than my author himself he calls the women  an epithet of scandalous import upon which porphyry and the greek scholiast have said but too much i know no man that has yet had the impudence to translate that remark in regard of which it is politeness to imitate the barbarians and say graecum est non legitur for my part i leave it as a motive to some very curious persons of both sexes to study the greek language  l verse     full hecatombs etc the six lines that follow being a translation of four in the original are added from the authority of plato in mr barnes his edition that author cites them in his second alcibiades there is no doubt of their being genuine but the question is only whether they are rightly placed here i shall not pretend to decide upon a point which will doubtless be the speculation of future critics  li verse     as when the moon etc this comparison is inferior to none in homer it is the most beautiful nightpiece that can be found in poetry he presents you with a prospect of the heavens the seas and the earth the stars shine the air is serene the world enlightened and the moon mounted in glory eustathius remarks that  does not signify the moon at full for then the light of the stars is diminished or lost in the greater brightness of the moon and others correct the word  to  for  but this criticism is forced and i see no necessity why the moon may not be said to be bright though it is not in the full a poet is not obliged to speak with the exactness of philosophy but with the liberty of poetry  lii verse  0  a thousand piles homer in his catalogue of the grecian ships though he does not recount expressly the number of the greeks has given some hints from whence the sum of their army may be collected but in the same book where he gives an account of the trojan army and relates the names of the leaders and nations of the auxiliaries he says nothing by which we may infer the number of the army of the besieged to supply therefore that omission he has taken occasion by this piece of poetical arithmetic to inform his reader that the trojan army amounted to fifty thousand that the assistant nations are to be included herein appears from what dolon says in l  0 that the auxiliaries were encamped that night with the trojans  this passage gives me occasion to animadvert upon a mistake of a modern writer and another of my own the abbe terasson in a late treatise against homer is under a grievous error in saying that all the forces of troy and the auxiliaries cannot be reasonably supposed from homer to be above ten thousand men he had entirely overlooked this place which says there were a thousand fires and fifty men at each of them see my observation on the second book where these fires by a slip of my memory are called funeral piles i should be glad it were the greatest error i have committed in these notes  liii verse  0  the coursers over their heaps of corn i durst not take the same liberty with m dacier who has omitted this circumstance and does not mention the horses at all in the following line the last of the book homer has given to the morning the epithet fairhaired or brightthroned  i have already taken notice in the preface of the method of translating the epithets of homer and must add here that it is often only the uncertainty the moderns lie under of the true genuine signification of an ancient word which causes the many various constructions of it so that it is probable the authors own words at the time he used them never meant half so many things as we translate them into madam dacier generally observes one practice as to these throughout her version she renders almost every such epithet in greek by two or three in french from a fear of losing the least part of its significance this perhaps may be excusable in prose though at best it makes the whole much more verbose and tedious and is rather like writing a dictionary than rendering an author but in verse every reader knows such a redoubling of epithets would not be tolerable a poet has therefore only to choose that which most agrees with the tenor and main intent of the particular passage or with the genius of poetry itself  it is plain that too scrupulous an adherence to many of these gives the translation an exotic pedantic and whimsical air which it is not to be imagined the original ever had to call a hero the great artificer of flight the swift of foot or the horsetamer these give us ideas of little peculiarities when in the authors time they were epithets used only in general to signify alacrity agility and vigor a common reader would imagine from these servile versions that diomed and achilles were footracers and hector a horsecourser rather than that any of them were heroes a man shall be called a faithful translator for rendering  in english swiftfooted but laughed at if he should translate our english word dextrous into any other language righthanded  errata preface page   line    for supply this characters read
