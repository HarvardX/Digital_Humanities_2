person breathing with a long tube  a physical dissertation on drowning  in which submersion commonly called drowning is shown to be a long time consistent with the continuance of life from a variety of unexceptionable though surprising facts related by the most eminent and judicious authors and confirmed by incontestable evidence which facts are reconciled and accounted for from the strictest laws of the animal economy  to which is subjoined the proper measures for recovery and relief the obligations we lie under to practice them are clearly suggested and strongly enforced intended for the good of mankind by restoring life to many persons who are erroneously supposed to be irretrievably drowned recommended particularly to the consideration of the surgeons of the navy and army who have frequent opportunities of practicing the methods recommended  with an appendix containing some methods for the recovery of those who hang themselves and of children supposed to be born dead  by a physician  london printed for jacob robinson at the goldenlion in ludgate street  mdccxlvi  a dissertation on the recovery of persons drowned as truth in general is of the last importance not only in affording a noble and exalted satisfaction to the mind but also in forming the morals and by that means promoting the most valuable interests of society so nothing can be a greater reproach to reason nor a more palpable affront offered to its august and venerable author than that ignoble and unmanly turn of mind commonly known by the name of credulity which is no more than an implicit contempt of reason and all the mental powers producing a propensity to believe certain tenets doctrines or facts without that degree of evidence which a mind studious of truth ought to require  but however odious credulity may appear when painted in her native colors she is nevertheless if we may be allowed the expression a spectre which haunts the various classes and distinctions of mankind under a form so infatuating and alluring as to seduce them from the plain and amiable paths of truth and bewilder them in the dark and gloomy labyrinths of ignorance error and confusion this deplorable observation is in no instance more effectually verified than in these very men who profess a sacred veneration for reason and pretend to go wherever truth shall conduct them for we frequently find not only ancient but also modern philosophers and physicians laboring with a pompous show of learning and ratiocination to prove that nature by her stated and established laws was capable of producing certain effects which time has afterward discovered never to have had any existence except in the imaginations of the credulous or in the chimerical works of authors who forsaking fact and nature have given a full scope to their fancy and invention thus in former ages it was keenly disputed how it came about that a small fish called the remora was capable of putting a speedy stop to a ship under fullsail but this pretended fact has by later and more penetrating naturalists been discovered to be absolutely false and no doubt the ever memorable rabbitwoman of godalmin would have made a considerable figure in the annals of the royal society and afforded matter to the members for copious dissertations on the force of imagination if she had prudently ceased breeding a day sooner this bad piece of conduct has however thrown an almost irreparable disgrace upon natural knowledge by inducing the sober and judicious part of mankind to imagine that it was totally employed in explaining visions and chimeras therefore if we intend to philosophise in such a manner as not to disgrace philosophy we must have facts duly ascertained before we attempt to explain and account for them since according to kercher in his mund subterran lib  0 it is as absurd in physical matters to philosophise without experience as it is for a blind man to pretend to judge of colors  though from what has been said it sufficiently appears that credulity is fatal to truth yet we observe in the minds of some men an arrogant and presumptuous skepticism which admitting nothing but what is easy to the conception of its possessors is no less prejudicial to the genuine interest of science and philosophy for as by the former we are exposed to the danger of adopting error as well as truth so by the latter our minds are as it were manacled and hindered from giving a rational assent to things and facts clothed with the most striking and distinguished characters of evidence for no other reason than that we cannot comprehend them it is for instance a culpable diffidence to disbelieve the possibility of a persons retaining a latent principle of life after he has remained some hours days and even weeks under water since numerous facts related by the best authors vouched by the most candid witnesses and recorded in the public archives of the most penetrating and sagacious nations concur to remove the smallest remains of uncertainty in this point besides i would have the gentlemen of this class remember that their conduct bespeaks an insupportable degree of pride and amounts to a formal declaration that they themselves are blessed with geniuses far superior to others since nothing can be true but what is comprehensible by the vast extent of their capacities and though modesty and commonsense should not direct them to this observation yet what the world calls moral evidence stands upon foundations too stable and sure to be shaken by their frivolous conceits or illgrounded remonstrances in a word the wise and thinking part of mankind will always be induced to give their assent to facts seen by a sufficient number of witnesses who have sense enough to guard against imposture themselves and honesty enough to say nothing but what is truth to their neighbors all these advantageous circumstances attend the following narrations which for the common benefit of mankind have been collected from authors of the greatest veracity in order to show that there is often a possibility of restoring drowned persons to life after vulgar prejudice and a want of sufficiently extensive views with respect to the laws of the animal economy have laid a foundation for concluding them irretrieveably dead and past all hopes of recovery  dr bruhier an eminent physician of paris well known to the learned world and highly esteemed for his knowledge in his profession about three years ago published a treatise on the uncertain signs of death tending to prove that many people are interred before they are really dead and that there are frequent instances of persons who have lived many days without respiration or any other apparent signs of life this doctrine he establishes by many incontestable histories of people who have actually survived their funerals and lived many years after they had been buried upon a supposition that they were actually dead hence he very judiciously infers that it is not imprudent but inhuman to suffer the interment of our friends and relations before we are convinced from the most evident marks that they are certainly and irrecoverably deceased or till such time as the beginning of putrefaction convinces us that no hopes remain of a revival  in confirmation of what this celebrated physician has advanced many examples might be found in our own country which escaped his researches and no doubt it happens much more frequently than is generally imagined especially in hysterical women in those who have contracted a habit of drinking spirituous liquors to excess but particularly in those who have been guilty for so i cannot forbear calling it of taking frequent doses of opium or its preparations so as to render life insupportable without them of which there are too many instances  this doctrine however true is not altogether modern for we learn from diogenes laertius that the celebrated empedocles acquired uncommon honor by restoring a woman to life who was thought to be dead many days and whose disorder he discovered to be only a strangulation of the uterus that is an hysteric fit  we learn farther that heraclides of pontus a noted philosopher wrote a treatise upon this very subject which he entitled  of the distemper in which the patient is deprived of respiration in this he asserted that the disorder might continue thirty days during which there was no respiration or any other signs of life without any marks of putrefaction and that notwithstanding the patient might at last recover  in consequence of the frequent interments of people before they were really dead dr bruhier in      published a small pamphlet containing proposals for the regulation of funerals and the prevention of such calamitous disasters which he endeavors to have confirmed by the legislature for says he how many women weary of their husbands and husbands equally weary of their wives how many children who have either a real or an imaginary reason to be dissatisfied with their parents and especially how many covetous and necessitous heirs who have long waited for the happy moment which was to put him in possession of an opulent fortune may not abuse the liberty the law affords them of burying their friends at the end of twentyfour hours at which time they may possibly be really alive and capable of a recovery and to prove this regulation the more necessary he relates the following histories  a woman about eighty years old being taken for dead was about to be laid out as such when a person who had perused his treatise opposed the design next morning the woman was found recovered from her profound syncope which considering the intense cold of the season had probably proved a real cause of her death had she been taken out of her bed  it is also sufficiently known that cardinal spicsa first minister to the king of spain being supposed dead and committed to a surgeon in order to be embalmed thrust away the hand which conducted the fatal instrument which put a real end to his life but notwithstanding this accident the barbarous surgeon proceeded to finish the operation  but as submersion or drowning is the subject of our present enquiry i shall only farther take notice of the histories relating thereto  the celebrated kunckel in ephemerid not curios informs us that a young man had the misfortune to fall from a boat into the water and sunk to the very bottom about fifteen hundred paces from the shore which he did not reach till two hours after however as it is natural for persons to give an account of the several circumstances attending their respective states of calamity and distress the young man informed those who had the curiosity to enquire into his condition during that time that whilst he was making the most strenuous efforts to preserve his life he thought of nothing but god and the means of recommending himself to his favor and acceptance that the voice of his darling sister who wept bitterly on the shore for the fate of her brother had served to conduct him to the land that the disturbance of the water by those who sought for him and the lamentations of the people on the shore were not only distinctly heard by him but also proved extremely shocking and uneasy to him that he thought his respiration was carried on without his knowing in what manner that the water had not penetrated into any of the cavities of his body and that he was hot instead of being cold  the same judicious author informs us that he had an opportunity of examining a fisherman who fell from a boat into the same place and was by means of the ice kept under water for three days but upon his being found appeared full of vigor said that he enjoyed good health and affirmed that the most remarkable circumstance of which he had been conscious was that a large bladder had been formed around his head for his preservation  the memorable accident which befell the swiss diver is so well attested and accompanied with such a peculiar train of circumstances that it cannot fail to make the most lively impressions upon every person capable of the smallest degree of reflection as necessity lays a foundation for industry which frequently cannot be employed but in a manner which is either prejudicial to health or fatal to life so this adventurous man followed the business of plunging into the water and searching those holes in which he imagined the larger and better sort of fishes were lodged accordingly being employed as dr bruhier relates the story to furnish a dish of fish for a company who intended to regale themselves with a fine dinner he cheerfully undertook the task his employers in the mean time accompanied him to the brink of the river and seeing him plunge into the water retired not in the least doubting but he would keep his word the swiss however happening not to bring the fish at the hour appointed the company when the afternoon was pretty far advanced went to the banks of the river in order to know the reason of their disappointment as the clothes of the diver lay on the riverside so they soon suspected his deplorable fate and accordingly ordered him to be searched for with hooks in the place into which they had seen him plunge the efforts for this purpose were not in vain for he was at last found and taken out of the water though wounded in several parts  as this unfortunate man had been under water for nine hours so the curate of the place whose profession called for some care of a person in such a situation had a mind that he should be forthwith interred and he had been infallibly committed to the grave had not the celebrated mr egly a member of the royal academy of inscriptions who observed a kind of ebullition in the water discharged from his mouth positively affirmed that he was not dead for that gentleman justly ascribed this ebullition to the languid and imperceptible remains of respiration  this conduct of mr egly however uncommon yet made so deep an impression upon the spectators that they carried the unfortunate diver into an adjacent house where having laid him out at full length they compressed his abdomen in order to procure a discharge of the water he had swallowed by this means having in three quarters of an hour evacuated a considerable quantity of water he moved one of his legs a circumstance which sufficiently evinced that he still retained some faint remains of life for this reason he was by mr eglys orders wrapped up in warm sheets and gradually reftored to a natural heat then being laid in a warm bed and his life becoming gradually more conspicuous a liberal venesection was made which was succeeded by a sigh then by a slight knowledge of what had befallen him and soon after by a total restitution of health and though gratitude is rarely to be met with in the breasts of the vulgar yet this important service ever after touched the heart of the swiss with the highest and most lively sense of the obligations he lay under to mr egly  mr durham a gentleman sufficiently celebrated for his untainted integrity and extensive learning in his physicotheology quotes the following history from pechlinus an author of no less candor and reputation  about eighteen years ago a gardner of fronningholm now sixtyfive years old and sufficiently vigorous and robust for a person of that age made a generous attempt to rescue an unfortunate neighbor who had fallen into the water but being too foolhardy he ventured upon the ice which broke and let him fall into the river which at that part was eighteen else in depth he went perpendicularly to be bottom in which his feet stuck for sixteen hours before he was found he himself says that he was no sooner under water than he became rigid and lost not only the power of motion but also all his senses except that of hearing which was affected by the ringing of some bells at stockholm he at first also perceived a kind of bladder before his mouth which hindered the ingress of the water by that passage though it entered freely into his ears and produced a dullness of hearing for some time after this unfortunate man was in vain sought for during sixteen hours at the end of which time he was taken up by means of an hook fixed in his head and upon his total recovery said that he was sensible of that particular part of his fate however whether from the prevailing custom of the country or the persuasion of particular persons certain attempts were made in order to restore him to life for this purpose he was wrapped up in blankets lest the air entering too precipitately into his lungs should prove fatal to him in this condition being gradually warmed by means of sheets he was rubbed and stimulated till the motion of his blood which had been checked for so many hours returned at last he was totally restored by means of cordials and antiapoplectic liquors he as yet bears the mark of the hook and says that he is still subject to violent headachs this singular accident attested by the oaths of persons who had been eyewitnesses to it induced the queen to give him an annual pension and he was introduced to the prince in order to give an account of what had befallen him  the celebrated pechlinus has wrote the history of a woman who remaining under water for three whole days was happily restored to life almost in the same manner as the gardner this fact was so notorious that the learned tilasius library keeper to the king of sweden and in whose time the woman was still alive gave the following certificate of it which is still kept in the archives of the acad nature curios  there lately was in dalia commonly called wormsland a woman of the name of margaret larsdotter who having the misfortune to be thrice drowned remained the first time she being then young for three whole days under water but the two other times had more speedy relief afforded her she died in      in the seventyfifth year of her age telasius  though this accident and the delivery from it happening so many different times to the same person may be some be looked upon as fabulous and romantic yet upon the whole it appears to be clothed with the most genuine character of truth and evidence for is it credible that a man of probity candor and learning as we may readily suppose the librarian of a rich and powerful monarch to be should in a manner so positive and circumstantial dare to affirm a fact which was only suspect and much less one that was absolutely false is it probable that a man of pechlinuss character who is no less universally than justly applauded for his extensive erudition and consummate medicinal knowledge should compose an elaborate treatise in order to explain the possibility of this fact without taking due pains to have its reality sufficiently confirmed and ascertained or in a word is it to be supposed that this physician who was looked upon as the glory and ornament of the swedish nation should have the impudence to appeal to all the literati of sweden for the truth of a fact which had not the sanction of sufficient evidences why should we be more scrupulous than pechlinuss contemporary authors who never called the truth of this fact in questions the celebrated bartholin in act med haffn tom   obs    speaks of it in the following manner i can by no means remain diffident with respect to the truth of a story confirmed by the concurring testimonies of so many witnesses of candor and veracity and of which pechlinus has demonstrated the possibility by other examples of a similar nature i am only surprised that so singular a narrative should be so long buried in oblivion in a nation otherwise so curious and fond of discoveries  but we shall have no manner of reason to doubt of this fact recorded by pechlinus when we reflect that other celebrated physicians and philosophers assure us of the truth of other accidents highly similar and analogous to it thus alexander benedicius lib x cap   speaks in the following manner life has been frequently seen restored to persons who have remained under water during fortyeight hours the same author for this very reason thinks it highly improper to inter drowned and hysteric patients till seventytwo hours after their supposed death borelli in cant   obs   informs us that a certain person of distinction having remained for a long time under the water was taken for dead when he was found but proper efforts being made to restore his life he was roused from his supposed death and long survived his misfortune besides the credibility of the fact told by pechlinus is sufficiently confirmed by the suffrage of the learned and judicious zacchias who in his   th consultation wrote in order to determine whether the return of life to a young man who had remained an hour under water was miraculous and as some superstitious people would have it to be ascribed to a person of superior sanctity speaks in the following manner this event is so far from being miraculous that it can hardly come under the denomination of surprising since vast numbers of persons have returned to life after having been drowned or suffocated in any other manner not only for some hours but also during one and even three whole days because the suppression of respiration in the water had occasioned an oppression of the spirits and had brought on an apoplectic paroxysm which rendered them apparently dead though their lives were really preserved by transpiration which augmenting gradually laid a foundation for a free respiration  the possibility of retaining a principle of life for a long time under water is still more surprisingly confirmed by kunckel in miscellan not curios decad   an   and   obs    where he speaks in the following manner i am sufficiently sensible that in sweden no one doubts of the possibility of retaining life under water for eight days and that the sollowing accident is by no means called in question by those who live near the place where it happened some time ago about four leagues from the town of falung a painter fell from a boat into the water in such a manner as to remain upright with his feet at the bottom he was in vain searched for during eight days at the end of which time he appeared alive on the surface of the water the magistrate and clergyman of the place asked him the following questions whether he had respird all the time of his submersion to which he answered he knew nothing of the matter whether he had thought upon god and recommended his soul to him to which he replied very often whether he could see and hear to which he answered yes and said that he would often have laid hold of the hooks employed in finding him if he could have moved his arms he also added that the fish proved highly offensive and uneasy to him by the attacks they made on his eyes and being asked by what means he guarded against these attacks he answered by moving his eyelids as to his sense of hearing he affirmed that nothing wrs more ungrateful and even painful to him than striking the surface of the water and that in a particular manner he was affected with a violent pain of his ears which was forthwith communicated to his whole body every time people came to draw water in buckets when he was asked whehe had been sensible of hunger and discharged his excrements he replied that he had not being interrogated whether he had slept he answered he knew nothing of it but believed he had because he was some time deprived of all sensation and reflection adding that all the thoughts he remembered to have passed in his breast had only god and the means of his own deliverance for their objects  the nature and circumstances of the accident now related lay a sufficient foundation for our believing the following memorable event especially as it happened to a person of distinction and is attested as authentic by men of learning and probity  gocellinus a young man and nephew to one of the archbishops of cologne had the misfortune to fall into the rhine and was not found for fifteen days after and being laid in an adjacent church in order to be interred soon returned to life and survived the accident a long time  as there are a great many secret things in nature and probably numberless latent circumstances in the animal economy with which we are entirely unacquainted and as persons of a curious and attentive turn of mind daily observe accidents which they before thought impossible so we have no reason to doubt of surprising facts related by men of learning and candor nor formally to deny the truth of events which at first appear incredible of this kind is the following narrative  the celebrated mr burmann assures us that in boness of pithovia he heard a funeral sermon preached upon the death of one laurence jones a man of seventy years of age who as the preacher said was drowned when sixteen years old and continued seven weeks under water notwithstanding which he returned to life and enjoyed good health however visionary and romantic this accident may appear in the eyes of those who pretend to have divested their minds of vulgar errors yet it has met with credit from the most penetrating and sagacious authors who lived at the time in which it happened thus the learned and judicious langelott in miscellan nature curios decad   an   obs  0 not being able to conceive how a person can preserve a principle of life so long without the assistance of the air in waters so cold and full of nitre as those of sweden and not being satisfied with similar accidents daily happening to some birds and infects is yet so far from doubting of the truth of this accident that he applies to the learned members of the acad nature curios for their opinion and explication of it by which means he imagined that effectual measures for restoring many drowned persons might be discovered besides it is by no means probable that a man of mr burmanns veracity would forge such a story in order to see what enormous lengths credulity was capable of carrying his fellow creatures nor is it possible that the clergyman should from the pulpit assert this fact as true if it had not really been so since laurence jones was a native of the place and well known to every one of his audience  but upon the whole granting that this narrative of laurence jones was false which however we have no reason to believe yet the recital of it has a great tendency not only to illustrate our subject but also to produce happy effects in life for  st it is certainly the genuine and uncontroverted interest of the public to be apprizd of the possibility of a persons retaining a principle of life for a long time under water  dly the conclusion to be drawn from this seemingly miraculous effect is that if after a long time a body is taken out of the water without the signs of putrefaction it is the duty of those who find such a body to treat it as if there were still a possibility of restoring it to life and  dly if it is certain from uncontroverted facts that persons have retained life under water for several days there is no reason from the laws of the animal economy and the hitherto known properties of the animal fluids to disbelieve that the like should happen to persons who have also remained under water for several weeks  as our modesty ought always to be proportioned to the difficult and intricate natures of the subjects we pretend to consider so we frankly acknowledge that these and other similar accidents as it were bewilder the mind and perplex the most penetrating capacities when they attempt to account for them since we have never yet discovered wherein the constituent principle of life exactly consists and since there are various properties both of the solids and fluids of the human body to which we are entire strangers some however affirm that a principle of life may in the deplorable state of submersion be retained for a long time because the coldness of the water renders the circulation slower and suppersses the transpiration of the vital air contained in the blood whilst at the same time some portions of the air lodged in the water probably penetrate into the bodies of such persons but platerus and bartholin seem to account in a more rational and satisfactory manner for phenomenon of this kind the former of these authors in explaining how a woman who was drowned in the rhine for murdering her own child returned to life after she was found affirms that this accident was the effect of a syncope in which respiration and the motion of the heart are stopped now it is certain from experience and observation that these two functions may be supperessd without the actual loss of life as is frequently obvious in violent syncopes and hysteric paroxysms from which the patients do not often recover in an hour or more during which time the slightest indications of life by the pulse and respiration are not to be observed  if any one should say that it bespeaks an unpardonable excess of credulity to believe that a syncope may last for a week or longer and that consequently the motion of the heart and pulse may be for that time suspended without necessarily producing death we may justly reply that hitherto no person has discovered wherein the essence and principle of life consists and that there are in nature various phenomenon which seem to prove that the motion of the heart and the circulation of the humors are rather palpable signs of the existence of life than its proximate and immediate causes this doctrine we shall endeavor to establish in a strictly analogical manner by comparing those events which happen to vegetables and the brute creation with similar accidents which befall mankind  for this purpose we shall first consider the state and condition of such plants as retain a principle of life and vegetation during the whole winter all the difference according to pechlinus between these and the plants of the animal kind is that in the latter the principle of motion is weaker and the texture of the fibers less firm whereas the former contain a much larger quantity of oil and have the spirit subservient to their vegetation repelled by the cold to the bulbs roots and seeds where it circulates in a languid manner without having force to propel buds flowers and blossoms till the kind and genial hears of the spring render it more powerful and active why may we not therefore suppose that something analogous to this may happen in some human bodies who have been under the water for some time  this is not the only instance in nature which we can bring in confirmation of our doctrine for certain insects pass the whole winter in chrysalides or considerably hard pellicules without discovering the smallest signs of life though it is certain they are not dead since a small degree of heat only is requisite to produce their last metamorphosis the reason of this apparent death is the cold of the atmosphere so inspissating their fluids as that they can only circulate in a faint and languid manner round an highly minute and small center the degree of fluidity which they retain is however so considerable that a more intense cold than we perceive on the earth is incapable of totally coagulating them as is sufficiently evinced by the curious experiments of mr reaumur  this phenomenon is not only observed in the chrysalides of insects but the seminal principle is also preserved free from coagulation and without discovering the smallest sign of life in eggs which may be considered as the chrysalides or pellicules of animals whose life is perceptible aquatic insects also plunge themselves into the mud where they remain without motion till the spring which holds equally true of frogs and toads according to valentinus in dissert epistol   the like happens to some terrestrial insects for mr reaumur has by experiment and observation sufficiently evinced that ants during the whole winter remain apparently dead till the approach of the spring  a third and more powerful collateral proof of this doctrine is drawn from the consideration of some animals whole blood is warm and circulates in the same manner with that of the human species since in these also the circulation and respiration are suppressed during the winter but return in the spring  thus of swallows it may be said that during one half of the year they are dead and the other alive olaus magnus and scheffer in a letter wrote to hevelius affirm that in some northerly countries it is very common for fishermen to find in the water large clusters of swallows which in the beginning of the autumn had thus pild themselves up those authors also inform us that some species of swallows spontaneously seek a refuge in the waters others take their flight to foreign climates others conceal themselves in the holes of old and decayed buildings in the sand and in their own nests and that others finding a decay of strength in their passage to other countries plunge themselves into the sea where they remain till the genial spring rouses their latent principle of life and motion  the celebrated kircher in mund subterran lib   sect   informs us that the inhabitants of peloponesus and other territories of the archipelago have told him that every year they observed large quantities of storks and swallows flying through their countries from egypt and the coasts of lybia and that these latter when fatigued with flying placed themselves to the number of five or six on the back of a stork whom they recompensed by an uninterrupted and melodious song there are therefore continues the author some swallows which fly from one country to another but it is equally certain from experience that the swallows of cold climates make no such voyages but during the winter conceal themselves in caves lakes rivers seas and the cavities of trees  olaus magnus in lib    chap  0 informs us that such swallows as are taken out of the water before the due time do not live long and adds that the inhabitants of tivoli when showing him mount scisso which name it receives from a foolish report of its being divided at the crucifixion of our savior assured him that in the winterseason large quantities of swallows apparently dead were to be found on it whereas no such animals are to be found there in summer he then quotes cysatus who in his description of switzerland affirms that about christmas some workmen when digging up the earth for laying the foundation of a public edifice found a subterraneous cave from which flew about twenty or more swallows whence the author concludes that all these birds do not pass the sea at their disappearance but that some retire into the cavities of mountains others in hollowtrees but that this most frequently happens in northerly climates  fortunus licetus in tr de feriis altric animal disp    affirms that in upper poland every person may be experimentally convinced that the same swallows which in summer build their nests upon the tops of houses toward the end of september plunge themselves into ditches and rivers where they remain concealed till about the middle of may he also informs us that when the inhabitants seeing fish through the ice break it in order to catch them they also frequently find clusters of swallows adhering to each other without discovering the smallest signs of life till they are brought to a stove where they soon return to life but what is still more remarkable is that as soon as the polanders who imagine it unlawful to kill these swallows set them at liberty they forthwith fly back to the water and plunge themselves into it  the celebrated huet archbishop of avranches who traveled through sweden informs us that between caen and the sea along the shore of the river orne there are many caves in which during the winter have been found large clusters of swallows suspended like so many bunches of grapes and that the like was long ago observed in italy for pedo albinovanus in the elegy he composed on the death of mecaenas speaks of the retreat of the swallows to the rocks as an infallible sign of the approach of winter  congelantur aquae scopulis se condit hirundo verberat egeledas garrula vere lacus bodin quoted by camerarius cant   hist    informs us in the second book of his theater of nature that when the people who inhabit the coasts of the baltic sea are employed among the rocks in searching for yellow amber they frequently find large clusters of swallows camerarius subjoins that some authors affirm that swallows conceal themselves in the bottom of the sea where they sleep till the appearance of a proper season for their quitting it but this is impossible since they have lungs and for that reason must necessarily perish in such a condition but however specious and conclusive this reasoning of camerarius may appear yet it is certain that the truth of facts which have actually happened can never be invalidated  franciseus de frankenau in his medicinal satyrs confirms this opinion with respect to swallows by the authorities of lauremberg in acer philol lib   cap    of isaac vossius in his append de lucis nature cap   of deusingius in vindict faet sect   and of fournier in his geography who in part   lib   cap   informs us that they are commonly found in the norwegianseas as also in the lakes and rivers of silesia poland bohemia and moravia and that in the beginning of the autumn large numbers of them plunge themselves into wells the same author also establishes his own opinion by the additional suffrages of cromerus in hist polon lib   of hevelius of marcellus donatus in hist med memorab lib   cap    and of helvicius in his epigrams  the celebrated mr falconet whose judgment and veracity render his single word a sufficient evidence informs us that being in the house of a gentleman of breast in the winter season he saw a servant bring in a kind of mass or lump which appeared to be earth and which some fishermen had caught in their nets by washing it carefully in order to discover what it was it was found to be a group of swallows which resumed life by being exposed to the fire for some time  swallows are not the only birds which conceal themselves in the bottoms of rivers in order to pass the winter for john baptiste de fulgosa formerly doge of genoa affirms that gervas tibellerius wrote to otho the fourth that some persons having thrown their nets into a river of that country in the winter time they brought to land a large quantity of storks which were apparently dead with their beaks fixed in each others fundament but they were soon restored to life by means of heat the same author adds that in      near metz in lorrain a large number of apparently dead storks were found in a river and that being put into a warm bath they recovered life  the learned vossius in append de lucis nature informs us that at the approach of winter storks herons and some other birds of the like nature do not fly to egypt or into more temperate climates but plunge themselves into ditches and marshes  the possibility of retaining life for a long time under water is still farther evinced by considering those birds with which our fields and forests are richly stocked in summer but which are not to be seen in winter if it should be said that these during the winter live upon the stores they have amassed in the summer i answer that they are by no means provident against future want hence they must necessarily conceal themselves in places suited to their particular natures and as it is equally impossilble for them as for the human species to live awake without aliments it is more than probable that during the whole winter they are as it were locked up in so lethargic a sleep that they sustain no loss or dissipation of their fluids and consequently require no reparation  if it should be asked whether these animals during such a state retain a real principle of life i answer that the thing is not only probable but may be also evinced from fact and experience since the most celebrated natural historians and physicians give us strong and uncontroverted instances of this kind thus in ephemerid not curios we are informed that a certain gentleman in the winter season ordered an hollow trunk of a sallow tree which by his direction had been cut down the preceding autumn to be laid on the fire but a small portion of it happening to be left in a corner of the room he had the curiosity to examine it and upon his doing so found feathers arrangd and disposed in a natural manner these he gently plucked off and underneath found the flesh of a small bird which he believed to be dead though he could not discover to what species it belonged however with respect to this circumstance he was soon undeceived for having exposed it to the influence of the fire it soon discovered palpable signs of life something similar and analogous to this no doubt happens with respect to many of those quadrupeds which inhabit our forests for want of a nourishment proper to give their blood that degree of fluidity which is absolutely necessary to its circulation since it is certain that a far smaller number is to be seen in winter than in summer  after these examples of an apparent death in birds whose blood is warm we have no reason to be surpised at pechlinus when he affirms that in the winter time fishes not only appear dead but are consequently covered over with a crust of ice in their holes without having the vital principle destroyed in them for they begin to live afresh when the heat of the atmosphere or an artificial fire melts the ice the like continues the author happens to serpents toads frogs tortoises and in a word all amphibious animals when the cold inspissates their juices which being naturally viscid are consequently more proper to prevent the dissipation of that vital spirit which is absolutely necessary to restore them to life  it is to be observed that those fishes which have been thus frozen do not long survive their artificial restitution to life because the frost having altered the principles of their blood the vital spirit when beginning to act and unfold itself can no longer form a mass of fluids of an uniform nature thus wine when frozen and artificially thawed contracts a disagreeable flavor because the solution being procured in an unnatural manner hinders the spirituous part of the wine from mixing with its other principles in the same order and proportion as before  what pechlinus advances with respect to fishes is entirely conformable to the opinion of theophrastus in tr de piscibus in siceo degeritibus where we are informed that the inhabitants of pontus frequently find fishes in the ice which discover no signs either of motion or sensation till they are put into a fishback or laid among straw this circumstance according to theophrastus happens particularly to the gudgeon and some other fishes of a similar nature  the last proof of the possibility of a persons retaining a principle of life for a long time under water without a supply of aliments for the purposes of nutrition is drawn from a consideration of some quadaupeds as the hedgehog the marmotte the dormouse and some others which in the beginning of winter concealing themselves in the earth are seized with so profound a sleep that they appear to be dead since neither the pulsation of their arteries nor their respiration are perceptible this circumstance no doubt induced the celebrated harvey in lib de generat animal exercit  0 to speak in the following manner some sanguineous animals live long without any pulse and lie concealed during the whole of the winter notwithstanding which they remain alive though their heart retains no motion and their respiration stops just as it happens to persons attacked with sincopes and hysteric fits whose pulse is totally abolished though harvey was the glorious discoverer of the circulation of the blood and may for that reason be supposed to be a keen advocate in its behalf yet it is sufficiently obvious from this passage that he did not believe it absolutely necessary to the preservation of life but pechlinus whether from prejudice or rational deductions from what he had observed is of opinion that in these animals respiration is carried on by a motion of the diaphragm so insensible as to escape the eye of the observer he also observes that in this state it is necessary their respiration should be such because if it was performed in the usual manner the motion of the blood would be so likewise in consequence of which the transpiration and necessity for aliments would be equally strong a circumstance incompatible with the condition of these animals which lie hid under the earth during the whole winter  though these relations may possibly appear very singular and surprising to persons unacquainted with natural history yet they infallibly prove that in the brute creation at least respiration the circulation of the blood and pulsation of the arteries may cease for a long time without the total extinction and destruction of life now is it not highly probable or rather absolutely certain that something similar and analogous to this may happen to human creatures who have the misfortune to be drowned since in both the solids and fluids act and move by the same laws so in both suffocation must be the same thing and consequently its effects removed by the same means  besides there is by no means any reason for believing that an instance of this surprsing abstinence and want of food prodncd by such a profound and lethargic sleep as that of the marmotte is not to be found among the human species for in miscellan academ nature curios an   obs    the celebrated ludovicus first physician to the duke of saxegotha informs us that a young girl who for some fault she had committed being apprehensive of a severe chastisement from her parents retired to the most concealed part of a thicket where seven days after her elopement she was found lying on her belly with all the apparent signs of death except that her limbs were still flexible and pliant her visage was overspread with a viscid phlegm which was covered with an hoary kind of down and with the falling leaves which had adhered to it her mouth and nostrils were entirely full of a thick mucus but notwithstanding these seemingly discouraging circumstances the physician called to her assistance ordered her body to be warmed by means of friction then with warm water washing away the phlegm which covered her face and the viscid mucus which obstructed her mouth and nostrils he poured into her mouth a spoonful of brandy which seemed to go down her throat and was the only cordial he had at hand upon exhibiting a second spoonful she fetched a sigh and a third made her open her eyes  we now proceed to consider the most proper and efficacious measure to be taken for the relief of drowned persons for which purpose we shall previously investigate and ascertain the genuine cause of suffocation  not only the ancient schools of greece and arabia but also most of the succeeding physicians till the days of platerus imagined that the suffocation was produced by the water which entered into the stomach breast and lungs in consequence of which false notion they thought themselves fully authorized to attempt its discharge with all possible expedition for this purpose they ordered drowned persons to be suspended by the feet or laid upon their bellies on a hogshead or tub which was to be agitated from one side to the other imagining that by this position the abdomen and breast being compressed and the head hanging down the agitation of the vessel must necessarily facilitate the evacuation of the water which they supposed was also favored by the declining situation of the superior part of the body with the same intention they also ordered such measures as had a tendency to excite vomiting  but as a false theory never fails to lay a foundation for a dangerous practice so we have just reason to condemn this method of suspension or hanging by the heels for the water swallowed by drowning persons descends into the stomach and not into the thorax so that it cannot prevent their recovery this circumstance must happen not only so long as a person retains a sense of his state and condition but also afterward for as the water is hindered from entering into the arteria trachaea and lungs by a mechanical effort in which reason has no share so the lungs may in this state be compared to an empty bottle plunged in water into which the fluid does not enter because the air it contains resists its access and this the rather happens because the motion of the breast destined to attract the air at that time totally ceases and consequently nothing forces the water to enter and fill up its place this doctrine is not only evinced from the structure of the parts but also confirmed by experience  thus the learned platerus in quest   positively affirms that if drowned persons swallow any water the quantity of it is too small to prove mortal to them because he always found but very little of it in their stomachs he also adds that most of the water which appears to be discharged from the mouths of persons suspended by the heels really flowed from their clothes  nymman in tr de vita foet in utero speaks thus who could believe that a foetus so long included in the uterus where it moves all its limbs should yet never move its jaw bone nor open its mouth besides it always has its nostrils open notwithstanding which it has never been observed that the liquor of the amnios has entered its body thus it is with the human foetus as with those who are drowned since in dissecting many of these last i have hardly found a pint of water in their bodies  in the miscellan not curios an   obs     wepfer gives an account of the anatomy of some beavers one of which was drowned the author having opened the arteria trachaea no water was discharged from the lungs but there were about four ounces of water like the washings of flesh found in the right cavity of the breast and about three ounces of the same kind in the left this extravasation the author justly supposes produced by the expression of a bloody lymph from the pores of the bronchia of this animal which had for a long time struggled against so violent a death as that of drowning neither pure water nor water tinged with blood were observed either in the arteria trachaea or in the bronchia  bhonius in the appendix to his treatise de renuntiat vuln diss   informs us that in dissecting a great many women drowned for murdering their children he had shown the spectators that there was little or no water in their lungs and abdomen and adds that in order to render himself more certain with respect to this circumstance he had drowned several animals in whose cavities though drowned alive he had never perceived any water  dethardingius at present professor of medicine in coppenhagen in a letter wrote when he was professor at rostoch in      gives us an account of the dissection of a soldier who attempting to make his escape from a garrison was drowned in a ditch and upon being opened had in his stomach only about a pint of beer which he had drank some time before the professor took care previously to apprise the spectators that there would not be a single drop of water in his breast which as well as his abdomen was very much elevated and the event verified the prediction  johannes conradus becker in his treatise de submers mort sin pot aq gives us the four following histories a dog says he being drowned and lying in the water for an hour his abdomen stomach and intestines appeared tumified and inflated though a single drop of water was not found in them the lungs were also inflated without containing water like those of hanged persons but immediately collapsd upon suffering the air to escape through an incision made in the arteria traehaea the author subjoins that this observation rendered the doctrine of the ancients highly suspected by him  the second is the history of a peasant taken from the water after he had been some weeks in it and was entirely putrified after opening his duodenum two ligatures were made on that intestine which was very much inflated and from the aperture of which nothing was discharged but a liquor which was chyle mixed with beer of which the peasant had at a market drank so liberally as to intoxicate himself the tumefaction of the stomach laid a foundation for suspecting that it contained a large quantity of water though upon laying it open nothing was found but a pint of a liquor whose smell exactly resembled that of beer the lungs were so much inflated that when an incision was made in the breast they burst out but their inflation was speedily dissipated by making an aperture in the arteria trachea through which the air was discharged with a considerable noise in cutting the lungs into pieces no extraordinary signs of humidity were perceived nor were any preternatural circumstances observed except spots of different colors  the third history is that of a woman drowned in a well in whose intestines nothing but chyle was discovered neither was there any water in the lungs the intestines collapsd upon making a small puncture in them and an aperture being made in the arteria trachea the air escaped through it from the lungs with some noise  the fourth and last history related by becker is that of a man who was found standing upright in a basin where he had remained under water for five days his stomach which was large was only inflated with wind and hardly contained six ounces of a whitish liquor the lungs being equally inflated collapsd upon cutting the arteria trachea from which the air was discharged with a considerable noise when he was found two spoonfuls of water were not discharged from his mouth he was however continues becker every where surrounded with water but that element notwithstanding the minuteness of its parts could not penetrate into the arteria trachea and oesophagus in order to fill the cavities of the viscera an evident proof that these parts were so defended against every thing that made an attempt to enter them that the water itself could not force a passage into them  from these observations the celebrated author concludes that the absence of water in the lungs and intestines is not a proof that a person has been thrown into the water after his death this observation is of the last importance to those whose business it is to make reports before courts of judicature though it is contrary to that of rodericus a castro adopted by many philologists and criminalists and among others by feltman in tr de cadavero inspiciendo cap    but as in the opinion of becker the lungs are not inflated in those who are thrown into the water after death so we may from their inflation draw a proof that the person was alive when drowned or put into the water  since therefore it is sufficiently obvious both from the structure of the parts and the authorities of the most penetrating anatomists that little or no water enters the bodies of drowned persons so it is equally obvious that the practice of hanging by the heels is not only useless but must also contribute to destroy those remains of life which may possibly be lost for by such a suspension the whole column of the blood conveyed to the heart by the inferior vena cava will necessarily press upon that conveyed by the superior vena cava where the blood being interrupted in its course must necessarily regurgitate into the jugular veins and consequently into the head where by its quantity and weight it retards the motion of the spirits whose free progress is absolutely necessary to restore the circulation of the blood on which life in a great measure depends  as it is of great importance to know the cause of the inflation of drowned persons since it is not produced by the water they swallow so the learned dethardingius accounts for it in the following manner those says he who die in the water are not destroyed for want of air but by means of too large a quantity of it they do not die in expiration but in inspiration and in a word nothing more resembles each inspiration than the phenomenon observed in drowned persons for if we attentively consider what happens to ourselves we perceive that the breast is as it were lengthened the abdomen elevated and the flanks inflated and that this state subsists so long as we draw in the air or retain it in the breast now the same things happen in drowned persons only with this difference that in the latter the inspiration is performed with rapidity and violence whereas in the former it is carried on quietly and without any effort in persons not drowned a depression succeeds the elevation but in drowned persons the elevation of the abdomen and the elongation of the breast subsist by which means all the parts continue in a state of expansion this is no doubt the meaning of those who look upon the death of drowned persons as a suffocation and pretend that the cause of it and that of strangled persons is the same for those two kinds of death have a great resemblance and analogy as is sufficiently obvious from the elevation of the abdomen which in hanged persons subsists after their death  from this theory it is sufficiently easy to conceive that the inflation of the lungs is the cause of the death of drowned persons accordingly dethardingius from the preceding doctrine draws the following conclusions the vesicules of the lungs are inflated by the air the bronchia are lengthened the blood vessels distributed through the whole body of the lungs are compressed and though the elongation of the bronchia assists the entry of the blood into the large vessels as well those proper to the lungs as the bronchial artery and vein as those which are only subservient to the circulation as the pulmonary artery and vein yet the circulation is not carried on equally in the capillaries since the presence of a rarefied air in the vesicules compresses the blood and forcing it to stop there hinders it from passing into the left ventricle of the heart in order to accomplish the circulation now as soon as there is a considerable retardation in this important function the vital motions also gradually cease and death approaches insensibly  after having thus discovered the reason of the inflation of the lungs and of the death which succeeds that circumstance we shall with the same author investigate the cause which hinders the discharge of the air from the lungs and breast this is by no means a topic of pure curiosity since the assistance to be afforded to drowned persons can be of no service except in so far as it is proper to remove those obstacles which oppose and hinder the respective actions of the viral functions now dethardingius and becker pretend that the epiglottis which is a small valve placed at the external entrance of the larynx in order by its covering the glottis to hinder all solid or liquid bodies which may be put into the mouth from descending into the canal of respiration being exactly and strongly applied over the glottis proves the obstacle to the discharge of the air from the lungs these authors also affirm that such a strong and convulsive application of the epiglottis over the glottis arises from a preternatural extension of the fibers of those membranes of the larinx which cover the epiglottis this preternatural extension they attribute to the violent inspiration excited by fear in persons who run a risk of being drowned thus the incomparable dethardingius reasons in the following manner if in all kinds of dread and terror we observe that respiration is disordered that is to say that inspiration is more quick and lasts longer and that on the contrary expiration is intercepted uncertain and short it follows of course that inspiration must be much more strong and the air attracted in a far larger quantity when a person perceives that he is threatened with death by the water which must in a moment fill the space which ought to be occupied by the air  it is pretty surprising that becker and dethardingius should only reason conjecturally in this affair since the dissections they made of drowned persons might have enabled them by their eyes to judge of the disposition of the epiglottis in these unfortunate creatures but be this as it will certain it is that dethardingiuss method of affording relief to drowned persons is highly rational and promises fair for restoring them to life it consists in four things the first of which is to place the body drawn from the water in a proper posture and situation the second is to compress the abdomen at the same time that frictions are making on the back the third is to excite an irritation in the throat and the fourth to make an incision in the arteria trachea  as for the situation of the person taken from the water we have already shown suspension by the heels to be prejudicial though becker recommends it because he thinks the weight of the abdominal viscera may thrust the diaphragm into the breast compress the lungs and giving a greater spring to the air make it act with such an effort as to raise the epiglottis but the judicious dethardingius sensible that this method is sufficient to destroy respiration in persons alive absolutely condemns it and orders drowned people to be laid with their bodies so declining as that the head may be lowest besides as he had observed that respiration is more difficultly performed on the belly he directs drowned persons to be laid on their backs and a strong compression of the abdomen to be made from the region of the pubes as far up as the stomach he adds that it is expedient both for the sake of the frictions and the compression to rub the hands with some oil proper to restore to the fibers rendered rigid by the cold and spasms that suppleness and pliant state which is necessary to them in order to perform the motions of respiration  pechlinus observes that in sweden it is customary to use frictions on persons taken out of the water and externally to apply hot and spirituous remedies in order to reanimate the internal heat and more effectually excite the effervescence of the blood borelli in hist cent   obs    orders the skin to be rendered red by means of frictions in a warm bed mr joly a physician of britany in the observations inserted in the historical journal for the month of november      advises frictions before a large fire with hot cloths with a view to restore the person to heat as soon as possible dethardingius orders these frictions to be made from the nape of the neck down to the buttocks because the heads of the muscles subservient to expiration are attached to the spine of the back and their tendors to the ribs and because in his opinion friction facilitates the action of these muscles especially when made with oils which contribute to restore the plyancy of the fibers  besides frictions before a fire with hot cloths soaked in oils or spirituous liquors are beneficial in another respect because the spine of the back is the origin of a great number of nerves and consequently of the various motions performed in the body this cannot fail to put all the vital springs in action by restoring suppleness to the nervous and muscular fibers and motion to the flow circulating or even totally coagulated juices this is the reason why frictions and pumping so often prove successful in apoplexies  we must also observe that dethardingius approves of laying drowned persons on their bellies over a hogshead or round vessel which is to be agitated not with a view to make them discharge the water they have swallowed but to shake and compress the abdomen and thrust its contents toward the diaphragm but forestus in observat chirurg lib   obs    and obs med lib    obs    condemns this expedient as well as that of hanging by the heels because says he it has produced sudden death in some persons who could not bear the violent motion the turning the internal parts of the body topsyturvy and the agitation of the head and vomiting produced by this means mr joly also condemns the putting drowned persons in a hogshead open at both ends in order to be rolled for some time in different directions  dethardingius seems not to have laid great stress upon the swedish practice of defending the bodies of drowned persons from the contact of the air and of conveying them into warm places the first step however taken by the swedes is according to pechlinus to wrap such bodies up in warm cloths langelotti also in miscel not curios an   obs  0 informs us that this method is among them universally put in practice because they have learned from long experience that no drowned person recovers if he is left long exposed to the free air mr joly is also of opinion that drowned persons should be left upon the shore no longer than is necessary to pull off their cloths which may be cut off for the sake of expedition for continues he a single moment often determines between a state of death or life in consequence of this principle he adopts the swedish practice for says he when the drowned persons cloths are taken off he is to be wrapped up in the warmest coverings or cloths which can be then had then he is to be conveyed to the nearest house where after frictions before a warm fire with hot cloths he is to be laid in a very warm bed great care is to be taken to apply to his feet the innersides of his thighs his houghs and his armpits flaggons full of boiling water wrapped up in linen cloths for the same purpose we may make use of bricks i must however observe that mr joly recedes from the swedish practice in a circumstance which to me appears to be of the least importance for the swedes do not warm the bodies of drowned persons suddenly but by little and little before a gentle fire the expedience of this may be evinced by considering the effects of a too intense heat upon fishes found frozen in the winter time which indeed recover for a moment and then die irretriveably nymman and ranchin also ordered drowned persons to be laid in warm places especially in winter  as in drowned persons a defect of respirable air produces a suffocation so it would be no less foolish than barbarous suddenly to expose them to the entire action of the atmosphere since that fluid entering precipitately into the thorax would produce in the pulmonary vessels a dilatation which instead of promoting the passage of the blood through that organ would produce a fresh obstruction in it because the action of the heart is not strong enough to surmount the resistance which the air makes to the passage of the blood and this must the more inevitably happen because the lungs in such a state collapse which is the unavoidable fate of all fibers deprived of the influx of the animal spirits which necessarily depends on the free conveyance of the blood through the whole body and the velocity of its circular motion the precaution therefore of wrapping persons taken from the water in blankets is highly proper and excellently suited not only to this species of suffocation but also of all others  but it is not sufficient to guard drowned persons against the rude impressions of the atmosphere since it is also requisite they should only be permitted the free use of that fluid by degrees  as the decrease of the circulation is necessarily succeeded by a proportionable diminution of heat so it is justly to be expected that the bodies of drowned persons have lost the greatest part of that warmth which is so necessary to the support of life hence it is absolutely requisite they should be warmed but it would be equally pernicious suddenly to expose them at once to the fire or precipitately to exhibit medicines which by the volatility of their principles might produce a rarefaction of the blood it is therefore far more safe and prudent to begin with gradually augmented frictions of the extremities with warm cloths than all at once to expose such persons to the fire or call in the assistance of hot and volatile medicines both of which may be safely though sparingly and gradually used when the circulation is so restored that their bad effects are no longer to be feared  these precautions are founded on physical reasons which though sufficiently known to physicians may yet afford fresh pleasure and entertainment to readers of another class  the blood then of the vena cava discharges itself into the right auricle of the heart whose contraction forces it into the right ventricle which in its turn contracting itself propels the blood into the pulmonary artery that those operations may be performed it is necessary the quantity of blood discharged into the right auricle should not overpower its action that the contractile force of the right ventricle should be sufficient to propel the blood in the pulmonary artery and that in this artery there should be nothing to obstruct or oppose the distribution of the blood which ought to be made in it now according to this theory the contractions of the right auricle and ventricle are in such cases extremely weakened since these muscles partake of the relaxation of the whole system of the fibers the lungs also collapse and consequently oppose the free circulation of the blood or its free distribution through themselves if therefore in affording assistance to drowned persons we should precipitately convey too quick a motion to the blood we should by that very circumstance produce invincible obstacles to its circulation and consequently make the means of recalling life subservient to the production of irretreivable death for the excessive quantity of blood which enters the right auricle will overpower and surmount the weak force which resists it besides though this auricle had contractile force enough to convey the blood into the heart yet the action of that muscle will not be sufficient to propel the blood into the lungs or at least to surmount the joint resistance made by the collapsed state of the lungs and the air compressing their blood vessels these methods therefore of relieving drowned persons and restoring them to life are not only founded upon the animal economy but are also absolutely necessary and indispensible  it is however to be observed that when the circulation begins to be carried on freely we may if such practice is indicated by any pressing circumstances attempt to reduce it to its natural state by means of cordials and antiapoplectic medicines though these especially the latter as being most powerful are in the beginning to be used with the utmost caution and probably the safest method is totally to abstain from the antiapoplectic medicines and to begin with the mildest cordials whose most energetic parts being diluted in a large quantity of some proper vehicle may more insensibly mix themselves with the mass of blood and consequently produce their effects more slowly it is however to be observed that the same danger is not to be dreaded from the external use of the most efficacious remedies thus for instance we need not hesitate to apply topics to the temples the nostrils the wrists the pit of the stomach and all those parts where the arteries lying near the surface of the body are exposed to their action and influence and as the membranous parts are none of the least considerable instruments of the several motions performed in the body so a very particular regard ought to be had to them frictions then of the hands and feet as well as the application of spirituous medicines to these parts are extremely beneficial for though the propriety of this practice could not be demonstrated from anatomy and physiology yet we might be fully convinced of it by the observation of deventer who orders frictions with brushes to be made on the soles of the feet of such newborn children as discover no signs of life in order to restore the circulation of the blood which is the foundation or first beginning of it  deventer does not indeed advise the application of spirituous medicines to these parts but as it is sufficiently certain that these as well as all other liquors penetrate the surface of the body and enter the cavities of the vessels so their external applications must necessarily produce very happy effects besides this method of using spirituous medicines is of all others the safest not only because their mixture with the blood is not so quick as when they are exhibited internally but also because the parts to which they are applied are most remote from the center  but we now proceed to consider the other methods of affording relief to drowned persons beginning with the smoke of tobacco the happy effects of which are proved by various observations thus doctor mead in his mechanical account of poisons after mentioning that many who have been drowned and dead to all appearance have been surprisingly restored to life speaks in the following manner from the memoirs of the royal academy of sciences this circumstance should certainly encourage the use of all means upon such accidents especially as the trial is not difficult the first step should be to blow the smoke of tobacco up into the intestines then to warm the body by shaking and rolling about and rubbing it with warm cloths in a bed in a word to put the blood into motion all manner of ways and not to be discouraged though no signs of life should be discovered after an hour or two should be spent in this good work toward the latter end of which spirits and volatile salts may produce a good effect neither should bleeding be omitted when the blood is become sufficiently warm to drop out of the veins  the happy effects of the smoke of tobacco in restoring drowned persons to life are farther evinced from the following narration of dr bruhier mr thomas a professed surgeon of paris being at passy waited in a boat till the number it was to take in should be completed during this time he saw a boat crossing the river and when it arrived at land one of the passengers stepping ashore and missing his wife asked what was become of her but no one could give him any answer except a young child who pointing to the river said she had hid herself in it this woman had fallen from the stern of the boat without being perceived by any of the passengers except the child who gave directions to row to the very part where the woman fell from the boat the husband finding her in a place which was not very deep but full of mud brought her to land and laid her out whilst some of the spectators of this melancholy accident were advising to hang her by the heels and others ordering different measures to be taken a soldier with his pipe in his mouth came to ask the reason of such a concourse of people upon being informed of the accident he desired the disconsolate husband to give over weeping because his wife would return to life very soon then giving his pipe to the husband he bid him introduce the small end of it into the anus put a piece of paper perforated with a large number of holes upon its mouth and through that blow the smoke of the tobacco into her interstines as strongly as he possibly could accordingly at the fifth blast a considerable rumbling in the womans abdomen was heard upon which she discharged some water from her mouth and in a moment after returned to life this practice however insignificant in the eyes of the vulgar is nevertheless of the highest importance for the irritation of the intestines excited by the heat and acrimony of the smoke of the tobacco produces in the muscles subservient to expiration such a reflux of the animal spirits as induces a contraction of them sufficient to surmount that resistance which the air contained in the breast found to its discharge this happy effect of the smoke of tobacco is sufficiently evinced by the preceding history since it made the woman vomit up the water she had swallowed now vomiting is excited by a stimulating contraction of the diaphragm and of the transverse muscle of the abdomen which contracting the stomach force it to discharge its contents where the least resistance is found and consequently by its superior orifice it is to be observed that the same happy effects are produced by the smoke of all acrid substances since mr joly affirms that the same end is equally answered by the smoke of sage and other plants of a similar nature it is also highly probable that clysters prepared with coloquintida or tobacco would produce effects equally good but on such occasions the most ready and expeditious measures are always to be taken since a very small delay may prove of the last consequence by destroying a life which might otherwise be preserved  in cases of emergence where proper instruments are not immediately to be procured the prescription of the soldier in the preceding history may be followed but it may lose less time to cover the tobacco in the bole of the pipe when lighted with a silk handkerchief either single or once doubled than to wait till proper holes are bored in a piece of paper though this takes up very little time however that no necessary instructions might be wanted i have given the figure of an instrument contrived on purpose for impelling the smoke of tobacco into the intestines a represents a brass or iron box capable of containing half an ounce of the strongest tobacco which is to be lighted b is a common clyster pipe to be introduced into the anus joined to the flexible tube d d made of leather c is another pipe at which a person blows forcibly that the smoke of the tobacco in the box a may be impelled through the flexible tube d d and the pipe b into the intestines e represents the smoke if one clyster is not sufficient another should be given soon after and repeated till it answers  these clysters of the fume of tobacco are of excellent use in the iliac passion and in an incarcerated hernia and no apothecary or surgeon ought to be without such an instrument  as the olfactory nerves are of all others the most exposed to the action of bodies and have an intimate connection with those subservient to the motion of the muscles destined for respiration it must of course be beneficial to irritate the nerves of the nose so that what we call sternutatories or such substances as excite sneezing produce happy effects in restoring drowned persons to life indian marum or euphorbium introduced into the nose or reduced into a powder and blown up the nostrils will in all probability produce salutary effects since if they operate they will excite a violent expiration sufficient to remove all those obstacles which the air finds to its free discharge mr joly warmly recommends this practice as also injections of spirituous liquors thus the injection of spirit of sal ammoniac into the nostrils operates more powerfully than holding volatile sal ammoniac to them perhaps vinegar will stimulate yet more strongly and with better effect  all those authors who treat of the measures proper for restoring drowned persons to life order a vomiting to be excited in order to procure a discharge of the water contained in the stomach this is the doctrine of codronchus forestus camerarius and mr joly who imagines that the water in the stomach of drowned persons is one of the causes of their death in order to excite this vomiting they order the throat to be tickled with the bearded end of a quill becker and dethardingius order a feather to be introduced into the oesophagus in order to excite such a motion of the epiglottis as is sufficient to procure a discharge of the air contained in the breast now it is sufficiently known to every body that the bearded end of a quill excites vomiting we must here observe that mr joly only orders vomiting to be procured after drowned persons return to life but it is certain that vomiting can produce no happy effects if there is nothing in the stomach or only a quantity of water equal to that daily used by most people as for liquid emetics their effects appear to be highly dubious since the oesophagus may possibly be in such a convulsive state as to hinder deglutition dethardingius looks upon this irritation of the throat as a circumstance of the highest importance but for exciting it prefers a certain instrument invented in germany and described by heister in his surgery  according to pechlinus the swedes attempt to restore the lives of drowned persons by means of fomentations with antiapoplectic medicines that is such as are of an hot and spirituous nature borelli in obs    cent   informs us that he successfully used toasted bread soaked in warm brandy applied to the region of the heart and frequently renewed nymman in tr de apoplexia cap    orders us to apply to the nostrils of drowned persons odoriferous substances and such as are carpable of putting the spirits in motion and restoring the action of the heart and the functions of the brain of this kind are pennyroyal rue and lilly of the valley soaked in vinegar he also orders us to apply to the region of the heart epithems prepared of baum rue marjoram amber cinnamon and lavender thus for instance  take of the best rose water an ounce and an half of baumwater two ounces and an half of rosemarywater one ounce of malmsey wine one ounce and an half of lemon juice one ounce of the powder of cloves one scruple of theriaca one dram and of camphire and saffron each half a dram mix all together and in the liquor soak a sponge to be applied to the region of the heart  as the genital parts of both sexes have a near and intimate correspondence with the heart as is obvious from the effects of cordials applied to those parts in syncopes faintings and other affections of the heart so nymman in order to restore drowned persons to life orders these parts to be fomented with warm wine in which cinnamon cloves musk and baum have been boiled  but if any success is to be expected from these remedies it is principally when by the assistance of frictions the most volatile parts of spirituous liquors are made to penetrate into the mass of fluids and it is highly probable that independently of the experience of the swedes this method will answer the end proposed by dethardingius which is the procuring of a free expiration for if the admixture of the spirituous parts of cordial liquors restores the course of the spirits and blood it must necessarily follow that both must be more copiously conveyed to the muscles destined for the purposes of expiration  it is also certain from experience that one of the most efficacious expedients for restoring drowned persons to lise is speedy venesection especially in those parts most proper for relieving the head as the ankles for instance and the jugular veins the use of venesection in such cases must be sufficiently obvious to every one who considers that drowned persons as well as those who are hanged die of an apoplexy of the sanguineous kind and not for want of respiration or as is commonly imagined on account of a repletion or choking up of the breast by blood for when such persons are laid open the breast is found almost entirely void of blood and the brain extremely inflamed both which phoenomena are highly agreeable to the laws of the circulation  these are the most common and approved methods of restoring drowned persons to life but if they should happen to prove ineffectual the last resource is what we commonly call bronchotomy or tracheotomy which consists in opening the trachea in order to procure a free access of the air to the lungs this operation is principally intended to remove the obstinate adherence of the epiglottis to the orifice of the glottis in consequence of which circumstance the air contained in the lungs is freely discharged tracheotomy was indeed originally intended for the extraction of foreign bodies from the trachea or for the procuring an access of the air to the lungs when the inflammation of the muscles of the larynx is so considerable in quinseys as to close up the aperture of the glottis  tracheotomy according to dethardingius has all the advantages which can be wished for since it affords relief speedily effectually and agreeably speedily because there is no more expeditious method of procuring a discharge of the air which by its natural spring and by the continual compression of the abdomen must necessarily be evacuated in that manner now the air cannot escape from the pulmonary vesicles without their collapsing and expressing into the pulmonary vein the blood which had entered the pulmonary artery which cannot happen without adding a greater facility of circulation to the arterial blood now the blood arriving at the left auricle and thence at the left ventricle produces a new contraction of the heart upon which the circulation is reestablished and life discovers itself by manifest signs especially by respiration  tracheotomy also affords relief without danger because we are no longer afraid of making an incision in those cartilages which the ancients in consequence of their bony nature imagined incapable of consolidation we no longer dread the hemorrhage since only a few drops of blood are discharged in opening the membrane which unites the ringlets of the arteria trachea and since there are not contiguous to the part such large blood vessels as being wounded would produce terrible effects there is no danger of injuring the voice by means of this operation since the operator cannot hurt the muscles of the larynx and since there are no nerves the dilaceration of which should impair or destroy the sensation of the part in a word it is no difficult task to heal up and consolidate the wound for this is readily effected by means of a plaster or some balsamic ointment  thirdly tracheotomy affords relief agreeably for it cannot possibly be painful to a drowned person whose senses are so locked up as to render him incapable of feeling pain thus the operation is performed without being intercepted by the cries the groans and motions which pain would produce  paulus aegincta is the first author extant who described the operation of broncotomy from antyllus but the judicious and accurate heister in his surgery describes this operation very distinctly the words bronchotomy says he laryngotomy and tracheotomy are convertible terms and mean no more than an incision of the aspera arteria or what we commonly call the windpipe and indeed various causes and circumstances concur to render this operation absolutely necessary on some occasions for in the first place it becomes principally and indispensably so when in a quinsey the fauces are so terribly inflamed that the patient is in imminent danger of having his respiration quite stopped and a total suffocation brought on secondly it becomes necessary when a bean a prune a cherrystone a pea or any other extraneous substance falls into the aspera arteria and seems to threaten a suffocation thirdly the aspera arteria is also to be opened in such persons as have been suffocated in consequence of their being immersed in water or as we commonly express it in newly drowned people for respiration has been often restored to persons in this condition by opening the aspera arteria and by that means procuring a free access of the air to the lungs i am sufficiently apprizd that a great many forbid making an incision in the aspera arteria and consequently condemn this operation because they think it productive of death and are therefore prompted by an idle zeal to brand the physicians who approve an operation so dangerous in their eyes with the odious appellations of barbarous and inhuman but the gentlemen who are of this narrow and confined way of thinking are grossly mistaken for in this operation the small incision made in the aspera arteria is so far from killing the patient that it does not produce that effect when made considerably large and garengeot gives examples of various cures performed by this operation so that we think ourselves authorized with casserius in tr de vocis auditusque organis to pronounce those men unskilful timorous and even cruel who in the cases now mentioned foolishly neglecting this operation which is not only safe but also attended with the most speedy and salutary effects suffer the patients to die for want of this seasonable assistance instances of this nature may be seen in nicolai fontani observat rarior analect and in casserius  when bronchotomy is to be performed that part of the trachea seems most proper for making the aperture in which is situated between its second and third cartilaginous annuli or ringlets the incision may however be made a little lower without any danger the method of performing the operation especially when a foreign substance falling into the aspera arteria and threatening a suffocation is to be extracted is thus the patient is first of all to be situated in a reclining posture either in bed or in some convenient chair and his head is to be held firm by an assistant standing behind his back then a longitudinal incision is to be made through the skin fat and muscles from about two fingers breadth below the cartilago thyroides or seutiformis or the pomum adami in the middle of the trachea down to the very sternum so that the length of the incision may be two three and in tall patients four fingers breadth in length  then an assistant is carefally to draw the lips of this orifice from each other either with proper hooks or with his fingers and having absorbed and wiped away the blood either by a sponge or linen cloth so that the aspera arteria may be seen three or four of the annuli or ringlets of that spiral pipe are to be cut in such a manner that the incisions made in the whole may form one continued line and thus whatever substance may have slipped into it is to be artfully and cautiously extracted either by a probe hook or forceps this being done the wound is to be cleansd with a sponge and its lips being kept in contact by adhesive plasters a proper compress and bandage are to be applied it is afterward to be carefully agglutinated by means of vulnerary balsams as in other wounds of the aspera arteria by this very method continues heister i myself in helmstadt happily extracted a piece of boiled mushroom from a patient who happening to laugh while he was supping broth in which among other things there were mushrooms had the misfortune to have a piece of one of them slip into his aspera arteria by which means he was in danger of being suffocated ravius continues heister also informed me that by this very method he happily extracted a bean from the throat of a patient some in order to induce a more speedy and seemly cicatrix on the wound recommend conglutination by suture as in the hare lip but it is certainly absurd to follow a practice attended with so much pain to the patient whilst methods equally good and at the same time far milder may be pursued  but in all cases where a suffocation is either dreaded or actually present tracheotomy is absolutely necessary and may be performed in three different manners in the first of these the patient is to be placed in a bed or chair with his head reclined at the operators discretion and held firm by an assistant as before directed then let the surgeon make an incision in that middle part of the throat and in the same manner as before ordered till he reaches the trachea itself if he thinks proper the skin on both sides is to be laid hold of by the assistant then it may be raised and cut longitudinally after these measures are taken the fat and muscles lying above the trachea are to be cut some would have these muscles first disengaged from the trachea or cautiously separated from the others but there is no occasion for all this labor since they may be cut safely and without any danger then the operator is to cleanse the wound with a sponge wrung out of warm wine or warm spirit of wine for stopping the blood more effectually the assistant is in the mean time to separate and retract the lips either by hooks or by his fingers then the surgeon is to pass his knife between two of the annuli of trachea or he may even pass it in such a manner as to cut one of them since by that means a silver or leaden pipe either round or flat furnished with ansae or a rim so as to prevent its falling into the trachea may be conveniently inserted into the wound but before the surgeon withdraws his knife some proper probe ought to be inserted in the wound by the side of the knife that by its assistance a pipe may be more commodiously and put into it this pipe is fixed in the wound by means of a ligature passed through its annuli or small holes in the rim and carried round the neck as also by means of a perforated adhesive plaster but great care is to be taken that the end of the pipe which is inserted into the wound be not permitted to touch the posterior part of the aspera arteria lest by this means a troublesome cough should be excited but that the lungs may not be injured by external cold or any filth falling upon them it is highly proper to lay upon the pipe a sponge often impregnated with warm wine and again wrung out or as garengeot advises a thin linen cloth and afterward a perforated plaster these directions being duly observed blood is to be taken either from the veins of the neck or feet those under the tongue or those situated in the neck when respiration is totally restored which is most quickly discovered by stopping up the pipe with one finger the pipe is to be taken out and the wound agglutinated in the manner above directed but when the difficulty of breathing at the mouth is considerable the pipe is to be left for some time longer in the wound and the other medicines continued  another and more expeditious method of opening the trachea is this a two edged knife is applied to the abovementioned part of the throat and cautiously passed through the skin fat and muscles into the cavity of the trachea itself and a pipe is forthwith inserted into the wound and carefully secured in the manner before directed this manner of operation is not only quicker but also produces a smaller cicatrix than the former  the third and last method of performing this operation is with an instrument called a trocar in tapping for the dropsy which no surgeon ought to be without this instrument applied to the middle of the trachea may as it were at one thrust be passed through the skin fat and muscles into its very cavity then taking out the perforating part let the pipe remain in the orifice till the patient recovers this method of operation seems in one respect to have the advantage of all the rest which is that it is soon over and the pipe at the same time introduced into the wound with far less pain to the patient than by any other method but even in this case the same caution ought to be used and the same directions followed which we have above specified  if persons drowned continues heister are but just dead their aspera arteria is to be opened with all expedition either with an incisionknife or any other instrument the surgeon shall judge proper then it is expedient strongly to blow into the orifice either with the naked mouth or by means of a common pipe the shank of which is to be introduced into the wound whilst the assistant blows into the bole the learned dethardingius in a dissertation on this very subject informs us that by this method if speedily put in execution life returns to the suffocated patients with the injected air and that he is in a manner miraculously raised from the dead for this reason the operation should in such cases be performed with the greatest haste and expedition imaginable  mr sharp our countryman in his surgery assures us that this operation is absolutely void of all danger and describes it in the following manner  bronchotomy is performed by making a longitudinal incision through the skin three quarters of an inch long between the third and fourth ringlets of the trachea when the operator has his own choice of the place it is always advised to pinch up the skin in this operation which however may be left to the discretion of the surgeon who when the skin is cut through must make a small transverse incision into the wind pipe and immediately introduce a crooked canula near half an inch long of silver or lead with a couple of little rings at the top of it through which a ribband may be passed round the neck to keep it fixed in the wound  some have prescribed making an incision through the skin and trachea at once with a lancet or knife as the more easy and expeditious manner and says the author i once saw it performed in this way but it proved very inconvenient for the windpipe in respiration moving up and down slipped from the orifice of the skin and made it very difficult to introduce the canula and afterward maintain it in its situation wherefore i think it absolutely necessary to make an external incision longitudinal and even pretty large as i have directed above  the caution of raising the sternohyoidei and sternothyroidei muscles before opening the windpipe is not to be regarded and as to the division of the recurrent nerves and large blood vessels so much dreaded in this operation it is not in the least to be feared since they are quite out of the reach of the instrument as any person skilled in the anatomy of these parts must very well know  the method of dressing is easily understood since after the patient can breath by the natural passage if we withdraw the pipe the wound becomes a simple one and notwithstanding its penetration through a cartilage into a large cavity requires only a superficial application  upon the whole it appears beyond all contradiction that bronchotomy is a safe operation and has been so often performed with success that no surgeon has any reason to hesitate in performing it in cases where particular circumstances indicate its propriety for this reason it is sufficiently obvious that this operation ought with all expedition to be performed on drowned persons many of whom have been happily restored to life by this very means it is carefully to be observed that this expedient is far more efficacious than blowing into a persons mouth as is confirmed by the following experiment made by becker this physician hanged a dog till no more motion of his heart was perceived and having left him dead on the ground for half a quarter of an hour he to no purpose blowed air into his throat then he performed the operation of bronchotomy and having thrice blown the air into his lungs the breast of the dog began to elevate itself and at the fifth blast he moved his feet after this he was blooded in the throat to give vent to the blood and at last gave some howling barks but survived the accident for several years now as the cause of death is the same in drowned as in hanged animals why should not the same means restore them both to life  i have been very particular with respect to the operation of bronchotomy because it is of great importance and of singular use in more cases than one and that no one might be ignorant of the methods of performing it in the case before us that of drowned persons it may frequently be necessary where no surgeon is to be procured soon enough to retrieve the misfortune and preserve life in this situation as there is no great danger of injuring a person who appears to be dead and must be absolutely so without immediate relief any common person tho not bred a surgeon may by these directions be enabled to perform the operation by making a perforation in the place above directed with any sharp pointed knife then instead of a canula or tube of metal if that is not at hand a tobacco pipe may be broken about three quarters of an inch or an inch from the bole and the part contiguous to the bole may be introduced into the perforation taking care not to break it within the trachea and then by blowing into the bole the lungs may be inflated  after having thus collected every thing of any importance upon the present subject we must beg leave to observe that though with respect to matters of religion and conscience it is not only extremely absurd but also highly cruel and barbarous to invoke the assistance and interposition of the secular power yet in the present case such an attempt is so far from being either absurd or barbarous that it bespeaks compassion and humanity for we may safely appeal to experience how many worthy members of society generous friends affectionate husbands tender parents and dutiful children have in foreign countries been restored to life by these very means whereas in england persons of equal worth have for want of proper care been laid in their graves at a time when they might for many future years have proved the common blessings of the various communities of which they were members  this melancholy and deplorable consideration will sufficiently authorize me to propose a regulation to the legislature of england whose principal aim seems ultimately to terminate in the greatest and most extensive happiness of the subject it is that this treatment of persons supposd to be drowned may be enforced by all the authority of the law and that no one may be suffered to be buried without it and this under severe penalties for otherwise i am afraid these endeavors of mine however well intended will not have the desired effect nor be attended to so much as the subject deserves  an appendix concerning the methods of restoring hanged persons to life and children supposed to be born dead as england is above all other nations in the world justly branded with suicide commonly known by the name of selfmurder and as our countrymen frequently make choice of a rope for that purpose we shall briefly point out the methods of restoring hanged persons to life  it is certain then that hanged persons die of an apoplexy of the sanguineous kind produced by an obstruction of the blood by the rope in the jugular veins whilst the arteries being freer from this compression continue to convey the blood to the brain we may form a judgment of the effects produced by a compression of the jugular veins from the following passage of alexander benedictus in lib   cap    when says that judicious author a redundance of blood obstructs the arterial and venous canals and intercepts the free circulation of the spirits the patient falls down in the same condition as if he was hanged the assyrians sometimes put sound persons into a similar state when for instance they intended to circumcise adults or children thus having laid them on their backs in a bath they compressed their jugular veins so as speedily to produce a privation both of motion and sensation and taking the advantage of this circumstance cut off the prepuce with as much ease as if the patient was in an apoplexy the same is the condition of those who having attempted to hang themselves are found suffocated tho their feet touch the ground  nymman also in tr de apoplexia cap    declares his sentiments on this subject in the following manner the functions of the brain says he are destroyed without any lesion of the animal spirits and nerves as appears in a syncope the like happens to hanged persons who are no sooner hung up provided an expert executioner exactly brace up the vessels of the neck with the rope than they become immovable as a log of wood without even so much as moving their feet notwithstanding which phenomenon the brain and origin of the nerves suffer nothing in such persons since those parts are defended by the cranium and vertebrae which can never be injured by the rope nor is the interception of respiration to be accused as the cause of death in hanged persons since tho we closely shut up the mouth and nostrils of an animal so as to hinder the access of air into the breast yet as the brain still retains its vital spirit it powerfully opposes the imminent danger of a suffocation by a violent agitation of the body and an excessive motion of the feet which circumstances are never observed in hanged person  from these authorities we evidently see the speedy effects produced by the compression of the jugular veins this doctrine is farther illustrated by bartholine in cent   hist    in dissecting says this author a man of a tall stature of a sanguine temperament and vigorous constitution who was hanged for a robbery i found his lungs preternaturally large bluish streaked with different colors light and spungious and so full of a frothy blood that every where on the membrane which covers them the veins not only appeared turgid but the lobes were also so large as to embarrass me in dissecting the heart the ventricules of the brain were full of water as also the origin of the nerves which enter the spine the plexus choroides also besides the inflation of its vessels contained a great many vesicules  the loss of knowledge in hanged persons also proves the truth of this doctrine and this loss is sufficiently attested by camerarius in cent   hist  0 where we are told that a robber being hanged and falling into the hands of the surgeons for dissection was nevertheless restored to life notwithstanding his mouth was full of froth which is generally looked upon as an infallible sign of irritrievable death especially where it continues long as it did in the present case and notwithstanding he had before his execution been seized with a fit of madness when this man however was restored to life he said he rememberd nothing of what had passed on that occasion except that he was conducted to the criminal chamber after which he was insensible of every thing this robber was hanged a second time for committing fresh robberies a convincing proof that he did not look upon the first as a formidable punishment camerarius in hist    mentions another who was twice hanged and in hist    another who was restored to life by the physicians of vienna after he had been hanged  lord bacon in his history of life and death relates an accident which like that of camerarius proves the loss of knowledge in hanged persons a young gentleman of some distinction curious to know the pain suffered by hanged persons having fixed a rope about his neck threw himself from a low stool upon which he imagined he could easily put his feet again but his attempts of this kind were in vain and he had been irretrievably suffocated without the assistance of a friend who had the curiosity to be present at such an unaccountable experiment upon his recovery his friend asking him if he had felt any pain he answered that he had perceived none in any part of his body but added that at first he observed before his eyes a species of fire or blazing light then an extreme darkness and last of all a pale blue or a seagreen like that which frequently presents itself before the eyes of those who fall into deliquiums lord bacon subjoins that he heard a physician of candor and worth assert that he had restored life to a man who had been hanged half an hour affirming at the same time that by proper means the same effect might be produced upon others who had hung no longer provided the effort of their first fall had not luxated the vertebrae of their necks  after having thus discovered the cause of death in hanged persons we are the better able to form an estimate of the means most proper to restore them to life  frictions then and hot baths by restoring the motion of the blood and resolving its coagulation must for these very reasons produce happy effects on hanged persons pechlinus in tr de aer and aliment defect cap   relates an observation which sufficiently evinces the efficacy of sal ammoniac on similar occasions i knew says he a woman hanged who after she had remained for some time without pulse and respiration with her lips covered with froth which is looked upon as an infallible sign of the total privation of life and in a word after she appeared to be the necessary victim of death was yet restored to life by a physician who coming accidentally to the place where she lay made her swallow a considerable quantity of the spirit of sal ammoniac as the activity of this acrid volatile liquor and its propriety to resolve coagulated blood are sufficiently known it is by no means surprising that it should on similar occasions produce such happy effects  pechlinus subjoins i dont in the least doubt but if proper measures were taken in due time a great many hanged persons might be restored to life even after those who have an opportunity of seeing them think they have all the reason in the world to conclude them really and irretrievably dead this effect is most commodiously produced by restoring the circulation of their blood by means of frictions venesections and the exhibition of hot and spirituous remedies or of some other analogous substances  it is sufficiently easy from what we have before said to conceive how venesection is excellently calculated for restoring life to hanged persons and as for spirituous liquors they act at once on the blood and vessels by attenuating the former and restoring the proper spring and tone of the latter the remedies of this kind are before specified  schenkius in observat art de suffocat ex laquea orders that drowned persons should be made to swallow vinegar and pepper or oxymel mixed with the powder of pennyroyal he also advises to excite a vomiting by means of a feather dipped in oil and to wrap up the patients neck in a woollen cloth dipped in warm oil especially the oil of orris  the virtues of oxymel or of simple vinegar with pepper are sufficiently evinced by christophorus de vega art med lib   sect   cap   all physicians are sufficiently apprizd that vinegar moderately used is a powerful resolvent whilst pepper is an acrid substance equally proper to dissolve the coagulations of the juices and reanimate the fibers by the irritation it produces in them the powder of pennyroyal is also an acrid aromatic whose effect must of course be nearly the same with that of pepper  as for exciting a vomiting in hanged persons i think it more dangerous than in those who are drowned for the contractions of the muscles subservient to expiration may serve to restore that function as we have already observed since the inflation of the abdomen and breast of hanged persons is a proof that their inspiration is forced and unnatural yet in such circumstances it seems dangerous to convey a greater quantity of blood to the head which is before overchargd with it as is sufficiently obvious not only from the preceding histories but also from the livid color of the countenance it is however certain that the shocks given to the parts by means of the vomiting are very proper to dissolve the coagulations of the blood though i would never advise the use of this method till after a previous venefection  the topic mentioned above which schenkius orders to be applied to the neck may produce very happy effects by resolving the blood collected in the skin and muscles of the neck and relaxing the parts which had suffered most immediately by the rope  gesner for a girl who hanged herself successfully ordered powder of castor which he forced down in warm broth this remedy is also of a volatile and resolvent nature joubert in lib   it effect thor cap   informs us that he restored many hanged persons to life without such a multiplicity of expedients since he used no other method than venesection and forcing into their stomachs a due quantity of good wine  ranchinus in tr de morb subit cap    orders oil of orris or of lillies to be applied to the necks of hanged persons whilst their mouths are to be gargarizd with syrup of violets dissolved in warm water or barleywater he also prescribes vomiting excited by a feather in order to enlarge the passages more the same author also recommends pepper and pennyroyal either in vinegar oxymel wine or the aqua caelestis but venesection is the expedient on which he depends most for happy effects the oils and the syrup are only intended to procure a relaxation and as for the gargarism it cannot be usd till the hanged person is previously restored to life the pepper pennyroyal and other substances mentioned by him are designed to reanimate and restore the natural heat  aelius in tetrabibl sermon   cap    orders us to add to the pepper and vinegar nettleseeds which are also of an highly acrid nature the same author affirms that when the redness round the neck of hanged persons is dissipated they open their eyes and the parts are relaxed he is also of opinion that we ought not to spare fomentations of the neck with warm oils cerate or woollen cloths  ranchinus from other authors greatly extols a remedy which most people will think as singular in itself as disagreeable to the person who administers it it consists of blowing into the mouth of hanged persons provided the administrator has in his own mouth a bruised nutmeg cinnamon cloves or carrawayseeds as it is certain that these aromatics produce no other effect than impregnating the air with some volatile parts proper to restore the motion of the fluids so it is equally certain that the principal efficacy of this practice depends upon the blowing which in this case must infallibly produce salutary effects as is obvious from the following experiments recorded in no    of the philosophical transactions of the royal society of london  first then doctor croon professor of greshamcollege in the presence of the royal society strangled a pullet in such a manner as that it discovered no more signs of life but by afterward blowing into the arteria trachea he so effectually restored the motion of the lungs that the pullet returned to life  secondly doctor walter needham in the presence of mr boil and other literati hanged a dog till the motion of his heart was no longer to be perceived after which he opened the abdomen of the dog and blowing into the thoracic duct restored the motion of the blood upon which the heart began to beat and the dog returned to life  thirdly doctor hook in the presence of the royal society cut the ribs the diaphragm and pericardium of a dog after which making an incision in the superior part of the trachea he introduced into it the pipe of a pair of bellows then he blowed the air into the lungs and the dog returned to life but died when he ceased to blow by which expedient he made him live and die alternately as long as the company pleased  a fourth experiment is that of becker by which he restored a hanged dog to life by opening his larynx and blowing the air into his lungs through the incision made so that the practice enjoined by ranchinus is by no means to be neglected  upon the whole the first and fourth experiments are absolutely the same with the practice recommended by that author now why may not that which has succeeded twice succeed oftener though the other experiments do not so directly prove the same truth yet it may be easily deduced from them for from the second it follows that the air is not only necessary to the circulation because by dilating the lungs it gives a free passage to the blood from one ventricle of the heart to the other but also is requisite to keep the blood in such a state of solution as circulation requires now by blowing air into the lungs we inflate their vesicles which is the first advantage produced by respiration and the air by this means insinuating itself into the blood resolves its coagulation by means of this explication it is easy to comprehend how doctor hooks experiment favors the doctrine of ranchinus  from what has been said we may therefore conclude first that blowing in the mouths of hanged persons is a proper method of restoring them to life secondly that if this method does not succeed we are to perform the operation of bronchotomy and by that means blow air into their lungs thirdly that we ought not to be discouraged at some fruitless attempts because a practice which with becker did not succeed till the fifth time may perhaps in other circumstances not succeed till later fourthly that we must not at the same time neglect these other means which have a tendency to restore the lost fluidity of the blood fifthly that if death does not succeed strangulation this is rather the effect of the stiffness of the cartilages which compose the larynx or according to some of the slackness of the rope than of the easy disposition of the blood to resume its fluidity sixthly that it is highly probable that an efficacious method of restoring drowned persons to life would be to inject air into the blood by introducing a small pipe into some of the larger veins for that purpose for what difference is there between making the air enter the blood by the thoracic duct or by any other part the only caution which i think ought to be given is to make choice of those veins most contiguous to the heart so that for this very reason as well as for their largeness and the facility of finding them i judge the external jugulars most proper for this purpose  having already observed that as the cause of death is the same in hanged and drowned persons so the measures taken for the relief of the one may be also used for restoring the lives of the others we proceed to give some histories of facts which prove the possibility of restoring suffocated people to life  mr falconet then a gentleman of strict probity and candor told dr bruhier that his father had a foolhardy coachman who falling into a quarrel at lions killed a man and being apprehended on the spot was forthwith condemned to be hanged which sentence was accordingly put in execution the surgeons of the town having obtained his body in order to make a skeleton brought it into a surgery where they left it upon a table but when they came next day to dissect it they were surprised to find the man not only alive but in good health and pissing in the chimney for want as he said of a chamber pot  this man had stood in no need of remedies certainly for no other reason but because the circulation of the blood had not been so long suppressed but that it could of its own accord restore itself  oswaldus gabelchaverus relates in one of his observations quoted by schenkius the history of a merchant of the name of landthtaler who was hanged on a tree for some villainies he had committed he hung for a whole hour and the servants who had orders to inter him having cut the rope perceived as they thought some marks of life in him upon which they put him in a cart conveyed him to a proper place and soon restored him to life he afterward used to say that he was sensible of no pain in hanging except in his eyes and the extremities of his toes about eighteen years after however he began to follow the same practices for which he had been hanged before but prince charles of aremberg ordered him to be hanged a second time in such a manner that he never returned to life  caesariensis in illustr mirac lib   cap    relates the history of a certain robber who had been hanged a little before a servant belonging to a canon of cologne happened to come up to the gallows the servant imagining there were still some remains of life left in him cut the rope and restored him to life by some cold water takenfrom an adjacent rivulet the robber in the mean time gradually resuming his strength followed his deliverer who was going to the next town and just as they were talking with each other the robber laid hold of the bridle of the servants horse cried out aloud that the horse belonged to him and swore that the servant had robbed him of him this debate having drawn together a large concourse of people their indignation was so strongly moved against the servant that without hearing what he had to say in his own justification they were determined to drag him to the gallows from which he had lately cut down the robber but luckily for the servant some inhabitants of the neighboring town seeing a concourse of people going to the gallows which belonged in common to both towns came to see what the matter was then the crowd suffering the servant to speak he related his adventure and the manner in which the robber had recompensed his service the robber being at last known was a second time hung upon the same gallows in such a manner as not to return to life  though the groundwork of the following history resembles the preceding yet it differs from it in many circumstances the most considerable of which is the long time the criminal continued hanged  a miller near abbeville in france happening to go near the place where a robber had been hanged the day before suspected that he was not dead compassion having induced him to satisfy his suspicion which was wellfounded he cut him down laid him in a cart conveyed him to his own house and used such effectual means to restore him to life that in fifteen days the robber recovered perfect health the miller upon this intended to give him a little money and take his leave of him but delaying for some time to put that intention in execution he left him one sunday alone in his house the miserable wretch forgetting what he owed to his deliverer broke open a cupboard and carried off all the plate and ready money he could find the miller upon coming home and finding his house robbed easily concluded that his guest was the person who had done it accordingly the miller his two sons and a cartdriver pursuing the robber overtook him about a league off and dragging him to the gallows whence he had been cut down hung him up a second time and gave him such shocks that they put it out of his power to commit any more robberies it is about forty years since this accident happened and doctor bruhier informs us that it is attested by persons of the best reputation in france and a pardon was actually procured for the miller his sons and servant who took the liberty of executing the robber without legal authority  before we put an end to this treatise which we intend for the common good and benefit of mankind we shall say something with respect to the methods of preserving the lives of children who appear dead when born no two abuses then are more prejudicial to society contrary to humanity or inconsistent with reason than to inter women big with child without performing the caesarian operation upon them and without any attempts of relief totally to abandon children who seem to be born dead  the former of these abuses is founded on two errors the first of which is that the infants do not survive their mothers when they die near their time an the second that the lives of children depend absolutely on those of their mothers now these two errors are destroyed by several histories which prove that the death of the mother does not necessarily produce that of the child  caspar reies then in his campus elysius jucundarum questionum relates from cornarius that a woman of madrid of the illustrious hose of lasso being reputed dead after remaining three days in the utmost agonies was put into the tomb belonging to the family which being opened some months after her corpse was found with an infant tenderly grasped in her right arm for continues the author the woman was pregnant an near her time when she was interred as dead  the following history is also related by the same author and attested by some of the most learned and judicious men in spain  the wife of francis arevallo de swasso fell ill in the city of segovia during the last months of gestation however as she died or rather was taken for dead in a few days she was interred according to the custom of the place the husbnd in the mean time who was sent for to a place at a considerable distance whither he had gone about some business came home about the middle of the night and being informed that his wife whom he loved to excess was dead and buried he would at any rate have the satisfaction of seeing her once more for this purpose he went to the church and ordered her to be raised from the grave hardly was the coffin opened till the cries of a infant were heard the bystanders were astonished a justice was called the priests and a great many others got flambeaus and attended the husband the shroud was lifted up immediately upon which appeared the head of an infant making a vigorous effort to disengage the rest of its body from the vagina this infant was not only extracted sound and alive but also lived to be lieutenant general of the city of cherez the surprising manner in which he came into the world laid a foundation for his being called the son of the earth  from these histories caspar reies draws the following consequence it is evident that children dont die with their mothers when the latter die near the periods of their deliveries sennertus affirms not only that they live for some time after their mothers are dead but also that we may and even ought to extract them alive from the uterus vincelius has composed two treatises in order to prove these truths which are also sufficiently established in the dissertations of nymman de vita foetus in utero where as well as in other authors we find a great many similar histories and others of women who have been delivered of live children after their own death the reader may also consult raynaud de ortu infantum contra naturam hence it is obvious that we ought not to be too rash and precipitate in burying pregnant women who die near their times i am not certain whether these women were dead or alive at the time of their interment though it appears evident from the circumstances that the first was buried alive for horstius proves from another fact that dead women may be delivered of children thus he informs us that a woman big with child being hanged along with her husband by the spanish soldiers between deventer and zutphen was four hours after her death delivered of live twins  thomas bartholin in act hasn an      relates an history which proves the same truth and which is that of a child born two days after the death of its mother which happened in a labor in which three midwives had employed all their art and skill thus it is certain from experience that dead women may be delivered of live children and this has perhaps laid a foundation for the whimsical and superstitious practice of putting into the coffins of women who die big with child a needle a thread and a pair of scissars as if the manes stood in need of those instruments to tie and cut the umbilical chord of the infant about to be born in short it has been observed that infants have been born in the coffins of their mothers  the same author also mentions a woman who in      on thursday about   oclock at night died of epileptic fits on the friday the foam was discharged from her mouth cries resembling those of an infant were heard and a sensible motion was observed in the abdomen of the mother on saturday about  0 oclock in the morning the woman discharged a great deal of blood so that on changing her linen her infant still warm was found lying betwixt her things bartholin adds that the physicians of the town were of opinion that the mother had only died when her mouth became full of froth without which circumstance the infant could not probably have lived  in the miscellanea naturae curios we have instances of women who have died near their time and been delivered sometimes of dead sometimes of live children sometimes one two and three days after their deaths these instances are recorded by resler first physician to the prince of brieg in obs     an   by polisius in obs    an   by doleus in decus   an   obs     by hoyer in decur   an and lastly by hartmanus in observat    of the same volume  from what has been said it is sufficiently obvious that those persons are greatly mistaken who suppose that the foetus does not survive its mother for it is evinced from a number of observations that the life of the foetus is sustained by a circulation peculiar to itself that the umbilical arteries which terminate in the placenta convey thither a quantity of blood which is carried back by the umbilical vein without passing to the mother and that if this blood undergoes any change it is only from a lymphatic or lacteal liquor which the roots of the placenta imbibe from the uterine vessels these truths are at present universally agreed upon so that before the death of the mother can destroy the life of the child it is necessary to prove first that the lacteal liquor ceases to be filtrated immediately after the death of the mother secondly that the suppression of this filtration is an infallible or even necessary cause of death in consequence of this we must prove that at every circulation the juices of the foetus have their nutritive and vivifying principles exhausted and that the foetus is incapable of sustaining in the uterus a degree of fasting which it often supports for several days after it is brought into the world now as these propositions cannot be proved so it cannot be evinced that the death of the mother is necessarily succeeded by that of the foetus so that it is certain we commit manifest homicide by interring pregnant women near their time without performing the caesarian operation upon them  this is no new doctrine since in the digest lib   tit   these words occur a royal edict prohibits the interment of dead pregnant woman before we have delivered them by means of the caesarian operation those who do otherwise appear to have destroyed with the pregnant woman the hope of obtaining a living man it is highly to be lamented that this law is not universally put in execution since it is a principle founded on the eternal and unalterable nature of things that we kill those whom we do not preserve when we have it in our power  if it should be objected that this operation would if not always yet at least very often prove an useless attempt i answer that it is an easy operation since it is performed by two or three strokes of the bistory and a few stitches of a needle besides though children after this operation should appear dead yet we are not to trust to those appearances unless putrefaction should remove all doubt  bhonius informs us that the faculty of medicine at wurtemberg being consulted in a criminal process raised against a mother for killing her own child answered that children were sometimes born so weak as to appear for a considerable time without sensation motion and respiration and that it was necessary to use vellications fomentations aspersions of wine spirits of wine or aqua vitae as also to make them swallow aromatic liquors or blow spirituous liquors into their mouths and nostrils till they begin to cry which is an infallible mark that the air has entered the lungs  as to these measures we have before shown that they have an evident tendency to restore life but we must not here pass over a practice which of all others seems to be of the greatest importance to stillborn children which is the sucking the left nipple of the dead foetus this method as we are told in ephemerid nature curios dec   an   proved successful after vellications frictions spirituous liquors and other methods had been tried in vain various other instances of the success of this practice are found in the same work and in the writings of other practical authors though this method may at first seem ridiculous yet it will appear of the last importance to the anatomist who knows the sensibility of the breast all whose nerves center in the nipple hannemaun also orders a sponge dipped in red wine or aqua vitae to be applied to the left breast and pit of the stomach of stillborn children heister when speaking of such newborn children as are excessively weak or hardly appear to be alive orders a robust sound man to breath into their mouths immediately after he has drank a dram of brandy  the last method of restoring stillborn children to life is to blow into their mouths as is obvious from various wellattested observations with two of which we shall put a period to this work  borelli in hist cent   observe    relates that a servant returning from the fields and finding his master whom he greatly loved lying dead he embraced him for a long time and by accidentally breathing in his mouth gradually restored him to life  the learned grubelius in miscellan not curios dec   an  0 obs    informs us that whilst a physician was preparing the remedies proper to restore to life a woman who had fallen into such a syncope that she was thought dead her own servant who had a great attachment to her restored her to life by blowing in her mouth but it is probable that this method produces its happy effects rather by restoring the motion of the blood and lungs than by means of that vivifying principle which some superstitious authors suppose to be lodged in the human breath  finis
