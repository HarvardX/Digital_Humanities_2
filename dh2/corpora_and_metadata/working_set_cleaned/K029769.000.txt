the captives a tragedy as performed at the theater royal drury lane  by the author of the royal suppliants  london printed for t cadell in the strand  m dcc lxxxvi  advertisement the captives are at length released from the theater where they have been confined for more than three months and now they hope to find a sanctuary in the closet it was the intention of the author throughout his piece to make experiment of a style and diction different from what are usual in modern tragedy overwrought ornaments and pompous versification he thought ill suited to the manners of those early times in which the action of his tragedy is supposed to have passed in a word he was of opinion that the language of simplicity would best accord with the subject and the characters but whether a plain intelligible and unaffected style would be acceptable to the public taste was what he had still to learn the experiment has been made and the author retires with the satisfaction of having at least

when i call all answer they refuse but say is it fit that mine be laid aside to gratify their present authors pride who comes with nature and such idle stuff as please my friends above there well enough  the galleries when i more bold and daring quit all rules in the pompous burlesque of tragedy and scorn to draw from classics and the schools but bid the dreadful surges from a grave to sink the merchant in the bankrupt wave or when i long for fair auroras light i am witchridden by the hag of night thus always keep sublimity in eye and sometimes hand in hand  simplicity new traps new passages for ever raise with starts and attitudes to gain your praise try every incident of trick and art to mend at once the drama and the heart such is my style and such each nervous line which all my friends who read pronounce divine and yet these hostile doors their barriers keep and all my labors  in my pockets sleep pointing to them revenge my cause assert each critic right and damn with me the author of tonight whose play though yet unknown untried unseen has felt in paragraphs an authors spleen but hark  i will tell you a secret  twas i who drew the shaft and forged the envenomed lie
