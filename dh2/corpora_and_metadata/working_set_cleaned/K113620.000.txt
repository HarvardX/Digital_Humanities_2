the life of henry st john lord viscount bolingbroke  london printed for t davies in russel street covent garden    0  the life of henry lord viscount bolingbroke there are some characters that seem formed by nature to take delight in struggling with opposition and whose most agreeable hours are passed in storms of their own creating the subject of the present sketch was perhaps of all others the most indefatigable in raising himself enemies to show his power in subduing them and was not less employed in improving his superior talents than in finding objects on which to exercise their activity his life was spent in a continued conflict of politics and as if that was too short for the combat he has left his memory as a subject of lasting contention  it is indeed no easy matter to preserve an acknowledged impartiality in talking of a man so differently regarded on account of his political as well as his religious principles those whom his politics may please will be sure to condemn him for his religion and on the contrary those most strongly attached to his theological opinions are the most likely to decry his politics on whatever side he is regarded he is sure to have opposers and this was perhaps what he most desired having from nature a mind better pleased with the struggle than the victory  henry st john lord viscount bolingbroke was born in the year      at battersea in surry at a seat that had been in the possession of his ancestors for ages before his family was of the first rank equally conspicuous for its antiquity dignity and large possessions it is found to trace its original as high as adam de port baron of basing in hampshire before the conquest and in a succession of ages to have produced warriors patriots and statesmen some of whom were conspicuous for their loyalty and others for their defending the rights of the people his grandfather sir walter st john of battersea marrying one of the daughters of lord chief justice st john who as all know was strongly attached to the republican party henry the subject of the present memoir was brought up in his family and consequently imbibed the first principles of his education amongst the dissenters at that time daniel burgess a fanatic of a very peculiar kind being at once possessed of zeal and humor and as well known for the archness of his conceits as the furious obstinacy of his principles was confessor in the presbyterian way to his grandmother and was appointed to direct our authors first studies nothing is so apt to disgust a feeling mind as mistaken zeal and perhaps the absurdity of the first lectures he received might have given him that contempt for all religions which he might have justly conceived against one indeed no task can be more mortifying than that he was condemned to undergo i was obliged says he in one place while yet a boy to read over the commentaries of dr manton whose pride it was to have made an hundred and nineteen sermons on the hundred and nineteenth psalm dr manton and his sermons were not likely to prevail much on one who was perhaps the most sharpsighted in the world at discovering the absurdities of others however he might have been guilty of establishing many of his own  but these dreary institutions were of no very long continuance as soon as it was fit to take him out of the hands of the women he was sent to eaton school and removed thence to christchurch college in oxford his genius and understanding were seen and admired in both these seminaries but his love of pleasure had so much the ascendency that he seemed contented rather with the consciousness of his own great powers than their exertion however his friends and those who knew him most intimately were thoroughly sensible of the extent of his mind and when he left the university he was considered as one who had the fairest opportunity of making a shining figure in active life  nature seemed not less kind to him in her external embellishments than in adorning his mind with the graces of an handsome person and a face in which dignity was happily blended with sweetness he had a manner of address that was very engaging his vivacity was always awake his apprehension was quick his wit refined and his memory amazing his subtilty in thinking and reasoning were profound and all these talents were adorned with an elocution that was irresistible  to the assemblage of so many gifts from nature it was expected that art would soon give her finishing hand and that a youth begun in excellence would soon arrive at perfection but such is the perverseness of human nature that an age which should have been employed in the acquisition of knowledge was dissipated in pleasure and instead of aiming to excel in praiseworthy pursuits bolingbroke seemed more ambitious of being thought the greatest rake about town this period might have been compared to that of fermentation in liquors which grow muddy before they brighten but it must also be confessed that those liquors which never ferment are seldom clear in this state of disorder he was not without his lucid intervals and even while he was noted for keeping miss gumley the most expensive prostitute in the kingdom and bearing the greatest quantity of wine without intoxication he even then despised his paltry ambition the love of study says he and desire of knowledge were what i felt all my life and though my genius unlike the demon of socrates whispered so softly that very often i heard him not in the hurry of these passions with which i was transported yet some calmer hours there were and in them i hearkened to him these secret admonitions were indeed very few since his excesses are remembered to this very day i have spoke to an old man who assured me that he saw him and another of his companions run naked through the park in a fit of intoxication but then it was a time when public decency might be transgressed with less danger than at present  during this period as all his attachments were to pleasure so his studies only seemed to lean that way his first attempts were in poetry in which he discovers more wit than taste more labor than harmony in his versification we have a copy of his verses prefixed to drydens virgil complimenting the poet and praising his translation we have another not so well known prefixed to a french work published in holland by the chevalier de st hyacinth entitled le chef de oeuvre dun inconnu this performance is an humorous piece of criticism upon a miserable old ballad and bolingbrokes compliment though written in english is printed in greek characters so that at the first glance it may deceive the eye and be mistaken for real greek there are two or three things more of his composition which have appeared since his death but which neither do honor to his parts or memory  in this mad career of pleasure he continued for some time but at length in   00 when he arrived at the twentyeighth year of his age he began to take a dislike to his method of living and to find that sensual pleasure alone was not sufficient to make the happiness of a reasonable creature he therefore made his first effort to break from his state of infatuation by marrying the daughter and coheiress of sir henry winchescomb a descendant from the famous jack of newbury who though but a clothier in the reign of henry viii was able to entertain the king and all his retinue in the most splendid manner this lady was possessed of a fortune exceeding forty thousand pounds and was not deficient in mental accomplishments but whether he was not yet fully satiated with his former pleasures or whether her temper was not conformable to his own it is certain they were far from living happily together after cohabiting for some time together they parted by mutual consent both equally displeased he complaining of the obstinacy of her temper she of the shamelessness of his infidelity a great part of her fortune some time after upon his attainder was given her back but as her family estates were settled upon him he enjoyed them after her death upon the reversal of his attainder  having taken a resolution to quit the allurements of pleasure for the stronger attractions of ambition soon after his marriage he procured a seat in the house of commons being elected for the borough of wottonbasset in wiltshire his father having served several times sor the same place besides his natural endowments and his large fortune he had other very considerable advantages that gave him weight in the senate and seconded his views of preferment his grandfather sir walter st john was still alive and that gentlemans interest was so great in his own county of wilts that he represented it in two parliaments in a former reign his father also was then the representative for the same and the interest of his wifes family in the house was very extensive thus bolingbroke took his seat with many accidental helps but his chief and great resource lay in his own extensive abilities  at that time the whig and the tory parties were strongly opposed in the house and pretty nearly balanced in the latter years of king william the tories who from every motive were opposed to the court had been gaining popularity and now began to make a public stand against their competitors robert harley afterward earl of oxford a staunch and confirmed tory was in the year   00 chosen speaker of the house of commons and was continued in the same upon the accession of queen anne the year ensuing bolingbroke had all along been bred up as was before observed among the dissenters his friends leaned to that persuasion and all his connexions were in the whig interest however either from principle or from perceiving the tory party to be then gaining ground while the whigs were declining he soon changed his connexions and joined himself to harley for whom he then had the greatest esteem nor did he bring him his vote alone but his opinion which even before the end of his first session he rendered very considerable the house perceiving even in so young a speaker the greatest eloquence united with the profoundest discernment the year following he was again chosen anew for the same borough and persevered in his former attachments by which he gained such an authority and influence in the house that it was thought proper to reward his merit and on the  0th of april   0  he was appointed secretary at war and of the marines his friend harley having a little before been made secretary of state  the tory party being thus established in power it may easily be supposed that every method would be used to depress the whig interest and to prevent it from rising yet so much justice was done even to merit in an enemy that the duke of marlborough who might be considered as at the head of the opposite party was supplied with all the necessaries for carrying on the war in flanders with vigor and it is remarkable that the greatest events of his campaigns such as the battles of blenheim and ramillies and several glorious attempts made by the duke to shorten the war by some decisive action fell out while bolingbroke was secretary at war in fact he was a sincere admirer of that great general and avowed it upon all occasions to the last moment of his life he knew his faults he admired his virtues and had the boast of being instrumental in giving luster to those triumphs by which his own power was in a manner overthrown  as the affairs of the nation were then in as fluctuating a state as at present harley after maintaining the lead for above three years was in his turn obliged to submit to the whigs who once more became the prevailing party and he was compelled to resign the seals the friendship between him and bolingbroke seems at this time to have been sincere and disinterested for the latter chose to follow his fortune and the next day resigned his employments in the administration following his friends example and setting an example at once of integrity and moderation as an instance of this when his coadjutors the tories were for carrying a violent measure in the house of commons in order to bring the princess sophia into england bolingbroke so artfully opposed it that it dropped without a debate for this his moderation was praised but perhaps at the expense of his sagacity  for some time the whigs seemed to have gained a complete triumph and upon the election of a new parliament in the year   0  bolingbroke was not returned the interval which followed of above two years he employed in the severest study and this recluse period he ever after used to consider as the most active and serviceable of his whole life but his retirement was soon interrupted by the prevailing of his party once more for the whig parliament being dissolved in the year    0 he was again chosen and harley being made chancellor and under treasurer of the exchequer the important post of secretary of state was given to our author in which he discovered a degree of genius and assiduity that perhaps have never been known to be united in one person to the same degree  the english annals scarce produce a more trying juncture or that required such various abilities to regulate he was then placed in a sphere where he was obliged to conduct the machine of state struggling with a thousand various calamities a desperate and enraged party whose characteristic it has ever been to bear none in power but themselves a war conducted by an able general his professed opponent and whose victories only tended to render him every day more formidable a foreign enemy possessed of endless resources and seeming to gather strength from every defeat an insidious alliance that wanted only to gain the advantages of victory without contributing to the expenses of the combat a weak declining mistress that was led by every report and seemed ready to listen to whatever was said against him still more a gloomy indolent and suspicious colleague that envied his power and hated him for his abilities these were a part of the difficulties that bolingbroke had to struggle with in office and under which he was to conduct the treaty of the peace of utrecht which was considered as one of the most complicated negotiations that history can afford but nothing seemed too great for his abilities and industry he set himself to the undertaking with spirit he began to pave the way to the intended treaty by making the people discontented at the continuance of the war for this purpose he employed himself in drawing up accurate computations of the numbers of our own men and that of foreigners employed in its destructive progress he even wrote in the examiners and other periodical papers of the times showing how much of the burden rested upon england and how little was sustained by those who falsely boasted their alliance by these means and after much debate in the house of commons the queen received a petition from parliament showing the hardships the allies had put upon england in carrying on this war and consequently how necessary it was to apply relief to so illjudged a connection it may be easily supposed that the dutch against whom this petition was chiefly levelled did all that was in their power to oppose it many of the foreign courts also with whom we had any transactions were continually at work to defeat the ministers intentions memorial was delivered after memorial the people of england the parliament and all europe were made acquainted with the injustice and the dangers of such a proceeding however bolingbroke went on with steadiness and resolution and although the attacks of his enemies at home might have been deemed sufficient to employ his attention yet he was obliged at the same time that he furnished materials to the press in london to furnish instructions to all our ministers and ambassadors abroad who would do nothing but in pursuance of his directions as an orator in the senate he exerted all his eloquence he stated all the great points that were brought before the house he answered the objections that were made by the leaders of the opposition and all this with such success that even his enemies while they opposed his power acknowledged his abilities indeed such were the difficulties he had to encounter that we find him acknowledging himself some years after that he never looked back on this great event passed as it was without a secret emotion of mind when he compared the vastness of the undertaking and the importance of the success with the means employed to bring it about and with those which were employed to frustrate his intentions  while he was thus industriously employed he was not without the rewards that deserved to follow such abilities joined to so much assiduity in july      he was created baron st john of lidyard tregoze in wiltshire and viscount bolingbroke by the last of which titles he is now generally known and is likely to be talked of by posterity he was also the same year appointed lord lieutenant of the county of essex by the titles of tregoze and bolingbroke he united the honors of the elder and younger branch of his family and thus transmitted into one channel the opposing interests of two races that had been distinguished one for their loyalty to king charles i the other for their attachment to the parliament that opposed him it was afterward his boast that he steered clear of the extremes for which his ancestors had been distinguished having kept the spirit of freedom of the one and acknowledged the subordination that distinguished the other  bolingbroke being thus raised very near the summit of power began to perceive more nearly the defects of him who was placed there he now began to find that lord oxford whose party he had followed and whose person he had esteemed was by no means so able or so industrious as he supposed him to be he now began from his heart to renounce the friendship which he once had for his coadjutor he began to imagine him treacherous mean indolent and invidious he even began to ascribe his own promotion to oxfords hatred and to suppose that he was sent up to the house of lords only to render him contemptible these suspicions were partly true and partly suggested by bolingbrokes own ambition being sensible of his own superior importance and capacity he could not bear to see another take the lead in public affairs when he knew they owed their chief success to his own management whatever might have been his motives whether of contempt hatred or ambition it is certain an irreconcilable breach began between these two leaders of their party their mutual hatred was so great that even their own common interest the vigor of their negotiations and the safety of their friends were entirely sacrificed to it it was in vain that swift who was admitted into their counsels urged the unseasonable impropriety of their disputes that while they were thus at variance within the walls the enemy were making irreparable breaches without bolingbrokes antipathy was so great that even success would have been hateful to him if lord oxford were to be a partner he abhorred him to that degree that he could not bear to be joined with him in any case and even some time after when the lives of both were aimed at he could not think of concerting measures with him for their mutual safety preferring even death itself to the appearance of a temporary friendship  nothing could have been more weak and injudicious than their mutual animosities at this juncture and it may be asserted with truth that men who were unable to suppress or conceal their resentments upon such a trying occasion were unfit to take the lead in any measures be their industry or their abilities ever so great in fact their dissentions were soon found to involve not only them but their party in utter ruin their hopes had for some time been declining the whigs were daily gaining ground and the queens death soon after totally destroyed all their schemes with their power  upon the accession of george i to the throne dangers began to threaten the late ministry on every side whether they had really intentions of bringing in the pretender or whether the whigs made it a pretext for destroying them is uncertain but the king very soon began to show that they were to expect neither savor nor mercy at his hands upon his landing at greenwich when the court came to wait upon him and lord oxford among the number he studiously avoided taking any notice of him and testified his resentment by the caresses he bestowed upon the members of the opposite faction a regency had been some time before appointed to govern the kingdom and addison was made secretary bolingbroke still maintained his place of state secretary but subject to the contempt of the great and the insults of the mean the first step taken by them to mortify him was to order all letters and packets directed to the secretary of state to be sent to mr addison so that bolingbroke was in fact removed from his office that is the execution of it in two days after the queens death but this was not the worst for his mortifications were continually heightened by the daily humiliation of waiting at the door of the apartment where the regency sat with a bag in his hand and being all the time as it were on purpose exposed to the insolence of those who were tempted by their natural malevolence or who expected to make their court to those in power by abusing him  upon this sudden turn of fortune when the seals were taken from him he went into the country and having received a message from court to be present when the seal was taken from the door of the secretarys office he excused himself alleging that so trifling a ceremony might as well be performed by one of the under secretaries but at the same time requested the honor of kissing the kings hand to whom he testified the utmost submission this request however was rejected with disdain the king had been taught to regard him as an enemy and threw himself entirely on the whigs for safety and protection  the new parliament mostly composed of whigs met the   th of march and in the kings speech from the throne many inflaming hints were given and many methods of violence were chalked out to the two houses the first steps says lord bolingbroke speaking on this occasion in both were perfectly answerable and to the shame of the peerage be it spoken i saw at that time several lords concur to condemn in one general vote all that they had approved in a former parliament by many particular resolutions among several bloody resolutions proposed and agitated at this time the resolution of impeaching me of high treason was taken and i took that of leaving england not in a panic terror improved by the artifices of the duke of marlborough whom i knew even at that time too well to act by his advice or information in any case but on such grounds as the proceedings which soon followed sufficiently justified and such as i have never repented building upon those who blamed it in the first heat were soon after obliged to change their language for what other resolution could i take the method of prosecution designed against me would have put me out of a condition immediately to act for myself or to serve those who were less exposed than me but who were however in danger on the other hand how few were there on whose assistance i could depend or to whom i would even in these circumstances be obliged the ferment in the nation was wrought up to a considerable height but there was at that time no reason to expect that it could influence the proceedings in parliament in favor of those who should be accused left to its own movement it was much more proper to quicken than slacken the prosecutions and who was there to guide its motions the tories who had been true to one another to the last were a handful and no great vigor could be expected from them the whimsicals disappointed of the figure which they hoped to make began indeed to join their old friends one of the principal among them namely the earl of anglesea was so very good as to confess to me that if the court had called the servants of the late queen to account and stopped there he must have considered himself as a judge and acted according to his conscience on what should have appeared to him but that war had been declared to the whole tory party and that now the state of things were altered this discourse needed no commentary and proved to me that i had never erred in the judgment i made of this set of men could i then resolve to be obliged to them or to suffer with oxford as much as i still was heated by the disputes in which i had been all my life engaged against the whigs i would sooner have chosen to owe my security to their indulgence than to the assistance of the whimsicals but i thought banishment with all her train of evils preferable to either  such was the miserable situation to which he was reduced upon this occasion of all the number of his former flatterers and dependants scarce one was found remaining every hour brought fresh reports of his alarming situation and the dangers which threatened him and his party on all sides prior who had been employed in negotiating the treaty of utrecht was come over to dover and had promised to reveal all he knew the duke of marlborough planted his creatures round his lordship who artfully endeavored to increase the danger and an impeachment was actually preparing in which he was accused of high treason it argued therefore no great degree of timidity in his lordship to take the first opportunity to withdraw from danger and to suffer the first boilings of popular animosity to quench the flame that had been raised against him accordingly having made a gallant show of despising the machinations against him having appeared in a very unconcerned manner at the playhouse in drury lane and having bespoke another play for the night ensuing having subscribed to a new opera that was to be acted some time after and talked of making an elaborate defense he went off that same night in disguise to dover as a servant to le vigne a messenger belonging to the french king and there one william morgan who had been a captain in general hills regiment of dragoons hired a vessel and carried him over to calais where the governor attended him in his coach and carried him to his house with all possible distinction  the news of lord bolingbrokes flight was soon known over the whole town and the next day a letter from him to lord lansdowne was handed about in print to the following effect  my lord i left the town so abruptly that i had no time to take leave of you or any of my friends you will excuse me when you know that i had certain and repeated informations from some who are in the secret of affairs that a resolution was taken by those who have power to execute it to pursue me to the scaffold my blood was to have been the cement of a new alliance nor could my innocence be any security after it had once been demanded from abroad and resolved on at home that it was necessary to cut me off had there been the least reason to hope for a fair and open trial after having been already prejudged unheard by two houses of parliament i should not have declined the strictest examination i challenge the most inveterate of my enemies to produce any one instance of a criminal correspondence or the least corruption of any part of the administration in which i was concerned if my zeal for the honor and dignity of my royal mistress and the true interest of my country has any where transported me to let slip a warm or unguarded expression i hope the most favorable interpretation will be put upon it it is a comfort that will remain with me in all my misfortunes that i served her majesty faithfully and dutifully in that especially which she had most at heart relieving her people from a bloody and expensive war and that i have also been too much an englishman to sacrifice the interest of my country to any foreign ally and it is for this crime only that i am now driven from thence you shall hear more at large from me shortly  yours etc   no sooner was it universally known that he was retired to france than his flight was construed into a proof of his guilt and his enemies accordingly set about driving on his impeachment with redoubled alacrity mr afterward sir robert walpole who had suffered a good deal by his attachment to the whig interest during the former reign now undertook to bring in and conduct the charge against him in the house of commons his impeachment consisted of six articles which walpole read to the house in substance as follows first that whereas the lord bolingbroke had assured the dutch ministers that the queen his mistress would make no peace but in concert with them yet he had sent mr prior to france that same year with proposals for a treaty of peace with that monarch without the consent of the allies secondly that he advised and promoted the making a separate treaty or convention with france which was signed in september thirdly that he disclosed to m mesnager the french minister at london this convention which was the preliminary instructions to her majestys plenipotentiaries at utrecht fourthly that her majestys final instructions to her plenipotentiaries were disclosed by him to the abbot gualtier who was an emissary of france fifthly that he disclosed to the french the manner how tournay in flanders might be gained by them and lastly that he advised and promoted the yielding up spain and the west indies to the duke of anjou then an enemy to her majesty these were urged by walpole with great vehemence and aggravated with all the eloquence of which he was master he challenged any person in the house to appear in behalf of the accused and asserted that to vindicate were in a manner to share his guilt in this universal consternation of the tory party none was for some time seen to stir but at length general ross who had received favors from his lordship boldly stood up and said he wondered that no man more capable was found to appear in defense of the accused however in attempting to proceed he hesitated so much that he was obliged to sit down observing that he would reserve what he had to say to another opportunity it may easily be supposed that the whigs found no great difficulty in passing the vote for his impeachment through the house of commons it was brought into that house on the  0th of june      it was sent up to the house of lords on the  th of august ensuing and in consequence of which he was attainted by them of high treason on the  0th of september nothing could be more unjust than such a sentence but justice had been long drowned in the spirit of party  bolingbroke thus finding all hopes cut off at home began to think of improving his wretched fortune upon the continent he had left england with a very small fortune and his attainder totally cut off all resources for the future in this depressed situation he began to listen to some proposals which were made him by the pretender who was then residing at bar in france and who was desirous of admitting bolingbroke into his secret councils a proposal of this nature had been made him shortly after his arrival at paris and before his attainder at home but while he had yet any hopes of succeeding in england he absolutely refused and made the best applications his ruined fortune would permit to prevent the extremity of his prosecution  he had for some time waited for an opportunity of determining himself even after he found it vain to think of making his peace at home he let his jacobite friends in england know that they had but to command him and he was ready to venture in their service the little all that remained as frankly as he had exposed all that was gone at length says he talking of himself these commands came and were executed in the following manner the person who was sent to me arrived in the beginning of july      at the place where i had retired to in dauphine he spoke in the name of all the friends whose authority could influence me and he brought me word that scotland was not only ready to take arms but under some sort of dissatisfaction to be withheld from beginning that in england the people were exasperated against the government to such a degree that far from wanting to be encouraged they could not be restrained from insulting it on every occasion that the whole tory party was become avowedly jacobites that many officers of the army and the majority of the soldiers were well affected to the cause that the city of london was ready to rise and that the enterprises for seizing of several places were ripe for execution in a word that most of the principal tories were in a concert with the duke of ormond for i had pressed particularly to be informed whether his grace acted alone or if not who were his council and that the others were so disposed that there remained no doubt of their joining as soon as the first blow should be struck he added that my friends were a little surprised to observe that i lay neuter in such a conjuncture he represented to me the danger i ran of being prevented by people of all sides from having the merit of engaging early in this enterprise and how unaccountable it would be for a man impeached and attainted under the present government to take no share in bringing about a revolution so near at hand and so certain he entreated that i would defer no longer to join the chevalier to advise and assist in carrying on his affairs and to solicit and negotiate at the court of france where my friends imagined that i should not fail to meet a favorable reception and from whence they made no doubt of receiving assistance in a situation of affairs so critical so unexpected and so promising he concluded by giving me a letter from the pretender whom he had seen in his way to me in which i was pressed to repair without loss of time to comercy and this instance was grounded on the message which the bearer of the letter had brought me from england in the progress of the conversation with the messenger he related a number of facts which satisfied me as to the general disposition of the people but he gave me little satisfaction as to the measures taken to improve this disposition for driving the business on with vigor if it tended to a revolution or for supporting it to advantage if it spun into a war when i questioned him concerning several persons whose disinclination to the government admitted no doubt and whose names quality and experience were very essential to the success of the undertaking he owned to me that they kept a great reserve and did at most but encourage others to act by general and dark expressions i received this account and this summons ill in my my bed yet important as the matter was a few minutes served to determine me the circumstances wanting to form a reasonable inducement to engage did not excuse me but the smart of a bill of attainder tingled in every vein and i looked on my party to be under oppression and to call for my assistance besides which i considered first that i should be certainly informed when i conferred with the chevalier of many particulars unknown to this gentleman for i did not imagine that the english could be so near to take up arms as he represented them to be on no other foundation than that which he exposed  in this manner having for some time debated with himself and taken his resolution he lost no time in repairing to the pretender at comercy and took the seals of that nominal king as he had formerly those of his potent mistress but this was a terrible falling off indeed and the very first conversation he had with this weak projector gave him the most unfavourable expectations of future success he talked to me says his lordship like a man who expected every moment to set out for england or scotland but who did not very well know for which and when he entered into the particulars of his affairs i found that concerning the former he had nothing more circumstantial or positive to go upon than what i have already related but the duke of ormond had been for some time i cannot say how long engaged with the chevalier he had taken the direction of this whole affair as far as it related to england upon himself and had received a commission for this purpose which contained the most ample powers that could be given but still however all was unsettled undetermined and ill understood the duke had asked from france a small body of forces a sum of money and a quantity of ammunition but to the first part of the request he received a flat denial but was made to hope that some arms and some ammunition might be given this was but a very gloomy prospect yet hope swelled the depressed party so high that they talked of nothing less than an instant and ready revolution it was their interest to be secret and industrious but rendered sanguine by their passions they made no doubt of subverting a government with which they were angry and gave as great an alarm as would have been imprudent at the eve of a general insurrection  such was the state of things when bolingbroke arrived to take up his new office at comercy and although he saw the deplorable state of the party with which he was embarked yet he resolved to give his affairs the best complexion he was able and set out for paris in order to procure from that court the necessary succors for his new masters invasion of england but his reception and negotiations at paris were still more unpromising than those at comercy and nothing but absolute infatuation seemed to dictate every measure taken by the party he there found a multitude of people at work and every one doing what seemed good in his own eyes no subordination no order no concert the jacobites had wrought one another up to look upon the success of the present designs as infallible every meeting house which the populace demolished as he himself says every little drunken riot which happened served to confirm them in these sanguine expectations and there was hardly one among them who would lose the air of contributing by his intrigues to the restoration which he took for granted would be brought about in a few weeks care and hope says our author very humorously sat on every busy irish face those who could read and write had letters to show and those who had not arrived to this pitch of erudition had their secrets to whisper no sex was excluded from this ministry fanny oglethorpe kept her corner in it and olive trant a woman of the same mixed reputation was the great wheel of this political machine the ridiculous correspondence was carried on with england by people of like importance and who were busy in sounding the alarm in the ears of an enemy whom it was their interest to surprise by these means as he himself continues to inform us the government of england was put on its guard so that before he came to paris what was doing had been discovered the little armament made at havre de grace which furnished the only means to the pretender of landing on the coasts of britain and which had exhausted the treasury of st germains was talked of publicly the earl of stair the english minister at that city very soon discovered its destination and all the particulars of the intended invasion the names of the persons from whom supplies came and who were particularly active in the design were whispered about at teatables and coffeehouses in short what by the indiscretion of the projectors what by the private interests and ambitious views of the french the most private transactions came to light and such of the more prudent plotters who supposed that they had trusted their heads to the keeping of one or two friends were in reality at the mercy of numbers into such company exclaims our noble writer was i fallen for my sins still however he went on steering in the wide ocean without a compass till the death of lewis xiv and the arrival of the duke of ormond at paris rendered all his endeavors abortive yet notwithstanding these unfavourable circumstances he still continued to dispatch several messages and directions for england to which he received very evasive and ambiguous answers among the number of these he drew up a paper at chaville in concert with the duke of ormond marshal berwick and de torcy which was sent to england just before the death of the king of france representing that france could not answer the demands of their memorial and praying directions what to do a reply to this came to him through the french secretary of state wherein they declared themselves unable to say any thing till they saw what turn affairs would take on the death of the king which had reached their ears upon another occasion a message coming from scotland to press the chevalier to hasten their rising he dispatched a messenger to london to the earl of mar to tell him that the concurrence of england in the insurrection was ardently wished and expected but instead of that noblemans waiting for instructions he had already gone into the highlands and had there actually put himself at the head of his clans after this in concert with the duke of ormond he dispatched one mr hamilton who got all the papers by heart for fear of a miscarriage to their friends in england to inform them that though the chevalier was destitute of succor and all reasonable hopes of it yet he would land as they pleased in england or scotland at a minutes warning and therefore they might rise immediately after they had sent dispatches to him to this message mr hamilton returned very soon with an answer given by lord lansdowne in the name of all the persons privy to the secret that since affairs grew daily worse and would not mend by delay the malcontents in england had resolved to declare immediately and would be ready to join the duke of ormond on his landing adding that his person would be as safe in england as in scotland and that in every other respect it was better he should land in england that they had used their utmost endeavors and hoped the western counties would be in a good posture to receive him and that he should land as near as possible to plymouth with these assurances the duke embarked though he had heard before of the seizure of many of his most zealous adherents of the dispersion of many more and the consternation of all so that upon his arrival at plymouth finding nothing in readiness he returned to britanny in these circumstances the pretender himself sent to have a vessel got ready for him at dunkirk in which he went to scotland leaving lord bolingbroke all this while at paris to try if by any means some assistance might not be procured without which all hopes of success were at an end it was during his negotiation upon this miserable proceeding that he was sent for by mrs trant a woman who had some time before ingratiated herself with the regent of france by supplying him with mistresses from england to a little house in the bois de boulogne where she lived with mademoiselle chaussery an old superannuated waiting woman belonging to the regent by these he was acquainted with the measures they had taken for the service of the duke of ormond although bolingbroke who was actual secretary to the negotiation had never been admitted to a confidence in their secrets he was therefore a little surprised at finding such mean agents employed without his privity and very soon found them utterly unequal to the task he quickly therefore withdrew himself from such wretched auxiliaries and the regent himself seemed pleased at his defection  in the mean time the pretender set sail from dunkirk for scotland and though bolingbroke had all along perceived that his cause was hopeless and his projects ill designed although he had met with nothing but opposition and disappointment in his service yet he considered that this of all others was the time he could not be permitted to relax in the cause he now therefore neglected no means forgot no argument which his understanding could suggest in applying to the court of france but his success was not answerable to his industry the king of france not able to furnish the pretender with money himself had writ some time before his death to his grandson the king of spain and had obtained from him a promise of forty thousand crowns a small part of this sum had been received by the queens treasurer at st germains and had been sent to scotland or employed to defray the expenses which were daily making on the coast at the same time bolingbroke pressed the spanish ambassador at paris and solicited the minister at the court of spain he took care to have a number of officers picked out of the irish troops which serve in france gave them their routes and sent a ship to receive and transport them to scotland still however the money came in so slowly and in such trifling sums that it turned to little account and the officers were on their way to the pretender at the same time he formed a design of engaging french privateers in the expedition that were to have carried whatever should be necessary to send to any part of britain in their first voyage and then to cruize under the pretenders commission he had actually agreed for some and had it in his power to have made the same bargain with others sweden on one side and scotland on the other could have afforded them retreats and if the war had been kept up in any part of the mountains this armament would have been of the utmost advantage but all his projects and negotiations failed by the pretenders precipitate return who was not above six weeks in his expedition and flew out of scotland even before all had been tried in his defense  the expedition being in this manner totally defeated bolingbroke now began to think that it was his duty as well as interest to save the poor remains of the disappointed party he never had any great opinion of the pretenders success before he set off but when this adventurer had taken the last step which it was in his power to make our secretary then resolved to suffer neither him nor the scotch to be any longer bubbles of their own credulity and of the scandalous artifices of the french court in a conversation he had with the marshal de huxelles he took occasion to declare that he would not be the instrument of amusing the scotch and since he was able to do them no other service he would at least inform them of what little dependence they might place upon assistance from france he added that he would send them vessels which with those already on the coast of scotland might serve to bring off the pretender the earl of mar and as many others as possible the marshal approved his resolution and advised him to execute it as the only thing which was left to do but in the mean time the pretender landed at graveline and gave orders to stop all vessels bound on his account to scotland and bolingbroke saw him the morning after his arrival at st germains and he received him with open arms  as it was the secretarys business as soon as bolingbroke heard of his return he went to acquaint the french court with it when it was recommended to him to advise the pretender to proceed to bar with all possible diligence and in this measure bolingbroke entirely concurred but the pretender himself was in no such haste he had a mind to stay some time at st germains and in the neighborhood of paris and to have a private meeting with the regent he accordingly sent bolingbroke to solicit this meeting who exerted all his influence in the negotiation he wrote and spoke to the marshal de huxelles who answered him by word of mouth and by letters refusing him by both and assuring him that the regent said the things which were asked were puerilities and swore he would not see him the secretary no ways displeased with his ill success returned with this answer to his master who acquiesced in this determination and declared he would instantly set out for lorrain at the same time assuring bolingbroke of his firm reliance on his integrity  however the pretender instead of taking post for lorrain as he had promised went to a little house in the bois de boulogne where his female ministers resided and there continued for several days seeing the spanish and swedish ministers and even the regent himself it might have been in these interviews that he was set against his new secretary and taught to believe that he had been remiss in his duty and false to his trust be this as it will a few days after the duke of ormond came to see bolingbroke and having first prepared him for the surprise put into his hands a note directed to the duke and a little scrip of paper directed to the secretary they were both in the pretenders handwriting and dated as if written by him on his way to lorrain but in this bolingbroke was not to be deceived who knew the place of his present residence in one of these papers the pretender declared that he had no further occasion for the secretarys service and the other was an order to him to give up the papers in his office all which he observes might have been contained in a lettercase of a moderate size he gave the duke the seals and some papers which he could readily come at but for some others in which there were several insinuations under the pretenders own hand reflecting upon the duke himself these he took care to convey by a safe hand since it would have been very improper that the duke should have seen them as he thus gave up without scruple all the papers which remained in his hands because he was determined never to make use of them so he declares he took a secret pride in never asking for those of his own which were in the pretenders hands contenting himself with making the duke understand how little need there was to get rid of a man in this manner who only wanted an opportunity to get rid of the pretender and his cause in fact if we survey the measures taken on the one side and the abilities of the man on the other it will not appear any way wonderful that he should be disgusted with a party who had neither principle to give a foundation to their hopes union to advance them or abilities to put them in motion  bolingbroke being thus dismissed from the pretenders service he supposed that he had got rid of the trouble and the ignominy of so mean an employment at the same time but he was mistaken he was no sooner rejected from the office than articles of impeachment were preferred against him in the same manner as he had before been impeached in england though not with such effectual injury to his person and fortune the articles of his impeachment by the pretender were branched out into seven heads in which he was accused of treachery incapacity and neglect the first was that he was never to be found by those who came to him about business and if by chance or stratagem they got hold of him he affected being in an hurry and by putting them off to another time still avoided giving them any answer the second was that the earl of mar complained by six different messengers at different times before the chevalier came from dunkirk of his being in want of arms and ammunition and prayed a speedy relief and though the things demanded were in my lords power there was not so much as one pound of powder in any of the ships which by his lordships directions parted from france thirdly the pretender himself after his arrival sent general hamilton to inform him that his want of arms and ammunition was such that he should be obliged to leave scotland unless he received speedy relief yet lord bolingbroke amused mr hamilton twelve days together and did not introduce him to any of the french ministers though he was referred to them for a particular account of affairs or so much as communicated his letters to the queen or any body else fourthly the count de castle blanco had for several months at havre a considerable quantity of arms and ammunition and did daily ask his lordships orders how to dispose of them but never got any instructions fifthly the pretenders friends at the french court had for some time past no very good opinion of his lordships integrity and a very bad one of his discretion sixthly at a time when many merchants in france would have carried privately any quantity of arms and ammunition into scotland his lordship desired a public order for the embarkation which being a thing not to be granted is said to have been done in order to urge a denial lastly the pretender wrote to his lordship by every occasion after his arrival in scotland and though there were many opportunities of writing in return yet from the time he landed there to the day he left it he never received any letter from his lordship such were the articles by a very extraordinary reverse of fortune preferred against lord bolingbroke in less than a year after similar articles were drawn up against him by the opposite party at home it is not easy to find out what he could have done thus to disoblige all sides but he had learned by this time to make out happiness from the consciousness of his own designs and to consider all the rest of mankind as uniting in a faction to oppress virtue  but though it was mortifying to be thus rejected on both sides yet he was not remiss in vindicating himself from all against these articles of impeachment therefore he drew up an elaborate answer in which he vindicates himself with great plausibility he had long as he assures wished to leave the pretenders service but was entirely at a loss how to conduct himself in so difficult a resignation but at length says he the pretender and his council disposed of things better for me than i could have done for myself i had resolved on his return from scotland to follow him till his residence should be fixed somewhere after which having served the tories in this which i looked upon as their last struggle for power and having continued to act in the pretenders affairs till the end of the term for which i embarked with him i should have esteemed myself to be at liberty and should in the civilest manner i was able have taken my leave of him had we parted thus i should have remained in a very strange situation all the rest of my life on one side he would have thought that he had a right on any future occasion to call me out of my retreat the tories would probably have thought the same thing my resolution was taken to refuse them both and i foresaw that both would condemn me on the other side the consideration of his having kept measures with me joined to that of having once openly declared for him would have created a point of honor by which i should have been tied down not only from ever engaging against him but also from making my peace at home the pretender cut this gordian knot asunder at one blow he broke the links of that chain which former engagements had fastened on me and gave me a right to esteem myself as free from all obligations of keeping measures with him as i should have continued if i had never engaged in his interest  it is not to be supposed that one so very delicate to preserve his honor would previously have basely betrayed his employer a man conscious of acting so infamous a part would have undertaken no defense but let the accusations which could not materially affect him blow over and wait for the calm that was to succeed in tranquillity he appeals to all the ministers with whom he transacted business for the integrity of his proceedings at that juncture and had he been really guilty when he opposed the ministry here after his return they would not have failed to brand and detect his duplicity the truth is that he perhaps was the most disinterested minister at that time in the pretenders court as he had spent great sums of his own money in his service and never would be obliged to him for a farthing in which case he believes that he was single his integrity is much less impeachable on this occasion than his ambition for all the steps he took may be fairly ascribed to his displeasure at having the duke of ormond and the earl of mar treated more confidentially than himself it was his aim always to be foremost in every administration and he could not bear to act as a subaltern in so paltry a court as that of the pretender  at all periods of his exile he still looked toward home with secret regret and had taken every opportunity to apply to those in power either to soften his prosecutions or lessen the number of his enemies at home in accepting his office under the pretender he made it a condition to be at liberty to quit the post whenever he should think proper and being now disgracefully dismissed he turned his mind entirely toward making his peace in england and employing all the unfortunate experience he had acquired to undeceive his tory friends and to promote the union and quiet of his native country it was not a little favorable to his hopes that about this time though unknown to him the earl of stair ambassador to the french court had received full power to treat with him whilst he was engaged with the pretender but yet had never made him any proposals which might be considered as the grossest outrage but when the breach with the pretender was universally known the earl sent one monsieur saludin a gentleman of geneva to lord bolingbroke to communicate to him his majesty king georges favorable disposition to grant him a pardon and his own earnest desire to serve him as far as he was able this was an offer by much too advantageours for bolingbroke in his wretched circumstances to refuse he embraced it as became him to do with all possible sense of the kings goodness and of the ambassadors friendship they had frequent conferences shortly after upon the subject the turn which the english ministry gave the matter was to enter into a treaty to reverse his attainder and to stipulate the conditions on which this act of grace should be granted him but this method of negotiation he would by no means submit to the notion of a treaty shocked him and he resolved never to be restored rather than go that way to work accordingly he opened himself without any reserve to lord stair and told him that he looked upon himself obliged in honor and conscience to undeceive his friends in england both as to the state of foreign affairs as to the management of the jacobite interest abroad and as to the characters of the persons in every one of which points he knew them to be most grossly and most dangerously deluded he observed that the treatment he had received from the pretender and his adherents would justify him to the world in doing this that if he remained in exile all his life that he might be assured that he would never have more to do with the jacobite cause and that if he were restored he would give it an effectual blow in making that apology which the pretender had put him under a necessity of making that in doing this he flattered himself that he should contribute something toward the establishment of the kings government and to the union of his subjects he added that if the court thought him sincere in those professions a treaty with him was unnecessary and if they did not believe so then a treaty would be dangerous to him the earl of stair who has also confirmed this account of lord bolingbrokes in a letter to mr craggs readily came into his sentiments on this head and soon after the king approved it upon their representations he accordingly received a promise of pardon from george i who on the  d of july      created his father baron of battersea in the county of surry and viscount st john this seemed preparatory to his own restoration and instead of prosecuting any farther ambitious schemes against the government he rather began to turn his mind to philosophy and since he could not gratify his ambition to its full extent he endeavored to learn the arts of despising it the variety of distressful events that had hitherto attended all his struggles at last had thrown him into a state of reflection and this produced by way of relief a consolatio philosophica which he wrote the same year under the title of reflections upon exile in this piece in which he professes to imitate the manner of seneca he with some wit draws his own picture and represents himself as suffering persecution for having served his country with abilities and integrity a state of exile thus incurred he very justly shows to be rather honorable than distressful and indeed there are few men that will deny but that the company of strangers to virtue is better than the company of enemies to it besides this philosophical tract he also wrote this year several letters in answer to the charge laid upon him by the pretender and his adherents and the following year he drew up a vindication of his whole conduct with respect to the tories in the form of a letter to sir william wyndham  nor was he so entirely devoted to the fatigues of business but that he gave pleasure a share in his pursuits he had never much agreed with the lady he first married and after a short cohabitation they separated and lived ever after asunder she therefore remained in england upon his going into exile and by proper application to the throne was allowed a proper maintenance to support her with becoming dignity however she did not long survive his first disgrace and upon his becoming a widower he began to think of trying his fortune once more in a state which was at first so unfavourable for this purpose he cast his eyes on the widow of the marquis of villette and niece to the famous madam maintenon a young lady of great merit and understanding possessed of a very large fortune but encumbered with a long and troublesome lawsuit in the company of this very sensible woman he passed his time in france sometimes in the country and sometimes at the capital till the year      in which after the breaking up of the parliament his majesty was pleased to grant him a pardon as to his personal safety but as yet neither restoring him to his family inheritance his title or a seat in parliament  to obtain this favor had been the governing principle of his politics for some years before and upon the first notice of his good fortune he prepared to return to his native country where however his dearest connexions were either dead or declared themselves suspicious of his former conduct in support of their party it is observable that bishop atterbury who was banished at this time for a supposed treasonable correspondence in favor of the tories was set on shore at calais just when lord bolingbroke arrived there on his return to england so extraordinary a reverse of fortune could not fail of strongly affecting that good prelate who observed with some emotion that he perceived himself to be exchanged he presently left it to his auditors to imagine whether his country were the loser or the gainer by such an exchange  lord bolingbroke upon his return to his native country began to make very vigorous applications for further favors from the crown his pardon without the means of support was but an empty or perhaps it might be called a distressful act of kindness as it brought him back among his former friends in a state of inferiority his pride could not endure however his applications were soon after successful for in about two years after his return he obtained an act of parliament to restore him to his family inheritance which amounted to near three thousand pounds a year he was also enabled by the same to possess any purchase he should make of any other estate in the kingdom and he accordingly pitched upon a seat of lord tankervilles at dawley near uxbridge in middlesex where he settled with his lady and laid himself out to enjoy the rural pleasures in perfection since the more glorious ones of ambition were denied him with this resolution he began to improve his new purchase in a very peculiar style giving it all the air of a country farm and adorning even his hall with all the implements of husbandry we have a sketch of his way of living in this retreat in a letter of popes to swift who omits no opportunity of representing his lordship in the most amiable points of view this letter is dated from dawley the country farm abovementioned and begins thus i now hold the pen for my lord bolingbroke who is reading your letter between two haycocks but his attention is somewhat diverted by casting his eyes on the clouds not in admiration of what you say but for fear of a shower he is pleased with your placing him in the triumvirate between yourself and me though he says he doubts he shall fare like lepidus while one of us runs away with all the power like augustus and another with all the pleasure like antony it is upon a foresight of this that he has fitted up his farm and you will agree that this scheme of retreat is not founded upon weak appearances upon his return from bath he finds all peccant humors are purged out of him and his great temperance and economy are so signal that the first is fit for my constitution and the latter would enable you to lay up so much money as to buy a bishopric in england as to the return of his health and vigor were you here you might enquire of his haymakers but as to his temperance i can answer that for one whole day we have had nothing for dinner but mutton broth beans and bacon and a barndoor fowl now his lordship is run after his cart i have a moment left to myself to tell you that i overheard him yesterday agree with a painter for two hundred pounds to paint his countryhall with rakes spades prongs etc and other ornaments merely to countenance his calling this place a farm what pope here says of his engagements with a painter was shortly after executed the hall was painted accordingly in black crayons only so that at first view it brought to mind the figures often seen scratched with charcoal or the smoke of a candle upon the kitchen walls of farmhouses the whole however produced a most striking effect and over the door at the entrance into it was this motto satis beatus ruris honoribus his lordship seemed to be extremely happy in this pursuit of moral tranquillity and in the exultation of his heart could not fail of communicating his satisfactions to his friend swift i am in my own farm says he and here i shoot strong and tenacious roots i have caught hold of the earth to use a gardeners phrase and neither my enemies nor my friends will find it an easy matter to transplant me again  there is not perhaps a stronger instance in the world than his lordship that an ambitious mind can never be fairly subdued but will still seek for those gratifications which retirement can never supply all this time he was mistaken in his passion for solitude and supposed that to be the child of philosophy which was only the effects of spleen it was in vain that he attempted to take root in the shade of obscurity he was originally bred in the glare of public occupation and he secretly once more wished for transplantation he was only a titular lord he had not been thoroughly restored and as he was excluded from a seat in the house of peers he burned with impatience to play a part in that conspicuous theater impelled by this desire he could no longer be restrained in obscurity but once more entered into the bustle of public business and disavowing all obligations to the minister he embarked in the opposition against him in which he had several powerful coadjutors but previously he had taken care to prefer a petition to the house of commons desiring to be reinstated in his former emoluments and capacities this petition at first occasioned very warm debates walpole who pretended to espouse his cause alleged that it was very right to admit him to his inheritance and when lord william pawlett moved for a clause to disqualify him from sitting in either house walpole rejected the motion secretly satisfied with a resolution which had been settled in the cabinet that he should never more be admitted into any share of power to this artful method of evading his pretensions bolingbroke was no stranger and he was now resolved to shake that power which thus endeavored to obstruct the increase of his own taking therefore his part in the opposition with pultney while the latter engaged to manage the house of commons bolingbroke undertook to enlighten the people accordingly he soon distinguished himself by a multitude of pieces written during the latter part of george the firsts reign and likewise the beginning of that which succeeded these were conceived with great vigor and boldness and now once more engaged in the service of his country though disarmed gagged and almost bound as he declared himself to be yet he resolved not to abandon his cause as long as he could depend on the firmness and integrity of those coadjutors who did not labor under the same disadvantages with himself his letters in a paper called the craftsman were particularly distinguished in this political contest and though several of the most expert politicians of the times joined in this paper his essays were peculiarly relished by the public however it is the fate of things written to an occasion seldom to survive that occasion the craftsman though written with great spirit and sharpness is now almost forgotten although when it was published as a weekly paper it sold much more rapidly than even the spectator beside this work he published several other separate pamphlets which were afterward reprinted in the second edition of his works and which were very popular in their day  this political warfare continued for ten years during which time he labored with great strength and perseverance and drew up such a system of politics as some have supposed to be the most complete now existing but as upon all other occasions he had the mortification once more to see those friends desert him upon whose assistance he most firmly relied and all that web of fine spun speculation actually destroyed at once by the ignorance of some and the perfidy of others he then declared that he was perfectly cured of his patriotic phrenzy he fell out not only with pultney for his selfish views but with his old friends the tories for abandoning their cause as desperate averring that the faint and unsteady exercise of parts on one side was a crime but one degree inferior to the iniquitous misapplication of them on the other but he could not take leave of a controversy in which he had been so many years engaged without giving a parting blow in which he seemed to summon up all his vigor at once and where as the poet says animam in vulnere posuit this inimitable piece is entitled a dissertation on parties and of all his masterly pieces it is in general esteemed the best  having finished this which was received with the utmost avidity he resolved to take leave not only of his enemies and friends but even of his country and in this resolution in the year      he once more retired to france where he looked back to his native country with a mixture of anger and pity and upon his former professing friends with a share of contempt and indignation i expect little says he from the principal actors that tread the stage at present they are divided not so much as it seemed and as they would have it believed about measures the true division is about their different ends whilst the minister was not hard pushed nor the prospect of succeeding to him near they appeared to have but one end the reformation of the government the destruction of the minister was pursued only as a preliminary but of essential and indisputable necessity to that end but when his destruction seemed to approach the object of his succession interposed to the sight of many and the reformation of the government was no longer their point of view they had divided the skin at least in their thoughts before they had taken the beast the common fear of hastening his downfall for others made them all faint in the chase it was this and this alone that saved him and put off his evil day  such were his cooler reflections after he had laid down his political pen to employ it in a manner that was much more agreeable to his usual professions and his approaching age he had long employed the few hours he could spare on subjects of a more general and important nature to the interests of mankind but as he was frequently interrupted by the alarms of party he made no great proficiency in his design still however he kept it in view and he makes frequent mention in his letters to swift of his intentions to give metaphysics a new and useful turn i know says he in one of these how little regard you pay to writings of this kind but i imagine that if you can like any it must be those that strip metaphysics of all their bombast keep within the sight of every well constituted eye and never bewilder themselves whilst they pretend to guide the reason of others  having now arrived at the sixtieth year of his age and being blessed with a very competent share of fortune he retired into france far from the noise and hurry of party for his seat at dawley was too near to devote the rest of his life to retirement and study upon his going to that country as it was generally known that disdain vexation and disappointment had driven him there many of his friends as well as his enemies supposed that he was once again gone over to the pretender among the number who entertained this suspicion was swift whom pope in one of his letters very roundly chides for harboring such an unjust opinion you should be cautious says he of censuring any motion or action of lord bolingbroke because you hear it only from shallow envious and malicious reporters what you writ to me about him i find to my great scandal repeated in one of yours to another whatever you might hint to me was this for the profane the thing if true should be concealed but it is i assure you absolutely untrue in every circumstance he has fixed in a very agreeable retirement near fontainbleau and makes it his whole business vacare litteris  this reproof from pope was not more friendly than it was true lord bolingbroke was too well acquainted with the forelorn state of that party and the folly of its conductors once more to embark in their desperate concerns he now saw that he had gone as far toward reinstating himself in the full possession of his former honors as the mere dint of parts and application could go and was at length experimentally convinced that the decree was absolutely irreversible and the door of the house of lords finally shut against him he therefore at popes suggestion retired merely to be at leisure from the broils of opposition for the calmer pleasures of philosophy thus the decline of his life though less brilliant became more amiable and even his happiness was improved by age which had rendered his passions more moderate and his wishes more attainable  but he was far from suffering even in solitude his hours to glide away in torpid inactivity that active restless disposition still continued to actuate his pursuits and having lost the season for gaining power over his cotemporaries he was now resolved upon acquiring fame from posterity he had not been long in his retreat near fontainbleau when he began a course of letters on the study and use of history for the use of a young nobleman in these he does not follow the methods of st real and others who have treated on this subject who make history the great fountain of all knowledge he very wisely confines its benefits and supposes them to consist in deducing general maxims from particular facts than in illustrating maxims by the application of historical passages in mentioning ecclesiastical history he gives his opinion very freely upon the subject of the divine original of the sacred books which he supposes to have no such foundation this new system of thinking which he had always propagated in conversation and which he now began to adopt in his more labored compositions seemed no way supported either by his acuteness or his learning he began to reflect seriously on these subjects too late in life and to suppose those objections very new and unanswerable which had been already confuted by thousands lord bolingbroke says pope in one of his letters is above trifling when he writes of any thing in this world he is more than mortal if ever he trifles it must be when he turns divine  in the mean time as it was evident that a man of his active ambition in choosing retirement when no longer able to lead in public must be liable to ridicule in resuming a resigned philosophical air in order to obviate the censure he addressed a letter to lord bathurst upon the true use of retirement and study in which he shows himself still able and willing to undertake the cause of his country whenever its distresses should require his exertion i have says he renounced neither my country nor my friends and by friends i mean all those and those alone who are such to their country in their prosperity they shall never hear of me in their distress always in that retreat wherein the remainder of my days shall be spent i may be of some use to them since even from thence i may advise exhort and warn them bent upon this pursuit only and having now exchanged the gay statesman for the grave philosopher he shone forth with distinguished luster his conversation took a different turn from what had been usual with him and as we are assured by lord orrery who knew him it united the wisdom of socrates the dignity and ease of pliny and the wit of horace  yet still amidst his resolutions to turn himself from politics and to give himself up entirely to the calls of philosophy he could not resist embarking once more in the debates of his country and coming back from france settled at battersea an old seat which was his fathers and had been long in the possession of the family he supposed he saw an impending calamity and though it was not in his power to remove he thought it his duty to retard its fall to redeem or save the nation from perdition he thought impossible since national corruptions were to be purged by national calamities but he was resolved to lend his feeble assistance to stem the torrent that was pouring in with this spirit he wrote that excellent piece which is entitled the idea of a patriot king in which he describes a monarch uninfluenced by party leaning to the suggestions neither of whigs nor tories but equally the friend and the father of all some time after in the year      after the conclusion of the peace two years before the measures taken by the administration seemed not to have been repugnant to his notions of political prudence for that juncture in that year he wrote his last production containing reflections on the then state of the nation principally with regard to her taxes and debts and on the causes and consequences of them this undertaking was left unfinished for death snatched the pen from the hand of the writer  having passed the latter part of his life in dignity and splendour his rational faculties improved by reflection and his ambition kept under by disappointment his whole aim seemed to have been to leave the stage of life on which he had acted such various parts with applause he had long wished to fetch his last breath at battersea the place where he was born and fortune that had through life seemed to traverse all his aims at last indulged him in this he had long been troubled with a cancer in his cheek by which excruciating disease he died on the verge of fourscore years of age he was consonant with himself to the last and those principles which he had all along avowed he confirmed with his dying breath having given orders that none of the clergy should be permitted to trouble him in his latest moments  his body was interred in battersea church with those of his ancestors and a marble monument erected to his memory with the following excellent inscription  here lies henry st john in the reign of queen anne secretary of war secretary of state and viscount bolingbroke in the days of king george i and king george ii something more and better his attachment to queen anne exposed him to a long and severe persecution he bore it with firmness of mind he passed the latter part of his time at home the enemy of no national party the friend of no faction distinguished under the cloud of proscription which had not been entirely taken off by zeal to maintain the liberty and to restore the ancient prosperity of great britain he died the   th of december      aged     in this manner lived and died lord bolingbroke ever active never depressed ever pursuing fortune and as constantly disappointed by her in whatever light we view his character we shall find him an object rather properer for our wonder than our imitation more to be feared than esteemed and gaining our admiration without our love his ambition ever aimed at the summit of power and nothing seemed capable of satisfying his immoderate desires but the liberty of governing all things without a rival with as much ambition as great abilities and more acquired knowledge than caesar he wanted only his courage to be as successful but the schemes his head dictated his heart often refused to execute and he lost the ability to perform just when the great occasion called for all his efforts to engage  the same ambition that prompted him to be a politician actuated him as a philosopher his aims were equally great and extensive in both capacities unwilling to submit to any power in the one or any authority in the other he entered the fields of science with a thorough contempt of all that had been established before him and seemed willing to think every thing wrong that he might show his faculty in the reformation it might have been better for his quiet as a man if he had been content to act a subordinate character in the state and it had certainly been better for his memory as a writer if he had aimed at doing less than he attempted wisdom in morals like every other art or science is an accumulation that numbers have contributed to increase and it is not for one single man to pretend that he can add more to the heap than the thousands that have gone before him such innovators more frequently retard than promote knowledge their maxims are more agreeable to the reader by having the gloss of novelty to recommend them than those which are trite only because they are true such men are

while they have been leaving a practical good and while they have been practicing the arts of doubting they have been losing all firmness of principle which might tend to establish the rectitude of their private conduct as a moralist therefore lord bolingbroke by having endeavored at too much seems to have done nothing but as a political writer few can equal and none can exceed him as he was a practical politician his writings are less filled with those speculative illusions which are the result of solitude and seclusion he wrote them with a certainty of their being opposed sifted examined and reviled he therefore took care to build them up of such materials as could not be easily overthrown they prevailed at the times in which they were written they still continue to the admiration of the present age and will probably last for ever  finis books printed for t davies in russel street covent garden the life of dr parnell by dr goldsmith price   s  the roman history from the foundation
