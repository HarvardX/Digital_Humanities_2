  the progress of wit a caveat for the use of an eminent writer  by a fellow of all souls  to which is prefixed an explanatory discourse to the reader  by gamaliel gunson professor of physic and astrology  this verse be thine my friend nor thou refuse this from no venal or ungrateful muse read these instructive leaves  pope to mr jervas london printed for j wilford at the crown in stationerscourt mdccxxx  to the reader courteous reader i am by profession no poet yet having a son of my own at this time of no small hope in one of our famous universities i cannot therefore be supposed to want reverence for those seminaries of the muses upon this account partly for of itself i have no great opinion of poetry but perceiving at the head of the manuscript that it had been written by a fellow of all souls and chiefly invited by some encouraging expressions in the beginning alluding to a chariot that could carry a man up to the stars i bestowed a serious perusal on the verses which i herewith publish and which i found one rainy day at the bottom of a hackneycoach where i suppose they might have been dropped by somebody who had been in possession of that coach before me  but i confess the oftener i perused the manuscript the less i was able to comprehend of its meaning i had not indeed labored far in the matter before i discovered that the author notwithstanding he has been pleased to make free with the stars is a novice in our science  so that what he writes concerning the thinness of heavens purlieus  surmounting the stars in a chariot of air and such like promising conceptions ought not i believe to be taken in the strict sense of the phrase but only for a joke or a fancy  however some of my profession to whom i showed it agreed that it was a dark piece of work had more in it than satire and for any thing they or i knew to the contrary might be matter of danger to the government and ought to be carried to the secretarys office  by a mind laudably filled with a zeal for his countrys safety every hint that infers its danger should be thought of the utmost importance to the secretarys office therefore i went with it and put it into the hands of one who appeared to think himself more considerable than any body i could see about him i begged the favor that he would look it over and give me his opinion whether it was a treasonable libel i would not willingly do injustice to the characters of persons above my station though it is well known physic and astrology are considered with respect among liberal sciences but truly be seemed to me to peruse it with less seriousness than i suppose with all due reverence to his office became the trust that was lodged in him for he laughed out once or twice and lifting his eyes from the paper took upon him to remark me with a countenance which i thought too merry for the occasion he was pleased when he came to the following lines to read them aloud to a young spark in red and asked him what he thought of the matter  i confess i was almost in a passion when this featherbrain made answer that it was the liveliest satire in the world upon a bawdy house of his acquaintance by the bank side over the water  i cite the very verses for the readers more effectual amazement at the unaccountableness of the young fellows of this forward generation  caught by the gulphy void that gloomd below crowds from the currents fairdescending flow indrawn at once by darkness swallowed over sunk from their sunny scene and rose no more still gaped thunclosing deep over millions gone yet still insatiate hourly swallowed on i could not forbear telling this story with due gravity and resentment to a certain lawyer of my acquaintance whom i met just landed at white hall stairs we walked together a few turns in the privygarden and he opened the manuscript where it speaks of shapeless bodies  whose breathing bulks to life and motion blown shot into human forms completely grown mixed rank and sex sprung through the liquid jett but pouring outward clear distinction met he read it once and again and was clear in his opinion it meant the masquerade in the haymarket he owned indeed that under proper hands it might be explained into something more considerable  but we wave it cried he after reading it a little farther we will wave the point of treason in exchange for scandalum magnatum it follows here as clear as sunshine upon a minister of state and a privycounsellor then he read to me this slanderous inuendo of people who coming within reach of a dark bustling power obscurely seen  from the blind bounty of his hasty hand buoyant in boats rode over the shining sand of different form these boats  a single oar distinguished some  some winged their sides with more others with oars and sails conjoined made way and mowed the murmuring surge with sweepy sway while some slow polemen over their toil reclined pushed their checked barks and laboring laggd behind some waded naked etc  he asked me whether i did not plainly discern what great man in a certain assembly was pointed at under this image of a dark bustling power obscurely seen upon which recollecting myself as became me and pondering the words to the best of my capacity i replied i thought it was the devil  he shook his head and informed me civilly that i was a little mistaken but perceiving me in some measure abashed he assured me it was so natural an error that any body might have fallen into it as well as i then proceeded to convince me that shining sand was a cantword for money bags that by the boats said to be distributed at random by the bounty of the blind power that was so busy in darkness was to be understood those gratifications impudently called pensions by persons disaffected to the ministry that for example the largest of such pretended pensions were represented under the similitude of boats which had sails and oars together  middling pensions were boats with many oars  smaller still were oneoard barks  the least of all were polemen  and as for the naked waders it was by this time become clear to my own unassisted capacity that they could mean nothing but those poor souls who were neglected by the black bustler and had no pensions at all to take boat with  my ingenious friend the lawyer advised me to write a letter to the great man who had made so light of a good subjects information and put him in mind of the fate of philotas  he added that the fears of statesmen would be more awake for their masters if less watchful for themselves he was sorry he was then in haste but invited me next morning to his chambers where he assured me no assistance in his power should be wanting to make something of the matter we had been conferring on  how admirable is the penetration of some mens spirits and how powerful the good influence of their example  i who before i had received this light could see no tendency to such seditious purpose in the manuscript so providentially decypherd could now in every page of it discover the clearest and most visible disaffection nay i have since that time upon frequent revisal of the libel under help of better eyes than my own found popery in it as well as jacobitism not to mention that the popes name itself in great letters stands audaciously written at the end of it  i sent a copy with a recital of all the foregoing particulars to my boy beforementioned who is now of three years standing at the college where i fear his political principles have been newmodelld since i saw him for he seems a little malepert in a letter he returned me for answer which however in justice to the good parts of the youth i take pleasure in publishing not supposing the childish mistake it turns upon capable of making any impression upon readers who know the world and are acquainted with men and business  honored sir i am sorry to say i was ashamed of your account concerning the manuscript you demand my thoughts of it is no other than a satire written by one poet on the misapplication of anothers genius  you apprehended it to mean more than the author designed by finding it say less than the reader expected but scurrility and grossness are so far from being requisites in satire that it can be no true satire in which they are to be met with the force of these writings consists in their smiling and whenever they grow angry they bring a storm over their own sunshine which like the frown of incensed beauty loses more by abatement of influence than is gained from accession of rigor  the pope at the end of the poem ought to give you no jealousy he is none of his holiness at rome but an english i had almost said protestant pope of this nations own breeding he wears indeed a triple crown like the other but it is of music painting and poetry  nothing is more easily perceived than that this satire is the consequence of some pieces lately published which savor to say truth of a sensibility too like levity in a mind so rich as his who is reputed their author but i cannot without pleasure observe the influence of acknowledged merit confining satire to his folly without allowing it to attack his wit which is not weaker though less lovely when it stains itself upon a dirty subject than when it ornaments beauty itself and adds magnificence to palaces  it is an art to trifle importantly and even to trifle agreeably has its attraction but to trifle unseasonably indecently or improperly let who will be the trifler must be either inhumane or unguarded  either wrong judgment or illbreeding  what pity that the warmest of a certain gentlemans admirers are lately forced to confess there are grossnesses in some of his sallies obscene enough to blot out any wit but their authors insults low enough to become the most vulgarspirited among his enemies and malice animated enough to be beautiful in any of his friends but himself  it gives however a kind of illnatured comfort to us who are his distant cotemporaries that among virtues which we must despair of equalling we discover errors which we disdain to imitate  so pray sir commit the poem to the press and let it travel in search of its author who will hardly look for it in your hands and by that means it may be lost to the public   the progress of wit a caveat tuneful alexis on the thames fair side the ladies plaything and the muses

helms forsook and on one object hung their lengthening look down from the gloomy source in sidelong float proudly descending moved a glittering boat her silken sails a colored radiance threw and tinged the sunny beams through which they flew while oars of silver dashed the watery spray that rained in gemmy showers and dazzled day high on the painted stern a youth appeared who rather happily than strongly steered faint and unstriking was his anguishd mien saddend by sickness and overcast with spleen yet from his eyes there beamed a living light keen and intent as a fired eagles sight and from his voice for as he sailed he sung such magic sounds of melting music sprung that the hushed heaven all downward seemed to bend and against nature the charmed earth ascend careless he looked yet heedful of his way broke the kind currents unobstructing sway that kissed his oars and hastened to obey scarce was his course oblique for each glad boat that envious stemd all others rival float fixed

negligent and aptly light he touched no shoal safe rounded every rock despised all danger and sustained no shock till to that calmer coast approaching nigh and gliding twixt green islands safely high circles of hovering swans with joyful note clapped their broad wings in triumph over his boat charmed that so soon he reached their solemn side ere yet one third of the streams length was tried steering from isle to isle with joyless awe thin over each height their whiterobd lords he saw pleased without transport bow the palms they bore to hail his passage near their silent shore cold and uncharmd he sought his favorite crowd immensely distant now though late so loud all was serene the air was hushed around the waters calm  lost even his musicks sound back to the left impatient looks he cast and longed for every shining insect past distant he saw them wings over wings display and in light chases thread the colored ray eager for these contending pilots strove and caught them careless how their vessels drove then with their trophies dressed each gaudy sail while humming drones in swarms their fortune hail record past leaps foretell their next essays and buzz melodious in

shoreless islands keep too safe your clime is and too calm your deep i choose a rapid glory not a slow shoals are sought harbors where these jewels grow he said and rising pushed with liquid sweep the inverted helm and goard the groaning deep flaming erect resought the surgy side and bounded threatening over the foaming tide sailing athwart the swarms and skipping high he snatched triumphant every tempting fly gave his loosed rudder to the currents claim and drove disdainful through his rivals game pressed by invaded wasps excited stings he warred revengeful on their falling wings through dust of slaughtered gnats he fought in shade and squeezed them deathful on the wounds they made fleets of cold opposites from all sides join and wedged against this general foe combine vainly indignant they resist his sway yet block his passage and obstruct his way still though he stagnates he the fight maintains while drones applausive with their ductile strains homage the rising heros new renown and prince of flycatchers the champion crown the swans meanwhile which from the calmer side forsaken saw him trust the fatal tide mournful with pendent wing his triumph grieved and wished his wasted
