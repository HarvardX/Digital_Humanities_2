j nicholss select collection of poems volume i  portrait of john dryden nations unborn his mighty name shall sound and worlds applaud that must not yet be found  john dryden died may     0  engraved by basire    a select collection of poems with notes biographical and historical  the first volume  london printed by and for j nichols red lion passage fleet street mdcclxxx  to the reverend thomas percy dd dean of carlisle rev sir when these miscellanies are inscribed to a percy i place them under the most auspicious shelter the relics of ancient poetry with which you obliged the world in your younger years would independent of all other claims have pointed you out as a proper patron to these fugitive remains but excellent as your own publications are it is neither to them nor to your elevated station in life that i pay this disinterested tribute  happy in a family connection which however remotely entitles me to claim relationship with the poet cleiveland extracts from whose works will add merit to a future volume of this collection i am proud to have it known that the dean of carlisle derives his descent from the same family his fathers mother having been niece to the bard abovementioned a family distinguished in private life for having produced a succession of most excellent clergymen treading in the steps of their venerable ancestor the rev thomas cleiveland father of the poet who is upon record see walkers sufferings of the clergy p     for his very worthy character and most exemplary life  that urbanity sir with which you recognized me as of kin to you and the friendship i have since in consequence experienced from you as they have made an indelible impression demand the warm acknowledgements with which these volumes are most respectfully presented by  sir your very much obliged and faithful humble servant j nichols jan      0 advertisement this collection though formed principally from that of mr dryden is by no means a mere republication which would now have been particularly illtimed as a large portion of that excellent miscellany the first which appeared in this kingdom with reputation is very properly arranged among the works of the english poets and some pages had crept into drydens collection which may be permitted to perish without regret there still however are an infinite number of small poems which coming under neither of these descriptions must be allowed to possess considerable merit being the productions of men of real genius who from the brevity rather than the inferiority of their writings have been usually styled minor poets  on drydens foundation the present superstructure is begun in its progress almost every undertaking of a similar nature has been consulted and material parts incorporated the collections formed by fenton and steel have been epitomized whilst popes pembertons lintots and c tookes have occasionally contributed to embellishment  the collection by mr r dodsley is allowed to be the completest of the kind and with this the present publication is so far from interfering that not a single poem is intended to be printed which is either in dodsleys collection the supplement to it by mr perch or in the sixty volumes of the english poets to all or either of these therefore this selection will be a suitable appendage and the more so as i have preserved some poems of merit which before were not known to have existed  the reader will find in these volumes some of the earliest productions of dryden some originals by sir william temple an ode by swift which had long been considered as irrecoverable a considerable number of good poems by steel parnell fenton broom and yalden with a few pieces by halifax dorset rochester sprat prior the following anecdotes of this excellent poet being curious i print them in the words of the friend from whom they are received at lord oxfords seat at wimple now lord hardwickes there hung a fine picture of harley in his speakers robes with the roll of the bill in his hand for bringingin the present family which if i mistake not was done by his casting vote in allusion to harleys being afterward sent to the tower prior wrote with a pencil on the white scroll bill paid such a day  the late recorder of cambridge pont had seen some ms dialogues of the dead of priors they were prose but had verse intermixed freely and the specimen i heard proved it the dialogue was between sir thomas more and the vicar of bray you must allow that the characters are well chosen and the speakers maintain their respective opinions smartly at last the knight seems to come over to his adversary at least so far as to allow that the doctrine was convenient if not honorable but that he did not see how any man could allow himself to act thus when the vicar concludes nothing easier with proper management etc you must go the right way to work   for conscience like a fiery horse  will stumble if you check his course  but ride him with an easy rein  and rub him down with worldly gain  he will carry you through thick and thin  safe although dirty to your inn this certainly is sterling sense  it would give me great pleasure to be enabled to present these dialogues to the world but where they are now deposited is unknown  pope bolingbroke philips king smith watts pit hughes a philips and tickell which are not to be found in any edition of their works  the assistance of some intelligent friends has enabled me to add a biographical account of almost every writer here selected and their persuasions have induced me to lay before the public four volumes as part of the plan i have undertaken two others are actually in the press there are still an infinite number of collections which amidst a chaos of weeds would afford a considerable quantity of flowers well worth the transplanting but the encouragement these meet with must determine whether the publication shall cease at the end of the sixth volume or be extended still farther without any great idea of emolument which in this case is far from being the principal object i am unwilling to sacrifice the little leisure of a laborious life in a pursuit that i have not reason to think will in some small degree contribute to the public stock of harmless pleasure  to my concluding volume shall be annexed a complete poetical index in the mean time for the convenience of the reader a short

elegy the complaint by broom english poets vol xl p     is partly in imitation of this elegy n  by the wife of st alexias or rather alexis a nobleman of rome of whom see a full account in blainvilles travels ii     alexias is probably the name of the poem as christias is the history of christ n  complaining of his absence he having left her on his wedding night unenjoyed out of zeal to visit the christian churches from the latin of francis remond a jesuit of dijon he employed himself in composing prose and poetry vid delit gall poet iii p  0  alegambe a brother jesuit in his bibliotheque of the order p     very highly commends his alexias he died in      n  loved by and loving the best youth of rome my fatal charms sent many to their tomb now wretched maid and miserable wife in tears and in complaints i waste my life abandoned by my husband ere enjoyed with thoughts of pleasure yet untasted cloyed this conveys not the least idea of devotion n  he leaves me to my anxious cares a prey ah my alexias whither do you stray whilst in my maidenwidowd bed i lie more wretched than the dead and wish to die this certainly is an intemperate exaggeration n  in you were all my hopes dear wanderer your doubted safety now creates my fear he broke his vows he broke our marriagebond what dangers may a perjured wretch surround at least his flight his tender feet may wound oh that i knew which way his course he steers twould soften much my pains and lessen much my fears a letter should inform him of my cares and he in pity sure would read my prayers i d write him lines might move a senseless stone nay his hard heart to feel compassion but when we write too slow are the returns too slow for one that with my passion burns letters i would not trust myself would go and from my mouth my sorrows he should know by stealth i will leave my fathers house twas you did first alas the sad example show my pressing love would wing my willing fet to fly till my alexias i should meet through deserts i durst go a tender maid in search of you i could not be afraid no dangers should my eager steps retard my innocence and love would be my guard if dragons against me their crests should rear or should i meet a lion or a bear i never can be capable of fear david too young for toils a tender boy could the fierce lion and rough bear destroy from his small hand a pebble could confound and strike the mountaingiant to the ground the assyrian general bethulias dread by a chaste womans hand did lose his head and she was by her guardian angel led why may not my attempts successful prove assisted by divinity and love with fearless courage i dare undertake amazing actions for my husbands sake through all the world my life i will follow thee whether by land thou wanderest or by sea whether on shore or on the swelling main one house one boat may both of us contain if your sharp keel ionian waves divide on that ionian sea my bark shall ride if to contemplate on the sufferings and cruel death of the blessed king of kings a pilgrim to the holy land you go i will join in adoration there with you if where the adored silver jordan flows with you in palestine i will offer holy vows or if to scythian mountains you repair and leave this temperate for that frozen air with thee my soul i willingly can dwell on the cold top of the caucasian hill or should you wander over the libyan sand that vast and wild unhospitable land through those parcht plains with thee my love i will stray nor fear the hungry savage beasts of prey i will be a thracian if to thrace you sail my love shall over my sexs fears prevail nothing to follow you would seem a toil though to the utmost indies you are driven tll i can reach your arms i will know no haven ah let chaste love propitious planets keep safe from the dangers of the greedy deep yet if my ship by tempests must be torn by artful strokes above the waters borne in spite of nature i shall swim to shore for love will give my untaught hands the power the flaming constellations are in love and seas and all that in the waters move nor waves unsettled nor the inconstant wind shall ever move my faith or shake my steadfast mind but if inevitable fates decree that i must suffer in the angry sea leviathan let me become thy prey the only succor such a fate can give in thy kind bowels hidden let me live there let me rest till thou shall find that shore where my alexias is a wanderer there cast me up unhurt and leave me there so in the scaly monster jonas lay protected from the fury of the sea both wondered at their lot and both rejoiced one with his guest was pleased the other with his hos the third day came and then by heavens command the fish restored the prophet to the land but if to me no fish will favor show and dear alexias i must die for you oh love divine i am pleased for thee to fall for thee chaste author of my funeral the sea shall take my name and amongst the stars i will be a guide to wandering mariners while they with wonder shall repeat my name a faith like mine deserves no less a fame they will doubtless pray that such a wife above may be rewarded for so chaste a love and that her husband there may constant prove and for the load of waters she has born her ashes may lie easy in their urn alas i rave with fancies i am fed not knowing where my dearest husband s fled i search him dreaming in my widowed bed if to the woods i go or rocks or shores from thee they have learned to scorn loves mighty powers unheard alas i lose my amorous groans the winds and waves refuse to hear my moans echo alone can suffer my complaint and she with repetition is grown faint return my life for what can cause your stay if thou have pity come oh come away ah suffer not thy absence i should mourn i will come to thee if thou can not return sappho to phaon this epistle after having appeared in a variety of collections was placed at the beginning of garths edition of ovids epistles by several hands    0 where it is followed by another translation of it by mr pope undertaken as that great poet expressly says not from any supposed defect in sir carrs translation but because he had not taken the whole of the original n  by the hon sir carr scrope son of sir adrian scrope of cockrington in lincolnshire knight he became a gentleman commoner of wadham college in      was created a baronet jan         and took the degree of ma on the fourth of february following his poems are not numerous consisting principally of translations and lampoons in his defense of satire we are told by anthony wood there are reflections on   john earl of rochester   edward griffin   wroth the page   franc newport   lord culpepper   henry savil   james duke of monmouth   tho armstrong    loftus  0 brandon gerrard    jermyn earl of st albans    finch lord chancellor this produced as might have been expected the keenest resentment of rochester see his poems      p   0 sir carr translated the fourth elegy of ovids first book and the parting of sireno and diana wrote the prologue to lees rival queens and to the man of mode and several songs introduced into the plays of those times he died in the parish of st martin in the fields in or about november    0 he is mentioned with respect by dr king poems p     wood refers to a ms song on scrope godolphin and dorset in mr sheldons library the parting of sireno and diana wood says was translated from the third book of ovids elegies but it is more probably from an italian original n  bart the poetess sappho forsaken by her lover phaon who was gone from lesbos to sicily and resolved in despair to drown herself writes this letter to him before she dies  while phaon to the flaming aetna flies consumed with no less fires poor sappho dies i burn i burn like kindled fields of corn when by the driving winds the flames are borne my muse and lute can now no longer please they are the employments of a mind at ease wandering from thought to thought i sit alone all day and my once dear companions shun in vain the lesbian maids claim each a part where thou alone have taken up all the heart ah lovely youth how can thou cruel prove when blooming years and beauty bid thee love if none but equal charms thy heart can bind then to thyself alone thou must be kind yet worthless as i am there was a time when phaon thought me worthy his esteem a thousand tender things to mind i call for they who truly love remember all delighted with the music of my tongue upon my words with silent joy he hung and snatching kisses stopped me as i sung kisses whose melting touch his soul did move the earnest of the coming joys of love then tender words short sighs and thousand charms of wanton arts endeared me to his arms till both expiring with tumultuous joys a gentle faintness did our limbs surprise beware sicilian ladies ah beware how you receive my faithless wanderer you too will be abused if you believe the flattering words that he so well can give loose to the winds i let my flowing hair no more with fragant scents perfume the air but all my dress discovers wild despair for whom alas should now my art be shown the only man i cared to please is gone oh let me once more see those eyes of thine thy love i ask not do but suffer mine thou might at least have taken thy last farewell and feigned a sorrow which thou did not feel no kind remembering pledge was asked by thee and nothing left but injuries with me witness ye gods with what a deathlike cold my heart was seized when first thy flight was told speechless and stupid for a while i lay and neither words nor tears could find their way but when my swelling passion forced a vent with hair disheveled clothes in pieces rent like some mad mother through the streets i run who to the grave attends her only son exposed to all the world myself i see forgetting virtue fame and all but thee so ill alas do love and shame agree it is thou alone that art my constant care in pleasing dreams thou comfortst my despair and make the night that does thy form convey welcome to me above the fairest day then spite of absence i thy love enjoy in close embraces locked methinks we lie thy tender words i hear thy kisses feel with all the joys that shame forbids to tell but when i waking miss thee from my bed and all my pleasing images are fled the dear deluding vision to retain i lay me down and try to sleep again soon as i rise i haunt the caves and groves those conscious scenes of our once happy loves there like some frantic bacchanal i walk and to myself with sad distraction talk then big with grief i throw me on the ground and view the melancholy grotto round whose hanging roof of moss and craggy stone delights my eyes above the brightest throne but when i spy the bank whose grassy bed retains the print our weary bodies made on thy forsaken side i lay me down and with a shower of tears the place i drown the trees are withered all since thou art gone as if for thee they put their mourning on no warbling bird does now with music fill the woods except the mournful philomel with here is my dismal notes all night agree of tereus she complains and i of thee ungentle youth did thou but see me mourn hard as thou art thou would thou would return my constant falling tears the paper stain and my weak hand can scarce direct my pen oh could thy eyes but reach my dreadful state as now i stand prepared for sudden fate thou could not see this naked breast of mine dashed against rocks rather than joined to thine peace sappho peace thou sendst thy fruitless cries to one more hard than rocks more deaf than sas the flying winds bear thy complaints away but none will ever back his sails convey no longer then thy hopeless love attend but let thy life here with thy letter end the parting of sireno and diana by the same sireno and diana having loved each other with a most violent passion sireno is compelled upon the account of his masters service to go for some time into a foreign country the melancholy parting of the two lovers is the subject of the following eclogue  close by a stream whose flowery bank might give delight to eyes that had no cause to grieve the sad sireno sat and fed his sheep which now alas he had no joy to keep since his hard fate compelled him to depart from her dear sight who long had charmed his heart fixed were his thoughts upon the fatal day that gave him first what this must take away through all the story of his love he ran and naught forgot that might increase his pain then with a sigh raising his heavy eyes the approach of his afflicted nymph he spies sad as she was she lost no usual grace but as she passed seemed to adorn the place thither she came to take her last farewell her silent look did her sad business tell under a neighboring tree they sat them down whose shade had often preserved them from the sun each took the other by the willing hand striving to speak but could no word command with mutual grief both were so overcome the much they had to say had made them dumb there many a time they two had met before but met alas upon a happier score cruel reverse of fate which all the joys their mutual presence used to bring destroys sireno saw his fatal hour draw near and wanting strength the parting pang to bear all drowned in tears he gazed upon the maid and she with equal grief the swain surveyed till his imprisoned passion forced its way and gave him leave faintly at last to say sireno o my diana who would have believed that when the sad sireno most had grieved any affliction could have fallen on me that would not vanish at the sight of thee thy charming eyes could all my clouds dispel let but diana smile and all was well absent from thee my soul no joy could know and yet alas i die to see thee now  diana turn o sireno turn away thy face while all her shame a blushing maid betrays for though my eyes a secret pain reveal my tongue at least should my fond thoughts conceal yet i would speak could speaking do me good and since it is to thee methinks it should o shepherd think how wretched i shall be when hither i return deprived of thee when sitting all alone within this shade which thou so often thy tender choice have made i read my name engraved on every bark of our past love the kind affecting mark then my despairing soul to death nust fly and must thou be content to let me die why do thou weep alas those tears are vain since it is thy fault that both of us complain by this the falsehood of thy vows i know for were thy sorrow true thou would not go  sireno cease cruel nymph such killing language cease and let the poor sireno die in peace witness ye everlasting powers above that never shepherd bore a truer love with thee i wish t had been my happy doom with thee alone to spend my life to come that we now part is by no fault of mine nor yet my dearest shepherdess of thine for as no faith did ever mine excel so never any nymph deserved so well but the great shepherd whom we all obey it is his command that forces me away whatever he ordains none dare refuse i must my joy or else my honor lose should i to him deny the allegiance due thou might to thee think me disloyal too  diana no no sireno now too late i find how fond she is that can believe mankind who such excuses for himself pretends will easily bear the absence he defends a little time i fear will quite deface thy thoughts of me to give another place fool that i was my weakness to betray to one not moved with all that i can say go cruel man embark whenever you please but take this with you as you pass the seas though with the fiercest winds the waves should roar that tempest will be less than mine on shore  sireno it is hard unjust suspicions to abide but who can such obliging anger chide fair as thou art that charm could never move my heart to this degree without thy love for it is thy tender sense of my sad fate that does my sharpest deadliest pain create ah fear not to what place soever i go that i shall ever break my sacred vow when for another i abandon thee may heaven for such a crime abandon me  diana if ever i my dearest swain deceive or violate the faith that here i give when to their food my hungry flocks i lead may the fresh grass still wither where they tread and may this river when i come to drink dry up as soon as i approach the brink take here this bracelet of my virgin hair and when for me thou can a minute spare remember this poor pledge was once a part of her who with it gave thee all her heart wherever thou go may fortune deal with thee better than thou alas has dealt with me farewell my tears will give me leave to say no more than this to all the gods i pray these weeping eyes may once enjoy thy sight before they close in deaths eternal night  sireno then let sireno banish all his fears heaven cannot long resist such pious tears the righteous gods from whom our passion came will pity sure so innocent a flame reverse the hard decree for which we mourn and let sireno to his joys return i shall again my charming nymph behold and never part but in her arms grow old that hope alone my breaking heart sustains and arms my tortured soul to bear my pains  prologue to the man of mode by the same      like dancers on the ropes poor poets fare most perish young the rest in danger are this one would think should make our authors wary but gamester like the giddy fools miscarry a lucky hand or two so tempts them on they cannot leave off play till they re undone with modest fears a muse does first begin like a young wench newly enticed to sin but tickled once with praise by her good will the wanton fool would never more lie still it is an old mistress you ll meet here tonight whose charms you once have looked on with delight but now of late such dirty drabs have known you a muse of the better sort s ashamed to own you nature well drawn and wit must now give place to gaudy nonsense and to dull grimace nor is it strange that you should like so much that kind of wit for most of yours is such but i m afraid that while to france we go to bring you home fine dresses dance and show the stage like you will but more foppish grow of foreign wares why should we fetch the scum when we can be so richly served at home for heaven be thanked it is not so wise an age but your own follies may supply the stage though often ploughd there is no great fear the soil should barren grow by the too frequent toil while at your doors are to be daily found such loads of dunghill to manure the ground it is by your follies that we players thrive as the physicians by diseases live and as each year some new distemper reigns whose friendly poison helps to increase their gains so among you there starts up every day some new unheard of fool for us to play then for your own sakes be not too severe nor what you all admire at home damn here since each is fond of his own ugly face why should you when we hold it break the glass song in the man of mode by the same from the french of madame de la suze as amoret with phyllis sat one evening on the plain and saw the charming strephon wait to tell the nymph his pain the threatening danger to remove she whispered in her ear ah phyllis if you would not love this shepherd do not hear none ever had so strange an art his passion to convey into a listening virgins heart and steal her soul away fly fly betimes for fear you give occasion for your fate in vain said she in vain i strive alas it is now too late prologue to the rival queens by the same      how hard the fate is of the scribbling drudge who writes to all when yet so few can judge wit like religion once divine was thought and the dull crowd believed as they were taught now each fanatic fool presumes to explain the text and does the sacred writ profane for while your wits each others fall pursue the fops usurp the power belongs to you you think y are challenged in each new playbill and here you come for trial of your skill where fencerlike you one another hurt while with your wounds you make the rabble sport others there are that have the brutal will to murder a poor play but want the skill they love to fight but seldom have the wit to spy the place where they may thrust and hit and therefore like some bully of the town never stand to draw but knock the poet down with these like hogs in gardens it succeeds they root up all and know not flowers from weeds as for you sparks that hither come each day to act your own and not to mind our play rehearse your usual follies to the pit and with loud nonsense drown the stages wit talk of your clothes your last debauches tell and witty bargains to each other sell glout on the silly she who for your sake can vanity and noise for love mistake till the coquette sung in the next lampoon is by her jealous friends sent out of town for in this duelling intriguing age the love you make is like the war you wage y are still prevented ere you come to engage but it is not to such trifling foes as you the mighty alexander deigns to sue the persians of the pit he does despise but to the men of sense for aid he flies on their experienced arms he now depends nor fears he odds if they but prove his friends for as he once a little handful chose the numerous armies of the world to oppose so backed by you who understand the rules he hopes to rout the mighty host of fools horace book i ode iv conquered with soft and pleasing charms and neverfailing vows of her return winter unlocks his frosty arms to free the joyful spring which for fresh loves with youthful heat does burn warm southwinds court her and with fruitful shower awake the drowsy flowers who haste and all their sweetness bring to pay their yearly offering no nipping white is seen but all the fields are clad with pleasant green and only fragrant dews now fall the ox forsakes his oncewarm stall to bask in the suns much warmer beams the ploughman leaves his fire and his sleep well pleased to whistle to his laboring teams whilst the glad shepherd pipes to frisking sheep nay tempted by the smiling sky wrecked merchants quit the shore resolving once again to try the wind and seas almighty power choosing much rather to be dead than poor upon the flowery plains or under shady trees the shepherdesses and their swains dance to their rural harmonies they steal in private to the covert groves there finish their wellheightend loves the city dame takes this pretense weary of husband and of innocence to quit the smoke and business of the town and to her country house retires where she may bribe then grasp some brawny clown or her appointed gallant come to feed her loose desires whilst the poor dotard by his sweat at home maintains her lust and pride blessed

called then thou were shy nor one kind aid to my assistance brought nor would inspire one tender thought when princes at my feet did lie when thou could mix ambition with my joy then peevish phantom thou were nice and coy not beauty would invade thee then nor all the arts of lavish men not all the powerful rhetoric of the tongue no sacred wit could charm thee on not the soft play that lovers make

county became a commoner of st albans hall in the beginning of the year      at the age of    when he was put under the tuition of mr edward corbet fellow of merton college and lodged in the chamber under him in that house leaving the university without a degree he retired to his native county he married the widow of robert earl of essex and delivered an oration at her funeral sept         oration sunebri a marito ipso more prisco laudata fuit is part of this ladys epitaph he married secondly bridget daughter of sir bevil greenvill of stow and sister to john earl of bath and removed to grewell in hampshire was elected a burgess for malmsbury in      and for new windsor in      his services to the crown were rewarded with a pension of  00l a year and gifts to the amount of  000l he was afterward knighted and in      was sent envoy extraordinary to invest john george duke of saxony with the order of the garter about four years after he was sent envoy to vienna where he continued three years in      he was elected burgess for st germains being then says wood accounted a loyal and accomplished person and a great lover of the regular clergy he died suddenly of an apoplexy in the kings bench court having been summoned there as a witness november         and was buried in winchester cathedral near the relics of his first wife his literary productions are   a panegyric to the king    0 fol   the funeral oration on his first lady        the history of isoof bassa      he also translated into english the venetian triumph for which he was complimented by waller in his poems p     who has also addressed a poem to mrs higgons p  0  mr granger who styles sir thomas a gentleman of great merit was favored by the duchess dowager of portland with a manuscript copy of his oration and concludes from the great scarcity of that pamphlet that the copies of it were for certain reasons industriously collected and destroyed though few pieces of this kind have less deserved to perish the countess of essex had a greatness of mind which enabled her to bear the whole weight of infamy which was thrown upon her but it was nevertheless attended with a delicacy and sensibility of honor which poisoned all her enjoyments mr higgons had said much and i think much to the purpose in her vindication and was himself fully convinced from the tenor of her life and the words which the spoke at the awful close of it that the was perfectly innocent  in reading this interesting oration i fancied myself standing by the grave of injured innocence and beauty was sensibly touched with the pious affection of the tenderest and best of husbands doing public and solemn justice to an amiable and worthy woman who had been grossly and publicly defamed nor could i withold the tribute of a tear a tribute which i am confident was paid at her interment by every one who loved virtue and was not destitute of the feelings of humanity this is what i immediately wrote upon reading the oration if i am wrong in my opinion the benevolent ader i am sure will forgive me it is not the first time that my heart has got the better of my judgment i am not afraid of being censured for having transcribed this beautiful passage n  though i can add but little to his name whose muse has given him such immortal fame yet in the crowd of those who dress his hearse i come to pay the tribute of a verse athens and rome when learning flourished most could never such a finished poet boast whose matchless softness in the english tongue outdoes what horace or anacreon sung judgment does some to reputation raise and for invention others wear the bays he possessed both with such a talent still as showed not only force of wit but skill so faultless was his muse it is hard to know if he did more to art or nature owe read where you will he is music all along and his sense easy as his thought is strong some striving to be clear fall flat and low and when they think to mount obscure they grow he is not darker for his lofty flight nor does his easiness depress his height but still perspicuous wheresoeer he fly and like the sun is brightest when he is high ladies admire and taste his gentle vein which does the greatest statesmen entertain his verses do all sorts of readers warm philosophers instruct and women charm nor did he all men in his verse outdo but gave the law in conversation too he tuned the company wherever he came still leaving with them something of his flame he seemed by nature made for every thing and could harangue and talk as well as sing persuade in council and assemblies lead now make them bold and then as much afraid give them his passions make them of his mind and their opinion change as he inclined the english he has to perfection brought and we to speak are by his measures taught those very words which are in fashion now he brought in credit half an age ago thus petrarch mended the italian tongue and now they speak the language which he sung they both like honor to their countries do their saints they both inimitably woo they both alike eternity do give and sacharissa shall with laura live to the duke on his return      by nathanael lee this celebrated dramatic poet was the son of a clergyman and bred at westminsterschool under the famous dr busby whence he removed to trinity college in cambridge became scholar upon that foundation in      and proceeded ab the same year but not succeeding to a fellowship he quitted the university and came to london where he made an unsuccessful attempt to become an actor in      the part he performed was duncan in sir william davenants alteration of macbeth failing in this design he had recourse to his pen for a support and having a genius for the drama he composed a tragedy called nero emperor of rome in      which being well received he pushed on the same way producing a new play almost every year one with another till      though unsuccessful in his performance on the stage yet it is observed by cibber that he read his pieces with a degree of excellence which astonished the most capital actors of that age mr lee was not only careless in his economy a foible incident to the poetic race but rakishly ravagant to that degree as to be frequently plunged into the lowest depths of misery his wit and genius were also of the same unlucky turn turgid unbridled and apt to break the bounds of sense thus gifted by nature he left the reins loose to his imagination till at length indigence and poetical enthusiasm transported him into madness so that in november      he was taken into bedlam where he continued four years under the care of the physicians he was discharged in april      being so much recovered as to be able to return to his occupation of writing for the stage and he produced two plays afterward the princess of cleve in      and the massacre of paris the following year however notwithstanding the profits arising from these performances he was this year reduced to so low n ebb that a weekly stipend of ten shillings from the theare royal was his chief dependence he was not so clear of his phrenzy as not to suffer some temporary relapses and erhaps his untimely end might be occasioned by one he died this year    0 as it is said in a drunken frolic by night in the street and was interred in the parish of st clement danes near temple bar he is the author of eleven plays all acted with applause and printed as soon as finished with dedications of most of them to the earls of dorset mulgrave pembroke the duchesses of portsmouth and richmond as his patrons mr addison declares that among our modern english poets there was none better turned for tragedy than our author if instead of favoring the impetuosity of his genius he had restrained it and kept it within proper bounds his thoughts are wonderfully suited to tragedy but frequently lost in such a cloud of words that it is hard to see the beauty of them there is an infinite fire in his works but so involved in smoke that it does not appear in half its luster he frequently succeeds in the passionate parts of the tragedy but more particularly where he slackens his efforts and eases the style of those epithets and metaphors in which he so much abounds his rival queens and theodosius or the force of love still keep possession of the stage these plays excel in moving the passions especially that universal one love he is said to be particularly a master in that art and for that reason has been compared to ovid among the ancients and to otway among the moderns mr dryden prefixed a copy of commendatory verses to the rival queens and our author joined with that laureat in writing the tragedy of the duke of guise and that of oedipus these particulars are extracted principally from the biographical dictionary n  come then at last while anxious nations weep three kingdoms staked too precious for the deep too precious sure for when the trump of fame did with a direful sound your wreck

rolls about and represents to my dim weary sight my light of life almost as near burnt out ah health best part and substance of our joy for without thee it is nothing but a shade why do thou partially thyself employ whilst thy proud foes as partially invade what we who never enjoy so fondly seek those who possess thee still almost despise to gain immortal glory raise the weak taught by their former want thy worth to prize dear melancholy muse my constant guide charm this coy health back to my fainting heart or i will accuse thee of vainglorious pride and swear thou do but feign the moving art but why do i upbraid thee gentle muse who for all sorrows make me some amends alas our sickly minds sometimes abuse our best physicians and our dearest friends song by the same how hardly i concealed my tears how often did i complain when many tedious days my fears told me i loved in vain but now my joys as wild are grown and hard to be concealed sorrow may make a silent moan but joy will be revealed i tell it to the bleating flocks to every stream and tree and bless the hollow murmuring rocks for echoing back to me thus you may see with how much joy we want we wish believe it is hard such passion to destroy but easy to deceive the lamentations of jeremiah by the same   how does the mournful widowed city bow she that was once so great alas how low once filled with joy with desolation now   tears on her cheeks and sables on her head she mourns her lovers lost and comforts dead alas alas lost city where are those so proud once to be friends now turned her foes   judah is gone alas to bondage gone amongst the heathen judah mourns alone grieved and in servitude she finds no rest followed by none but those by whom oppressed   the feasts of zion no one now attends unhappy zion destitute of friends her priests still sigh and all her virgins mourn because her gladness now finds no return   her enemies are great and ever nigh still fortunate because her crimes were high her captived children still her guilt upbraid who mourn whilst their insulting foes invade   her beauty which excelled is now no more that brightness which all nations did adore her princes are like hunted hearts become breathless and faint whilst the pursuit goes on alas for zion all their strength is gone   jerusalem then thought upon the hour when she was crowned with peace delight and power thoughts once so joyful mournful now and vain the foe insults whilst she no helps sustain mocking both at her sabbaths and her pain   her crimes have caused her to be far removed jerusalem who was so well beloved all those who in her pride admired her fame despise her now because they have seen her shame sighing she turns away with shame distressed amazed despised deserted and oppressed   circled with guilt and shame she cannot fly her comforts far removed her end too nigh she vainly thinks on that it is now too late behold those griefs which no one can repeat her fall is steep and all her foes are great  0 her sanctuary is by them betrayed all her delights they carelessly invade even the heathen of whom god had said they should not in her holy temple tread    her hungry people sigh and give away for bread their treasures lest their lives decay consider lord see her with cares bowed down for i am vile and zion left alone    all you who pass this way behold and see are my griefs small do others grieve like me are not these sorrows under which i bow with which the lord has brought my soul so low turn back and mourn with me because my lord in his fierce anger does no peace afford    he from above has flames and horror sent circling my soul with pain and discontent his snares alas my weary feet betray whilst desolate and faint i mourn all day for zion lost her glory thrown away    our sins have brought those chains which his command has fastened now who can his power withstand now they are linked by his almighty hand the lord forsakes and i am now the scorn of enemies because of god forlorn he was my strength and now alas it is gone    my mighty men are all by him cast down they are crushed by numbers and i am left alone whilst silently thy virgin daughters mourn unhappy mournful judah left forlorn    for this i weep and waste myself in tears because her helps far off and sorrows near ah wretched judah where is now thy hope thy foes still triumph whilst thy children droop    zion spreads forth her arms to be relieved but who can comfort whom the lord has grieved her enemies increase and flourish still by his command by his allpowerful will ah wretched city scorned and shamed by all who can enough lament thy dreadful fall    yet he is just for i am guilty found the lord with righteousness is always crowned ye that pass by see me with sorrows drowned my weight of sin has pressed me to the ground who is it now my freedom can restore my youth and captive virgins are no more    i called for all my friends but they were gone friendship grows cold when misery comes on with hunger pined my priests and rulers died within my walls perished my strength and guide  0 my crimes were great so are my sorrows now behold my lord see the afflicted bow abroad the unwearied sword bereaves of breath and grief at home is a more cruel death    all round me hear my sighs and see my tears whilst there is none that can relieve my cares my foes hear and rejoice at what is done but thou will surely lord at last return and then the enemy like me will mourn    their crimes are great turn mighty lord and see afflict them then as thou afflicted me my griefs are great turn therefore and relent my sighs are many and my heart is faint song to a lady who discovered a new star in cassiopeia by mr charles dryden eldest son of the great high priest of all the nine

lies but if less ruin will atone let strephons only fate suffice ariadnes complaint upon a rock in the island of naxos on being deserted by theseus by william cartwright son of thomas cartwright of burford in oxfordshire was born aug         this is the account given by lloyd but wood who may be supposed wellinformed says he was the son of a gentleman of broken fortune who was reduced to keep an inn at cirencester in gloucestershire was born at northway near tewksbury in september      and received the early part of his education at cirencester free school being placed as a kings scholar at westminster he was elected to christ church oxford in      where he took the degree of ma in      the same writer informs us he went through the classes of logic and philosophy with an unwearied industry took holy orders and became the most florid and scraphical preacher in the university he was another tully and virgil as being most excellent for oratory and poetry in which faculties as also in the greek tongue he was so full and absolute that those that best knew him knew not in which he most excelled so admirably well versed also was he in metaphysics that when he was reader of them in the university the exposition of them was never better performed than by him and his predecessor thomas barlow of queens college his preaching also was so graceful and profound withal that none of his time or age went beyond him so that if the wits read his poems divines his sermons and philosophers his lectures on aristotles metaphysics they would scarcely believe that he died at a little above thirty years of age but that which is most remarkable is that these his high parts and abilities were accompanied with so much candor and sweetness that they made him equally beloved and admired of all persons especially those of the gown and court who esteemed also his life a fair copy of practic piety a rare example of heroic worth and in whom arts learning and language made up the true complement of perfection in      bishop duppa appointed him to be succentor in the church of salisbury and in      he was chosen junior proctor of the university he was also metaphysical reader to the university ben jonson said of him my son cartwright writes like a man there are extant of this authors four plays besides other poems which were printed together in      accompanied by above fifty copies of commendatory verses by the wits of the university a wood tells us mr cartwright wrote also   poemata graeca et latina   an offspring of mercy issuing out of the womb of cruelty a passion sermon preached at christ church in oxford on acts ii      on the signal days in the month of november in relation to the crown and royal family a poem   poems and verses containing airs for several voices set by mr henry laws his royal slave was acted before the king and queen by his fellowstudents of christ church of whom the most applauded was mr busby afterward the celebrated master of westminster school wit learning judgment elocution a graceful person and behavior occasioned that wellknown encomium of him from dean fell that he was the utmost man could come to this instance of the perfection of human nature was also an instance of its vanity he was suddenly snatched away by a fever in the prime of life on the twentyninth of november      and had the honor to be regretted by his sovereign and his queen who were in oxford at the time of his death see wood and granger jacob says cartwright was a kings scholar at eton under dr olbaston eminent for learning and loyalty an excellent scholar and an admirable poet expert in the latin greek french and italian languages the wits of oxford prefixed recommendatory verses to his works  after such eulogiums it seems a kind of poetical blasphemy to annex the opinion of dr king who says cartwrights poems seem to me very indifferent n  theseus o theseus hark but yet in vain alas deserted i complain it was some neighboring rock more soft than he whose hollow bowels pitied me and beating back that false and cruel name did comfort and revenge my flame tell me ye gods whoever ye are why o why made ye him so fair and tell me wretch why thou made not thy self more true beauty from him may copies take and more majestic heroes make and falsehood learn awhile from him too to beguile restore my clew it is here most due for it is a labyrinth of more subtle art to have so fair a face so foul a heart the ravenous vulture tear his breast the rolling stone disturb his rest let him next feel ixions wheel and add one fable more to cursing poets store and then  yet rather let him live and twine his woof of days with some thread stolen from mine but if you will torture him however torture my heart you will find him there till my eyes drank up his and his drank mine i never thought souls might kiss and spirits join pictures till then took me as much as men nature and art moving alike my heart but his fair visage made me find pleasures and fears hopes sighs and tears as several seasons of the mind should thine eye venus on his dwell thou would invite him to thy shell and caught by that live jet venture the second net and after all thy dangers faithless he should thou but slumber would forsake even thee the streams so court the yielding banks and gliding thence never pay their thanks the winds so woo the flowers whispering among fresh bowers and having robbed them of their smells fly thence perfumed to other cells this is familiar hate to smile and kill though nothing please thee yet my ruin will death hover hover over me then waves let your crystal womb be both my fate and tomb i will sooner trust the sea than men and yet o nymphs below who sit in whose swift floods his vows he writ snatch a sharp diamond from the richer mines and in some mirror grave these sadder lines which let some god convey to him that so he may in that both read at once and see those looks that caused my destiny in thetis arms i ariadne sleep drowned first by my own tears then in the deep twice banished first by love and then by hate the life that i preserved became my fate who leaving all was by him left alone that from a monster freed himself proved one that then i  but look o mine eyes be now true spies yonder yonder comes my dear now my wonder once my fear see satyrs dance along in a confused throng while horns and pipes rude noise do mad their lusty joys roses his forehead crown and that recrowns the flowers where he walks up and down he makes the deserts bowers the ivy and the grape hide not adorn his shape and green leaves cloth his waving rod it is either theseus or some god in memory of the most worthy ben jonson by the same father of poets though thine own great day struck from thyself scorns that a weaker ray should twine in luster with it yet my flame kindled from thine flies upwards toward thy name for in the acclamation of the less there is piety though from it no access and though my ruder thoughts make me of those who hide and cover what they should disclose yet where the luster s such he makes it seen better to some that draws the veil between and what can more be hoped since that divine freefilling spirit took its flight with thine men may have fury but no raptures now like witches charm yet not know whence nor how and through distemper grown not strong but fierce instead of writing only rave in verse which when by thy laws judged twill be confessed twas not to be inspired but be possessed where shall we find a muse like thine that can so well present and show man unto man that each one finds his twin and thinks thy art extends not to the gestures but the heart where one so showing life to life that we think thou taughtst custom and not custom thee manners that were themes to thy scenes still flow in the same stream and are their comments now these times thus living over thy models we think them not so much wit as prophesy and though we know the character may swear a sibyls finger has been busy there things common thou speak proper which though known for public stamped by thee grow thence thine own thy thoughts so ordered so expressed that we conclude that thou did not discourse but see language so mastered that thy numerous feet laden with genuine words do always meet each in his art nothing unfit does fall showing the poet like the wiseman all thine equal skill thus wrestling nothing made thy pen seem not so much to write as trade that life that venus of all things which we conceive or show proportioned decency is not found scattered in thee here and there but like the soul is wholly every where no strange perplexed maze does pass for plot thou always do untie not cut the knot thy labyrinths doors are opened by one thread that ties and runs through all that is done or said no power comes down with learned hat and rod wit only and contrivance is thy god it is easy to gild gold there is small skill spent where even the first rude mass is ornament thy muse took harder metals purged and boiled labored and tried heated and beat and toiled sifted the dross filled roughness then gave dress vexing rude subjects into comeliness be it thy glory then that we may say thou runst where the foot was hindered by the way nor do thou pour out but dispense thy vein skilled when to spare and when to entertain not like our wits who into one piece do throw all that they can say and their friends too pumping themselves for one terms noise so dry as if they made their wills in poetry and such spruce compositions press the stage when men transcribe themselves and not the age both sorts of plays are thus like pictures shown thine of the common life theirs of their own thy models yet are not so framed as we may call them libels and not imagery no name on any basis it is thy skill to strike the vice but spare the person still as he who when he saw the serpent wreathed about his sleeping son and as he breathed drinkin his soul did so the shoot contrive to kill the beast but keep the child alive so do thou aim thy darts which even when they kill the poisons do but wake the men thy thunders thus but purge and we endure thy launcings better than anothers cure and justly too for the age grows more unsound from the fools balsam than the wise mans wound no rotten talk breaks for a laugh no page commenced man by the instructions of thy stage no bargaining line there no provoctive verse nothing but what lucretius might rehearse no need to make good countenance ill and use the plea of strict life for a looser muse no woman ruled thy quill we can descry no verse born under any cynthias eye thy star was judgment only and right sense thy self being to thy self an influence stout beauty is thy grace stern pleasures do present delights but mingle horrors too thy muse does thus like joves fierce girl appear with a fair hand but grasping of a spear where are they now that cry thy lamp did drink more oil than the author wine while he did think we do embrace their slander thou have writ not for dispatch but fame no marketwit twas not thy care that it might pass and sell but that it might endure and be done well nor would thou venture it unto the ear until the file would not make smooth but wear thy verse came seasoned hence and would not give born not to feed the author but to live whence among the choicer judges rose a strife to make thee read as classic in thy life those that do hence applause and suffrage beg cause they can poems form upon one leg write not to time but to the poets day there is difference between fame and sudden pay these men sing kingdoms fall as if that fate used the same force to a village and a state these serve thyestes bloody supper in as if it had only a sallad been their catilines are but fencers whose fights rise not to the fame of battle but of prize but thou still puttst true passions on do write with the same courage that tried captains fight givst the right blush and color unto things low without creeping high without loss of wings smooth yet not weak and by a thorough care big without swelling without painting fair they wretches while they cannot stand to fit are not wits but materials of wit what though thy searching wit did rake the dust of time and purge old metals of their rust is it no labor no art think they to snatch shipwrecks from the deep as diverse do and rescue jewels from the covetous sand making the seas hid wealth adorn the land what though thy culling muse did rob the store of greek and latin gardens to bring over plants to thy native soil their virtues were improved far more by being planted here if thy still to their essence does refine so many drugs is not the water thine thefts thus become just works they and their grace are wholly thine thus does the stamp and face make that the kings that s ravished from the mine in others then it is ore in thee it is coin blessed life of authors unto whom we owe those that we have and those that we want too you are all so good that reading makes thee worse and to have writ so wells thine only curse secure then of thy merit thou did hate that servile base dependence upon fate success thou never thought virtue nor that fit which chance and the ages fashion did make hit excluding those from life in aftertime who into poetry first brought luck and rhyme who thought the peoples breath good air styled name what was but noise and getting briefs for fame gathered the manys suffrages and thence made commendation a benevolence thy thoughts were their own laurel and did win that best applause of being crowned within and though the exacting age when deeper years had interwoven snow among thy hairs would not permit thou should grow old cause they never by thy writings knew thee young we may say justly they are ungrateful when they more condemned thee cause thou were so good before thine art was thine arts blur and they ll confess thy strong perfumes made them not smell thee less but though to err with thee be no small skill and we adore the last draughts of thy quill though thse thy thoughts which the now queasy age does count but clods and refuse of the stage will come up porcelainwit some hundreds hence when there will be more manners and more sense twas judgment yet to yield and we afford thy silence as much fame as once thy word who like an aged oak the leaves being gone wast food before art now religion thought still more rich though not so richly stored viewed and enjoyed before but now adored great soul of numbers whom we want and boast like curing gold most valued now thou t lost when we shall feed on refuse offals when we shall from corn to acorns turn again then shall we see that these two names are one jonson and poetry which now are gone a new catch would you know how we meet over our jolly full bowls as we mingle our liquors we mingle our souls the sweet melts the sharp the kind sooths the strong and nothing

the fathers kindness and the princes care nor war nor exile nor a fathers blood nor just revenge for injured virtue could the native sweetness of his mind control or change the godlike temper of his soul contending rebels seemed in vain to strive they could not more offend than he forgive a nobler triumph and more glorious far than all the trophies of destructive war for mercy does a bloodless conquest find and with sweet force the rudest passions bind the gaping wounds of civil rage he mourned and saved his country first and then adorned our dreadful navy does in triumph ride and the

motion on his will did wait the threatening cloud we saw at last withdrawn and a new morn of triumphs seemed to dawn the auspicious prospect did bright years foreshow and golden times in long succession seemed to flow once more he did our civil jars compose and gained new glories from his pardoned foes no private passion to revenge could draw but justice governed and impartial law so just yet so indulgently severe like heaven he pitied those he could not spare and forced to draw the necessary sword the sad effects of their own crimes abhorred now just success the royal conduct crowned and stubborn factions their great sovereign owned but ah black shades his sacred head surround nor do thou fall unwept three kingdoms groan and in their rulers fate bewail their own justice and equal government are things that subjects make more happy than their kings thy fame best prince if poets can divine shall the great troublers of the world outshine successful robberies their titles swell

amazing virtues recommend the kindest brother and the bravest friend the reapers this idyllium is generally excluded by the critics from the number of the pastorals but is considered as such by mr fawkes in his translation of the syracusan bard i am aware that in the preface to that elegant performance not only this of mr bowls but all former versions of theocritus are reprobated as sounding

complaint of ariadne from catullus by mr w bowls the poet in the epithalamium of peleus and thetis describes the genial bed on which was wrought the story of theseus and ariadne and on that occasion makes a long digression part of which is the subject of the following poem  there on the extremest beach and farthest sand deserted ariadne seemed to stand newwakd and raving with her love she flew to the dire shore from whence she might pursue with longing eyes but all alas in vain the winged bark over the tempestuous main for buried in fallacious sleep she lay while through the waves false theseus cut his way regardless of her fate who saved his youth winds bore away his promise and his truth like some wild bacchanal unmoved she stood and with fixed eyes surveyed the raging flood there with alternate waves the sea does roll nor less the tempests that distract her soul abandoned to the winds her flowing hair rage in her soul expressed and wild despair her rising breasts with indignation swell and her loose robes disdainfully repel the shining ornaments that dressed her head when with the glorious ravisher she fled now at her mistress feet neglected lay sport of the wanton waves that with them play but she nor them regards nor waves that beat her snowy legs and wound her tender feet on theseus her lost senses all attend and all the passions of her soul depend long did her weaker sense contend in vain she sunk at last beneath the mighty pain with various ills beset and stupid grown she lost the power those ills even to bemoan but when the first assault and fierce surprise were past and grief had found a passage at her eyes with cruel hands her snowy breast she wounds theseus in vain through all the shore resounds now urged by love she plunges in the main and now draws back her tender feet again thrice she repeats the vain attempt to wade thrice fear and cold her shivering limbs invade fainting at last she hung her beauteous head and fixing on the shore her eyes she said ah cruel man and did i leave for thee my parents friends for thou wast all to me and is my love and is my faith thus paid oh cruelty unheard a wretched maid here on a naked shore abandoned and betrayed betrayed to mischiefs of which death s the least and plunged in ills too great to be expressed yet the gods will the gods contemned by you with vengeance thy devoted ship pursue overtake thy sails and rack thy guilty breast and with new plagues the illomend flight infest but though no pity thy stern breast could move nor angry gods nor illrequired love yet sense of honor sure should touch thy heart and shame from low unmanly flight divert with other hopes my easy faith you fed a glorious triumph and a nuptial bed but all those joys with thee alas are fled let no vain woman vows and oaths believe they only with more form and pomp deceive to compass their lewd ends the wretches swear of oaths profuse nor gods nor temples spare but when enjoyed  nor broken vows nor angry heaven they fear but o ye women warned by me be wise turn their false oaths on them their arts their lies dissemble fawn weep swear when you betray defeat the gamesters at their own foul play oh banished faith but now from certain death i snatched the wretch and saved his perjured breath his life with my own brothers blood i bought and love by such a cruel service sought by me preserved yet me he does betray and to wild beasts expose an easy prey nor thou of royal race nor human stock wast born but nursed by bears and issued from a rock too plain thou do thy dire extraction prove who death for life returnst and hate for love yet he securely sails and i in vain recall the fled and to deaf rocks complain unmoved they stand yet could they see and hear more human would than cruel man appear but i  must the sad pleasure of compassion want and die unheard and lose my last complaint happy ye gods too happy had i lived had thou o charming stranger never arrived dissembled sweetness in thy look does shine but ah the inhuman monsters lurk within what now remains or whom shall i implore in a wild isle on a deserted shore shall i return and beg my fathers aid my fathers whom ungrateful i betrayed and with my brothers cruel murderer fled but theseus ariadne s constant kind kind as the seas and constant as the wind see wretched maid vast seas around thee roar and angry waves beat the resounding shore cut off thy hopes and intercept thy flight no ship appears to bless thy longing sight the dismal isle no human footstep bears but a sad silence doubles all my fears and fate in all its dreadful shapes appears even fainting nature scarce maintains the strife betwixt prevailing death and yielding life yet ere i die revenging gods i will call and curse him first and then contented fall ascend ye furies then ascend and hear my last complaints and grant my dying prayer which grief and rage for illrewarded love and the deep sense of his injustice move oh suffer not my latest words to fly like common air and unregarded die with vengeance his dire treachery pursue for vengeance goddesses attends on you terror with you despair and death appear and all the frightful forms the guilty fear may his proud ship by furious billows tossed on rocks or some wild shore like this be lost there may he fall or late returning see if so the gods and so the fates decree a mournful house

same proud eunica when i advanced to kiss laughed loud and cried how ignorant he is alas poor man dare you a wretched swain lips such as these and such a mouth profane no to prevent your rustic freedom know they re unacquainted yet with such as you but your soft lip your beard your horny fist all charming and all suing to be kissed your matted hair and your smooth chin invite conspire to make you lovely to the sight oh how you look how prettily you play how soft your words and what fine things you say yet to prevent infection pray be gone your neighborhood methinks is dangerous grown vanish nor dare to touch me  oh the shame he smells of the rank goats from which he came this said with indignation thrice she spit surveyed me with disdain from head to feet then was fierce rage and conscious beauty seen in all her motions and her haughty mien she prayed as if she some contagion feared cast a disdainful smile and disappeared my boiling blood sprang with my rage and spread over all my burning face a fiery red so roses blush when night her kindly dew has shed i rage i curse the haughty jilt that jeered my graceful person and my comely beard ye shepherds i conjure you tell me true has any god cast my old form anew how am i changed for once a matchless grace shone in the charming features of my face like creeping ivy did my beard oergrow and my long hair in untaught curls did flow my brows were black and my large forehead white my sparkling eyes shot forth a radiant light in sweetest words did my soft language flow as honey sweet and soft as falling snow when with loud notes i the shrill pipe inspired the listening shepherds all my skill admired me all the virgins on our mountains love they praise my beauty and my flames approve such though i am yet me because a swain how nice these townbred women are how vain gay eunica rejected with disdain and she it seems has never heard or read how bacchus now a god a flock once fed venus herself did the profession grace by love transformed into a country lass the phrygian fields and woods her flames can tell and how her muchbewaild adonis fell how often on latmos did the moon descend from her bright chariot to her carian friend and absent from the sky whole nights with him did spend to shining in her orb prefer her love stoop and desert her glorious seat above and was not he a shepherd sure he was yet did not

the feast in all the charms of art and nature dressed cynisca all our ravished senses fed we gazed and we adored the lovely maid with wine and beauty all our hearts were fired and fair cynisca still new joys inspired now healths we drank and as the glasses came such was the law each did his mistress name charming cynisca too at last was pressed to name the lover in her favor blessed a woman sure she hoped might be excused the more they urged her she the more refused refused oh friend and i her lover by guess if my rage with wine inflamed grew high silent she sat and with her eyes denied lycus

mine successful damon burned diseased he parted and he sound returned i too the uncertain remedy will try and to less cruel seas and rocks will fly  thyonicus from hence to the conclusion is rather an

noise how you my restless thought delight o heavens what content is mine to see those trees which have appeared from the nativity of time and which all ages have revered to look today as fresh and green as when their beauties first were seen ii a cheerful wind does court them so and with such amorous breath enfold that we by nothing else can know but by their height that they are old hither the demigods did fly to seek a sanctuary when displeased jove once pierced the sky to pour a deluge upon men and on these boughs themselves did save whence they could hardly see a wave iii sad philomel upon this thorn so curiously by flora dressed in melting notes her case forlorn to entertain me has confessed oh how agreeable a sight these hanging mountains do appear which the unhappy would invite to finish all their sorrows here when their hard fate makes them endure such woes as only death can cure iv what pretty desolations make these torrents vagabond and fierce who in vast heaps their spring forsake this solitary vale to pierce then sliding just as serpents do under the foot of every tree themselves are changed to rivers too wherein some stately naiade as in her native bed is grown a quen upon a crystal throne v the den beset with riverplants o how it does my senses charm nor elders reeds nor willows wants which the sharp steel did never harm here nymphs which come to take the air may with such distaffs furnished be as flags and rushes can prepare where we the nimble frogs may see who frighted to retreat do fly if an approaching man they spy vi here waterfowl repose enjoy without the interrupting care lest fortune should their bliss destroy by the malicious fowlers sare some ravished with so bright a day their feathers finely prune and deck others their amorous heats allay which yet the waters could not check all take their innocent content in this their lovely element vii summers nor winters bold approach this stream did never entertain nor ever felt a boa or coach whilst either season did remain no thirsty traveller came near and rudely made his hand his cup nor any hunted hind has here her hopeless life resigned up nor ever did the treacherous hook intrude to empty any brook viii what beauty is there in the sight of these old ruined castle walls in which the utmost rage and spite of times worst insurrection falls the witches keep their sabbath here and wanton devils make retreat who in malicious sport appear our senses both to afflict and cheat and here within a thousand holes are nests of adders and of owls ix the raven with his dismal cries that mortal augury of fate whose ghastly goblin gratifies which in these gloomy places wait on a cursed tree the wind does move a carcass which did once belong to one that hanged himself for love of a fair nymph that did him wrong who though she saw his love and truth with one look would not save the youth x but heaven which judges equally and its own laws will still maintain rewarded

up sense and every care he does forbid whilst in the arms of negligence lazily on his back he s spread and sheaves of poppey are his bed xiii within this cool and hollow cave where love itself might turn to ice poor echo ceases not to rave on her narcissus wild and nice hither i softly steal a thought and by the softer music made with a sweet lute in charms welltaught sometimes i slatter her sad shade whilst of my chords i make such choice to serve as body to her voice xiv when from these ruins i retire this horrid rock i do invade whose lofty brow seems to enquire of what materials mists are made from thence descending leisurely under the brow of this steep hill it with great pleasure i descry by waters undermined until they to palaemons seat did climb composed of spunges and of slime xv how highly is the fancy pleased to be upon the oceans shore when she begins to be appeased and her fierce billows cease to roar and when the hairy tritons are riding upon the shaken wave with what strange sound they strike the air of their trumpets hoarse and brave whose shrill report does every wind unto his due submission bind xvi sometimes the sea dispels the sand trembling and murmuring in the bay and rolls itself upon the shells which it both brings and takes away sometimes exposes on the strand the effects of neptunes rage and scorn drowned men dead monsters cast on land and ships

rough where all alone i love to walk and with discourse refined enough my genius and the muses talk but the converse most truly mine is the dear memory of thine xix thou may in this poem find so full of liberty and heat what illustrious rays have shined to enlighten my conceit sometimes pensive sometimes gay just as that fury does control and as the object i survey the notions grow up in my soul and are as unconfined and free as the flame which transported me xx oh how i solitude adore that element of noblest wit where i have learned apollos lore without the pains to study it for thy sake i

quick and luxuriant fancy that it gives a stop to its speed till slow judgment comes in to assist it and again verses i mean good ones do in their height of fancy declare the labor that brought them forth like majesty that grows with care and nature that made the poet capable seems to retire and leave its offers to be made perfect by pains and judgment these passages appear to be alluded to above see an account of sir robert p     r  because he would rather choose to spoil his verse than tire his muse nor will he let heroics chime fancy quoth he is lost by rhyme and he that is used to clashing swords should not delight in sounds of words mars with mercury should not mingle great warriors should speak big not jingle amongst this heptarchy of wit the censuring age have thought it fit to damn

at the restoration and rewarded by the office of auditor of the exchequer he was chosen member for stockbridge in      and for castle rising in      and      he was so strong an advocate for the revolution as to disclaim all manner of conversation with the nonjurors and by his obstinacy and pride made many enemies his patron the duke of buckingham had in      exposed him under the name of bilboa in the rehearsal but afterward altered his resolution and leveled his ridicule at a much greater name under that of bays he was also ridiculed in shadwells sullen lovers    0 under the name of

friend sir r howard on his excellent poems n  since earth and water more dilated air and active fire mixed natures parts appear these all new formed and to destruction brought why of the world may not the like be thought reason presents this maxim to our view what in each part that in the whole is true and therefore when you see spring up and fall natures great parts conclude the like of all know heaven and earth on the same laws depend in time they both began in time shall end but memmius not to assume what some deny the proof on plain experience shall rely i will show these elements to change are prone rise in new shapes continue long in none then first of earth conclude that all must fail which differing parts fermenting can exhale much the reflected rays extract from thence and from their burning heat no less the expense the dust and smoke in flying clouds appear which boisterous winds disperse through liquid air some parts dissolve and flow away in rain and from their banks the rapid rivers gain a diminution nothing ever escapes which new existence gives to other shapes plants minerals and concretes owe their birth and animals their growth in part to earth then since from this their beings first did spring time all to this their common grave does bring in these examples not to mention more nature does earth consume and earth restore the springs the rivers and the seas are found for earths supply with waters to abound renewed and flowing in continual round lest these increasing should at last prevail the mighty ocean fiercer winds assail vast shoals of atoms thence away they bear and raising them aloft transform to air much is extracted from the powerful sun more does in subterranean channels run in earth it first excessive saltness spends then to our springs and rivers heads ascends these in the fruitful valleys turn and wind and still to new productions are inclined and next of air which in its vast extent in changes infinite each hour is spent for airs wide ocean still requiring more filled with effluvia should it not restore the perished shapes times ruins to repair long since had all things been dissolved to air from others loss its being it receives to these again its changing substance leaves so true it is that nature ebbs and flows and one part perishing another grows the sun the fountain of the glorious rays instead of vanished light new light displays the brightness of the flying minute past is now obscured and to new forms does haste from hence it comes that when black clouds draw near and banished sunshine strait does disappear the earth s oershadowd as the storms are driven and rays new darted are required from heaven vision would cease so soon would light expire without recruits of bright etherial fire in our inferior and sulphurous light of lamps and tapers chacing shades of night continued fuel feeds the trembling flame which gives the light nor is that light the same of sun of moon of stars never think it strange that they are not secure from final change when what so late did smile this instant dies and newborn light still shines to mortal eyes thus we observe hard rocks in time decayed the marble monuments for heroes made and stately towers in humble ruins laid do gods their images from age secure or force their temples always to endure thus when you see old rocks from mountains fall by this conclude their sure original for were they from eternity so placed no chance could ruin them no time could waste next raise your eyes to earthsurrounding spheres from which say some springs all that now appears to which at last their vanished parts ascend these as they re formed to dissolution tend for all things must in such proportion cease as they to other beings give increase but then if no beginning does appear of heaven and earth but both eternal were before the theban war was ever proclaimed or fatal siege of troy by homer famed why did not far more ancient poets sing what revolutions elder times did bring such men such acts how in oblivion drowned as with immortal fame might well be crowned no great antiquity the world has proved eternity from this seems far removed all arts and science else would long ago have reached perfection not now daily grow no ancient sailors ever like ours did steer no such harmonious music charmed the ear this nature of the world not ages past was brought to light retarded for the last and these discoveries ordained by fate to foreign climes i with the first translate but still if no beginning you believe and say it is easier for us to conceive such conflagrations from sulphurous power as totally did human race devour or general earthquakes did the world confound or all in mighty deluges were drowned this force of argument you then increase that heaven and earth in future time must cease for which such dreadful danger threatened all though nature then escaped a total fall grant but the cause increased and twill not fail as did the less over all things to prevail what shows we cannot endless life enjoy b sense of ills which others did destroy if you the worlds duration would extend to all eternity you must defend its solid substance is so firmly bound no penetration can it ever wound minutest atoms it is confessed are so but not the compound which from these did grow or that it is immaterial you must prove and what no forcing agent can remove or else you must all ambient space deny to which it may dissolved and ruined fly thus universal claims eternals place because it never can pass to external space but neither is this various globe so fixed for much vacuity is intermixed nor is it void of matter nor can be from threatening power of penetration free and powers unknown from boundless ambient space this present state of nature may deface with dreadful hurricanes they may invade and turn to chaos all that ever was made or by some other means beyond the reach of mans conception make the fatal breach nor wants there space beyond the spheres of heaven to which the ruined parts may then be driven whenever these elements their mansions leave that vast abyss lies open to receive from hence to their beginning you re directed what magic charms have always so protected that when the finite parts expiring lie the whole eternal ages should defy then since the worlds great parts at once engage and civil wars in its dominions rage we may foresee their strife so long depending at last in general subversion ending rivers and seas consumed fierce fires may burn till all their ashes meet in earths great urn even now they strive the victory to gain but still the ocean does the fight maintain and swelled with rivers hopes by forces tried to drown the rest and sole in triumph ride this to prevent the swift exhausting wind and radiant sun against liquid force are joined thus equal in appearance long they moved each others strength in mighty wars they proved at last the fire it is said did win the field and earth did once overwhelmed with waters yield long since when phaeton led by vain desire to drive the suns great chariot did aspire twas then the world was hazarded by fire with headstrong force the winged horses flew over earth and heaven the burning planet drew what then had been the fate of all things here if angry jove the daring charioteer had not dismounted by swift lightnings stroke and so at once the flaming progress broke thus phaeton slain was falling to the ground and furious horses dragged the chariot round when great apollo reassumed the chair restored the sun that roved throughout the air with dextrous force reclaimed his raging steeds and to this hour in annual course proceeds greek poets thus the truth with lies confound to waking men like wandering dreams they sound but though to grace their morals they romance true fires did then from east to west advance such magazines of sulphur earth contains that if some stronger agent not restrains the fuel all inflamed and raging high will never be quenched till all in ruins lie the water too did as our authors tell in ages past to such proportion swell that spacious empires wholly were destroyed the ocean

the duke of buckingham george villiers duke of buckingham a noble writer a man of great wit and humor and of the most whimsical caprice was the admiration and the jest of the reign of charles ii he

the stage it was finished before the end of      but the great plague and other accidents prevented its being acted before      he is said to have been assisted in this comedy by dr spratt mr clifford

marriage but was mortified with a denial he afterward married the only daughter of lord fairfax and was soon committed to the tower by the protector on the restoration he was at first slighted by the king but the charms of his wit and conversation soon prevailed and he was appointed a lord of the bedchamber in may      he purchased the office of master of the horse was installed chancellor of

epistle to lord bathurst and see some further particulars of a peer who was of so great and at the same time of so little a character in granger vol iii p     his works were published in      in   vols  vo n  my lord i should beg your pardon could i apprehend it were an error to present any thing to your grace which comes from me to whom i have made so entire a dedication of myself but this advantage appears in all real esteems and friendships they are as much above the ceremonies of the world as the usual practice of it but your grace has a farther title to this being more yours than mine as much as an image well shaped and polished is more properly due to him that gave it that perfection than to him that first dug the stone out of the quarry it was an illcontrived house within full of entries and unuseful passages till your grace was pleased to take them away and make it habitable for any candid opinion at the same time when your grace made this your own you made me more justly yours it was in your confinement where after some concealment of yourself to weigh the circumstances and causes of your persecution you generously exposed yourself to stand all hazards and trials from the assurance of your courage and advice of your innocence and as your grace in your adversity has found the advantage of an unshaken honor i doubt not but your prince and nation will find an equal benefit in your better fortunes by your counsel and service which will always be directed by such a steady virtue and may all advantages that you increase in and all the nation receives by you be equalled by nothing but the content of my lord your graces  most humble and faithful servant robert howard  in windsor forest before war destroyed the harmless pleasure which soft peace enjoyed a mighty stag grew monarch of the herd by all his savage slaves obeyed and feared and while the troops about their sovereign fed they watched the awful nodding of his head still as he passes by they all remove proud in dominion prouder in his love and while with pride and appetite he swells he courts no chosen object but compels no subject his loved mistress dares deny but yields his hopes up to his tyranny long had this prince imperiously thus swayed by no set laws but by his will obeyed his fearful slaves to full obedience grown admire his strength and dare not use their own one subject most did his suspicion move that showed least fear and counterfeited love in the best pastures by his side he fed armed with two large militias on his head as if he practiced majesty he walked and at his nod he made not haste but stalked by his large shade he saw how great he was and his vast layers on the bended grass his thoughts as large as his proportion grew and judged himself as fit for empire too thus to rebellious hopes he swelled at length love and ambition growing with his strength this hid ambition his bold passion shows and from a subject to a rival grows solicits all his princes fearful dames and in his sight courts with rebellious flames the prince sees this with an inflamed eye but looks are only signs of majesty when once a princes will meets a restraint his power is then esteemed but his complaint his head then shakes at which the affrighted herd start to each side his rival not afeard stands by his mistress side and stirs not thence but bids her own his love and his defense the quarrel now to a vast height is grown both urged to fight by passion and a throne but love has most excuse for all we find have passions though not thrones alike assigned the sovereign stag shaking his loadedhead on which his scepters with his arms were spread wisely by nature there together fixed where with the title the defense was mixed the pace which he advanced with to engage became at once his majesty and rage to other stands still with as much confidence to make his part seem only his defense their heads now meet and at one blow each strikes as many strokes as if a rank of pikes grew on his brows as thick their antlers stand which every year kind nature does diband wild beasts sometimes in peace and quiet are but man no season frees from love or war with equal strength they met as if two oaks had fell and mingled with a thousand strokes one by ambition urged the other disdain one to preserve the other fought to gain the subjects and the mistresses stood by with love and duty to crown victory for all affections wait on prosperous fame not he that climbs but he that falls meets shame while thus with equal courages they meet the wounded earth yields to their struggling feet and while one slides the other pursues the fight and thinks that forced retreat looks like a flight but then ashamed of his retreat at length drives his foe back his rage renews his strength as even weights into a motion thrown by equal turns drive themselves up and down so sometimes one then to other stag prevails and victory yet doubtful holds the scales the prince ashamed to be opposed so long with all his strength united rushes on the rebel weaker than at first appears and from his courage sinks unto his fears not able longer to withstand his might from a retreat at last steals to a flight the mighty stag pursues his flying foe till his own pride of conquest made him slow thought it enough to scorn a thing that flies and only now pursued him with his eyes the vanquished as he fled turned back his sight ashamed to fly and yet afraid to fight sometimes his wounds as his excuse surveyed then fled again and then looked back and staid blushed that his wounds so slight should not deny strength for a fight that left him strength to fly calls thoughts of love and empire to his aid but fears more powerful than all those persuade and yet in spite of them retains his shame his cooled ambition and his halfquenchd flame there is none from their own sense of shame can fly and dregs of passions dwell with misery now to the shades he bends his feeble course despised by those that once admired his force the wretch that to a scorned condition s thrown with the worlds favor loses too his own while fawning troops their conquering prince enclosed now rendered absolute by being opposed princes by disobedience get command and by newquenchd rebellions firmer stand till by the boundless offers of success they meet their fate in illusd happiness the vanquished stag to thickest shades repairs where he finds safety punished with his cares thorough the woods he rushes not but glides and from all searches but his own he hides ashamed to live unwilling yet to lose that wretched life he knew not how to use in this retirement thus he lived concealed till with his wounds his fears were almost healed his ancient passions now began to move he thought again of empire and of love then roused himself and stretched at his full length took the large measure of his mighty strength then shook his loaded head the shadow too shook like a tree where leafless branches grew stooping to drink he sees it in the streams and in the woods hears clashing of its beams no accident but does alike proclaim his growing strength and his increasing shame now once again resolves to try his fate for envy always is importunate and in the mind perpetually does move a fit companion for unquiet love he thinks upon his mighty enemy circled about with power and luxury and hoped his strength might sink in his desires remembering he had wasted in such fires yet while he hoped by them to overcome he wished the others fatal joys his own thus the unquiet beast in safety lay where nothing was to fear nor to obey where he alone commanded and was lord of every bounty nature did afford chose feasts for every arbitrary sense an empire in the state of innocence but all the feasts nature before him placed had but faint relishes to his lost taste sick minds like bodies in a fever spent turn food to the disease not nourishment sometimes he stole abroad and shrinking stood under the shelter of the friendly wood casting his envious eyes toward those plains where crowned with joys his mighty rival reigns he saw the obeying herd marching along and weighed his rivals greatness by the throng want takes false measures both of power and joys and envied greatness is but crowd and noise not able to endure this hated sight back to the shades he flies to seek out night like exiles from their native soils though sent to better countries think it banishment here he enjoyed what the other could have there the woods as shady and the streams as clear the pastures more untainted where he fed and every night chose out an unpressd bed but then his laboring soul with dreams was pressed and found the greatest weariness in rest his dreadful rival in his sleep appears and in his dreams again he fights and fears shrinks at the strokes of tothers mighty head feels every wound and dreams how fast he fled at this he wakes and with his fearful eyes salutes the light that fleets the eastern skies still half amazed looks round and held by fear scarce can believe no enemy was near but when he saw his heedless fears were brought not by a substance but a drowsy thought his ample sides he shakes from whence the dew in scattered showers like driven tempests flew at which through all his breast new boldness spread and with his courage raised his mighty head then by his love inspired resolves to try the combat now and overcome or die every weak passion sometimes is above the fear of death much more the noblest love by hope it is scorned and by despair it is sought pursued by honor and by sorrow brought resolved the paths of danger now to tread from his scorned shelter and his fears he fled with a brave haste now seeks a second fight redeems the base one by a noble flight in the mean time the conqueror enjoyed that power by which he was to be destroyed how hard it is for the prosperous to see that fate which waits on power and victory thus he securely reigned when in a rout he saw the affrighted herd flying about as if some huntsmen did their chase pursue about themselves in scattered rings they flew he like a careful monarch raised his head to see what cause that strange disturbance bred but when the searchdout cause appeared no more than from a slave he had overcome before a bold disdain did in his looks appear and shook his awful head to chide their fear the herd afraid of friend and enemy sink from the one and from the other fly they scarce know which they should obey or trust since fortune only makes it safe and just yet in despite of all his pride he staid and this unlookdfor chance with trouble weighed his rage and his contempt alike swelled high and only feared his enemy should fly he thought of former conquest and from thence cd himself into a confidence t other that saw his conqueror so near sd still and listened to a whispering fear from whence he heard his conquest and his shame but newborn hopes his ancient fears oercame the mighty enemies now meet at length with equal fury though not equal strength for now too late the conqueror did find that all was wasted in him but his mind his courage in his weakness yet prevails as a bld pilot steers with tattered sails and cordage cracked directs no steady course cd by resolution more than force before his oncescornd enemy he reels his wounds increasing with his shame he feels the others strength more from his weakness grows and with one furious push his rival throws so a tall oak the pride of all the wood that long the assault of several storms had stood till by a mighty blast more strongly pushed his roots torn up and to the earth he rushed yet then he raised his head on which there grew once all his power and all his title too unable now to rise and less to fight he raised those scepters to demand his right but such weak arguments prevail with none to plead their titles when their power is gone his head now sinks and with it all defense not only robbed of power but pretense wounds upon wounds the conqueror still gives and thinks himself unsafe while the other lives unhappy state of such as wear a crown fortune can never lay them gently down now to the most scorned remedy he flies and for some pity seems to move his eyes pity by which the best of virtues tried to wretched princes ever is denied there is a debt to fortune which they pay for all their greatness by no common way the flattering troops unto the victor fly and own his title to his victory the faith of most with fortune does decline dutys but fear and conscience but design the victor now proud in his great success hastes to enjoy his fatal happiness forgot his mighty rival was destroyed by that which he so fondly now enjoyed in passions thus nature herself enjoys sometimes preserves and then again destroys yet all destruction which revenge can move time or ambition is supplied by love to count montecuccoli against pride upon sudden

writer of our female poets and langhaine tells us that all the language and plots of her plays were her own a commendation which will atone for some faults in her numerous productions consisting of

pleasures i enjoy in you when love and youth did both conspire to fill our breasts and veins with fire it is true some other nymph may gain that heart which merits your disdain but second love has still allay the joys grow aged and decay then blame me not for losing more than love and beauty can restore and let this truth thy comfort prove i would but can no longer love  to a very young lady by the same sweetest bud of beauty may no untimely frost decay the early glories which we trace blooming in thy matchless face but kindly opening like the rose fresh beauties every day disclose such as by nature are not shown in all the blossoms she has blown and then what conquest shall you make who hearts already daily take scorched in the morning with thy beams how shall we bear those sad extremes which must attend thy threatening eyes when thou shall to thy noon arise the divided heart by the same ah celia that i were but sure thy love like mine could still endure that time and absence which destroy the cares of lovers and their joy could never rob me of that part which you have given me of your heart others unenvied might possess whole hearts and boast that happiness twas nobler fortune to divide the roman empire in her pride than on some low and barbarous throne obscurely placed to rule alone love only from thy heart exacts the several debts thy face contracts and by that new and juster way secures thy empire and his sway favoring but one he might compel the hopeless lover to rebel but should he other hearts thus share that in the whole so worthless are should

france while with your voice their music you advance your growing fame with envy can oppose who sing with no less art than they compose in these attempts so few have had success their beauties suffer in our english dress by artless hands spoiled of their native air they seldom pass from moderately fair as if you meant these injuries to atone you give them charms more conquering than their own not like the dull laborious flatterer with secret art those graces you confer the skilful painters with slight strokes impart that subtle beauty which affects the heart there are who publicly profess they hate translations and yet all they write translate so proud they scorn to drive a lawful trade yet by their wants are shameless pirates made these you incense while you their thefts reveal or else

that all approach her with respect and can i offer violence where love does join in her defense this guard might all her fears disperse did she with savages converse then my celia would surprise with what is produced by her own eyes those matchless flames which they inspir in her own breast should raise a fire for love but with more subtle art as well as beauty charms the heart to a lady asking him how long he would love her by the same it is not celia in our power to say how long our love will last it may be we within this hour may lose those joys we now do taste the blessed that immortal be from change in love are only free then since we mortal lovers are ask not how long our love will last but while it does let us take care each minute be with pleasure past were it not madness to deny to live because we are sure to die to the memory of mr dryden i am sorry that i cannot trace out the author of this excellent poem n  if generous gratitude could ever excuse the sallies of a longneglected muse mine pleads that cause alone and so should be from censure or malicious pity free for all the pleasures she from dryden knew she pays this tribute and she thinks it due still had she slept unmoved by all beside no rhymes attempted and no numbers tried if to another man he could impart his real nature and his wondrous art both did he temper right and raise from thence unrivaled numbers and unequal sense most that remain for so to me they seem are but the shadows and the ghosts of him some few it is confessed have gained their cause and justified their merit by applause it is true their diction s good their style is clear and art and labor through the whole appear but let us search them well where shall we find his force of thought his energy of mind the words that move us with mysterious charms the soul that actuates and the fire that warms a ghost sometimes appears to mortal view and bears the shape of humankind but not the substance too words are like colors in two artists hands of different skill where each the best commands one paints and pleases but the pleasure lies not in the mind but only in the eyes the colors justly mixed delude the sight and gaily shining give a false delight for far from thence is honest nature chased ashamed to see herself so much disgraced not so the other whose superior art to lifeless colors can a living soul impart bold are his strokes but managed still with care for nature always claims the better share colors proportion distance are combined to please the sight and strength to charm the mind yet not the best a full perfection gained but in one province still the painter reigned water and land a different master own and history is always found alone peculiar hands give trees and flowers the best the mimic drolls below distinguished from the rest our wondrous bard whose comprehending soul could reach all nature and describe her whole to single beauties scorned to be confined but showed the vigor of extensive mind in all the nice proportions we behold like angelo correct like titian bold if homely cots or humble shepherds ways employed his muse how calmly did they please and sink our passions to a rural ease or when he sung the excesses of the great high palaces the trifling pomp of state the ungoverned soul her reason laid aside took the fond hint and was debased to pride landscape in all its various face he showed here winding rivers through the meadows flowed and there the fruitful trees complained the unequal load here mountains rise aloft and dare the sky there dreary caves the face of nature fly here night a pleasing horror does display and with its gloomy charms excels the day there the bright morn expands its radiant wings and gives new vigor with the light it brings his universal muse with equal ease could paint or dismal storms or calmest seas the miseries of war and joys of peace but what nor paint can tell nor pencil reach his larger genius could divinely teach describe the inner passions of the man and show the steps from whence they first began love he described though different are its ways how the first fluttering pain disturbs our days and gives our nights but half their usual ease then our kind thoughts improve the passion higher it is restless rage it is covetous desire and love unbounded and impetuous fire till at the last with ecstasy we find extremest pleasures in one moment joined and joys immense which leave all other joys behind o anthony how nobly do thou charm o cleopatra how do thou disarm the roughest spirits and the coldest warm

loose to rage and manly rage succeeds his satire free impartial and severe at once gave pleasure and created fear who would not read what he so justly writ but who would be the subject of his wit could but our modern satirists have known his way of satire they d despise their own soon would they see the sharpest muse disclaims illmannerd language and opprobrious names that sordid railing is the poor retreat of angry malice or unmanly wit he shows what we from him alone can feel satire may bite and yet may be genteel audacious fancy fain would hurry on and tread those paths which reason ought to shun for homer and the mantuan are in view a dangerous chase nor must my muse pursue over steepy hills tremendous to the sight their fiery coursers kept an equal flight his close pursued nor feared the dismal height my humble muse looks upward with despair admires their strength but wonders how they dare attempt the regions of the upper air suffice it her to say he never failed wherever his adventurous muse assailed and all attempting he in all prevailed what more had he to do his conquering lays were above censure and commanded praise secure of fame he laid the laurel down enough

deep nor yet too fearfully creeps near the land and runs the danger of the rocks and sand who to that happy medium can attain  who neither seeks for nor despises gain  who neither sinks too low nor aims too high he shuns the unwholesome ills of poverty and is secure from envy which attends a sumptuous table and a crowd of friends their treacherous height does the tall pines expose to the rude blast of every wind that blows and lofty towers unfortunately high are near their ruin as they re near the sky and when they fall what was their pride before serves only then to increase their fall the more who wisely governs and directs his mind never despairs though fortune be unkind he hopes and though he finds he hoped in vain he bears it patiently and hopes again and if at last a kinder fate conspires to heap upon him more than he desires he then suspects the kindness he enjoys takes it with thanks but with such care employs as if that fate weary of giving more would once resume what

unerring rule decreed that this shall that alternately succeed therefore when fates unkind dear friend be wise and bear its ills without the least surprise the more you are oppressed bear up the more weather the tempest till its rage be over but if too prosperous and too strong a gale should rather ruffle than just fill your sail lessen it and let it take but so much wind as is proportioned to the

please some man of sense breaks jests at his deluded friends expense as jilts who by a quick compendious way to gain new lovers do the old betray there is another failing of the mind equal to this of a quite different kind i mean that rude uncultivated skill which some have got of using all men ill out of a zealous and unhewn pretense of freedom and a virtuous innocence who cause they cannot fawn betray nor cheat think they may push and justle all they meet and blame whatever they see complain and brawl and think their virtues make amends for all they neither comb their head nor wash their face but think their virtuous nastiness a grace whenas true virtue in a medium lies and that to turn to either hand s a vice others there are who too obsequious grown live more for others pleasure than their own applauding whatsoever they hear or see by a too nauseous civility and if a man of title or estate does some strange story true or false relate obsequiously they cringe and vouch it all repeat his words and catch them as they fall as schoolboys follow what the masters say or like an actor prompted in a play some men there are so full of their own sense they take the least dispute for an offense and if some wiser friend their heat restrains and says the subject is not worth their pains straight they reply what i have said is true and i will defend it against him and you and if he still dares say it is not i will die rather than not maintain he says a lie now would you see from whence these heats arise and where the important contradiction lies it is but to know if when a client s pressed sawyer sir robert sawyer attorney general from      to      he was the manager for james the second in depriving the city of london of its charter burnet represents him as a dull hot

court burne says he was a corrupt and vicious man who had no principles but followed his own interests at the latter part of king jamess reign he veered toward the court was appointed solicitor general and had the management of the famous trial of the seven bishops wholly given to him after this period he sunk into obscurity and we hear no more of him r pleads his cause the best or if to windsor he most minutes gains who goes by colebrook or who goes by stains who spends his wealth in pleasure and at play and yet affects to be wellcloathd and gay and comes to want and yet dreads nothing more than to be thought necessitous and poor him his rich kinsman is afraid to see shuns like a burden to the family and rails at vices which have made him poor though he himself perhaps has many more or tells him wisely cousin have a care and your expenses with your rents compare since you inherit but a small estate your pleasures cousin must be moderate i know you think to huff and live like me cousin my wealth supports my vanity but they who ve wit and not estate enough must cut their coat according to their stuff therefore forbear to affect equality forget you ve such a foolish friend as me there was a courtier who to punish those whom though below him he believed his foes and more effectually to vent his rage sent them fine clothes and a new equipage for then the foolish sparks courageous grown set up for roaring bullies of the town must go to plays and in the boxes sit then to a whore and live like men of wit till at the last their coach and horses spent their clothes grown dirty and their ribbons rent their fortune changed their appetite the same and it is too late their follies to reclaim they must turn porters or in taverns wait and buy their pleasures at a cheaper rate and midst their dirty mistresses and wives lead out the rest of their mistaken lives never be too inquisitive to find the hidden secrets of anothers mind for when you ve torn one secret from his breast you run great risque of losing all the rest and if he should unimportund impart his secret thoughts and trust you with his heart let not your drinking anger pride or lust ever invite you to betray the trust first never praise your own designs and then never lessen the designs of other men nor when a friend invites you any where to set a partridge or to chase a hare beg he would excuse you for this once and say you must go home and study all the day so twas that once amphion jealous grown that zethus loved no pleasures but his own was forced to give his brothers friendship over or to resolve to touch his lyre no more he chose the safest and the wisest way and to oblige his brother left his play do you the same and for the selfsame end obey your civil importuning friend and when he leads his dogs into the plain quit your untimely labors of the brain and leave your serious studies that you may sup with an equal pleasure on the prey hunting s an old and honorable sport loved in the country and esteemed at court healthful to the body pleasing to the eye and practiced by our old nobility who see you love the pleasures they admire will equally approve what you desire such condescension will more friendship gain than the best rules which your wise books contain talk not of others lives or have a care of whom you talk to whom and what and where for you dont only wound the man you blame but all mankind who will expect the same shun all inquisitive and curious men for what they hear they will relate again and he who has impatient craving ears has a loose tongue to utter all he hears and words like the moving air of which they re framed when once let loose can never be reclaimed where you ve access to a rich powerful man govern your mind with all the care you can and be not by your foolish lust betrayed to court his cousin or debauch his maid lest with a little portion and the pride of being to the family allied he gives you either with which bounty blessed you must quit all pretensions to the rest or lest incensed at your attempt and grieved you should abuse the kindness you received he coldly thwarts your impotent desire till you at last choose rather to retire than tempt his anger any more and so lose a great patron and a mistress too next have a care what men you recommend to the service or esteem of your rich friend lest for his service or esteem unfit they load you with the faults which they commit but as the wisest men with all their skill may be deceived and place their friendship ill so when you see you ve erred you must refuse to defend those whom their own crimes accuse but if through envy of malicious men they be accused you must protect them then and plead their cause yourself for when you see him you commend attacked with infamy know that it is you they hate when him they blame him they have wounded but at you they aim and when your neighbors house is set on fire you must his safety as your own conspire such hidden fires though in the suburbs cast neglected may consume the town at last they who dont know the dangers which attend the glittering court of a rich powerful friend love no estate so much and think they re blessed when they make but a leg amongst the rest but they who ve tried it and with prudent care do all its honors and its ills compare ear to engage lest with their time and pain they lose more pleasure than they hoped to gain see you that while your vessel s under sail you make your best advantage of the gale lest the wind changes and some stormy rain should throw you back to your first port again you must endeavor to dispose your mind to please all humors of a different kind whose temper s serious and their humor sad they think all blithe and merry men are mad they who are merry and whose humor s free abhor a sad and serious gravity they who are slow and heavy cannot admit the friendship of a quick and ready wit the slothful hate the busy active men and are detested by the same again they whose free humor prompts them to be gay to drink all night and revel all the day abhor the man that can his cups refuse though his untimely virtue to excuse he swears that one such merry drinking feast would make him sick for a whole week at least suffer no cloud to dwell upon your brow the modest men are thought obscure and low and they who an affected silence keep are thought to be too rigid sour and deep amongst all other things do not omit to search the writings of great men of wit and in the conversation of the wise in what true happiness and pleasure lies which are the safest rules to live at ease and the best way to make all fortunes please lest through the craving hopes of gaining more and fear of losing what you gained before your poor unsatisfied misguided mind to needy wishes and false joys confined puts its free boundless searching thoughts in chains and where it sought its pleasure finds its pains if virtuous thoughts and if a prudent heart be given by nature or obtained by art what lessens care the minds uneasy pain and reconciles us to ourselves again which does the truest happiness create unblemished honor or a great estate or a safe private quiet which betrays itself to ease and cheats away the days when i m at  where my kind fate has placed my little moderate estate where natures care has equally employed its inward treasures and its outward pride what thoughts d ye think those easy joys inspire what do you think i covet and desire it is that i may but undisturbed possess the little i have and if heaven pleases less that i to nature and myself may give the little time that i have left to live some books in which i some new thoughts may find to entertain and to refresh my mind some horses which may help me to partake the lawful pleasures which the seasons make an easy plenty which at least may spare the frugal pains of a domestic care a friend if that a faithful friend there be

at trinity college dublin and then at st johns cambridge he entered early into the service of charles i and was shot at the battle of newbury sept  0      the character of lord falkland by the earl of clarendon is the completest if not the finest of any in his admirable history he is represented as an assemblage of almost every virtue and excellency that can dignify or adorn a man this encomium is doubtless somewhat exaggerated but there seems to be much truth in it with respect to the private part of his life as it appears to have been taken from near and repeated views a great man in public rather appears to be what it is his interest or inclination to be thought than what he is the earl of clarendon who knew lord falkland in private life seems therefore to have given us a juster portrait of him than if he had seen him only in his public character it must be acknowledged that he has drawn him to great advantage but we are not to impute this to the least disregard to truth but to the amiable lights in which his friendship had placed him a friend who draws the portrait of another friend is apt to bestow as much heightening upon it as a painter would in finishing the picture of his mistress this extract from mr granger is given without the most distant inclination of throwing a shade on a virtue the brightest and purest that has done honor to these later ages see bp hurds excellent dialogues vol i p     before he was twentythree years of age he had read over all the greek and latin fathers and was indefatigable in collecting books of value he has given specimens of his own abilities as a poet a politician and a polemic writer but his discourse of the infallibility of the church of rome which is written in an easy and familiar style without the least affectation of learning is the most considerable of his works it is remarked by doctor swift that in some of lord falklands writings when he doubted whether a word was perfectly intelligible or no he used to consult one of his ladys chambermaids not the waiting woman because it was possible she might be conversant in romances and by her judgment was guided whether to receive or reject it n  on the death of ben

praised and praisedeserving book and could the world of that choice treasure boast it need not care though all the rest were lost and such his wit he writ past what he quotes and his productions far exceed his notes so in his works where aught inserted grows the noblest of the plants ingrafted shows that his adopted children equal not the generous issue his own brain begot so great his art that much which he did write gave the wise wonder and the crowd delight each sort as well as sex admired his wit the he is and she is the boxes and the pit and who less liked within did rather choose to tax their judgments than suspect his muse how no spectato his chaste stage could call the cause of any crime of his but all with thoughts and wills purged and amended rise from the ethic lectures of his comedies where the spectators act and the shamed age blusheth to meet her follies on the stage where each man finds some light he never sought and leaves behind some vanity he brought whose politics no less the minds direct than these the manners nor with less effect when his majestic tragedies relate all the disorders of a tottering state all the distempers which on kingdoms fall when ease and wealth and vice are general and yet the minds against all fear assure and telling the disease prescribe the cure where as he tells what subtle ways what friends seeking their wicked and their wished for ends ambitious and luxurious persons prove whom vast desires or mighty wants do move the general frame to sap and undermine in proud sejanus and bold catiline so in his vigilant prince and consuls parts he shows the wiser and the nobler arts by which a state may be unhurt upheld and all those works destroyed which hell would build who not like those who with small praise had writ had

have or hope to gain and in so large a store that to his ashes they can pay no more except those few who censuring thought not so but aimed at glory from so great a foe how the wise too did with mere

far as the fame of poetry and ben  to the memory of ben jonson by lord buckhurst richard lord buckhurst a nobleman unnoticed in the catalogue of royal and noble authors obtained the title of earl of dorset in      on the death of edward his father who is mentioned by mr walpole with respect vol ii p    he died in august      and was succeeded in the title by charles the celebrated poet n  if romulus did promise in the fight to jove the stator if he held from flight his man a temple and performed his vow why should not we learned jonson thee allow an altar at the least since by thy aid learning that would have left us has been stayed the actions were different that thing required some mark to keept from perishing but letters must be quite defaced before thy memory whose care did them restore on ben jonson by mr henry king son of dr john king bishop of london from      to      henry was born in january      educated partly at them and partly at westminster elected student of christ church in   0  he was made chaplain to james i archdeacon of colchester residentiary of st pauls and canon of christ church dd in      chaplain to charles i dean of rochester in      and in      when episcopacy was sinking was advanced to the bishopric of chester it being conceived says jacob the most effectual method for the restitution of that order to prefer persons not only of unblamable lives and eminent for their learning but also such a were generally beloved by all disinterested people the kings choice amongst these was very happy in this great divine who lived a most religious life and did not die till after his order was restored his death happened october        after having published a new metrical translation of the psalms        mo poems elegies paradoxes sonnets       vo diverse latin and greek poems some sermons and religious treatises n  i see that wreath which does the wearer arm against the quick strokes of thunder is no charm to keep off deaths pale dart for jonson then thou had been numbered still with living men times scythe had feared thy laurel to invade nor thee this subject of our sorrow made amongst those many votaries that come to offer up their garlands at thy tomb whilst some more lofty pens in their bright verse like glorious tapers flaming on thy hearse shall light the dull and thankless world to see how great a maim it suffers wanting thee let not thy learned shadow scorn that i pay meaner rites unto thy memory and since i naught can add but in desire restore some sparks which leapt from thine own fire what ends soever other quills invite i can protest it was no itch to write nor any vain ambition to be read but merely love and justice to the dead which raised my fameless muse and caused her bring these drops as tribute thrown into that spring to whose most rich and fruitful head we owe the purest streams of language which can flow for it is but truth thou taughtst the ruder age to speak by grammar and reformdst the stage thy comic sock induced such purged sense a lucrece might have heard without offense amongst these soaring wits that did dilate our english and advance it to the rate and value it now holds thyself was one helped lift it up to such proportion that thus refined and robbed it shall not spare with the full greek or latin to compare for what tongue ever durst but ours translate great tullys eloquence or homers state both which in their unblemished luster shine from a specimen of chapman shall be given hereafter n chapmans pen and from thy catiline all i would ask for thee in recompense of thy successful toil and times expense is only this poor boon that those who can perhaps read french or talk italian or do the lofty spaniard affect to show their skill in foreign dialect prove not themselves so unnaturally wise they therefore should their mother tongue despise as if her poets both for style and wit not equaled or not passed their best that writ until by studying jonson they have known the height and strength and plenty of their own thus in what low earth or neglected room so ever thou sleepst thy book shall be thy tomb thou will go down a happy corse bestrewd with thine own flowers and feel thyself renewed whilst thy immortal neverwithering bays shall yearly flourish in thy readers praise and when more spreading titles are forgot or spite of all their lead and searcloth rot thou wrapped and shrind in thine own sheets wilt lie a relick famed by all posterity to the memory of ben jonson by jasper main born at hatherlagh in donshire   0  elected from westminsterschool to christ church oxford as a servitor in      and in the next year was chosen a student he took the degrees of b and ma and was presented by the college to the livings of cassington and pyrton in oxfordshire in the civil wars he preached before the king at oxford and was made dd but was soon after ejected from his livings by cromwells visitors he found an asylum with the earl of devonshire and at the restoration obtained his livings again was made canon of christ church archdeacon of chichester and chaplain to charles ii he died december        and is called by wood a quaint preacher and a noted poet five only of his sermons are in print and his poems are not numerous he published two plays a poem on the naval victory over the dutch by the duke of york translated some of lucians dialogues      and donnes latin epigrams      which he called a sheaf of miscellany epigrams though very orthodox in his opinions and severe in his manners he was a facetious companion and his propensity to mirth attended him in his last moments for to a servant who had lived long with him he bequeathed a trunk with something in it to make him drink which being opened by the expecting servant he found the legacy to be nothing but a red herring n  as when the vestal hearth went out no fire less holy than the flame that did expire could kindle it again so at thy fall our wit great ben is too apocryphal to celebrate the loss since it is too much to write thy epitaph and not be such what thou were like the hard oracles of old without an ecstasy cannot be told we must be ravished first thou must infuse thyself into us both the theme and muse else though we all conspired to make thy hearse our works so that t had been but one great verse though the priest had translated for that time the liturgy and buried thee in rhyme so that in meter we had heard it said poetic dust is to poetic laid and though that dust being shakespeares thou might have not his room but the poet for thy grave so that as thou did prince of numbers die and live so now thou might in numbers lie t were frail solemnity verses on thee and not like thine would but kind libels be and we not speaking thy whole worth should raise worse blots than they that envied thy praise indeed thou needst us not since above all invention thou were thine own funeral hereafter when time has fed on thy tomb the inscription worn out and the marble dumb so that t would pose a critic to restore half words and words expired so long before when thy maimed statue has a sentenced face and looks that are the horror of the place that t will be learning and antiquity and ask a an honorable testimony to contemporary merit n seldom to say this was thee thou lt have a whole name still nor needst thou fear that will be ruined or lose nose or hair let others write so thin that they cannot be authors till rotten no posterity can add to thy works the had their whole growth then when first born and came aged from thy pen whilst living thou enjoydst the fame and sense of all that time gives but the reverence when thou rt of homers years no man will say thy poems are less worthy but more gray it is bastardpoetry and of the false blood which cannot without succession be good things that will always last do thus agree with things eternal they at once perfect be scorn then their censures who gave t out thy wit as long upon a comedy did sit as elephants bring forth and that thy blots and mendings took more time than fortune see p     plots that such thy drought was and so great thy thirst that all thy plays were drawn at the mermaid see p     first that the kings yearly butt wrote and his wine has more right than thou to thy catiline let such men keep a diet let their wit be racked and while they write suffer a fit when they ve felt tortures which outpain the gout such as with less the state draws treason out though they should the length of consumptions lie sick of their verse and of their poem die twould not be thy worst scene but would at last confirm their boastings and show made in haste he that writes well writes quick since the rule s true nothing is slowly done that is always new so when thy fox had ten times acted been each day was first but that t was cheaper seen and so thy alchymist played over and over was new of the stage when t was not at the door we like the actors did repeat the pit the first time saw the next conceived thy wit which was cast in those forms such rules such arts that but to some not half thy acts were parts since of some silken judgments we may say they filled a box two hours but saw no play so that the unlearned lost their money and scholars saved only that could understand thy scene was free from monsters no hard plot called down a god to unty the unlikely knot the stage was still a stage two entrances were not two parts of the world disjoined by seas thine were land tragedies no prince was found to swim a whole scene out then of the stage drowned pitched fields as the red bull in st johns street was one of the old play houses r  and so the fortune and mermaid p     n red bull wars still felt thy doom thou said no sieges to the musicroom nor would allow to thy best comedies humors that should above the people rise yet was thy language and thy style so high thy sock to the ancle buskin reached to the thigh and both so chaste so bove dramatic clean that we both safely saw and lived thy scene no foul loose line did prostitute thy wit thou wrotst thy comedies did not commit we did the vice arraigned not tempting hear and were made judges not bad parts by the ear for thou even sin did in such words array that some who came bad parts went out good play which ended not with the epilogue the age still acted which grew innocent from the stage it is true thou had some sharpness but thy salt served but with pleasure to reform the fault men were laughed into virtue and none more hated face a finished character in the alchymist n acted than were such before so did thy sting not blood but humors draw so much does satire more correct than law which was not nature in thee as some call thy teeth who say thy wit lay in thy gall that thou did quarrel first and then in spite did against a person of such vices write that twas revenge not truth that on the stage carlo was not presented but thy rage and that when thou in company were met thy meat took notes and thy discourse was net we know thy free vein had this innocence to spare the party and to brand the offense and the just indignation thou were in did not expose shift but his tricks and ginn thou might have used the old comic freedom these might have seen themselves played like socrates like cleon mammon might the knight have been if as greek authors thou had turned greek spleen and had not chosen rather to translate their learning into english not their rate indeed this last if thou had been bereft of thy humanity might be called theft the other was not whatsoever was strange or borrowed in thee did grow thine by the change who without latin helps had been as rare as beaumont fletcher or as shakspeare were and like them from thy native stock could say poets and kings are not born every day description of fortune by michael drayton the reputation of drayton in the reigns of elizabeth and james i stood on much the same level with that of cowley in the reigns of charles i and ii but it has declined considerably since that period he frequently wants that elevation of thought which is essential to poetry though in some of the stanzas of his barons wars he is scarce inferior to spenser in his englands heroical epistles written in the manner of ovid he has been in general happier in the choice than the execution of his subjects yet some of his imitations are more in the spirit of a poet than several of the english translations of him his nymphidia or court of fayrie seems to have been the greatest effort of his imagination and is the most generally admired of his works his character among his friends was that of a modest and amiable man granger  drayton who on his monument in westminster abbey is styled a memorable poet of his age was born at atherston in warwickshire in      and is said on his epitaph to have exchanged his laurel for a crown of glory      his nymphidia shall be printed in a future volume n  esquire fortune as

as it was unmerited he who was admired and beloved by all the best writers of his time who was esteemed and highly recommended by the critical jonson and the learned seldom was in a few years after his death almost forgotten to the o small credit of mr t davies his writings were for the first time completely collected in      in three neat volumes of a size which makes them a proper companion for the english poets and consequently renders it unnecessary to print here any more than a specimen of his poetry but a few particulars of his life shall be given in the words of mr davies william brown descended of a good family was born at tavistock in devonshire in the year    0 his father according to prince in his worthies of devon being probably of the knightly family of brown of brownesilash in the parish of langtree near greattorrington after he had passed through the grammar school he was sent to exeter college in the university of oxford about the beginning of the reign of king james the first where he became a great proficient in classical learning and in the belles lettres was scarcely equalled from hence however before he had taken any academical degree he removed to the inner temple london where he more particularly devoted himself to the muses in the beginning of the year      he returned again to exeter college and became tutor to robert dormer who was afterward earl of carnarvon and who lost his life at newbury fight on the  0th of september      on the   th of march      our author received permission to be actually created a master of arts although the degree was not conferred upon him till the november following he is styled in the public register of the university a man well skilled in all kinds of polite literature and useful arts vir omni humana literatura et bonarum artium cognitione instructus after he had left college with his pupil he was gladly received into the family of william earl of pembroke who had a great respect for him and here according to the author of the athenae oxonienses he made his fortune so well that he purchased an estate he also adds that he had a great mind in a little body but with regard to the time of his death he is very doubtful for all that he says of the matter is that in his searches he finds that one william brown of ottery st mary in devonshire died in the year      but that he cannot tell whether he was the same with our poet to this account i shall only add that mr warburton the herald appears to have been possessed of some ms poems by this author which were sold with the rest of his library about the year      or    0 i cannot but wish that mr davies had met with sufficient encouragement to have proceeded with the work he announced at the conclusion of his preface under the title of englands helicon he published however in the same size the whole works of suckling in    0 the poems of marvel and carew in      and those of sir john davies in      a small portion therefore of each of these writers will be sufficient for this collection n  on a hill that graced the plain thyrsis sat a comely swain comelier swain never graced a hill whilst his flock that

inner temple in may   0  he soon commenced writer and published a considerable number of valuable works which it is needless here to enumerate in      he published notes and illustrations on the first eighteen songs in his worthy friend michael draytons polyolbion and the year after wrote verses in greek latin and english upon brownes britannias pastorals which with diverse poems prefixed to the works of other authors occasioned sir john suckling to give him a place in his session of the poets mr seldom when not above three and thirty years of age had shown himself a great philologist antquary herald and linguist and his name was so wonderfully advanced not only at home but in foreign countries that he was actually then what he was afterward usually styled the great dictator of learning to the english nation in      when he was in his thirtyfourth year he published his history of tithes which alarming the clergy and offending king james i it was suppressed and the author forced to make public submission he again offended that monarch in      by an opinion he gave against the crown as counsel in the house of lords and was committed into the custody of the sheriff of london but was released in five weeks by the favor of the lord keeper williams he was chosen member for lancaster that year but neglected all public business to apply himself to study in      he was appointed by the inner temple reader at lyons inn but refused to accept that office in      he was chosen burgess for great bedwin wiltshire and again in      when he was an active manager against the duke of buckingham in      he was counsel for mr hampden and in the third parliament of king james was again elected for lancaster and had a considerable hand in the petition of rights after the prorogation in june retiring to wrest in bedfordshire he finished his commentaries on the arundelian marbles in the next session he warmly opposed the court and was committed to the tower and had his sdy sealed up march         he was closely confined three months but magnificently supported at the kings expense and being afterward allowed the use of such books as he desired he proceeded in his studies in hilary term      declining to give security for his good behavior as unwarrantable by law he was committed to the kings benh prison he was released the latter end of the year though it does not appear how only that the parliament in      ordered him l 000 for the losses he had sustained on that occasion in    0 he was again committed to custody with the earls of bedford and clare sir robert cotton and mr st john being accused of having dispersed a libel entitled a proposition for his majestys service to bridle the impertinency of parliaments but it was proved that sir robert dudley their living in the duke of tuscanys dominions was the author all these various imprisonments and tumults gave no interruption to his studies but he proceeded in his old way to write and publish books in    0 he was chosen member of parliament for the university of oxford and though he was against the court yet in      the king had thoughts of taking the seal from the lord keeper littleton and giving it to him in      he was appointed one of the laymembers to sit in the assembly of divines at westminster in which he frequently perplexed those divines with his vast learning

november that year at the friary house in whitefriars where he had resided for some years being possessed of it in the right of elizabeth countes dowager of kent who had appointed him executor of her will having before from the first of her widowhood committed the management of her affairs to him he was buried in the temple church where a monument was erected to him he left a most valuable and curious library to his executors which they generously would have bestowed on the society of the inner temple if a proper place had been provided to receive it but this being neglected they gave it to

bathurst in the early part of his life applied himself to the study of divinity in which he made a very considerable progress but when he saw that some churches were defaced or demolished and others converted into barracks and stables and that a learned ministry was held in the utmost contempt he changed the course of his studies and applied himself to physic he took a doctors degree in that faculty in which he rose to such eminence that he was in the time of the usurpation appointed physician to the state upon the restoration he quitted his profession of physic was elected a fellw of the royal society and president of his college and having entered into holy orders he was made chaplain to the king and installed dean of wells june       0 his learning and talents were various he was the orator and the poet the philosopher and the divine he possessed an inexhaustible fund of writ and was the facetious companion at eighty years of age ridicule was the weapon that he made use of to correct the deliquents of his college and he was so absolute a master of it that he had it always at hand his poetical pieces in the musae anglicanae are excellent in their kind they are much in the

the world his heir verses by george chapman this writer who obtained much applause in his time and was greatly praised by his contemporaries was born at hitchinghill in the county of hertford some time in the year      after being well grounded in schoollearning he was sent to the university but whether to oxford or cambridge was unknown to anthony wood who declares himself certain he resided some time at the former where he was observed to be most excellent in the latin and greek tongues but not in logic or philosophy which may be presumed to be the reason he took no degree there he appears to have been a man of a very respectable character being countenanced and patronized by several eminent persons particularly sir thomas walsyngham and his son and by prince henry son of james the first wood imagines that he was a sworn servant either to james the first or his queen and says he was highly valued but not so much as ben jonson the same writer adds that he was a person of most reverend aspect religious and temperate qualities rarely meeting in a poet after living to the age of    years he died on the   th day of may      in the parish of st giles in the fields and was buried on the south side of the churchyard there his friend inigo jones erected a monument to his memory near the place of his interment his translation of homer acquired him a considerable degree of reputation mr dryden tells us that waller used to say he never could read it without incredible transport it is much censured by mr pope who notwithstanding acknowledges that there is a daring fiery spirit which animates it something like what one might imagine homer himself would have writ before he arrived at years of discretion he translated also the batrachomyomachia and all the hymns of homer to which he annexed the verses here printed finished marlows translation of musaeus produced several original poems and some other translations was the author of seventeen dramatick performances and assisted shirley in two others for this note i am indebted to the new edition of dodsleys old plays vol iv p     where the reader will find some other curious particulars of chapman and an exact

his poem on the imortality of the soul and being answered that he was he graciously embraced him and assured him of his favor the king presently after promoted him to the office of solicitor and then attorney general in ireland where in   0  he was made sergeant at law and afterward speaker of the house of commons in that kingdom the year following he received the order of knighthood from the king

published reports and other books relating to the constitution and laws of this kingdom anthony wood says there were several of his manuscripts on various subjects which were formerly in the library of sir james ware and since that in the possession of edward earl of clarendon besides these which were chiefly of the political kind the same author says there were also some epigrams written by sir john and a metaphrase of several of king davids psalms but never published the poem on the soul which he called nosce teipsum was first published in      and afterward in      with hymns to astrea in acrostic verse and orchestra a poem expressing the antiquity and excellence of dancing in a dialogue between penelope and one of her wooers containing one hundred and thirtyone stanzas unfinished see the life prefixed by mr davies to the complete edition of his poems      n  o ignorant poor man what do thou bear locked up within the casket of thy breast what jewels and what riches have thou there what heavenly treasure in so weak a chest look in thy soul and thou shall beauties find like those which drowned narcissus in the flood honor and pleasure both are in thy mind and all that in the world is counted good think of her worth and think that god did mean this worthy mind should worthy things embrace blot not her beauties with thy thoughts unclean nor her dishonor with thy passion base kill not her quickening power with surfeitings mar not her sense with sensuality cast not her wit on idle things make not her free will slave to vanity and when thou think of her eternity think not that death against her nature is think it a birth and when thou go to die sing like a swan as if thou went to bliss and if thou like a child did fear before being in the dark where thou did nothing see now i have brought thee torchlight fear no more now when thou dyst thou can not hoodwinked be and thou my soul which turnst with curious eye to view the beams of thine own form divine know that thou can know nothing perfectly while thou art clouded with this flesh of mine take heed of overweening and compare thy peacocks feet with thy gay peacocks train study the best and highest things that are but of thyself an humble thought retain cast down thyself and only strive to raise the glory of thy makers sacred name use all thy powers that blessed power to praise which gives thee power to be and use the same detraction execrated by sir john suckling a poet of great vivacity and some elegance and one of the finest gentlemen of his time he was son to sir john suckling comptroller of the household to king charles the first and was born at witham in essex in      he spoke latin at five years of age and wrote it when nine he had a general knowledge of polite literature but applied himself more particularly to music and poetry in the course of his foreign travels he made a campaign under gustavus adolphus and at his return raised a splendid troop of horse at the expense of twelve thousand pounds for the service of the king this troop with sir john at its head behaved so ill in the engagement with the scots upon the english borders in      as to occasion the famous lampoon by sir john mennis sir john he got him an ambling nag etc which was set to an irish tune and much sung by the parliamentarians this disastrous expedtion and the ridicule that attended it was supposed to have hastened his death which happened in      at the age of twentyeight his prose writings particularly his discourse of religion addressed to lord dorset are thought equal to the best of his poetical performances his ballad on a wedding and his session of the poets are oftener remembered than any of his works this ballad was occasioned by the marriage of roger boil the first earl of orrery with lady margaret howard daughter of the earl of suffolk there was a great intimacy betwixt sir john and the earl of orrery then lord broghill in his session of the poets he has given us some traits of the characters of his poetical brethren this article is principally compiled from jacob and granger the whole of sir john sucklings works containing his poems letters and plays were published several times by mr tonson and in two neat volumes by mr davies    0 n  thou vermin slander bred in abject minds of thoughts impure by vile tongues animate canker of conversation could thou find naught but our love whereon to show thy hate thou never were when we two were alone what can thou witness then thy base dull aid was useless in our conversation where each meant more than could by each be said whence had thou thy intelligence from earth that part of us never knew that we did love or from the air our gentle sighs had birth from such sweet raptures as to joy did move our thoughts as pure as the chaste mornings breath when from the nights cold arms it ceeps away were clothed in words and maidens blush that has more purity more innocence than they nor from the water could thou have this tale no briny tear has furrowed her smooth cheek and i was pleased i pray what should he ail that had her love for what else could he seek we shortened days to moments by loves art whilst our two souls in amorous ecstasy perceived no passing time as if a part our love had been of still eternity much less could have it from the purer fire our heat exhales no vapor from coarse sense such as are hopes or fears or fond desire our mutual love itself did recompense thou have no correspondence had in heaven and the elemental world thou see is free whence had thou then this talking monster even from hell a harbor fit for it and thee cursed be the officious tongue that did address thee to her ears to ruin my content may it one minute taste such happiness deserving lose unpitied it lament i must forbear the sight and so repay in grief those hours joy shortened to a dram each minute i will lengthen to a day and in one year outlive methusalem song by thomas carew thomas carew a poet of real elegance was a younger son of the family of the carews in devonshire he was born in      and after receiving some part of his education at corpus christi college oxford he spent many years in france and italy returning from travel he followed the court which says lord clarendon the modesty of that time disposed men to do some time before they pretended to be of it and he was very much esteemed by the most eminent persons in the court and well looked upon by the king himself some years before he could obtain to be sewer to the king and when the king conferred that place upon him it was not without the regret even of the whole scotch nation which united themselves in recommending another gentleman to it and of so great value were those relations held in that age when majesty was beheld with the reverence it ought to be wood the celebrated oxford biographer says that he was adored by the poets of his time which seems to be true as we well know that his admirers were the first men of the age that montague the lord abbot of pontois caressed him that done d avenant and may loved him suckling too admired him and yet in his session of the poets says  tom carew came next but he had a fault  that would not well stand with a laureat  his muse was hidebound and the issue of s brain  was seldom brought forth but with trouble and pain suckling knew otherwise but we must remember that the poet when he wrote this was writing a satire the elegance of his lovesonnets made them familiar to his majesty and his nobles they were sought after read and rehearsed and by his majestys command were set to music or as wood expresses it wedded to the charming notes of mr henry laws who was gentleman of the kings chapel and at that time the greatest musical composer in england lord clarendon says carew was a person of a pleasant and facetious wit and made many poems especially in the amorous way which for the sharpness of the fancy and the elegance of the language in which that fancy was spread were at least equal if not superior to any of that time but his glory was that after fifty years of his life had been spent with less severity or exactness than it ought to have been he died with the greatest remorse for that license and with the greatest manifestation of christianity that his best friends could desire he died in the year      i have already mentioned that his poems were published in      by mr davies n  esquire ask me no more where jove bestows when june is past the fading rose for in your beautys orient deep these flowers as in their causes sleep ask me no more whither do stray the golden atoms of the day for in pure love heaven did prepare those powders to enrich your hair ask me no more whither does haste the nightingale when may is past for in your sweet dividing throat she winters and keeps warm her note ask me no more where those stars light that downwards fall in dead of night for in your eyes they sit and there fixed become as in their sphere ask me no more if east or west the phoenix builds her spicy nest for unto you at last she flies and in your fragrant bosom dies the primrose by the same ask me why i send you here this firstling of the infant year ask me why i send to you this primrose all bepearld with dew i strait will whisper in your ears the sweets of love are washed with tears ask me
