particularly mentioned several cuirous and valuable pieces of plate and other rich furniture not usually exposed to public view a particular description of which would be too redious to be here inserted  however for the further information and amusement of our little readers we shall close this chapter with a poetical account of the bold and unparalleled attempt of a desperate villain with others of his associates to strip the jeweloffice of the royal crown globe scepter etc with the happy prevention of their wicked design in which had they succeeded the loss could never have been repaired  the wolf in sheeps clothing or the villain triumphant now my young readers lend an ear and you a matchless tale shall hear how one in a canonick gown pilferd away old englands crown and how which aggrandizd the matter the globe and sceeptre sollowed after but watchful providence decreed to bring to light so dark a deed in gay king charles the seconds days so readers my historian says one blood blood was the son of a blacksmith in ireland a fellow that thought small villainies below him  he once rescued a comrade of his out of the hands of the sheriffs officers as they were leading him to the gallows  at another time be laid a design in ireland to surprise the castle of dublin etc and to usurp the government but being discovered by the duke of ormond he vowed revenge  accodingly one night he with some of his associates went boldly up to the coach took him out of it and tied him fust behind one of his comrades who role away with him but the duke throwing him off his horse and procuring assistance got released  blood losing his repulation among his fellow rogues through this miscarriage resolved to make amends by a more daring villainy that of stealing the regalia  one parrot parrot was a silkdyer in southwark and in the rebellion had been majorgeneral harrisons lieutenant  and another the other was named hunt a son in law of bloods and trained up under him  notorious rogue their friend and brother laid a bold scheme in one half hour to seize the treasures of the tower the better to secure success blood strait put on a parsons dress and took his wife an artful jade well yersd in the mercurialtrade the art of thieving  to see the jewels in the tower and stayed at least full half an hour madam bloods wife at length sunk gently down into an artificial swoon blood saintlike lifted up his eyes and feigned a husbands fond surprise one edwards the jewelkeeper wife who there kept the house with great indulgence treats his spouse calls for assistance holds her head and leads her gently up to bed with eyes half closed the imposton fell slunberd an hour and all was well the parson at departure said how shall this goodness be repaid hence a firm friendship was professed and gifts his gratitude expressed in short  to ripen the design of this archvillain sham divine he made an offer quickly after to wed his one who he pretended had three hundred a year in land which was at his disposal nephew with her daughter  her husband liked the proposition writings were drawn with expedition fixed in an instant was the day the memorable ninth of may on which the bold attempt was made the crown was stolen the villains fled and he was keeper of the jeweloffice edwards left at home for dead treason and murder soon was cried the crown beneath bloods gown was spyd and parrot being before suspected was with the globe concealed detected thus the regalia were recovered and thousands round the villains hovered  both were in irons quickly laid and to the tower white tower conveyed soon they were summoned to whitehall where to the king blood owned it all fearless he added to it a lie told him of a conspiracy if he or parrot once should dye of men who would in ambush lay and take his precious life away but if they met with his compassion they would prove of service to the nation the king sore frightened at that time not only pardoned the bold crime but what is monstrous to declare gave blood five hundred pounds a year chap v of the line batteries etc the line is a narrow neat paved way just within the battlements of the wall which surrounds the tower upon this line which is about half a mile in compass are four batteries which by means thereof have an easy communication one with another  the first entrance upon the line is just beyond traitors bridge where is a clean paved walk about seventy yards long called the ladies walk because it is much frequented by the fair sex in summer evenings on the left hand is a pleasant row of shady trees extending from the one end to the other and on the right the wall which encompasseth the tower over which is a delightful prospect of the river thames with the ships boats and c passing up and down as also of the wharf belonging to the tower on which are planted sixty one large iron cannon  at the farther end of the ladies walk you descend the steps and going on a little way you ascend the line again where presently you come to the first six gun battery which commands the river to the fouth here stands a sentinel as there does likewise at each of the other batteries  a few yards from this battery at the east end of the tower you come to the second six gun battery which has likewise a devil upon duty command of the river this is called the divils battery the origin of which story is as follows  of the devils battery hear now young readers how it came to bear that hideous frightful name the tale is merry though it is old then take it as to me twas told as once a sentinel was put to guard this little eastern spot soon as twas dark before his eyes a shocking spectre did arise of bulk enormous full as tall as either giant in guildhall and what still made him look the bolder he bore a cannon on his shoulder the soldier frightened quits his post and looks as pale as any ghost flies to his corporal who was near and tells the groundwork of his fear bless me he cried what shall i do i have seen old satan  faith it is true return for shame the corporal said let us go and shoot old satan dead onwards they march  the corporal spies the devil with his saweer eyes fearles at once don quixote fired down dropped the devil or retired hence let the fact be how it will it is called the devils bettery still from this battery at about two hundred yards distance you come to a spacious strong stone battery where there are eight large iron cannon mounted this battery is at the north corner of the east end of the tower  from thence you pass on to the fourth battery where there are six guns which point toward the north the guns are fired from all these batteries and from those also of the wharf on some particular rejoicing days such as the kings birthday being the  0th of october and his return from abroad and from the wharf alone on all other royal holidays and likewise as often as his majesty goes to the parliament house and on the   th of may  th of november etc  from the last battery we proceed to the royal mint where all the gold silver and copper coins and medals are struch belonging to the management of which there are several officers of whom the warden is chief  i could very willingly give my young readers a particular account of the art of making of money but i am afraid it might tempt some naughty persons to counterfeit the current coin for which i should be justly blamed and become in some measure accessory to the fatal consenquences that might attend it  chap vi of the inside of the white tower i must first inform my young readers that the inside of this grand tower is not publicly shown but as they in proceeding from one place to the other in order to see the rarities pass by it two or three times and will very likely be inquisitive to know what is with inside i shall therefore endeavor to satisfy their curiousity  this tower is a large magazine or vast storehouse filled with prodigious numbers of various kinds of instruments of war the vaults which perhaps are the largest and finest in all the world are filled with bags of salt petre for the making of gunpowder upon the first sloor are several spacious rooms one of which is a small armoury for the sea service for ten thousand men which arms are of various sorts very curious and laid up in beautiful order  in another room are a multitude of fine closets presses and lockers all filled with an almost incredible number of tools for the war service as to gunpowder there is but little kept in this place only so much as will serve for the use of the garrison this tower has three very high stories and upon the top of all fine leads and what is surprising water from the thames is forced by an engine to the top of this lofty tower where it fills a cistern of about seven feet deep nine broad and about sixty feet in length being the biggest that i ever saw or heard of  the walls of this strong tower are at the groundfloor one and twenty feet thick at the second about sixteen feet and at the third about seven feet thick at the south side of this white tower is a room formerly a chapel where are kept the ancient records of this nation  i shall next tell my readers the time and ceremony of opening and shutting the gates of the tower and so conclude this history  chap vii of the ceremony of opening and shutting the gates of the tower at half an hour after nine oclock at night the bell on the top of the governors house rings to warn the inhabitants or others to go out or come into the garrison as their affairs may require at the same time the drum beats over the spur guard at the entrance into the tower to give notice to the soldiers who are absent from duty to come in likewise at ten aclock the tattoo beats go to bed tom from the main guard which is at the west side of the white tower quite round the tower to the place from whence they set out  at eleven oclock which is the hour they lock up the gates both in winter and summer the yeoman porter calls a sergeant and a file fo men to attend the keys to lock up the royal tower who proceed with him to the spur guard or outer gates which being secured they go back to the main guard where the yeoman porter cries god bless the king the guard who are drawn up in order answer amen from thence they go to the governors house where they lodge the keys after which no person upon any account whatsoever can either go out or come into the tower till next morning when the same ceremony is again observed at opening the gates in the summer at half an hour after five and in the winter at seven  about half and hour after nine before they look up the tower one of the warders with a guard of soldiers upon duty locks up the gates upon the wharf and drawing up the drawbridge locks the gate which leads to it and so retires into the tower after which no person can go out or come in  having now shut the gates of the tower i have nothing more to add concerning the curiosities
