the town  a satire  oh that i would had in those blessed times my birth ever coxcomb pies or coxcombs were on earth pope by w kenrick  london printed for r griffiths at the dunciad in ludgate street       price one shilling  the town wise was the clown who when he first descried london the seat of vanity and pride and saw the clouds that over it is turrets spread gravely stood still and shook his cautious head what can this mean the portent is not good see heaven has marked it with a sulfurous cloud some dangers near this warning is not vain then turned him back and traveled home again how happy they who never yet have known the numerous follies of the noisy town where affectation joins to low conceit and fills with coxcombs every crowded street all seek intent for what is new today and noise and nonsense bear them all away at paulins longs behold the glorious trade how the fools swarm to get in masquerade that is done tonight  tomorrow something new again with equal appetite pursue to broughtons see the tender stripling goes to hear the battle and to see the blows some a place of resort among some wits h  s calls where snuffing punsters meet and all the company is plagued with wit so great the virtue of the strong rappee that every pinch creates a repartee strange power in dust be h  s all the gain whose wondrous art can thus affect the brain strait let his shop commence a public school to teach the blockhead and instruct the fool twas here the player took his first degrees who wrote a farce then helped his farce to please here first established was he called a wit and since has charmed the world with what he writ in vain dull songsters a barbarous and favorite song on woman at vaux hall womans praise rehearse his peggy proves the mighty power of verse his vocal shell what shell soever it be speaks a just taste of senseless poetry pleased may the mrs wf  g  n fair review each charming line by her inspired and think herself divine yet oh how mortal on a sudden grown to be the singsong ballad of the town hail mighty g  k chief amidst the throng of leading nonsense and of apish song to thee with joy the herd of fools submit and curse me fellows current coin for wit thy keenest satire bears the silliest phrase and oh how much unworthy of our praise pleasing the character you set to view for fools are ever pleased with what is new the mean infection catches through the street and see a a character too much known and practiced to need explanation fribble every fop we meet so great the miss in her teens favorite work so learned so wise one fool is lashed and thence lo ten arise a fools a resolute and sturdy beast and thy weak hand but tickles him at best how much we owe to such a pen as thine where blockheads with the satyrist combine first taught by thee they boast the strange pretense to satire coxcombs while they murder sense fondly they write each others follies down and quite forget those follies are their own as once a fool beheld his antic face and saw his visage in the magic glass surpised he saw and this construction made a man is wondrous strange with such a head then laughed to view the oddness of the phiz but little thought the monstrous picture his so when a fop against fops a satire reads he smiles whenever he thinks the victim bleeds again the tale insensibly pursues and struck afresh afresh the smile renews see amongst the crowd new endless follies rise whilst all for wit contend a glorious prize each blockhead boasts how just his own pretense and proves how much he wants of common sense the spruce young templar or thaffected cit maintains his title as a firstrate wit prates of the playhouse  i was there today saw the rehearsal of a new writ play bout which the managers in doubt perplexed to bring it out this season or the next of all the coxcombs that infest the age none like the politicians of the stage those dupes to wit who ever boldly say they know as much as others wise as they eternal bablers yet they boast to know more than the managers or actors do name but a play they have seen it over and over and speeches could rehearse if need a score beg but the favor they would one repeat puffed up with vanity and loud conceit with opening lungs for never they refuse to tear the product of a worthy muse they plague your ears then fly the place or stay to see a barbarous murder on a play as soon i would go to smithfields dirty fair and bear the gabbling of a stroling player as soon i would be in jamesstreet hovel seen where lowlivd prentices play tamerlane or at the wells where bawling butchers wait and the fit theme is wretched barnwells fate as would i go where fools like these resort the curse of company the public sport yet say what place is free from folly now where do we lose the fops affected bow where does the dunce attentive silent sit or where the blockhead fear to trust his wit at w  s behold the fools and coxcombs there but fools and coxcombs in a higher sphere there lords and knights fill up the crowded room and rakes polite that from the bagnio come there whisper nonsense apes embroidered clothes make up the sweet society of beaux sense scorned by all the worthless house denies and w  s remains a box of butterflies hold cries a friend that at my elbow sits what meddle with the great you have lost your wits perchance some lord your verses may receive and when they have money lords you know can give besides there is some may boast a good pretense however strange it seem to wit and sense well sir suppose your just assertion true that some great man is near as wise as you if amongst the fools st jamess coffeehouse st jamess constant guest how shall we know to mark him from the rest but think not i would ever so meanly serve show verses to my lord then hope and starve such be the fate of every rhiming fool who learned to pen his wretched lines at school like c  s self wrote odes at twelve to show odes writ at twelve are better odes than now dull asses void of genius or of thought and write so parrots prate as once they are taught d  s to those he had by physic slain so sung to tell em how to rise again finely describes how vide dr d  s poem on the resurrection printed in folio      part  st broken members fly odd legs and arms how bustle in the sky how vast the genius that such thoughts contains so then if true be his prophetic strains d  s perhaps may find his scattered brains to low petitions can the muses stoop see invocations from a bakers shop to stanhopes name the a wretched poem published by subscription by the author on the passions of man dedicated to the earl of chesterfield mighty work addressed but not by stanhopes name it is worth confessed mans dreadful passion was the dreadful verse but the author of it r  ds passion was the greatest curse he called the muse and begged her quick relief in vain he called for oh the muse was deaf then down he sat and racked his brainless head and swore to write and writ without her aid oh could i hope to catch the exalted fires which dropped from heaven the sacred muse inspires glad over the world the noisy world i would fly and taste the various beauties of the sky i would seek the groves and make the dwelling mine where dwell the graces and the tuneful nine there wish to live in one continued day where bright urania sings and heavenly muses play how vain the wish the prospects vanished quite new scenes of folly rush upon my sight what loads of paper destined to the press to bear the dull impressions of an ass who takes the advantage of a senseless age and cheats the reader with a title page of such the an ode inscribed to ralph allen esquire of bath for which it is conjectured the author has robbed some poor bellman of his yearly verses solitary tuneless ode with naught of solitude nor ought of good cease worthless tribe and give your scribbling over if you would gain applause then write no more that maxims taught in all our public schools that silence is the best recourse of fools yet how perverse ye wander from the right as if you would be blockheads out of spite whilst all your study and your utmost care is to be viler asses than ye are yet each one thinks the more a fool he grows the more he has of wit the more he knows thus of all follies that possess the brain the coxcombs greatest curse is to be vain even sacred temples are not sacred now for fops and fools intrude wherever you go though coxcombs ever are too vain to pray they go for company as to the play see clody enter in the velvet pew he comes today because his clothes are new his head he turns his body turns withal or else the buckle of his hair might fall he coughs aloud to tell the ladies by who plagues the church  hem  ladies see  it is i now down he sits still peeping at the fair pulls out a mirror to adjust his hair lays out the dresden settles every pleat each atoms set his lapdogs scarce so neat but on a sudden see the mortal grieve for oh a dreadful spot upon his sleeve pain insupportable too much to bear but thanks to heaven his cordial drops are near but see he goes and leaves each sneering fair forsakes the bishop and the godly prayer even priests themselves just satire cannot pass nor is the bishop free if he is an ass how often the chaplain flies from serving god strips off his gown and turns a man of mode the low prized reader skips the collects over to get a breakfast with a generous whore in brothels see the priest a lechrous swine dead drunk tonight tomorrows a divine these britain these your pious teachers are if these not all but others boast your care how many such whom senseless learning makes as wretched blockheads as the others rakes hold  hold  again thus interrupts my friend stop here good sir and let your satire end how vain how needless give the purpose over follys a boundless sea without a shore as the light bark is on the waters tossed thy pens amidst the floating billows lost as soon you might the seas mad wave contain as follys wide prerogative restrain nor fops nor fools you ever can destroy for who will mind the satire of a boy yet still in vain i curb the unruly pen still it pursues and strikes at fools again but what misfortune has the verse befell conveyed how sudden to the crowded mall here folly reigns behold her numerous tribe which fool which coxcomb shall i first describe lost in the thronging tumult of conceit the verse relents and satire would retreat but now too late no way is left to go placed in between a blockhead and a beau here doomed to bear the vast impertinence of wretches void of learning as of sense see now a train of ladies sailing by strait whips the double concave to the eye the laugh the sneer the look without the glass denote the blockhead and confirm the ass there stalks a creature some might call a man playing the monkey with a ladys fan lo there a blustering hector from the wars behind a row of smockfacd sons of mars here fools of every kind  fops rakes and cits among the rest the worst of fools the wits say where shall those who sense or thought admire free undisturbed amidst the town retire no  here is no safety here no refuge found where nonsense rules and vanities abound behold the stage where shakespeare once could charm and row with sacred fire each bosom warm even there low folly finds a kind retreat whilst shakespeares trod beneath the dancers feet to what low ebb is taste and judgment grown that sense must need a dance to please the town soft otways lines sound tedious to the pit and  expectant for a favorite dancer auretti sit blush senseless audience blush to see a playr whose sounds of sense should charm the attentive ear go silent off or seldom more can boast than the poor gallrys halfstraind praise at most yet if auretti janeton shakes her slender feet how the loud thunder clatters through the pit how often we see the hero half divine in noble worth and generous passion shine we see him fetch the last dear parting breath and greatly bear the agonies of death lo the scene shifts and see the hero pass a mimick sir and now is turned an ass how ill proportioned what a monstrous thing thus abel drugger a low character of mr g  ks in ben johnsons alchymist  it were to be wished that persons of great abilities for the stage instead of being seen in the mean characters they often are would study and play those more suitable to their capacities and to the taste of judges of theatrical performances   nab tomorrow swells into a king no wonder follies thus oerrun the stage since naught but folly takes the senseless age what shame to see as i myself have seen when wellplayd an admirable character in shakespeares merchant of venice then beautifully represented by mr macklin jan  st shylock graced the lively scene a stagebox beau who sat a finished ass and played at peepbo with a spyingglass coxcomb such wretches would i more despise than idiots nature never intended wise expelled the house was every fool like these more men of sense would come less farces please f  by himself had mimickd over his tea for f  and at least in the character of punch fool alike in sound agree but b  n calls fly thither strait my pen again he calls the bulldog barks again  the kennel opens  see the wretched crew  how base the scene presented to the view among the boxers see my lord and squire all hounds alike for all the pack admire but lo the curs for bloody fight prepare and roaring oaths loud bellow desperate war whilst all the gallry is in praises lost on him the worthiest cur that worries most so when two mastiffs better dogs than they in jamess market mix the noisy fray before the snarly fight is half begun lo hooting butchers from the shambles run redoubled noise promotes the favorite cause whilst the poor curs lose blood and gain applause but see the kennel turned a public school where squires and coachmen may be brutes by rule mufflers for those the naked fist may fright for here young lords and puppies learn to fight did britain boast no better arts than these let every worthless art in britain cease a boxer be the great mans constant guest and every man of fortune turn a beast finis
