most important and entertaining subjects in genteel life  published in order to cultivate the principles of virtue and religion in the minds of the youth of both sexes  vol iv  london printed for s richardson and sold by c rivington in st pauls churchyard and j osborn in paternoster row  mdccxlii  pamela or virtue rewarded in a series of familiar letters vol iv letter i from miss darnford to mrs b my dearest mrs b we are greatly obliged to you for every particular article in your entertaining journal which you have brought sooner than we wished to a conclusion we cannot express how much we admire you for your judicious charities so easy to be practiced yet so uncommon in the manner and for your inimitable conduct in the affair of your frail polly and the silly mr h  your account of the visit of the four rakes and of your parting with your noble guests your verses and mr hs letter an original indeed have all greatly entertained us as your prerogative hints have amused us but we defer our opinions of those hints till we have the case more fully explained  but my dear friend are you not in danger of falling into a too thoughtful and gloomy way by the latter part of your letter we are afraid you are and my mamma and mrs jones and mrs peters injoin me to write to caution you on that head but there is the less need of it because your prudence will always suggest to you reasons as it does in that very letter that must outbalance your fears think little and hope much is a good lesson in your case and to a lady of your temper and i hope lady davers will not in vain have given you that caution after all i dare say your thoughtfulness is but symptomatical and will go off in proper time  mean time permit me to choose you a subject that will certainly divert you you must know that i have been a diligent observer of the conduct of people in the married life to each other and have often pronounced that there cannot be any tolerable happiness in it unless the one or the other makes such sacrifices of their inclinations and humors as renders it a state very little desirable to free and generous minds of this i see an instance in our own family for though my papa and mamma live very happily it is all owing to one side i need not say which and this i am sure must be the case between mr b and you for you must even through fire if required sacrifice to moloch i know your prudence will oblige you to make the best of it and like a contented good wife you will say you have your own will in every thing a good reason why because you make your own will his this long ago we all decreed any lady must do be her quality ever so great who would be happy with mr b  yet my sister once hoped  enter nous to be the person fine work would there have been between two such spirits you may believe   but to wave this let me ask you mrs b is your monarchs conduct to you as respectful i dont mean fond when you are alone together as when in company  forgive me madam  but you have hinted two or three times in your letters that he always is most complaisant to you in company and you observe that wisely does he act in this because he thereby does credit with every body to his own choice i make no doubt that the many charming scenes which your genius and fine behavior furnish out to him must as often as they happen inspire him with joy and even rapture and must make him love you more for your mind than for your person  but these rapturous scenes last very little longer than the present moment what i want to know is whether in the steadier parts of life when you are both nearer the level of us common folks he gives up any thing of his own will in compliment to yours whether he acts the part of a respectful polite gentleman in his behavior to you and breaks not into your retirements in the dress and with the brutal roughness of a foxhunter  making no difference perhaps between the field or his stud i will not say kennel and your chamber or closet  policy for his own creditsake as i mentioned accounts to me well for his complaisance to you in public but his regular and uniform behavior to you in your retirements when the conversation between you turns upon usual and common subjects and you have not obliged him to rise to admiration of you by such scenes as those of your two parsons sir jacob swynford and the like are what would most engage my curiosity if you please to give me an instance or two of it  now my dearest mrs b if you can give me a case partly or nearly thus circumstanced you will highly oblige me  first where he has borne with some infirmity of your own and i know of none where you can be guilty of any except you get into a vapourish habit by giving way to a temper too thoughtful and apprehensive  next that in complaisance to your will he recedes from his own in any one instance  next whether he breaks not into your retirements unceremoniously and without apology or concern as i hinted above  you know my dear mrs b all i mean by what i have said and if you have any pretty conversation in memory where this my bold curiosity may be answered pray oblige me with it and we shall be able to judge by it not only of the inborn generosity which all that know mr b have been willing to attribute to him but of the likelihood of the continuance of both your felicities upon terms suitable to the characters of a fine lady and fine gentleman and of consequence worthy of the imitation of the most delicate of our own sex  this is the task your polly darnford presumes to set to her beloved mrs b and why for your own diversion in the first place for my edification in the next and that when i have the pleasure i hope for of attending you in london i may see what there is in the conduct of you both to admire or to remonstrate against in the third for where there is so little wanting to perfection between you i shall be very free with you both in my censures if he imposes through prerogative or you permit through an undue compliance what i shall imagine ought not to be in either case i know you will excuse me for what i have said and well you may since i am sure i shall have nothing to do when i am with you but to admire and to imitate you and to wish if ever i marry i may have just such an husband though not quite so haughty perhaps as mr b but pray let not the lordly man see this letter nor your answer nor the copy of it till you may conclude i have the latter if then that you may not be under any undue influences  your obliging longings my beloved dear lady for my company i hope will be soon very soon answered my papa was so pleased with your sweet earnestness on this occasion that he joined with my mamma and both with equal cheerfulness said you should not be many days in london before me murray and his mistress go on swimmingly and have not yet had one quarrel the only person he of either sex that ever knew nancy so intimately and so long without one  this is all i have to say at present when i have assured you my dear mrs b how much i am  your obliged and affectionate polly danford i must add however that i expect from you almost as many letters as there are postdays between this and the time i see you for i will not part with my correspondent for any body no not for lady davers  but i must insist upon your giving me the conversation with the young ladies related to mrs towers and mrs arthur  i will observe every thing you say in relation to mrs jewkes who is much as she was but not better    letter ii my dearest miss darnford i was afraid i ended my last letter in a gloomy way and i am obliged to you for the kind and friendly notice you take of it it was owing to a train of thinking which sometimes i get into of late i hope only symptomatically as you say and that the cause and effect will soon vanish together  but what a task my dear miss i will warrant you think you have set me i thought in the progress of my journal and in my letters i had gjven so many instances of mr bs polite tenderness to me that no new ones would be required at my hands and when i said he was always most complaisant before company i little expected that such an inference would be drawn from my words as would tend to question the uniformity of his behavior to me when there were no witnesses to it but i am glad you give me an opportunity to clear up all your doubts on this subject to begin then  you first desire an instance where mr b has borne with some infirmity of mine  next that in complaisance to my will he has receded from his own  and lastly whether he breaks not into my retirements unceremoniously and without apology or concern making no difference between the field or the stud and my chamber or closet  i know not my dear miss what the distance is at which the polite ladies and those of rank think it proper to endeavor to keep their husbands but i will give you byandby the subject of one conversation only which will answer all you mean as i apprehend and at the same time acquaint you with the notions and behavior of us both with respect to this distance and my retirements and then leave you to judge as you think fit  as to the first his bearing with my infirmities he is daily giving instances of his goodness to me on this head and i am ashamed to say that of late i give him so much occasion for them as i do but he sees my apprehensiveness at times though i endeavor to conceal it and no husband was ever so soothing and so indulgent as mr b he gives me the best advice as to my malady if i may call it one treats me with redoubled tenderness talks to me upon the subjects i most delight to dwell upon as of my worthy parents what they are doing at this time and at that of our intended journey to london of the diversions of the town of miss darnfords company and when he goes abroad sends up my good mrs jervis to me because i should not be alone at other times takes me abroad with him brings this neighbor and that neighbor to visit me and carries me to visit them talks of our journey to kent and into lincolnshire and to my lady daverss to bath to tunbridge and i cannot tell whither when the apprehended time shall be over  in fine my dear miss darnford you cannot imagine one half of his tender goodness and politeness to me indeed you cannot  then as to what you call respectful he watches every motion of my eye every turn of my countenance seldom gives his opinion upon subjects that he kindly imagines within my capacity till he has heard mine and i have the less fear of falling into mean compliances because his generosity is my guardian and never fails to exalt me more than i can debase myself or than it is possible i can deserve then he hardly ever goes out to any distance but he brings me some pretty present that he thinks will be grateful to me when at home is seldom out of my company delights to teach me french and italian and reads me pieces of manuscript poetry in several of the modern tongues for he speaks them all explains to me every thing i understand not delights to answer all my questions and to encourage my inquisitiveness and curiosity tries to give me a notion of pictures and medals and reads me lectures upon them for he has a fine collection of both and every now and then will have it that he has been improved by my questions and observations  what say you to these things my dear miss do they come up to your first question or do they not or is not what i have said a full answer were i to say no more to all your inquiries can there be any such thing as undue compliances to such an husband on my side think you and when i have charmed to sleep by my grateful duty that watchful dragon prerogative as lady davers in one of her letters calls it and am resolved not to awake it if i can help it by the least disobliging or wilfully perverse act what have i to apprehend from it  o my dear miss i am thoroughly convinced that half the misunderstandings among married people are owing to trifles to petty distinctions to mere words and little captious follies to overweenings or unguarded petulances and who would forego the solid satisfactions of life for the sake of triumphing in such poor contentions if one could triumph  are such foibles as these to be dignified by the name of inclinations and humors which to be given up would be making such a sacrifice as shall render the married life little desirable to free and generous minds   but say not my dear miss to free and generous minds for every high spirit deserves not those epithets nor think what i say a partiality in behalf of my own conduct and an argument for tameness of spirit and such an one as would lick the dust for let me tell you my dear friend that dearly as i love and honor my mr b if he were to require of me any thing that i thought it was my duty not to comply with i should be the unhappiest creature in the world because i am sure i should withstand his will and desire him to excuse my compliance  but then i would reserve my strength for these greater points and would never dispute with him the smaller although they were not entirely to my likeing and this would give both force and merit to the opposition when i found it necessary but to contest every little point where nothing but ones stubborn will was in the question what an inexcusable perverseness would that be how ready to enter the lists against an husband would it make one appear to him and where besides is the merit of obliging were we only to yield to what will oblige ourselves  but you next require of me an instance where in complaisance to my will he has receded from his own i dont know miss what to say to this when mr b is all tenderness and indulgence as i have said and requires of me nothing that i can have a material objection to ought i not to oblige him can i have a will that is not his or would it be excusable if i had all little matters as i have said i cheerfully give up great ones have not yet occurred between us and i hope never will one point indeed i have some apprehension may happen and that to be plain with you is we have had a debate or two on the subject which i maintain of a mothers duty to nurse her own child and i am sorry to say it he seems more determined than i wish he were against it  i hope it will not proceed so far as to awaken the sleeping dragon i mentioned prerogative by name but i doubt i cannot give up this point very contentedly but as to lesser points had i been a duchess born i think i would not have contested them with my husband  upon the whole of this question then i have really had no will of my own to contend for so generous is mr b and so observant and so grateful have i thought it my duty to be yet i could give you many respectful instances too of his receding when he has desired to see what i have been writing and i have told him to whom and begged to be excused one such nstance i can give since i began this letter this is it  i put it in my bosom when he came up he saw me do so  are you writing my dear what i must not see  i am writing to miss darnford sir and she begged you might not at present  this augments my curiosity pamela what can two such ladies write that i may not see  if you will not be displeased sir i had rather you would not because miss desires you may not see her letter nor this my answer till the latter is in her hands  then i will not returned mr b  will this instance my dear miss come up to your demand for one where he recedes from his own will in complaisance to mine  but now as to what both our notions and our practice are on the article of my retirements and whether he breaks in upon them unceremoniously and without apology let the conversation i promised inform you which began on the following occasion  mr b rode out early one morning within a few days past and did not return till the afternoon an absence i had not been used to of late and breakfasting and dining without him being also a new thing to me i had such an impatiency to see him having expected him at dinner that i was forced to retire to my closet to try to divert it off by writing and the gloomy conclusion of my last was then the subject he returned about four oclock and indeed did not tarry to change his ridingdress as your politeness my dear friend would perhaps have expected but came directly up to me with an impatiency to see me equal to my own when he was told upon inquiry that i was in my closet  i heard his welcome step as he came upstairs which generally after a longer absence than i expect has such an effect upon my fond heart that it gives a responsive throb for every step he takes toward me and beats quicker and faster as he comes nearer and nearer till tapping my breast i say to it sometimes lie still busy fool as thou art can thou not forbear letting thy discerning lord see thy nonsensical emotions i love to indulge thee in them myself it is true but then let nobody else observe them for generous as thy master is thou may not perhaps meet with such favorable interpretations as thou deservest when thou art always fluttering thus as he approaches and playest off all thy little joyful frolicks into the glowing cheek and brightened eye of thy mistress which makes her look as if she were conscious of some misdemeanour when all the time it is nothing in the world but grateful joy and a love so innocent that the purest mind might own it  this little flutter and chiding of the busy simpleton made me meet him but at the closetdoor instead of the entrance of my chamber as sometimes i do  so my dear love how do you folding his kind arms about me and saluting me with ardour whenever i have been but a few hours from you my impatience to see my beloved will not permit me to stand upon the formality of a message to know how you are engaged but i break in upon you even in my ridingdress as you see  dear sir you are very obliging but i have no notion of mere formalities of this kind how unpolite this my dear miss in your friend in a married state since it is impossible a virtuous wife can be employed about any thing that her husband may not know and so need not fear surprises  i am glad to hear you say this my pamela for i have always thought the extraordinary civilities and distances of this kind which i have observed among several persons of rank altogether unaccountable for if they are exacted by the lady i should suspect she had reserves which she herself believed i could not approve of if not exacted but practiced of choice by the gentleman it carries with it in my opinion a false air of politeness little less than affrontive to the lady and dishonorable to himself for does it not look as if he supposed and allowed that probably she might be so employed that it was necessary to apprise her of his visit left he should make discoveries not to her credit or his own  one would not sir for i thought his conclusion too severe make such a harsh supposition as this neither for there are little delicacies and moments of retirement no doubt in which a modest lady would be glad to be indulged by the tenderest husband  it may be so in an early matrimony before the ladys confidence in the honor and discretion of the man she has chosen has disengaged her from her bridal reserves  bridal reserves dear sir permit me to give it as my humble opinion that a wifes behavior ought to be as pure and as circumspect in degree as that of a bride or even of a maiden lady be her confidence in her husbands honor and discretion ever so great for indeed i think a gross or a careless demeanor little becomes that modesty which is the peculiar excellency and distinction of our sex  you account very well my dear by what you now say for your own overnice behavior as i have sometimes thought it but are we not all apt to argue for a practice we make our own because we do make it our own rather than from the reason of the thing  i hope sir that is not the present case with me for permit me to say that an overfree or negligent behavior in a lady in the married state must be a mark of disrespect to her consort and would show as if she was very little solicitous about what appearance she made in his eye and must not this beget in him a slight opinion of her and her sex too as if supposing the gentleman had been a free liver she would convince him there was no other difference in the sex but as they were within or without the pale licensed by the law or acting in defiance of it  i understand the force of your argument pamela but you was going to say something more  only sir permit me to add that when in my particular case you injoin me to appear before you always see vol ii p  0      dressed even in the early part of the day it would be wrong if i was less regardful of my behavior and actions than of my appearance  i believe you are right my dear if a precise or unnecessary scrupulousness be avoided and where all is unaffected easy and natural as in my pamela for i have seen married ladies both in england and france who have kept a husband at greater distance than they have exacted from some of his sex who have been more entitled to his resentment than to his wifes intimacies  but to wave a subject in which as i can with pleasure say neither of us have much concern tell me my dearest how you were employed before i came up here are pen and ink here too is paper but it is as spotless as your mind to whom was you directing your favors now may i not know your subject  mr hs letter was a part of it and so i had put it by at his approach and not choosing he should see that i am writing replied i to miss darnford but i think you must not ask me to see what i have written this time i put it aside that you should not when i heard your welcome step the subject is our parting with our noble guests and a little of my apprehensiveness on an occasion upon which our sex may write to one another but for some of the reasons we have been mentioning gentlemen should not desire to see  then i will not my dearest love so here miss is another instance  i could give you an hundred such  of his receding from his own will in complaisance to mine only continued he let me warn you against too much apprehensiveness for your own sake as well as mine for such a mind as my pamelas i cannot permit to be habitually overclouded and yet there now hangs upon your brow an overthoughtfulness which you must not indulge  indeed sir i was a little too thoughtful from my subject before you came but your presence like the sun has dissipated the mists that hung upon my mind see you not and i pressed his hand with my lips they are all gone already smiling upon him with a delight unfeigned  not quite my obliging charmer and therefore if you have no objection i will change my dress and attend you in the chariot for an hour or two whither you please that not one shadow may remain visible in this dear face and then he saluted me with ardour  whither you please sir a little airing with you will be highly agreeable to me  the dear obliger went and changed his dress in an instant and he led me to the chariot with his usual tender politeness and we had a charming airing of several miles returning quite happy cheerful and delighted with each others conversation without calling in upon any of our good neighbors for what need of that my dear miss when we could be the best company in the world to each other  now miss do these instances come up to your questions do they or do they not  if you think not i could give you our conversation in the chariot for i wrote it down at my first leisure so highly was i delighted with it for the subject was my dearest parents a subject started by himself because he knew it would oblige me but being tired with writing i may reserve it till have the pleasure of seeing you if you think it worth asking for and so i will hasten to a conclusion of this long letter  you will perceive my dear miss by what i have written in what sense it may be justly said that mr b is most complaisant to me before company perhaps politically as you say to do credit to his own generous choice  but that he is more tender yea respectfully tender for that is the word with you and not less polite to me in our retired hours you will have no doubt from what i have related and could further relate if it was necessary for every day produces instances equal to what i have given you  then my dear miss let me say to you what i could not so freely say to any other young lady that i never could have hoped i should be so happy as i am in other particulars from a gentleman who has given himself the liberties mr b has done for i never hear from him in company or when alone the least shocking expression or such frothy jests as tend to convey impure ideas to the most apprehensive mind there is indeed the less wonder in this and that we can glory in a true conjugal chastity as i have the vanity to think his love as well as my own is the love of the mind rather than that of person and our tenderest and most affecting moments are those which lift us up above sense and all that sense can imagine but this is a subject too delicate to be dwelt upon even to you and you will better comprehend all i mean when your pure mind meets with a gentleman of exalted sense like mr b whom if you find not so good as you wish your example will make so  permit me to add for the sake of you my dear parents as well as for those of my muchrespected friends who have joined in the kind caution you give me my dear miss against getting into too thoughtful and gloomy a way that there is no great fear that i should continue long in it when i have so kind and so generous a comforter as mr b for at his presence all my fearful apprehensions are dissipated and vanish like a morning dream and depend upon it that so sure as the day succeeds to the night so sure will my mind while capable of the least sense of gratitude be illuminated the moment he shines out upon me let it be ever so overcast in his absence through imaginary doubts and apprehended evils  i have only further to add for my comfort that next thursday sevnnight if nothing hinders we are to set out for london and why do you think i say for my comfort only that i shall then soon have the opportunity to assure you personally as you give me hope how much i am my dear miss darnford  your truly affectionate pb i will show you when i see you the conversation you require about the young ladies    letter iii my dear miss one more letter and i have done for a great while because i hope your presence will put an end to the occasion i shall now tell you of my second visit to the dairyhouse where we went to breakfast in the chariot and four because of the distance which is ten pretty long miles  i transcribed for you from letters written formerly to my dear parents an see vol ii p     account of my former dairyhouse visit and what the people were and whom i saw there and although i besought you to keep that affair to yourself as too touching a point to the reputation of my mr b to be known but to you only and even to destroy it when you had perused it yet i make no doubt you remember the story and so i need not repeat any part of that account  when we arrived there we found at the door expecting us for they heard the chariotwheels at a distance my pretty miss goodwin accompanied by two other misses who had earned their ride and attended by the governesss daughter a discreet young gentlewoman as soon as i stepped out missran into my arms with great eagerness and i as tenderly embraced her and leading her into the parlour asked her abundance of questions about her work and her lessons and among the rest if she had merited this distinction of the chaise and dairyhouse breakfast or if it were owing to her uncles favor and to that of her governess the young gentlewoman assured me it was to both and showed me misss needleworks and penmanship and the child was highly pleased with my commendations  i took a good deal of notice of the other two misses for their schoolfellows sake and made each of them a present of some little toys and my miss of a number of pretty trinkets with which she was highly delighted and i told her that i would wait upon her governess when i came from london into the country again and see in what order she kept her little matters for above all things i loved pretty housewisely misses and then i would bring her more  mr b observed with no small satisfaction the childs behavior which is very pretty and appeared as fond of her as if he had been more than her uncle and yet seemed under some restraint lest it should be taken that he was such power has secret guilt poor dear gentleman to lessen and restrain a pleasure that would in a happier light have been so laudable to have manifested but how commendable is this his love to the dear child compared to that of most wicked libertines who have no delight but in destroying innocence and care not what becomes of the unhappy infant or of the still more unhappy mother  i am going to let you into a charming scene resulting from this perplexity of the dear gentleman a scene that has afforded me high delight ever since and always will when i think of it but i will lead to it as gradually as it happened  the child was very fond of her uncle and told him she loved him dearly and always would love and honor him for giving her such a good aunt  you talked madam said she when i saw you before that i should come and live with you  will you let me madam indeed i will be very good and do every thing you bid me and mind my book and my needle indeed i will  ask your uncle my dearest miss said i i should like your pretty company of all things  she went to mr b and said shall i sir go and live with my aunt pray let me when you come from london again  you have a very good governess miss said he and she cannot part with you  yes but she can sir she has a great many misses and can spare me well enough and if you please to let me ride in your coach sometimes i can go and visit my governess and beg a holiday for the misses nowandthen when i am almost a woman and then all the misses will love me  dont the misses love you now miss goodwin said he yes they love me wellenough for matter of that but they will love me better when i can beg them a holiday do dear sir let me go home to my new aunt next time you come into the country  i was much pleased with the dear childs earnestness and permitted her to have her full argument with her beloved uncle but was much moved and he himself was under some concern when the dear miss said  but you should in pity let me live with you sir for i have no papa nor mamma neither they are so far off  but i will love you both as if you were my own papa and mamma so dear now my good uncle promise the poor girl that has never a papa nor mamma   i withdrew to the door it will rain i believe said i and looked up and indeed i had almost a shower in my eye and had i kept my place could not have refrained showing how much i was affected  mr b as i said was a little moved but for fear the young gentlewoman should take notice of it how my dear said he no papa and mamma  did they not send you a pretty black boy to wait upon you a while ago have you forgot that  that is true replied miss but what is a black boy to living with my new aunt  that is better a great deal than a black boy indeed it is  well your aunt and i will consider of it when we come from london be a good girl mean time and do as your governess would have you and then you dont know what we may do for you well then miss bett said she to her young governess let me be set two tasks instead of one and i will learn all i can to deserve to go to my aunt  in this manner the little prattler diverted herself and as we returned from them the scene i hinted at opened as follows  mr b was pleased to say what a poor figure does the proudest mind make my dear pamela under the sense of a concealed guilt in company of the innocent who know it and those who do not even the casual expression of a baby shall strike back shame upon a guilty heart and make one unable to look up without confusion i blushed for myself continued he to see how you was affected for me and yet withdrew to avoid reproaching me so much as with your eye for then the whole power of innocence triumphing over my guilt how like a fool i looked surely i made a most contemptible figure pamela  did you not disdain me at that moment  dearest sir how can you speak such a word a word i cannot repeat after you for at that very time i beheld you with the more reverence for seeing your noble heart touched with a sense of your error and it was such an earnest to me of the happiest change i could ever wish for and in so young a gentleman that it was one half joy for that and the other half concern at the little charmers accidental plea to her best and nearest friend for coming home to her hew aunt that affected me so sensibly as you saw  you must not talk to me of the childs coming home after this visit pamela for how at this rate shall i stand the reproaches of my own mind were i to see the little prater every day before me and to think of what her poor mamma has suffered on my account it is enough that in you my dear i have an hourly reproach before me for my attempts on your virtue and i have nothing to boast but that i gave way to your triumphs and what then is my boast  what is your boast dearest sir you have every thing to boast that is worthy of being boasted of  brought up to an affluent fortune uncontrollable in your will your passions unbridled god has touched your truly noble heart and you have seen your error at a time of life when others are rushing into vices in the midst of which perhaps they are cut off  you act generously and with a laudable affection to a deserving baby which some would have left friendless to the wide world and have made more miserable perhaps than they had made the very miserable mother and you have the comfort to think that through gods goodness this mother is not unhappy and that there is not a lost soul any more than a lost body to lay to your charge  you have inspirited by your generous example and enabled by your splendid fortune another person whom you have made the happiest creature in the world to do more good if she may say so without vanity than twenty wicked libertines have done mischief besides making every one that approaches you easy and happy with the bounty of your own hands  you are the best of husbands the best of landlords the best of masters the best of friends and with all these excellencies and a mind as i hope continually improving and more and more affected with the sense of its past mistakes will you ask dear sir what is your boast  o my dearest dear mr b and then i pressed his hand with my lips whatever you are to yourself when you give way to reflections so hopeful you are the glory and the boast of your grateful pamela and permit me to add tears standing in my eyes and holding his hand between mine that i never beheld you in my life in a more amiable light than when i saw your manly countenance manifesting the struggle your heart labored with as it seemed to me between grace and consciousness o sir this was a sight of joy of true joy to one who loves you for your dear souls sake more than for that of your person and who looks forward to a companionship with you beyond the term of this transitory life  the dear gentleman looked down sometimes and sometimes upon me without offering to interrupt me and when i had done speaking i began to fear by his silence that i had offended him remembering just then one of his former see vol ii p     cautions to me not to throw a gloom by my overseriousness upon his innocent enjoyments and i said putting my arms round his arm as i fat my fearful eye watching his i fear sir i have been too serious i have perhaps broken one of your injunctions have cast a gloominess over your mind and if i have dear sir forgive me  he clasped his arm around me o my beloved pamela said he thou dear augmenter of my honor and confirmer of all my better purposes how shall i acknowledge for reward i never can your inexpressible goodness to me i see every day more and more my dear love what confidence i may repose in your generosity and discretion you want no forgiveness and my silence was owing to much better motives than to those you were apprehensive of  judge ye my honored parents and you my dear miss the joy that overspread my heart encouraged in a manner so agreeable to all my wishes o sir sir said i after a short pause your goodness had struck me dumb for a moment but my silence could hold but for that moment for had i been naturally dumb and never spoken before my joy for this your kindness and the futute hope you raise in my breast would have unbarrd the doors of my speech or my heart would have been made vocal had my tongue remained silent  forgive me my dearest miss these slightly expressions i know they are above myself and perhaps out of nature but so in a manner was your friend when she spoke them if ever it be your lot to marry such a gentleman as mr b one who is capable of generous and noble sentiments and yet has not been so good as you wish him to be whenever it shall happen that the divine grace and your example shall touch his heart and awaken his better faculties you will then know a joy like this which i have described which will not only exalt your heart and speech but upon reflection will irradiate many a gloomy apprehension that at times will cast a shadow over the brightest and happiest prospects  the chariot brought us home sooner than i wished and mr b handed me into the parlour here mrs jervis said he meeting her in the passage receive your angellady i must take a little tour without you pamela for i have had too much of your dear company and must leave you to descend again into myself for you have raised me to such a pitch that it is with pain i bear it  he kissed my hand and went into his chariot again for it was but half an hour after twelve and said he would be back by two at dinner he left mrs jervis wondering at his words and at the solemn air with which he uttered them but when i told that good friend the occasion i had a new joy in the pleasure and gratulations of the dear good woman on what had passed  were i my dear friends to recount to you every conversation that gives me delight when we are alone my miss darnford as well as when we are in company i should do nothing but write imagine the rest from what i have but as so many specimens of my felicity informed you of and then think if there can possibly be a happier creature on earth than i am at present  my next letter will be from london and to you my honored parents for to you my dear miss i shall not write again expecting to see you soon but i must now write seldomer because i am to renew my correspondence with lady davers with whom i cannot be so free as i have been with miss darnford and so i doubt my dear father and mother you cannot have the particulars of that correspondence for i shall never find time to transcribe but every opportunity that offers you may assure yourself shall be laid hold of by  your everdutiful daughter p b excuse me dear miss a second subscription for you need not be told how much i am and ever shall be  your affectionate p b    letter iv my dear father and mother i know you will be pleased to hear that we arrived safely in town last night we found a stately wellfurnishd and convenient house and i had my closet or library and my withdrawingroom all in complete order which mr b gave me possession of in a manner the most obliging that can be imagined  i am in a new world as i may say and see such vast piles of building everywhere and such a concourse of people and hear such a rattling of coaches in the day that i hardly know what to make of it as yet then the nightly watch going their hourly rounds disturbed me last night but i shall soon be used to that and sleep the sounder perhaps for the security it assures to us  mr b is impatient to show me what is curious in and about this vast city and to hear as he is pleased to say my observations upon what i shall see and he has carried me through several of the fine streets this day in his chariot but at present i have too confused a notion of things to give any account of them nor shall i trouble you with descriptions of that kind for you being within a days journey of london i hope for the pleasure of seeing you oftener than i could expect before and shall therefore leave these matters to your own observations and what you will hear from others  i am impatient for the arrival of my dear miss darnford whose company and conversation will reconcile me in a great measure to this new world  our family at present are mr colbrand mr jonathan and six menservants including the coachman the four maids are also with us  but my good mrs jervis was indisposed so came not up with us but we expect her and mr longman in a day or two for mr b has given her to my wishes and arthur the gardener and his wife with benjamin are to keep house in the country and as mr longmans business will require him to be up and down frequently mrs jerviss care will be the better dispensed with there and i long to see the dear good woman and shall be more in my element when i do  then i have besides my penitent polly barlow but the poor girl has never held up her head since that deplorable instance of her weakness which i mentioned to you and miss darnford yet am i as kind to her as if nothing had happened i wish however some good husband would offer for her  mr adams our worthy chaplain is at present with mr williams he purposes to give us his company here till christmas when matters will be adjusted probably so that he can take possession of his living mean time that we may not let fall a good custom when perhaps we shall have most occasion for it i make mr jonathan who is reverend by his years and silver hairs supply his place appointing him the subjects  god preserve you both in health and continue to me i beseech you your prayers and blessings concludes me  your everdutiful daughter p b  letter v from mrs b to lady davers my dearest lady i must beg pardon for having been in this great town more than a week and not having found an opportunity to tender my devoirs to your ladyship you know dear madam what hurries and fatigues must attend such a journey to one in my way and to an entire new settlement in which an hundred things must be done and attended to with a preference to other occasions however delightful yet i must own we found a stately a wellordered and a convenient house but although it is not far from fields and has an airy opening to its back part and its front a square as it is called yet i am not reconciled to it so entirely as to the beloved mansion we left  my dear mr b has been and is busily employed in ordering some few alterations to make things still more commodious he has furnished me out a little pretty library and has allotted me very convenient apartments besides and the furniture of every place is rich as befits the mind and fortune of the generous owner but i shall not offer at particulars because we hope to have the honor of a visit from my good lord and your ladyship before the winter weather sets in to make the roads too dirty and deep but it is proper to mention that the house is so large that we make a great number of beds the more conveniently to receive the honors your ladyship and my lord and mr bs other friends will do us  i have not yet been at any of the public diversions mr b has carried me by gentle turns out of his workmens way ten miles round this overgrown capital and through the principal of its numerous streets the villages that lie spangled about this vast circumference as well on the other side the noble thames which i had before a notion of from sir john denbams celebrated coopers hill as well as on the middlesex side are beautiful both by buildings and situation beyond what i could conceive and several of them seem larger than many of our country towns of note but it would be impertinent to trouble your ladyship with these matters who are no stranger to what is worthy of notice in london but i was surprised when mr b observed to me that this whole county and the two cities of london and westminster are represented by no more than eight members of parliament when so many borough towns in england are inferior to the meanest villages about london  i am in daily expectation of the arrival of miss darnford and then i shall wish accompanied by a young lady of so polite a taste to see a good play mr b has already shown me the operahouse and the two play houses though silent as i may say that as he was pleased to observe they should not be new to me and that the sight might not take off my attention to the performance when i went to the play so that i can conceive a tolerable notion of every thing from the disposition of the seats the boxes the galleries the pit the music the scenes and the stage and so shall have no occasion to gaze about me like a country novice whereby i might attract a notice that i should not with either for my own credit or your dear brothers honor  i have had a pleasure which i wished for and had not in bedfordshire and that is that on sunday i was at church without gaping crowds to attend us and wishes too loud for my own yet i was more gazed at and so was mr b than i expected considering there were so many welldressd gentry and some nobility there and they stard as much as any body but will not do so i hope when we cease to be a novelty  we have already had several visitors to welcome mr b to town and to congratulate him on his marriage  but some no doubt to see and to find fault with his rustic for it is impossible you know madam that a gentleman so distinguished by his merit and fortune should have taken a step of such consequence to himself and family and not be known by every body so to have done  sir thomas atkyns is in town and has taken apartments in the newbuilt stately pile of edifices called hanoversquare and he brought with him a younger brother of mr arthurs who it seems is a merchant  lord f has been to pay his respects to mr b likewise whose schoolfellow he was eaton the little time mr b was there his lordship promises that his lady shall make me a visit and accompany me to the opera as soon as we are fully settled  a gentleman of the temple mr turner by name and mr fanshaw of greysinn both lawyers and of mr bs former acquaintance very sprightly and modish gentlemen have also welcomed us to town and made mr b abundance of gay compliments on my account to my face all in the common frothy run   they may be polite gentlemen but i cannot say i overmuch like them  there is something so forward so opinionated so seemingly insensible of rebuke either from within or without and yet not promising to avoid deserving one occasionally that i could as lieve wish mr b and they would not renew their former acquaintance  i am very bold your ladyship will say  but you command me to write freely yet i would not he thought to be uneasy with regard to your dear brothers morals from these gentlemen for oh madam i am a blessed creature and am hourly happier and happier in the confidence i have as to that particular but i imagine they will force themselves upon him more than he himself may wish or would permit were the acquaintance now to begin for they are not of his turn of mind as it seems to me being by a sentence or two that dropped from them very free and very frothy in their conversation and by their laughing at what they say themselves taking that for wit which will not stand the test if i may be allowed to say so  but they have heard no doubt what a character mr bs goodness to me has lifted into notice and they think themselves warranted to say any thing before his country girl  he was pleased to ask me when they were gone how i liked his two lawyers and said they were persons of family and fortune  i am glad of it sir said i for their own sakes  then you dont approve of them pamela   they are your friends sir and i cannot have any dislike to them  they say good things sometimes returned he  i dont doubt it sir but you say good things always  it is happy for me my dear you think so but tell me what think you of em  i shall be better able sir to answer your question if i see them a second time  but we form notions of persons at first sight sometimes my dear and you are seldom mistaken in yours  i only think sir that they have neither of them any diffidence but their profession perhaps may set them above that  they dont practice my dear their fortunes require it not of them and they are too studious of their pleasures to give themselves any trouble they are not obliged to take  they seem to me sir to be qualified for prastice they would make great figures at the bar i fansy  why so  because sir they seem if i must speak gentlemen of great elocution   how do you discover that my dear   only that they seem prepared to think well of what they shall say themselves and lightly of what other people say or may think of them   that indeed my dear is the necessary character of a public speaker be he lawyer or what he will the man who cannot doubt himself and can judge contemptibly of his auditors never fails to speak with selfapplause at least  but you will pardon me good sir for speaking my mind so freely and so early of these your friends  i never my love ask you a question i wish you not to answer and always expect your answer should be without reserve for many times i may ask your opinion as a corrective or a confirmation of my own judgment  how kind how indulgent was this my good lady  but you know how generously your dear brother treats me on all occasions and this makes me so bold as i often am  it may be necessary my dear lady to give you an account of our visitors in order to make the future parts of my writing the more intelligible because what i may have to write may turn sometimes upon the company we see for which reason i shall also just mention sir george stuart a scottish gentleman with whom mr b came acquainted in his travels who seems to be a polite and mr b says is a learned man and a virtuoso he and a nephew of his of the same name a bashful gentleman and who for that reason i imagine has a merit that lies deeper than a first observation can reach are just gone from us and were received with so much civility by mr b as intitles them to my respectful regard  thus madam do i run on in a manner without materials and only to show you the pleasure i take in obeying you i hope my good lord davers continues in health and me in his favor which i value extremely as well as your ladyships mr h i hope likewise enjoys his health but let me not forget my particular and thankful respects to the countess for her ladyships favor and goodness to me which i shall ever place next in my grateful esteem to the honors i have received from your ladyship on so many occasions and which bind me to be with the greatest respect my dear lady  your faithful and obliged servant p b  letter vi my dear father and mother i write to you both at this time for your advice in a particular case that is the only one that i have had or i hope ever shall have with my dear benefactor by way of dispute and as he is pleased to insist upon his way and it is a point of conscience with me i must resolve i think to be determined by your joint advice and if my father and mother and husband are of one opinion i must yield up my own  this is the subject i think a mother ought if she can to be the nurse to her own children  mr b says he will not permit it  it is the first will not i have heard from him or given occasion for and i tell him that as it is a point of conscience with me i hope he will indulge me but the dear gentleman has an odd way of arguing that sometimes puzzles me he pretends to answer me from scripture but i have some doubts of his exposition and he gives me leave to write to you though yet he will not promise to be determined by your opinions if they are not the same with his own and i say to him is this fair my dearest mr b is it   he has got the deans opinion with him for our debate began before we came to town but then he would not let me state the case but did it himself and yet it is but an half opinion as i may say neither for it is that if the husband is set upon it it is a wifes duty to obey  but i cannot see how that is for if it be the natural duty of a mother it is a divine duty and how can a husband have power to discharge a divine duty  as great as a wifes obligation is to obey her husband which is i own one indispensable of the marriage contract it ought not to interfere with what one takes to be a superior duty and must not one be ones own judge of actions by which we must stand or fall   i will tell you my plea  i say that where a mother is unhealthy subject to communicative distempers as scrophulous or scorbutic or consumptive disorders which have infected the blood or lungs or where they have not plenty of nourishment for the child as i have heard is the case of some that in these cases a dispensation lies of course  but where there is good health free spirits and plentiful nourishment i think it an indispensable duty  for this was the custom of old of all the good wives we read of in scripture  then the nourishment of the mother must be most natural to the child  then a nurse may have a bad husband may have distempers may have private vices as to liquors etc may be careless and a selflover while a mother prefers the health of her child to her own private satisfactions or appetites  a nurse may be of a sordid nature and when i have heard mr b so satirical on lords and gentlemen in coachboxes why may not charity make one think that the lady of the family was innocent of sordid and unpardonable crimes imputed by severe judges and that the child when grown up owes its taste to the coachbox to its nurses being the coachmans wife or the wife of one of like degree who may not have a mind or qualities above that degree for as the blood and spirits are augmented with the childs growth by the food it takes in a sordid nature may as well be communicated from a sound woman as bad health by an unsound as i should imagine  then the child by the designation of nature generally brings its nourishment into the world with it and art must be used as i presume to dry up the fountains of such its nourishment and is not this quite unnatural  and is not what is unnatural sinful  then i have lately read my circumstances having made me curious on this subject that a newborn child has in its little bowels a pitchy substance that wants to be purged off and when it is not occasions those gripings and convulsions which destroy so many miserable infants even as one finds by the weekly bills here in town more than half of those who die in infancy whereas nature has designed it seems a cure for this in the purgative quality and fine thin blueness given to the first milk which in three weeks or a month or may be less carries off that pitchy substance and gives freedom and ease to the bowels of babies a quality which not being in staler milk the poor child often falls a sacrifice to this negligence or inattention and the mothers pains and hazards are all cast away and her griefs at losing the dear infant are much greater than her joys at its birth when all the danger was over  then dear sir said i there is another point respecting the health of our sex  great hurts to ones constitution may arise from too frequently being in this circumstance and for my own part you have made me so happy that i cannot help being covetous of life if i may so say  but the sin dear sir the sin of committing that task to others which is so right to be performed by ones self if one has health and strength to perform it is the chief thing with me and you know sir that even a husbands will is not sufficient to excuse one from a natural or divine obligation  these were my pleas among others and this is his answer for he was so good to give it me in writing  as to what you allege my dear of old customs times and fashions are much changed if you tell me of sarahs or rachels or rebekahs or leahs nursing their own children i can answer that the one drew water at a well for her fathers flocks another kneaded cakes and baked them on the hearth for her guests another personally dressed savoury meat for her husband and all of them performed the common offices of the household and when our modern ladies are willing to follow such examples in every thing their plea ought to be allowed in this  as to the matter of sordid natures  we read that there were among jacobs twelve sons bad as well as good natures though born of and nursed by the same mothers reuben particularly committed an unpardonable crime you are too well read in scripturehistory to need being told what it was two others were murderers treacherous murderers in cold blood and how did all their hearts burn with sordid and unbrotherly envy against their fathers favorite son  then it requires but the more care in finding out a wholesome woman who has an honest and goodnatured husband and let me tell you pamela that the best natures and the best constitutions though your case is an exception are not always to be met with in highlife and the less perhaps because they dont exercise themselves as the patriarchal nurses you hinted at used to do indeed i have seen spirits in some of the highborn of your sex that one would not wish to be propagated but contrarily if there be so much in the nature of the nourishment i should think it matter of prudence that the child should have any other nurse than its mother  as to the nurses private vices with regard to liquors distempers etc this will be answered by what i have hinted of the greater care to be taken in the choice of the nurse and i am so well pleased with your apprehensions of this nature that it is a moral security to me that you will make a proper choice and i shall be entirely easy in committing this province to so prudent and discreet a wife  i allow that there is a great deal in what you say as to the pitchy substance in newborn children and i think it very proper that the child should have the first milk but cannot such a nurse be found as may answer this intention  if she cannot i will provided you deal by me with your usual sincerity and not make scruples against a recommendation on purpose to carry your own point permit you to be your own nurse for one month or so if by the opinion of proper judges it be found necessary but then as i know the pretty wiredrawing ways of your sex you must not so much as ask to go farther for i shall not care to have my rest disturbed and it may not be quite so well perhaps to lay us under the necessity of separate beds  besides my fondness for your personal graces and the laudable and i will say honest pleasure i take in that easy genteel form which every body admires in you at first sight oblige me to declare that i can by no means consent to sacrifice these to the carelessness into which i have seen very nice ladies sink when they became nurses moreover my chief delight in you is for the beauties of your mind and unequalled as they are in my opinion you have still a genius capable of great improvement and i shall not care when i want to hear my pamela read her french and latin lessons which i take so much delight to teach her and to endeavor to improve myself from her virtue and piety at the same time to seek my beloved in the nursery or to permit her to be engrossed by those baby offices which will better befit weaker minds  no my dear you must allow me to look upon you as my scholar in one sense as my companion in another and as my instructress in a third you know i am not governed by the worst motives i am half overcome by your virtue and you must take care that you leave not your work halfdone but i cannot help looking upon the nurses office as an office beneath my pamela let it have your inspection your direction and your sole attention if you please when i am abroad but when i am at home even a son and heir so jealous am i of your affections shall not be my rival in them nor will i have my rest broken in upon by your servants bringing to you as you once proposed your dear littleone at times perhaps as unsuitable to my repose and your own as to the childs necessities for i have no notion of stifling even a cry by cramming its little stomach when that very cry shall perhaps be necessary for exercise to its lungs and to open its little organs  you have been often somewhat uneasy when i have talked for arguments sake in favor of polygamy but when you mention the designations of nature and form from thence your notions of duty on this subject what will you say if i could from your very arguments of this kind plead for that practice and bring all your good patriarchal folks on my side on whom you lay such stress in one instance  for example my dear suppose i put you in mind that while rachel was giving her littleone all her attention as a good nurse the worthy patriarch had several other wives  dont be shocked my dearest love  the laws of ones own country are a sufficient objection to me against polygamy at least i will not think of any more wives till you convince me by your adherence to the example given you by the patriarch wives that i ought to follow those of the patriarch husbands  so here is that nasty word polygamy again mr b knows i had rather he should mention any thing than that  but be so good as to mind his next argument he is pleased to entertain very high notions though he puts them not in practice and indeed i think it my duty to avoid giving him occasion for it of the prerogativeof a husband upon my word he sometimes for arguments sake makes a body think a wife should not have the least will of her own he sets up a dispensing power in short although he knows that that doctrine once cost a prince his crown and thus proceeding with his answer to my plea he argues  the chief thing that sticks with you my dear pamela is that you think it unnatural in a mother not to be a nurse to her own child if she can and what is unnatural you say is a sin now my dear although your practice be so unexceptionable you seem not to have a right notion of the obedience which a wife naturally owes as well as voluntarily vows to a husbands will   in all lawful things you will say  but suppose my dear you were to make a solemn vow either as a single woman or as a wife to do any thing that you had a natural power to do no doubt you would think yourself under an obligation to perform it let the consequence be what it would but to show you who are so learned in the old law of how little force even the vows of your sex are and how much you are under the control of ours read the following verses in numbers xxx if a man vow a vow unto the lord or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond he shall not break his word he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth the reason of this is he is sole and independent and master of his own will and actions  but what follows if a woman also vow a vow unto the lord and bind herself by a bond being in her fathers house in her youth and her father hear her vow and her bond wherewith she has bound her soul and her father shall hold his peace at her then all her vows shall stand and every bond wherewith she has bound her soul shall stand but if her father disallow her in the day that he hears not any of her vows or of her bonds wherewith she has bound her soul shall stand and the lord shall forgive her because her father disallowed her  the very same thing is with equal strength expressed in the verses immediately following in relation to a husbands allowing or disallowing his wifes vows nor is it distinguished at all whether the vow be just or unjust and it is worthy of observation too that the laws of england in consideration of the obedience a wife owes to a husband will acquit a woman of certain crimes for which they will punish a man with death  what i have mentioned therefore shows how much the daughter is under the absolute control of her father and the wife of her husband so that you see my dear even in such a strong point as solemn vow to the lord the wife may be absolved by the husband from the performance of it  and by the way this is no bad piece of information to young ladies who are urged by their designing lovers to enter into vows and contracts in their favor not one of which you see is of force unless the father and by the same rule those who have authority over her and stand in the fathers place approve and confirm it  if this therefore be the case in so solemn a point surely an husband may take upon himself to dispense with such a supposed obligation as that which you seem so loath to give up even although you had made a vow that you would nurse your own child  and the rather if the principle an husband acts upon is laudable a desire to continue his affectionate and faithful regards to his wife to preserve in her as long as may be preserved those graces and those delicacies of person which he admires in her and which it is impossible a thorough nurse should keep up and as moreover in your case her time may be employed to so much greater improvement to her own mind and her husbands morals while he can look upon her in a light above that of an insipid prattling nurse who must become a fool and a baby herself before she can be complete in the character into which you my dear want to dwindle  some gentlemen may be fond of having their ladies undertake this province and very good reasons may be assigned for such their fondness but it suits not me at all and yet no man would be thought to have a greater affection for children than myself or be more desirous to do them justice for i think every one should look forward to posterity with a preference but if my pamela can be better impoyd if the office can be equally well performed if your direction and superintendence will be sufficient and if i cannot look upon you in that way with equal delight as if it was otherwise i insist upon it my pamela that you acquiesce with my dispensation and dont think to let me lose my beloved wife and have an indelicate nurse put upon me instead of her  as to that hint the nearest to me of all of dangers to your constitution there is as much reason to hope it may not be so as to fear that it may for children sometimes bring health with them as well as infirmity and it is not a little likely that the nurses office may affect the health of a dear lady who has no very robust constitution and thinks it so much her duty to attend it that she will abridge herself of half the pleasures of life and on that account confine herself within doors or in the other case must take with her her infant and her nurserymaid wherever she goes and i shall either have very fine company shall i not or be obliged to deny myself yours  then as i propose to give you a smattering of the french and italian i know not but i may take you with me on a little tour into france and italy at least to bath to tunbridge to oxford to york and the principal places of england wherefore as i love to look upon you as the companion of my pleasures i advise you my dearest love not to weaken or to speak in a phrase proper to the present subject wean me from that love to you and admiration of you which hitherto has been rather increasing than otherwise as your merit and regard for me have increased  these my dear parents are charming allurements almost irresistible temptations and that makes me mistrust myself the more and be the more diffident  for we are but too apt to be persuaded into any thing when the motives are so tempting as these last  but do you take it indeed that a husband has such a vast prerogative can it be now under the gospel that this setting themselves as it were in gods place and dispensing with our wills as pleases theirs is still in force  yet it is said that our savior came not to break the law but to fulfill it  i take it for granted that many ladies will not choose to dispute this point so earnestly as i have done for we have had several little debates about it and it is the only point i have ever yet debated with him but one would not be altogether implicit neither it is no compliment to him to be quite passive and to have no will at all of ones own yet would i not dispute one point but in supposition of a superior obligation and this he says he can dispense with  but alas my dear mr b was never yet thought so entirely fit to fill up the character of a casuistical divine as that one may absolutely rely upon his decisions in these serious points and you know we must all stand or fall by our own judgments  upon condition therefore that he requires not to see this my letter nor your answer to it unless i please i write for your advice for you both have always made a conscience of your duties and taught me to do so too or perhaps i had not been what i am and i know morever that nobody is more conversant with the scriptures than you are and some how or other he has got the dean against me and i care not to be so free with the worthy minister of our parish here and still less with the younger clergymen i am acquainted with  but this i see plainly enough that he will have his own way and if i cannot get over my scruples what shall i do for if i think it a sin to submit to the dispensation he insists upon as in his power to grant and yet do submit to it what will become of my peace of mind for it is not in our power to believe as one will then weak minds will have their doubts and the law allows a toleration for scrupulous and tender consciences but my beloved husband my lawgiver and my prince i doubt will allow none to poor me  as to the liberty he gives me for a month i should be loath to take it for one does not know the inconveniences that may attend a change of nourishment or if i did i should rather  but i know not what i would say for i am but a young creature to be in this way and very unequal to it in every respect so i commit myself to gods direction and your advice as becomes  your everdutiful daughter p b  letter vii my dearest child your mother and i have as well considered the case you put as we are able and we think your own reasons very good and it is pity a thousand pities your honored husband will not allow them as you my dear make it such a point with you very few ladies would give their spouses we believe the trouble of this debate and few gentlemen are so very nice as yours in this respect for i but what signifies what such a mean soul as i think compared to so learned and brave a gentleman yet i always thought your dear mother and she has been a pretty woman too in her time never looked so lovely as when i saw the dear creature like the pelican in the wilderness feeding her young ones from her kind breast  and had i had ever so noble an estate i am sure i should have thought so  but since the good squire cannot take this pleasure since he so much values your person since he gives you warning that it may estrange his affections since he is impatient of denial and thinks so highly of his prerogative since he may if disobliged resume some bad habits and so you may have all your prayers and hopes in his perfect reformation frustrated and find your own power to do good more narrowd as i may say we think besides the obedience you have vowed to him and is the duty of every good wife you ought to give up the point and acquiesce for this seems to us to be the lesser evil and god almighty if it should be your duty will not be less merciful than men who as his honor says by the laws of the realm excuse a wife when she is faulty by the command of the husband and we hope the fault he is pleased to make you commit if a fault for he really gives very praiseworthy motives for his dispensation will not lie at his own door so even resolve my dearest child to submit to it and with cheerfulness too  god send you an happy hour but who knows when the time comes whether it may not be proper to dispense with this duty as you deem it on other accounts for every young person is not enabled to perform it so to show his honor that you will cheerfully acquiesce your dear mother advises that you would look out for a wholesome goodhumored honest body as near your complexion and temper and constitution as may be and it may not be the worse she thinks if she is twenty or one or twoandtwenty for she will have more strength and perfection as one may say than even you can have at your tender age and above all for the wife reason you give from your reading that she may be brought tobed much about your time if it be possible  we will look out if you please about us for such an one and as mr b is not averse to have the dear child in the house with you you will have as much delight and the dear baby may fare as well under your prudent and careful eye as if you were to be obliged in the way you would choose  so god direct you my dearest child in all your ways and make you acquiesce in this point with cheerfulness although as you say one cannot believe as one pleases for we verily are of opinion you safely may at matters stand and continue to you and your beloved and honored husband health and all manner of happiness are the prayers of  your most affectionate father and mother j and e andrews i have privately showed our worthy minister your letter you know my dear he is a learned and judicious gentleman and he is of our opinion that it is best for you on all accounts to acquiesce besides it may disoblige the squire and it will signify nothing after all for he will have his way that is sure enough    letter viii i thank you my dearest parents for your kind letter it was given to mr b and he brought it to me himself and was angry at me indeed he was as you shall hear  it is from the good couple my dear i see i hope they are of my opinion but whether they be or not  but i will leave you and do you pamela step down to my closet when you have perused it  he was pleased to withdraw and i read it and sat down and considered it well but as you know i made it always my maxim to do that i could not avoid to do with as good a grace as possible i waited on the dear gentleman  well pamela said he a little seriously what say the worthy pair  oh sir they declare for you they say it is best for me to yield up this point  they are certainly in the right  but were you not a dear little perverse slut to give me all this trouble about your saucy scruples  nay sir dont call them so said i little thinking he was displeased with me  i still am somewhat wavering though they advise me to acquiesce and as it is your will and you have determined how it shall be it is my duty to yield up the point  but do you yield it up cheerfully my dear   i do sir and will never more dispute it let what will happen  and i beg pardon for having so often entered into this subject with you  but you know sir if a bodys weakness of mind gives one scruples one should not yield implicitly till they are satisfied for that would look as if one gave you not the obedience of a free mind   you are very obliging just now my dear but i can tell you you had made me half serious yet i would not show it in compliment to your present circumstance for i did not expect that you would have thought any appeal necessary though to your father and mother in a point that i was determined upon as you must see every time we talked of it  this struck me all in a heap i looked down to the ground having no courage to look up to his face for fear i should behold his aspect as mortifying to me as his words but he took both my hands and drew me kindly to him and saluted me  excuse me my dearest love i am not angry with you  speak to me my dear  why drops this precious pearl and kissed my cheek  speak to me pamela   i will sir  i will  as soon as i can  for this being my first check so seriously given my heart was full but as i knew he would be angry and think me obstinate if i did not speak i said full of concern  i wish sir  i wish  you had been pleased to spare me longer a little longer for the same kind very kind consideration   but is it not better my dear to tell you i was a little out of humor than that i am  but you had been very earnest with me on this point more than once and you put me upon a hated because an ungenerous necessity of pleading my prerogative as i call it and yet this would not do but you would appeal against me in the point i was determined upon for reasons altogether generous and in your favor and if this was not like my pamela excuse me my dearest love that i could not help being a little unlike myself  ah thought i this is not so very unlike your dear self if i were to give the least shadow of an occasion for it is of a piece with your lessons formerly see vol ii p         etc   i am sure said i i was not in the least aware that i had offended  but i was too little circumspect i had been used to your goodness for so long a time that i expected it it seems and thought i was sure of your favorable construction  why so you may be my dear in every thing almost but i dont love to speak ibid p     twice my mind on the same subject you know i dont and you have really disputed this point with me five or six times insomuch that i wondered what was come to my dearest   i thought sir you would have distinguished between a command where my conscience was concerned and a common point you know sir i never had any will but yours in common points  but indeed you make me fearful because my task is rendered too difficult for my own weak judgment but then sir  but i shall offend again   and then what say all you would say pamela  and then what  why sir if i must speak  you threaten me so at every turn with that cruel word polygamy that it shows me it is too much in your mind  but i shall make you angry again  was not the patriarch husbands practice pamela a fit thing to be opposed to that of the patriarch wives but do you say i threaten you with that word take care my love you have been a faultless angel hitherto dont let me find you ready to make such harsh constructions as a mere woman is accustomed to make when she is disposed to be captious although a better construction lies before her  i was silent but by my tears  now i doubt pamela your spirit is high you will not speak because you are out of humor at what i say i will have no sullen reserves my dearest what means that heaving sob i know my dear love that this is a time with your sex when saddend with your apprehensions and indulged because of them by the fond husband it is needful for both their sakes to watch over the changes of their temper for ladies in your way are often like incroaching subjects they are apt to extend what they call their privileges on the indulgence showed them and the husband never again recovers the ascendant he had before  you know these things better than i mr b but i had no intention to invade your province or go out of my own yet i thought i had a right to a little free will a very little especially on some greater occasions  why so you have my dear but you must not plead one text of scripture in behalf of your own will and refuse to another its due weight when it makes for mine  well sir i must needs say i have one advantage above others of my sex for if wives in my circumstance are apt to grow upon indulgence i am very happy that your kind and watchful care will hinder me from falling into that danger  he gave me a kind tap on the neck let me beat my beloved sawcebox said he is it thus you railly my watchful care over you for your own good but tell me truly pamela are you not a little sullen look up to me my dear  are you not  i believe i am but it is but a very little sir  it will soon go off  please to let me withdraw that i may take myself to task about it  for at present i know not what to do because i did not expect the displeasure i have incurred  is it not the same thing replied he if this our first quarrel end here without your withdrawing  i forgive you heartily my pamela and give me one kiss and i will think of your saucy appeal against me no more  i will comply with your conditions dear sir but i have a great mind to be saucy i wish you would let me for this once  what would you say my dearest be saucy then as you call it as saucy as you can  why then sir i am a little sullen at present that i am  and i am not fully convinced whether it must be i that forgive you or you me  for indeed till i can recollect i cannot think my fault so great in this point that was a point of conscience to me as pardon me sir to stand in need of your forgiveness  well then my dearest said he clasping his kind arms about me we will forgive another but take this with you that it is my love to you that makes me more delicate than otherwise i should be and you have inured me so much to a faultless conduct that i can hardly bear with natural infirmities from you  but giving me another tap get you gone i leave you to your recollection and let me know what fruits it produces for i must not be put off with a halfcompliance i must have your whole will with me if possible  so i went up and recollecting every thing sacrificed to my sex as mr b calls it when he talks of a wifes reluctance to give up a favorite point for i shed a good many tears because my heart was set upon it and this patriarchal retort hung heavy upon my mind  and so my dear father and mother twenty charming ideas and pleasures which i had formed to myself had i obtained this permission are vanished from me and my measures are quite broken but after my heart was relieved by my eye i was lighter and easier and the result is we have heard of a good sort of body that is to be my poor babys mother when it comes and so your kindlyofferd inquiries are needless i believe  i cannot tell but this sort of rebuff might be a little necessary after all for i had forgotten through mr bs past indulgence for so long a time his injunctions and lessons see vol ii p     etc before cited  and this awfullyinforced remembrance shows me that the rules he formerly prescribed were not words of course but that he intended to keep me up to the letter of them  so i must be a little more circumspect i find that then of late i thought i had occasion to be  but he is the best and tenderest of husbands for all this and yet i was forced to accept of his forgiveness and he did not think himself obliged to me for mine and has carried his point all to nothing as the racing gentlemen say but i can see one thing nevertheless on this occasion that the words command and obey are not quite blotted out of his vocabulary as he said they should be see vol ii p       but truly i did not imagine before that the husband had so very extensive a prerogative neither  nor do i believe that many ladies would sit down so satisfied with it as i am forced to do  yet he vows that it must have been so had he married a princess  and that it is not because of the former inequality of condition between us  i cannot tell what to say to that but i fansy there would then have been some princely struggles between them had it been so  it may be if he could not have conquered he would not have lived with her or perhaps would have run into his wicked polygamy notions  mr b to my further great comfort has just been telling me how little a wife of his must expect from her tears and his most nicely been distinguishing between tears of sullenness and tears of penitence the one he declares shall always meet with his indulgence and kindness and never pass unrewarded but the other being the last resources of the sex after they are disarmed of all others and by which they too often as he says carry all their purposes he will never suffer to have any force at all upon him  very heroic truly  one stands a poor chance in a contest with such an husband  it must be all pure unmixed obedience and submission and i find half the tears a poor wife might shed in matrimonial bickerings so frequent with some even of those not unhappily married as the world goes would be of no effect were all men of his mind  it is well for our sex in general that there are not many gentlemen who distinguish thus nicely for i doubt there are but very few so well entitled to their ladies observances as mr b is and who would act so generously and so tenderly by a wife as he does in every material instance on which the happiness of life depends  but we are quite reconciled atho as i said upon his own terms and so i can still style myself  my dear honored parents your happy as well as dutiful daughter p b  letter ix from lady davers to mrs b my dear pamela i have sent you a present the completest i could procure of every thing that may suit your approaching happy circumstance as i hope it will be to you and to us all but it is with a hope annexed that although both sexes are thought of in it yet that you will not put us off with a girl no child we will not permit may we have our wills that you shall think of giving us a girl till you have presented us with half a dozen fine boys for our line is gone so low that we expect that human security from you in your first seven years or we shall be disappointed i can tell you that  and now pamela i will give you their names if my brother and you approve of them your first shall be billy my lord davers and the earl of c  shall be godfathers and it must be doubly godmotherd too or i am afraid the countess and i shall fall out about it your second shall be davers besure remember that  your third shall be charley your fourth jemmy your fifth harry your sixth  dudley if you will  and your girl if you had not rather call it pamela shall be barbara  the rest you must name as you please  and so my dear i wish all seven happily over with you  i am glad you got safe to town and long to hear of miss darnfords arrival because i know you will be out of your biass in your new settlement till then she is a fine lady and writes the most to my taste of any one of her sex that i know next to you i wish she would be so kind to correspond with me but besure dont omit to give me the sequel of her sister and murrays affair and what you think will please me in relation to her you do well to save yourself the trouble of describing the town and the public places we are no strangers to them and they are too much our tabletalk when any country lady has for the first time been carried to town and returned besides what london affords is nothing that deserves mention compared to what we have seen at paris and at versailles and other of the french palaces you exactly therefore hit our tastes and answer our expectations when you give us in your peculiar manner sentiments on what we may call the soul of things and such characters as you draw with a pencil borrowed from the hand of nature intermingled with those fine lights and shades of reflections and observations that make your pictures glow and instruct as well as inform  there pamela is encouragement for you to proceed in obliging us we are all of one mind in this respect and more than ever since we have seen your actions so well answer to your writings and that theory and practice with regard to every excellence that can adorn a lady is the same thing with you  we are pleased with your lawyers characters there are life and nature in them but never avoid giving all the characters that occur to you for that seems to be one of your talents and in the ugliest you can draw there will be matter of instruction especially as you seem naturally to fall upon such as are so general that no one who converses but must see in them the picture of one or other he is acquainted with  by this time perhaps miss darnford will be with you  our respects to her if so  and you will have been at some of the theatrical entertainments so will not want subjects to oblige us  twas a good thought of your dear mans to carry you to see the several houses and to make you a judge by that means of the disposition and fashion of every thing in them tell him i love him better and better i am proud of my brother and do nothing but talk of what a charming husband he makes but then he gives an example to all who know him and his uncontrouled temper which makes against many of us that it is possible for a good wife to make even a bad man a worthy husband and this affords an instruction which may stand all our sex in good stead  but then they must have been cautious first that they have chosen a man of natural good sense and good manners and not a brutal or abandoned debauchee  but harkyeme my sweet girl what have i done to you that you will not write yourself sister to me i could find in my heart to be angry with you on this account before my last visit indeed i was scrupulous to subscribe myself so to you but since i have seen myself so much surpassed in all manner of excellence that i would take pleasure in the name you assume a pride in your turn and think it an undervaluing of yourself i suppose to call me so  ay that is the thing i doubt  although i can tell you i have endeavored by several regulations since my return and the countess too keeps your example in distant view as well as i to be more worthy of the appellation if therefore you would avoid the reproaches of secret pride under the shadow of so remarkable an humility for the future never omit subscribing as i do with great pleasure  your truly affectionate sister and friend b davers i always take it for granted that my worthy brother sends his respects to us as you must that lord davers the good countess and jackey who as well as his uncle talks of nothing else but you send theirs and so unnecessary compliment will be always excluded our correspondence    letter x in answer to the preceding how you overwhelm me with your goodness my dearest lady in every word of your last welcome letter is beyond my power to express how nobly has your lady contrived in your evervalud present to encourage a doubting and apprehensive mind and how does it contribute to my joy and my glory that i am deemed by the noble sister of my best beloved not wholly unworthy of being the humble means to continue and perhaps to perpetuate a family so ancient and so honorable   this madam when i contemplate and look upon what i was  what can i say  how shall i express the sense of the honor done me  and when skipping over for a few moments the other engaging particulars in your ladyships letter i come to the last charming paragraph i am doubly affected to see myself seemingly upbraided but so politely imboldend to assume an appellation that otherwise i hardly dared to assume  i  humble i  who never had a sister before  to find one now in lady davers o madam you and only you can teach me words fit to express the joy and the gratitude that fill my delighted heart  but thus much i am taught and thus much i can say though at a loss for other words that there is something more than the lowborn can imagine in birth and education this is so evident in your ladys actions words and manner that it strikes one with a becoming reverence and we look up with awe to a condition we emulate in vain when raised by partial favor like what i have found and are confounded when we see grandeur of soul joined with grandeur of birth and condition and a noble lady acting thus nobly as lady davers acts  my best wishes and a thousand blessings attend your ladyship in all you undertake and i am persuaded the latter will and a peace and satisfaction of mind incomparably to be preferred to whatever else this world can afford in the new regulations which you and my dear lady countess have set on foot in your families and when i can have the happiness to know what they are i shall i am confident greatly improve my own methods by them were we to live for ever in this life we might be careless and indifferent about these matters but when such an uncertainty as to the time and such a certainty as to the event is before us a prudent mind will be always preparing till prepared and what can be a better preparative than charitable actions to our fellow creatures in the eye of that majesty which wants nothing of us himself but to do just and merciful things to one another pardon me my dearest lady for this my free style methinks i am out of myself i know not how to descend all at once from the height to which you have raised me and you must forgive the reflections to which you yourself and your own noble actions have given birth  here having taken respite a little i find i naturally enough sink into body again  and will not your ladyship confine your expectations from me within narrower limits  i hope you will  for oh my excellent lady i cannot even with my wishes so swiftly follow your expectations if such they are but however leaving futurity to him who only can govern futurity and who conducts us all and our affairs as shall best answer his own divine purposes i will proceed as well as i can to obey your ladyship in those articles which are at present more within my own power  my dear miss darnford then let me acquaint your ladyship arrived here on thursday last she had given us notice by a line of the day she set out and sir simon and lady darnford saw her ten miles on the way to the stagecoach in sir simons coach mr murray attending her on horseback they parted with her as was easy to guess from her merit with great tenderness and we are to look upon the visit as we do as a high favor from her papa and mamma who however charge her not to exceed a month in and out which i regret much mr b kindly proposed to me as miss came in the stagecoach attended with one maidservant to meet her part of the way in his coach and six if as he was pleased to say it would not be too fatiguing to me and we would go so early as to dine at st albans i gladly consented and we got thither about one oclock attended by mr colbrand abraham and john and while dinner was preparing he was pleased to show me the great church there and the curious vault of the good duke of gloucester and also the monument of the great lord chancellor bacon in st michaels church all which no doubt your ladyship has seen  there happened to be six passengers in the stagecoach and miss was exceedingly glad to be relieved from them though the weather was cold enough two of the passengers being not very agreeable company one a rough military man the other a positive humoursome old gentlewoman and the other two not such as she had reason to regret parting with two sisters who jangled nowandthen said miss as much as my sister and my sisters sister  your ladyship will judge how joyful this meeting was to miss and to me mr b was no less delighted and said he was infinitely obliged to sir simon for this precious trust  miss said i came with double pleasure to see the greatest curiosity in england an husband and a wife who have not in so many months that you have been married if i may believe report and your letters mrs b once repented you are severe miss said mr b upon people in the married state i hope there are many such instances  there might said she if there were more such husbands as mr b makes  oh you are a charming man  i hated you once and i thought you very wicked but i revere you now  if you will revere any body my dear miss said he let it be this good girl for it is all owing to her conduct and discretion that i make a tolerable husband were there more such wives i am persuaded there would be more such husbands than there are  you see my dear miss said i what it is to be wedded to a generous mind mr b by his noble treatment of me creates a merit in me and disclaims the natural effects of his own goodness  well youre a charming couple  person and mind i know not any equal either of you have  but mr b i will not compliment you too highly i may make you proud for men are saucy creatures but i cannot make your lady so and in this doubt of the one and confidence in the other i must join with you that her merit is the greatest  since excuse me bold gentleman as i know you have been her example has reformed her rake and you have only confirmed in her the virtues you found ready formed to your hand  that distinction said mr b is worthy of miss darnfords judgment  my dearest miss my dearest mr b said i taking each by the hand how can you go on thus  as i look upon every kind thing two such dear friends say to me as incentives for me to endeavor to deserve them you must not task me too high for then instead of encouraging you will give me despair  the dear gentleman clasped us both in his arms and saluted each  and called us his two nonpareils  he led us into the coach placing miss and me on the frontseat and himself on the other with misss maidservant a genteel prudent young body whom her lady would fain have left in the stage to avoid the honor of sitting with mr b and in a free easy joyful manner not in the least tired or fatigued did we reach the town and mr bs house with which and its furniture and the apartments allotted for her miss is highly pleased  but the dear lady put me into some little confusion when she saw me first taking notice of my improvements as she called them before mr b i looked at him and looked at her  dear miss said i with a blushing cheek and downcast eye he smiled at miss and said would you my good miss look so silly after such a length of time with an husband you had no occasion to be ashamed of  no indeed sir not i i will assure you nor will i forgive those maiden airs in a wife so happy as you are i said nothing but i wished myself in mind and behavior to be just what miss darnford is  but my dear lady miss darnford has had those early advantages from conversation which i had not and so i must never expect to know how to deport myself with that modest freedom and ease which although some of my favorers attribute to me yet i know i want and shall always want for i am every day more and more sensible of the great difference there is in being used to the politest conversation as an inferior and in being born to bear a part in it in the one all is set stiff awkward and the person just such an ape of imitation as poor i in the other all is natural ease and sweetness  like miss darnford   knowing this i dont indeed aim at what i am sensible i cannot attain and so i hope am less exposed to ridicule than i should be if i did for i have heard mr b observe with regard to gentlemen who build fine houses and make fine gardens and open fine prospects that art should never take place of but be subservient to nature and a gentleman if he is confined to a situation had better conform his designs to that than to do as at chatsworth was done that is to say level a mountain at a monstrous expense which had it been suffered to remain in so wild and romantic a scene as chatsworth affords might have been made one of the greatest beauties of the place  so i madam think i had better endeavor to make the best of those natural defects i cannot master than by assuming airs and dignities in appearance to which i was not born act neither part tolerably by this means instead of being thought neither gentlewoman nor rustic as sir jacob hinted  linseywolsey i think was his term too i may be looked upon as an original in my way and all originals pass muster well enough you know madam even with judges  now i am upon this subject i can form to myself if your ladyship will excuse me two such polite gentlemen as my lawyers mentioned in my former who with a true london magnanimity and penetration  for madam i fansy your london critics will be the severest upon the country girl will put on mighty significant looks forgetting maybe they have any faults themselves and apprehending they have nothing to do but to sit in judgment upon others expressing themselves after this manner why truly jack the girl is well enough  considering  i cannot say  then a pinch of snuff perhaps adds importance to their air but a man might love her for a month or two these sparks talked in this manner of other ladies before me  she behaves better than i expected from her  considering  again will follow  so i think cries the other and tosses his tie behind him with an air partly of contempt and partly of rakery  as you say jemmy i expected to find an awkward country girl but she tops her part i will assure ye  nay for that matter behaves very tolerably for what she was  and is right not to seem desirous to drown the remembrance of her original in her elevation  and i cannot but say  for something like it they did say is mighty pretty and passably genteel and thus with their poor praise of mr bs girl they think they have made a fine compliment to his judgment  but for his sake  for as to my own i am not solicitous about such gentlemens good opinions i owe them a spite and believe i shall find an opportunity to come out of their debt for i have the vanity to think now your ladyship has made me proud by your kind encouragements and approbation that the country girl will make em look about em with all their genteel contempts which they miscal praise  but how i run on your ladyship expects me to write as freely as i used to do to my parents i have the merit of obeying you that i have but i doubt too much to the exercise of your patience this like all mine is a long letter and i will only add to it miss darnfords humble respects and thanks for your ladyships kind mention of her which she receives as no small honor  and now madam with a greater pleasure than i can express will i make use of the liberty your ladyship so kindly allows me to take of subscribing myself with that profound respect which becomes me  your ladyships most obliged sister and servant p b mr adams mr longman and mrs jervis are just arrived and our household is now complete    letter xi from lady davers to mrs b my dear pamela after i have thanked you for your last agreeable letter which has added the earl and lord john and lady jenny to the number of your admirers you know lady betty their sister was so before i shall tell you that i now write at all their requests as well as at those of my lord davers the countess you so dearly love and lady betty for your decision of an odd dispute that on reading your letter and talking of your domestic excellencies happened among us  lady betty would have it that notwithstanding any aukwardness which you attribute to yourself she cannot but decide by all she has seen of you and has heard us say that yours is the perfectest character she ever heard or read of  the countess said that you wrong yourself in supposing that you are not every thing that is polite and genteel in your behavior as well as person and that she knows not any lady in england who better becomes her station than you do  why then said lady jenny mrs b must be quite perfect that is certain so said her brother lord john so said the earl their father so said they all and lord davers confirmed that you were and jackey swore to it  yet as we are sure there cannot be such a character in this life as has not one fault although we could not tell where to fix it the countess started a whimsical motion  lady davers said she pray do you write to mrs b and acquaint her with our subject and as it is impossible that one who can act as she does should not know herself better than any body else can do desire her to acquaint us with some of those secret foibles that leave room for her to be still more perfect  a good thought said i a good thought said they all  and this is the present occasion of my writing and pray see that you accuse yourself of no more than you know yourself guilty for overmodesty borders so nearly on pride and too liberal accusations seem to be but so many traps for acquittal with applause that you whatever other ladies might will not be forgiven if you deal with us in a way so poorly artful let them therefore be such faults as you think we can subscribe to from what we have seen of you and read of yours and you must try to extenuate them too as you give them lest we should think you above that nature which in the most and best cases is your undoubted talent  i congratulate you and miss darnford on her arrival she is a charming young lady but tell her that we shall not allow her to take you at your word and to think that she excels you in any one thing only indeed we think you nicer in some points than you need to be as to your present agreeable circumstance and yet let me tell you that the easy and unaffected conjugal purity in word and behavior between your good man and you is worthy of imitation and what the countess and i have with pleasure contemplated since we left you an hundred times and admire in you both and it is good policy too child as well as high decorum for it is what will make you ever new and respectful to one another  but you have the honor of it all whose sweet natural and easy modesty in person behavior and conversation forbid indecency even in thought much more in word to approach you insomuch that no rakes can be rakes in your presence and yet they hardly know to what they owe their restraint  however as people who see you will take it for granted that you and mr b have been very intimate together i should think you need not be ashamed of your appearance because as he rightly observes you have no reason to be ashamed of your husband  excuse my pleasantry my dear and answer our demand upon you as soon as you can which will oblige us all particularly  your affectionate sister b davers  letter xii my dearest lady what a task have you imposed upon me and according to the terms you annex to it how shall i acquit myself of it without incurring the censure of affectation if i freely accuse myself as i may deserve or of vanity if i do not indeed madam i have a great many failings and you dont know the labor it costs me to keep them under not so much for fear the world should see them for i bless god i can hope they are not capital as for fear they should become capital if i were to let them grow upon me  and this surely i need not have told your ladyship and my lady countess who have read my papers and seen my behavior in the kind visit you made to your dear brother and had from both but too much reason to censure me did not your generous and partial favor make you overlook my greater failings and pass under a kinder name many of my lesser for surely my good ladies you must both of you have observed in what you have read and seen that i am naturally of a spiteful saucy temper and with all my appearing meekness and humility can resent and sting too when i think myself provoked  i have also discovered in myself on many occasions of some of which i will byandby remind your ladyship a malignancy of heart that it is true lasts but a little while  not had it need  but for which i have often called myself to account  to very little purpose hitherto  and indeed madam now for a little extrenuation as you expect from me i have some difficulty whether i ought in the station to which i am raised to take much pains to subdue myself in some instances that otherwise it would have become me to attempt to do for it is no easy task for a person in my circumstances to distinguish between the ought and the ought not to be humble without meannes and decent without arrogance and let me add that if every body thought as justly as i flatter myself i do of the inconveniences as well as conveniences which attend the being raised to a condition above them they would not imagine all the world was their own when they come to be distinguished as i have been for what with the contempts of superior relations on one side which all such must undergo at first the envy of the world and low reflections arising from that envy on the other from which no one must hope to be totally exempted and the aukwardness besides with which they support their elevated condition if they have sense to judge of their own imperfections and if the gentleman be not such an one as mine  and where will such another be found  on all these accounts i say they will be made sensible that whatever they might once think happiness and an high estate are two very different things  but i shall be too grave when your ladyship and all my kind and noble friends expect perhaps i should give the uncommon subject a pleasanter air yet what must that mind be that is not serious when it is obliged to recollect and give account of its defects  but i must not only accuse myself it seems i must give proofs such as your ladyship can subscribe to of my imperfections there is so much real kindness implied in this seeming hardship that i will obey you madam and produce proofs in a moment which cannot be controverted  let me then in the first place as to the selfaccusation of spitefulness refer your ladyship and those of my noble friends who have read my papers to the character i gave in them of poor mrs jewkes see vol i p      also to honest mr colbrands character as i gave it when i suspected he was to be employed for the worst purposes ibid p   0  both of which though not untrue in the main are so drawn as to show a very spiteful nature in the characterizer  and as to my sauciness those papers will give an hundred instances against me  as well to your dear brother as to others  indeed to extenuate as you command me as i go along these were mostly when i was apprehensive for my honor that they were  and then my dear lady i have a little tincture of jealousy which sometimes has made me more uneasy than i ought to be as the papers you have not seen would have demonstrated particularly in miss godfreys case see vol ii p     etc  and in my conversation with your ladyships in which i have frequently betrayed my apprehensions of what might happen when we came to london yet to extenuate again i have examined myself very strictly on this head and i really think that i can ascribe a great part of this jealousy to laudable motives no less than the concern i have for your dear brothers future happiness in the hope that i may be an humble means in the hands of providence to induce him to abhor those crimes in which young gentlemen too often indulge themselves and to bring him over to the practice of those virtues in which he will for ever have cause to rejoice  yet my lady some other parts of the charge must stand against me for as to be sure i love his person as well as his mind i have pride in my jealousy that would nor permit me i verily think to support myself as i ought under the trial of a competition in this tender very tender point  and this obliges me to own that i have a little  not a little perhaps  spark of secret pride and vanity that will arise nowandthen on the honors done me but which i keep under as much as i can and to this pride let me tell your ladyship i know no one contributes or can contribute more largely than yourself  so you see my dear lady what a naughty heart i have and how far i am from being a faultless creature  i hope i shall be better and better however as i live longer and have more grace and more wit for here to recapitulate my faults is in the first place vindictiveness i will not call it downright revenge that i will not  for as the poet says revenge is but a frailty incident to crazed and sickly minds the poor content of little souls unable to surmount an injury too weak to bear affront and i would not be thought to have a little mind because i know i would not do a little thing vindictiveness then let it stand though that is a harsh word to accuse ones self of  spitefulness  jealousy  secret pride  vanity  which i cannot for my life keep totally under  o dear madam are not here faults enough without naming any more  and how much room do all these leave for amendment and greater perfection  had your ladyship and my lady countess favored us longer in your late kind visit it had been impossible but i must have improved every day by your delightful conversations so as to have got over such of these foibles as are not rooted in nature for to behold that natural ease and dignity which accompany every thing your ladyships do and say must have made me more than emulate those perfections which at present i can only at an awful distance revere as becomes  my dear ladies your most humble admirer and obliged servant p b  letter xiii from miss darnford to her father and mother my everhonoured papa and mamma i arrived safely in london on thursday after a tolerable journey considering deb and i made six in the coach two having been taken up on the way after you left me and none of the six highly agreeable mr b and his lady who looks very stately upon us from the circumstance of person rather than of mind however were so good as to meet me at st albans in their coach and six they have a fine house here richly furnished in every part and allotted me the best apartments in it  we are happy beyond expression mr b is a charming husband so easy so pleased with and so tender of his lady and she so much all that we saw her in the country as to humility and affability and improved in every thing else which we hardly thought possible she could be  that i never knew so happy a matrimony  all that prerogative sauciness which we apprehended would so eminently display itself in his behavior to his lady had she been ever so distinguished by birth and fortune is vanished and no traces of it left i did not think it was in the power of an angel if our sex could have produced one to have made so tender and so fond an husband of mr b as he makes and should i have the sense to follow mrs bs example if ever i marry i should not despair of making myself happy let it be to whom it would provided he was not a brute nor sordid in his temper which two characters are too obvious to be concealed if persons take due care and make proper inquiries and if they are not led by blind passion may mr murray and miss nancy make just such an happy pair  you commanded me my honored mamma to write to you an account of every thing that pleased me  i said i would but what a task should i then have  i did not think i had undertaken to write volumes  you must therefore allow me to be more brief than i had intended  in the first place it would take up five or six long letters to do justice to the economy observed in this happy family you know and we have often admired and applauded her for it that mrs b has not changed one of the servants of the family and only added her polly to the number this is an unexampled thing especially as they were all her fellow servants as we may say but since they have the sense to admire so good an example and are proud to follow it each to his and her power i think it one of her peculiar felicities to have continued them and to choose to reform such as were exceptionable rather than dismiss them  their mouths deb tells me are continually full of their ladys praises and prayers and blessings uttered with such delight and fervor for the happy pair that it makes her eyes she says ready to run over to hear them  moreover i think it an extraordinary piece of policy whether designed or not to keep them as they were honest and worthy folks for had she turned them all off what had she done but made as many enemies as persons and as many more as those persons had friends and acquaintance and we all know how much the reputation of families lies at the mercy of servants and it is easy to guess to what cause each would have imputed their dismission and so she has escaped as she ought to escape the character of pride and has made every one instead of reproaching her with her descent find those graces in her which turn that very disadvantage to her glory  she is exceeding affable to every one of them always speaks to them with a smile but yet has such a dignity in her manner that it secures her their respect and reverence and they are ready to fly at a look and seem proud to have any commands of hers to execute insomuch that the words my lady commands so or so from one servant to another are sure to meet with an indisputable obedience be the duty required what it will  if any one of them is the least out of order her care and tenderness for them engage the duty and the veneration and gratitude of all the rest who see in that instance how kindly they will be treated should they ail any thing themselves and in all this i must needs say she is very happy in mrs jervis who is an excellent second to her admirable lady and is treated by her with as much respect and affection as if she was her mother  you may remember madam that in the account she gave us of her benevolent round as lady davers calls it she says that as she was going to london she should leave directions with mrs jervis about some of her clients as i find she calls her poor to avoid a word that her delicacy accounts harsh with regard to them and ostentatious with respect to herself i asked her how since contrary to her then design mrs jervis was permitted to be in town with her she had provided to answer her intention as to those her clients whom she had referred to the care of that good woman  she said that mr barlow her apothecary was a very worthy man and she had given him a plenary power in that particular and likewise desired him to recommend any new and worthy case to her that no distressful circumstance among the deserving and destitute sick poor might be unrelievd by reason of her absence  and here in london she has applied herself to dr  her parishminister a fine preacher and sound divine who promises at all opportunities to pay his respects to mr b to recommend to her any poor housekeepers who will be glad to accept of some private benefactions and yet having lived creditably till reduced by misfortunes are ashamed to apply for public relief and she has several of these already on her benevolent list to some of whom she sends coals now on the entrance of the wintry season to some a piece of irish or scottish linen or so many yards of norwich stuff for gowns and coats for girls or yorkshire cloth for the boys and to some of whose prudence she is most assured in laying it out in the way they best can judge of money and she has moreover mortified as the scots call it   0 l as a fund for loans without interest of    0 or    but not exceeding  0 l to answer some present exigence in some worthy families who find the best security they can to repay it in a given time and this fund she purposes as she grows richer she says to increase and prides herself every nowandthen upon her frugality to have saved so much money already and estimates pleasantly her worth by this sum saying sometimes who would ever have thought i should have been worth   0 l already i shall be a rich body in time but in all these things she injoins secrecy which the doctor has promised  she told the doctor what mr adamss office was in her family and hoped she said he would give her his sanction to it assuring him that she thought it her duty to ask it as she was one of his flock and he on that account her principal shepherd which made a spiritual relation between them the requisites of which on her part were not to be dispensed with you may be sure the good gentleman very cheerfully and applaudingly gave her his consent and when she told him how well mr adams was provided for and that she should apply to him to supply her with a townchaplain when she was deprived of him he wished that the other duties of his function for he has a large parish would permit him to be the happy person himself saying that till she was supplied to her mind either he or his curate would take care that so laudable a method should be kept up  you will do me the justice madam to believe that i very cheerfully join in my dear friends sunday duties and am not a little edified with the good example and with the seriousness harmony and good will that this lovely method contributes to keep up in the family  i must own i never saw such a family of love in my life for here under the eye of the best and most respected of mistresses they twice every sunday see one another all together as in the country in a body superior as well as inferior servants and deb tells me after mrs b and i are withdrawn there are such friendly salutations among them that she never heard the like  your servant good master longman your servant master colbrand cries one and another how do you john i am glad to see you abraham  all blessedly met once more cries jonathan the venerable butler with his silver hairs as mrs b always distinguishes him good madam jervis cries another you look purely this blessed day thank god  and they return to their several vocations so light so easy so pleased so eventemperd in their minds as their cheerful countenances as well as expressions testify that it is an heaven of an house and being wound up thus constantly once a week like a good eightday clock no piece of machinery that ever was made is so regular and uniform as this family is  what an example does this dear lady set to all who see her to all who know her and to all who hear of her and have the grace to imitate her  what a public blessing would such a mind as hers be could it be vested with the robes of royalty and adorn the sovereign dignity  but what are the princes of the earth look at them in every nation and what have they been for ages past compared to this lady who acts from the impulses of her own heart unaided by any human example and how can one avoid thinking of inspiration in this case or that she was dropped down when the creating mind was forming angels forgive the enthusiasm which the contemplation of her innumerable excellencies raises to be received into bodily organs and to live among men and women in order to show what the first of the species was designed to be  this reminds me of what my honored papa said once at our own house to mr b see vol ii p     that there was but one such angel descended from heaven in a thousand years and he had got her  and yet here is the admiration that one sees all these duties performed in such an easy and pleasant manner as any body may perform them for they interfere not with any parts of the family management take up no time from the most necessary employments but rather aid and inspirit every one in the discharge of all their domestic services and moreover keep their minds in a state of preparation for the more solemn duties of the day and all without the least intermixture of affectation enthusiasm or ostentation o my dear papa and mamma permit me but to tarry here till i am perfect in all these good lessons and how happy shall i be  i am mindful my dear mamma of yours and our good neighbors requests to mrs b to oblige you with the conversations she mentioned the one with the young ladies related to mrs towers and mrs arthur the other with mr b on her father and mother a subject which always however humble raises her admired pen and of consequence our expectations and i will prevail upon her to let me transcribe them for your entertainment she writes down every thing that passes which she thinks may one day be of use to miss goodwin and to her own children if she shall live to have any and to see them grown up what a charming mamma as well as wife and mistress will this dear lady make  as to the town and the diversions of it i shall not trouble you with any accounts of them because you know the one and from the time we passed here last winter as well as your former thorough knowledge of both you will want no information about the other for generally speaking all who reside constantly in london allow that there is little other difference in the diversions of one winter and another than such as are in clothes a few variations of the fashions only which are mostly owing to the ingenious contrivances of persons who are to get their bread by diversifying them  mrs b has undertaken to give lady davers an account of matters as they pass and her sentiments on what she sees there must be something new in her observations because she is a stranger to these diversions and unbiassed entirely by favor or prejudice and so will not play the partial critic but give to a beauty its due praise and to a fault its due censure according to that truth and nature which are the unerring guides of her actions as well as sentiments these i will procure for you as she gives me leave to transcribe what she writes and you will be so good as to return them when perused because i will lend them as i used to do her letters to her good parents and so i shall give her a pleasure at the same time in the accommodating them with the knowledge of all that passes which she makes it a point of duty to do because they take delight in her writings  my papas observation that a woman never takes a journey that she dont forget something is justified by me for with all my care i have forgot my diamond buckle which miss nancy will find in the inner till of my bureau wrapped up in cotton and i beg it may be sent me by the first opportunity with my humble duty to you both my dear indulgent papa and mamma thanks for the favor i now rejoice in and affectionate respects to miss nancy i wish she would love me as well as i love her and service to mr murray and all our good neighbors conclude me  your dutiful and highly favored daughter m darnford mr b and mrs b desire their compliments of congratulation to mr and mrs peters on the happy marriage of their worthy niece which they knew nothing of till i told them of it also to your honored selves they desire their kind respects and thanks for the loan of your worthless daughter  i experience every hour some new token of their politeness and affection and i make no scruple to think i am with just such a brother and such a sister as any happy creature may rejoice in and be proud of  mr b i cannot but repeat is a charming husband and a most polite gentleman his lady is always accusing herself to me of aukwardness and insufficiency but not a soul who sees her can find it out she is all genteel ease and the admiration of every one who beholds her  only i tell her with such happiness in possession she is a little of the gravest sometimes     the letter which contains the account of the conversation requested by miss darnford p   of this volume and promised by mrs b p    and mentioned by miss in the preceding letter will be found the last letter but one of this volume for miss darnford having mislaid the first copy of it requested another two or three years after this when married herself for the sake of two young ladies in her neighborhood whose inconsiderate rashness had given great affliction to their honorable parents and mrs b with a view to their particular case having made diverse additions and improvements to it it will come in more properly as we conceive in the course of these letters at or near the time when those improvements were made to it  letter xiv from mrs b to lady davers my good lady you command me to acquaint you with the proceedings between mr murray and miss nanny darnford and miss polly makes it very easy for me to obey you in this particular and in very few words for she says every thing was adjusted before she came away and the ceremony she believes may be performed by this time she rejoices that she was out of the way of it for she says love is so awkward a thing to mr murray and good humor so uncommon an one to miss nancy that she hopes she shall never see such another courtship  mr b teizes miss that she is a little piqud and that she showed it by a satirical fling or two in a former letter to me that her humble servant took her at her word and yet he acknowleges that he believes she despises him as by his conduct he has shown that he deserves to be despised by her  she says nothing has piqud her in the whole affair but the triumph it gave to that illnatured girl as she justly calls her sister who has insulted her unmercifully on that account and yet with so low and mean a spite that she has been vexed at herself to show the least concern on the occasion but ungenerous teizing is an intolerable thing as she says and often repeated will vex a mind naturally above it had it says she come from any body else i should not have heeded it but how can one despise a sister  we have been at the playhouse several times and give me leave to say madam for i have now read as well as seen several that i think the stage by proper regulations might be made a profitable amusement but nothing more convinces one than these representations of the truth of the common observation that the best things corrupted may prove the worst the terror and compunction for evil deeds the compassion for a just distress and the general beneficence which those lively exhibitions are so capable of raising in the human mind may be of great service when directed to right ends and induced by proper motives where the actions which the catastrophe is designed to punish are not set in such advantageous lights as shall destroy the end of the moral and make the vice that ought to be censured imitable where the distress arises from proper motives where instruction is kept in view all the way and vice is punished and virtue rewarded  but give me leave to say that i think there is hardly one play i have seen or read hitherto but has too much of love in it as that passion is generally treated how unnatural in some how inflameing in others are the descriptions of it  in most rather rant and fury like the loves of the fiercer brute animals as virgil translated by dryden describes them than the soft sighing fearfullyhopeful murmurs that swell the bosoms of our gentler sex and the respectful timorous submissive complainings of the other when the truth of the passion humanizes as one may say their more rugged hearts  in particular my dear lady what strange indelicates do these writers of tragedy often make of our sex they dont enter into the passion at all if i have any notion of it but when the authors want to paint it strongly such as in those plays i have seen and read their aim seems to be to raise a whirlwind as i may say which sweeps down reason religion and decency and carries every laudable duty away before it so that all the example can serve to show is how a disappointed lover may rage and storm resent and revenge  the play i first saw was the tragedy of the distressed mother and a great many beautiful things i think there are in it but half of it is a tempestuous cruel ungoverned rant of passion and ends in cruelty bloodshed and desolation which the truth of story not warranting as mr b tells me makes it the more pity that the original author for it is a french play translated you know madam had not conducted it since it was in his choice with less terror and with greater propriety to the passions intended and actually raised in many places  i need not tell your ladyship what the story is and yet it is necessary as you demand my opinion that i should give a little sketch of it it is this then  pyrrhus the son of achilles is betrothed to hermione the daughter of menelaus but hectors widow andromache with astyanax her son by hector in the division of the trojan captives falls to the lot of pyrrhus who slighting hermione actually sent to his court and in his court waiting his good pleasure to espouse her falls in love with andromache orestes the son of agamemnon in love with hermione is sent ambassador from the other greek princes to demand the life of astyanax for fear the poor infant should become another hector and avenge his fathers death a most improbable unprincely and basehearted fear as pyrrhus himself represents it pyrrhus in hopes to gain the mothers love which he seeks on honorable terms offers to break with all his allies rather than give up the child but finding her resolved on widowhood determines to sacrifice the child and to marry hermione this creates a fine distress in andromache between a laudable purpose to continue the widow of so great and so deserving a prince and her desire to preserve the life of her son by that beloved hero and at last overcome by maternal tenderness finding no other way she resolves to marry pyrrhus and yet to destroy herself after the marriage ceremony had entitled her son to her new husbands protection a very strange and not very certain expedient to answer her view and so to die the widow of hector though she gave her hand to pyrrhus and vowed herself his at the altar and of consequence had a still less power over her own life than before  hermione a highspirited lady raging in her love to pyrrhus and for the slight and disappointment she met with obliges orestes on promise of giving her heart and hand to him to murder pyrrhus at the altar while the ceremony of marriage with andromache was performing he causes this to be done when done he applies to hermione expecting her applause who then violently upbraids him for having obeyed her and flying toward the temple meets the body of pyrrhus and stabs herself upon it  upon this orestes runs mad and it is said to be the finest mad scene in any english play  andromache remains queen her son lives and being diverted from her own bloodypurpose she has nothing to do but to give orders for the funeral of pyrrhus and to bring her son in triumph from a prison to a palace  this is in brief the story now madam since you will hive me i will tell you in my artless way what i think not quite so pretty and what is great and beautiful in this play which upon the whole however i was much pleased with and should have been more had there been less terror in it and more probability as i presume to say in some of its parts and had not the softest passion in nature been treated as such a flaming thing as cannot be a worthy example to female minds  and first i could not but observe that the plea of the princes of greece for the murder of astyanax a helpless infant to procure which and for nothing else they send one of the chief princes or greece ambassador to pyrrhus is a very poor one and most easily answered  for thus orestes says among other very pompous things have you so soon forgot the mighty hector the greeks remember his highbrandishd sword that filled their states with widows and with orphans for which they call for vengeance on his son who knows what he may one day prove    and in another place troy may again revive and a new hector rise in astyanax   and in another place sir call to mind the unrivaled strength of troy her walls her bulwarks and her gates of brass her kings her heroes and imbattled armies   what tragedy pomp is this how poor the plea from princes and heroes when it is so easily answered by pyrrhus in this manner i call them all to mind and see them all confused in dust all mixed in onewide ruin all but a child and he in bondage held what vengeance can we fear in such a troy   and a little before let dastard souls be timorously wise but tell them pyrrhus knows not how to form farfansyd ills and dangers out of sight   and still with greater contempt  i thought your kings were met on more important counsels when i heard the name of their ambassador i hoped some glorious enterprise was taking birth is agamemnons son dispatched for this and do the grecian chiefs renowned in war a race of heroes join in close debate to plot an infants death    but what if this very pyrrhus after twenty humane and generous things which the poet makes him say shows that all this right thinking is only owing to his passion for the mother and as soon as she gives him to understand she is resolved to remain hectors widow he determines to give way to the embassy and threats of the grecian princes which he had so justly despised and to destroy the infant but first he tells her it is true hermione was sent to share my throne and bed    a fine errand for a highspirited lady and to wait afterward his good pleasure in his own court through a series of slights and contempts for the performance of his vows and he generously like a true insulting man boasts  and would with transport hear the vowswhich you neglect    to which andromache nobly answers  she has no troy no hector to lament she has not lost a husband by your conquests such a husband tormenting thought whose death alone has made your sire immortal    this inrages the hero and what he should have admired her for had his soul been half as noble as hers he thus resents i have been too tame i will awake to vengeance the son shall answer for his mothers scorn the greeks demand him nor will i endanger my realms to pleasure an ungrateful woman   accordingly he resolves to sacrifice the child to do justice to hermione out of spite to andromache and most ungenerously knowing orestes loves hermione to distraction tells him he shall grace his nuptial rites and he will receive hermione from his hands  but now again see what succeeds to this one look of favor from andromache reverses all his new resolves makes him throw new indignities on hermione new contempts upon the greek princes and show that if he acts right in one point the saving of the child it is from wrong and unjustifiable motives and yet the poet seems to design him an amiable character  now madam could not a distress have been formed in this story from more laudable and proper motives should this passion of unbridled love be represented in such a strong such an irresistible light to an audience who must be taught that the highest ingratitude the most rageful extreme of sensual passion the most unjustifiable actions and the sacrifice of all considerations of public good and private right had examples all in this piece to warrant them  it is true pyrrhus is punished by a cruel assassination  hermione falls by her own hand for murdering him by the hands of the greeks and the phrensy of orestes becomes his punishment but what a scene of terror does all this raise how unlikely to be an exemplar either to public or private life and what a hard fate is that of hermione slighted despised insulted by the man she loved to whom she was betrohed and whose resentment therefore was warranted had it shown itself in almost any act short of the murder which in the violence of her passion she commanded orestes to perpetrate  then madam the love of hermione for pyrrhus is not i think of that delicate sort which ought to be set before our sex for an example  it is rage not love that of a woman slighted and however just supposing our sex to have such revengeful hearts when slighted by the man they love is not so exemplary as one would wish and besides she is represented as sometimes sighing and wishing for orestes when a true love bears not the thought of any object but that one it sighs for even should that be ungrateful thus it is said of orestes by her confidante orestes whose return you often had wished the man whose sufferings you so often lamented and often praised his constancy and love   then hermione repeats her womans words that love that constancy so ill requited  upbraids me to myself i blush to think how i have used him and would shun his presence   the motive for this however is neither justice nor generosity but pride indeed it must be owned a pride too natural to a female mind in such a circumstance as hers what will be my confusion when he sees me neglected and forsaken like himself her insolence at last is well repaid i cannot bear the thought   and then the moment she sees him  this is her blunt question to him notwithstanding all her shame to see him how am i to interpret sir this visit is it a compliment of form or love   does this madam show any thing of the delicacy of sex or condition  and would one think it right after she has thus extorted from him a repeated confession of his love or weakness as he calls it to upbraid him that it ill becomes the ambassador of greece to talk of love or dying  in short madam i think none of the love in this piece is such a love however suited to hermiones character and circumstance as is fit to be recommended to our example it is a love that shocks one and is rather rage and tumult than love and succeeds accordingly so that of pyrrhus is ungoverned wild unjust ungenerous caprice hermiones is founded in confessed ingratitude to orestes and she perseveres in it to pyrrhus when the indignities put upon her should have made her sooner wish for death than for so perjured a man and yet i think she shows an inconsistent tenderness for orestes as i have hinted while her passion for pyrrhus flames out with so much violence  the motive of andromache for hers is the most perfect character in the piece and designed to be so by the poet to save her son is the best a woman could have to excuse her for marrying the man who had slaughtered all her relations but the uncertainty of securing that point by the mere formality of joining hands with pyrrhus and her resolution to destroy herself in defiance of her vows just plighted to be his was a strange expedient to preserve her widowhood and her child for was it very likely that a man so wildly in love with her as to forego all other just and prudent considerations for her and who had shown that he would have destroyed her son but for the sake of her person would when disappointed by so great a rashness have hazarded his realms in defense of her son  but of all things commend me to the noble regard for self of her woman and confidante cephisa to whom andromche communicates her rash purpose injoining her a willing secrecy the only way the poet had to let us know it as it was not put in execution for she shows that regard to her dear self in this tragic performance which in a comedy would have raised a laugh no doubt as a satire on ladys women alas i fear i never shall outlive you  these things struck me madam when i saw the play and when i came to read it i was more confirmed in my sentiments but now i will transcribe some passages which pleased me much  the storms and doubts and uncertainty of wild ungoverned love is very naturally i humbly think painted in several scenes of this play in the characters of hermione and pyrrhus and nowhere more affectingly than in the upbraidings of hermione to orestes after she found her bloody purposes too well complied with thus what if transported by my boundless passion i could not bear to see him wed another were you to obey a jealous womans phrensy you should have dived into my inmost thoughts my heart though full of rage was free from malice and all my anger was excess of love why did you take me at my word you saw the struggles of my soul you heard me rave you should have questioned me a thousand times yet still have doubted still have questioned on before you ventured on a life so precious why did you not return why not consult me a second time and undetermined still again return and still find new delays   the scene between andromache and hermione when the former supposes the latter on the point of marrying pyrrhus and bespeaking her interest for her sons life affected me much and was nobly acted by mrs oldfield who after assuring her that her slain lords was the only love she could ever indulge as hermione flies her cries  ah madam whither whither do you fly where can your eyes behold a sight more pleasing than hectors widow suppliant and in tears i come not an alarmed a jealous foe to envy you the heart your charms have won  but oh i have a son  and you one day will be no stranger to a mothers fondness   was not this madam a moving and interesting plea and is not what follows affectingly noble  but heaven forbid that you should ever know a mothers sorrow for an only son her joy her bliss her last surviving comfort when every hour she trembles for his life your power over pyrrhus may relieve my fears alas what danger is there in a child saved from the wreck of a whole ruined empire let me go hide him in a desert isle you may rely upon my tender care to keep him far from perils of ambition all he can learn of me will be to weep this is sweetly moving nobly pathetick but i am angry at the poet if he could have helped it for drawing in hermione such an ungenerous and unprincely insult upon the royal mourner when in the height of her own prosperity as she imagined and her rival subjected beneath her feet  fie upon him thus to make her say like a true woman as our censurers will reflect  madam if pyrrhus must be wrought in pity no woman does it better than yourself if you gain him i shall comply of course this from one woman to another much more from one princess to another from the elated to the captive could not be said surely  twas all the poet nor do i see there was need for it for had he made hermione on this occasion capable her own empire secured as she thought of a more generous and humane answer would it not have heightened the distress when such a character sunk who had been basely injured by the man she loved and whose crime was the rage or slighted love why would he choose to make andromaches part thus nobly moving at the expense of the other character in a point where justice generosity and humanity were so much concerned and would not a fine instruction have lain here for the audience to have had compassion for the distresses of another and so much the more as that other was a rival sunk at the feet of the prosperous  indeed hermione which by the way mrs porter acted incomparably is a character full of rage and violence of jealousy and great cause she had for it but what then could she not a princess as she was when her own love was secured have been made capable of feeling a distress so nobly pleaded by motives so becoming a mothers lips and a bridal virgins prospects  but i am upon the authors beauties  andromaches plea to pyrrhus when thus insulted by hermione she sees no hope of any way to preserve her son but by soothing the proud heart of the prince whom her refusal had incensed is very pretty in the mouth of captive royalty  oh sir excuse the pride of royal blond that cheeks my soul and knows not how to be importunate you know alas i was not born to kneel to sue for pity and to own a master   and afterward behold how low you have reduced a queen these eyes have seen my country laid in ashes my kindred fall in war my father slain my husband dragged in his own blood my son condemned to bondage and myself a slave yet in the midst of these unheard of woes twas some relief to find myself your captive and that my son derived from ancient kings since he must serve had pyrrhus for his master when priam kneeled the great achilles wept i hoped i should not find his son less noble i thought the brave were still the most compassionate o do not sir divide me from my child if he must die    then there is a fine scene recollected by andromache to her woman between hector and herself on the morning he set out for the action in which he was slain  that morn cephisa that illfated morn my husband bid thee bring astyanax he took him in his arms and as i wept my wife my dear andromache said he heaving with stifled sights to see me weep  finely said and the hero all preserved he sighed not for fear of the foe but to see his beloved lady weep  from that humanity which should always be inseparable i think whether in fiction or fact from true heroism and that other inseparable piety as follows what fortune may attend my arms the gods alone can tell to thee i give the boy preserve him as the token of our loves if i should fall let him not miss his sire while thou survivst but by thy tender care let the son see that thou did love his father   and the advice left by andromache with cephisa for her son when she resolves to kill herself after the nuptial ceremony is performedis very worthy after a scene of passionate fondness well expressed  let him know i died to save him  and would die again  season his mind with early hints of glory make him acquainted with his ancestors trace out their shining story in his thoughts dwell on the exploits of his immortal father and sometimes    very pretty   let him hear his mothers name let him reflect upon his royal birth with modest pride pyrrhus will prove a friend but let him know he has a conqurors right he must be taught to stifle his resentments and sacrifice his vengeance to his safety and to his gratitude too madam should it not have been said when he was so generously protected against the demand of confederate kings  should he prove headstrong rash or unadvised he then would frustrate all his mothers virtue provoke his fate and i shall die in vain very nobly said but i cannot forbear making one observation on occasion of selfmurder which however the poets may be justified by the examples of the greeks and romans when they draw their stories from them yet in such a gloomy saturnine nation as ours where selfmurders are more frequent than in all the christian world besides methinks all those stories should be avoided for public entertainment or where there is a necessity as in cato for example to introduce such a wicked practice the bad example should be obviated and the poison it may administer antidoted by more forcible lessons than what these few doubtful words express  i fear i have been too hasty   so in this tragedy i am speaking of when hermione destroys herself and andromache designs to do the like should the english poet have left this practice unguarded or unaccompanyd by proper lessons and censures in such a country as ours  the staggering doubts and distress of hermione after she had engaged orestes in the murder of pyrrhus between her love and her resentment her questions to her woman that as he approached the temple to marry her rival in breach of his vows of betrothment to her whether his countenance showed not some tokens of remorse are very natural to one in her amorous circumstance i fansy but say cleone did thou mark him well was his brow smooth say did there not appear some shade of grief some little cloud of sorrow did he not stop did he not once look back did thou approach him was he not confounded did he not  oh be quick and tell me all   this madam i think is charmingly natural and on cleones answer that he went to the temple all joy and transport unguarded and all his cares employed to gratify andromache in her sons safety the poet palliates a little for a rageful mind to say enough he dies  the traitor  where is orestes  there are several circumstances of horror in this play that shocked me much but i think none like the description the poet puts into the mouth of pylades the inseparable friend of orestes who far from avoiding to shock the soul of his friend by gently insinuating the fate of that hermione on whom he had fixed his happiness thus terribly with all the aggravations that could attend such a circumstance points out the horrid action taking care even to make her as impious in her reproaches of the deity for her own rashness as she was in the violence by which she dies and so leaving a dreadful example that i presume was not needful to be left of a final impenitence especially in a suffering character that had not merited the evils she met with  thus it is mentioned and i am affected with the transcription of a passage which the poet has labored more than he ought i think to show the force of his descriptive vein full of disorder wildness in her looks with hands expanded and dishevelled hair breathless and pale with shrieks she sought the temple in the midway she met the corpse of pyrrhus she startled at the sight then stiff with horror gazed frightful wakened from the dire amaze she raised her eyes to heaven with such a look as spoke her sorrows and reproached the gods then plunged a poniard deep within her breast and fell on pyrrhus grasping him in death   this from a friend to a lover of the miserable hermione though the poet might think it the only way he had left to make orestes run quite distracted yet was not i presume to say very judiciously put into the mouth of a beloved friend anxious for his safety and to get him off after the murder and whose part till now had been rather that of soothing like a true friend the sorrows of his mind  the moral of the story only regards andromache nor is there indeed any thing but violence and terror in the rest of the story and characters as if the poet was determined to sink all into one and make that great at the expense of the rest it is however in my humble opinion a good one to show that persons in distress ought never to despond be their afflictions what they will and ought to have weighed with andromache herself to make her avoid the crime of suicide which she had resolved upon since this moral is put into her mouth but so late that it seems rather to make her good by an event she could not foresee than by the prudence of her reflections which would not without that event have prevented her from a rash action that would have rendered the moral ineffectual  though plunged in ills and exercised in care yet never let the noble mind despair where pressed by dangers and beset with foes the gods their timely succor interpose and when our virtue sinks overwhelmed with grief by unforeseen expedients bring relief now madam good as this moral is i should rather in generosity have had it recommended from any mouth than that of andromache for what is the consolation she receives what are the expedients she so much rejoices in why in the first place the murder of a prince who loved her more than his own glory and to whom she had just given her faith as a second husband though forced to it from a laudable motive and next the selfmurder of hermione the distraction of orestes and the prospect of succeeding with her son to the throne of the murdered prince from which however she could not expect but to be driven and her son at last to be destroyed by those vengeful confederates who had joined by a solemn embassy to demand his life and who now by his elevation had stronger reasons to apprehend danger from him and the less difficulty to effect his ruin as pyrrhus was no more  but judge my dear lady what after the play was over i must think of the epilogue and indeed of the audience who called out for it an epilogue spoken by mrs oldfield in the character of andromache that was more shocking to me than the most terrible parts of the play as by lewd and even senseless doubleentendre it could be calculated only to efface all the tender all the virtuous sentiments which the tragedy was designed to raise  the pleasure this was received with by the men was equally barbarous and insulting every one turning himself to the boxes pit and galleries where ladies were to see how they locked and how they stood an emphatical and toowell pronounced ridicule not only upon the play in general but upon the part of andromache in particular which had been so well sustained by an excellent actress and i was extremely mortified to see my favorite and the only perfect character debased and despoiled and the widow of hector prince of troy talking nastiness to an audience and setting it out with all the wicked graces of action and affected archness of look attitude and emphasis  i stood up  dear sir  dear miss  said i   what is the matter my love said mr b smileing who expected as he told me afterward to see me moved by this vile epilogue  for it is always called for it seems  why have i wept the distresses of the injured hermione whispered i why have i been moved by the murder of the brave pyrrhus and shocked by the madness of orestes is it for this see you not hectors widow that noble andromache inverting the design of the whole play satirizing her own sex but indeed most of all ridiculing and shaming in my mind that part of the audience who can call for this vile epilogue and those who can be delighted with it after such scenes of horror and distress  he was pleased to say smiling i expected my dear that your delicacy and misss too would be shocked on this preposterous occasion i never saw this play rake as i was but the impropriety of the epilogue sent me away dissatisfied with it and with human nature too and you only see by this one instance what a character that of an actor and actress is and how capable they are to personate any thing for a sorry subsistence  well but sir said i are there not think you extravagant scenes and characters enough in most plays to justify the censures of the virtuous upon them that the wicked friend of the author must crown the work in an epilogue for fear the audience should go away improved by the representation it is not i see sir always narrowness of spirit as i have heard some say that opens the mouths of good people against these diversions  in this wild way talked i for i was quite out of patience at this unnatural and unexpected piece of ridicule tacked to so serious a play and coming after such a moral  here is a specimen my dear lady of my observations on the first play i saw how just or how impertinent i must leave to your better judgment i very probably expose my own ignorance and folly in them but i will not say presumption because you have put me upon the task which otherwise i should hardly have attempted i have very little reason therefore to blame myself on this score but on the contrary if i can escape your ladyships censure have cause to pride myself in the opportunity you have thereby given me to show my readiness to obey you and the rather since i am sure of your kindest indulgence now you have given me leave to style myself  your ladyships obliged sister and humble servant p b  letter xv my dear lady i gave you in my last my bold remarks upon a tragedy  the distressed mother  i will now give you my shallow notions of a comedy  the tender husband  i liked this title though i cannot say i was pleased at all with its second with an explanatory or  the accomplished fools but when i was told it was written by sir richard steel and that mr addison had given some hints toward it if not some characters o dear sir said i give us your company to this play for the authors of the spectators cannot possibly produce a faulty scene  mr b indeed smiled for i had not then read the play and the earl of f his countess miss darnford mr b and myself agreed to meet with a niece of my lords in the stagebox which was taken on purpose  there seems to me my dear lady to be a great deal of wit and satire in the play but upon my word i was grievously disappointed as to the morality of it nor in some places is probability preserved and there are diverse speeches so very free that i could not have expected to meet with such from the names i mentioned  i should be afraid of being censured for my presumption were i to write to any body less indulgent to my boldness than your ladyship but i will make no apologies to you madam  let me see then can i give you the brief history of this comedy as i did of the tragedy  i profess i hardly know whether i can or not at least whether i should or not  but i will try  the tender husband mr clerimont has for his wife a lady who has traveled and is far gone in all the french fashions she brought me says he a noble fortune and i thought she had a right to share it therefore carried her to see the world forsooth and make the tour of france and italy where she learned to lose her money gracefully to admire every vanity in our sex and contemn every virtue in her own which with ten thousand other perfections are the ordinary improvements of a traveled lady  tender as the husband was to be supposed to the wife which by the way is not extremely apparent in proper or right instances of tenderness i presume to think he shows no great delicacy to the sex in general in this speech  but what is the method he takes to reclaim the lady  why this he sets a former mistress of his own to work in mans clothes to ensnare his lady and thus he declares himself  now i can neither mortify her vanity that i may live at ease with her or quite discard her till i have caught her a little enlarging her innocent freedoms as she calls them for this end i am content to be a french husband though nowandthen with the secret pangs of an italian one and therefore sir or madam to his mistress lucy under the name of mr fainlove in the dress of a young coxcomb you are thus equipped to attend and accost her ladyship a speech unnecessary to fainlove who was dressed before for that purpose and had actually won money in that character of mrs clerimont but the poet had no other way to let the audience know it as it should seem  it concerns you continues he to be diligent if we  ie he and his lady wholly part  i need say no more if we do not  i will see thee well provided for  here is a fine moral scene opened my lady with regard to mr clerimont his lady and his kept mistress mr fainlove alias mrs lucy undertakes the task in hopes to live with mr clerimont in case of a divorce from his wife or to be provided for in case the plot does not succeed which looks pretty plainly that to say nothing of his morality the poor lucy had not met with a generous man in mr clerimont since after the forfeiture of her honor she was still to do a more infamous jobb if possible to procure for herself a provision from him  then mr clerimont proceeds to in ctruct the newmade man how to behave like a coxcomb in order to engage his ladys attention and to join in all her foibles till she can furnish him with an opportunity to detect them in such a way as shall give a pretense for a divorce and this in such free language and action as must disgust any modest body  then the poet causes this faithful mistress in order to make her character shine above that of the wife and indeed above his own likewise to present her imployer with bills for  00 l which she tells him she won of his wife the preceding night and makes up  000 l which mr clerimont says this unprovidedfor mistress of his has won from his lady and honestly given him or else he could not he says have supplied her gaming losses and lucy declares she will gain him for ever from his lady if she can yet you will see byandby that it is not love to his particular person more than any other that is her inducement of course then it must be wickedness for wickedness sake  the next character is captain clerimont brother to the other gentleman a man of fashion and the world who being a younger brother has his fortune to make and we shall see presently how he proposes to make it  the next is pounce an infamous jobber or broker of stocks marriages or any thing  whose character be pleased to take in his own words now it is my profession to assist a freehearted young fellow against an unnatural longlived father  to disincumber men of pleasure of the vexation of unwieldy estates to support a feeble title to an inheritance  one that mr clerimont says by way of praise he has seen prompting a stammering witness in westminster hall that wanted instruction and could venture his ears with great bravery for his friend  a worse character than this can there be yet is it not produced to be punished neither  the next person introduced is hezekiah tipkin a banker in lombard street of an infamous and sordid character and a vile usurer who has a beautiful niece miss bridget tipkin overrun with affectation and romance with a great fortune in money which so attracts the captain that he supposes in sordid but witty manner enough all imaginable perfections in her person before he has a sight of it this young lady by a treaty between her uncle tipkin and sir harry gubbin a tyrannical positive hotheaded country gentleman is designed to be married to humphrey the son of sir harry a creature so savage so rough and so stupid that there cannot be drawn a stronger contraste between his character and that of miss bridgets  mr pounce who is employed as a broker in their match is for a reward of  000 l to cheat them and poor humphrey and to procure this young lady for captain clerimont admirable justice and morality all round you will say my lady  for this purpose mr pounce finds mr humphrey so great a fool that though he never saw him before he very esily sets him against his father and against his cousin bridget and all this on the wedding day in order to induce him to make court to a person he tells him of but never saw and who should be this person but the sister of fainlove clerimonts mandressd mistress which sister however was to be fainlove or lucy herself with a worthy intent to impose upon him as a wife this castoff mistress of clerimont a just a generous an exemplary plot this  the next character is an old maiden gentlewoman aunt to miss bridget an antiquated virgin who as pounce says has a mighty affectation for youth and is a great lover of men and money  and she is set over her niece as a promoter of the match with humphrey  over this lady mr pounce has a great ascendant half for sordid reasons and half for amorous ones which makes her a thorough ridiculous character and he introduces captain clerimont into the company of the aunt and niece and entertains the former while the captain ingages the latter on the subject of her beloved romance these with mrs clerimonts maid jenny are the principal characters  i need not my lady take up much of your time or my own to tell you how they proceed  mr clerimont then after bearing from his wife what hardly any gentleman could bear surprises fainlove as a man and a very wicked scene it is in every part taking shocking freedoms with her and falling into a feigned rage threatening to kill fainlove the lady at first menaces and is haughty and arrogant but finding by her husbands behavior to lucy whom he then addresses with fondness before her face that she is tricked by a woman in mans habit in her turn would kill the impostor as lucy whom as fainlove she tried to save and a scene on this occasion occurs to my thinking very ridiculous mr clerimont then upbraids her guilt and what was hardly ever known in nature she reforms instantly on the spot and expresses all the signs of contrition imaginable he forgives and receives her guilty as she is in her intention her person only untainted and an adultress in her mind as she would have been in fact had fainlove been a man and a moving scene had it been from proper motives follows yet still more preposterous excuse me madam afterward she resumes all her traveled and nonsensical airs all her follies to help to support the piot in favor of captain clerimont upon miss bridget and that of pounces and mr clerimonts against poor humphry the only innocent character in the play and the only suffering one and this latter as well as the former plot being brought about a laughing scene is produced by sir harrys soundly cudgelling his stupid son for permitting himself to be so foolishly drawn in  now my good lady can you see one character and i think i have given them justly fit to be set up for an example in this celebrated play of an author so celebrated i must own as i said before i was greatly disappointed in my expectations of it there is indeed a great deal of sprightly wit and knowledge of the wicked part of the world displayed in it as it seems to me by what i have heard mr b talk sometimes but there is not one character in it but what is shockingly immoral and at the same time either above or below nature so that the ridicule which is intended in it on the bad characters cannot in my poor opinion be just or efficacious  for first there never i believe could be a gentleman so foolishly tender yet so plottingly cruel to his lady as mr clerimont  there never could be such a very fantastical lady as mrs clerimont  and there is such an improbability in the intimate access which lucy in mans clothes has to her in that creatures lewd views yet faithful and generous conduct in giving back to clerimont who had not provided for her  000 l won of the fantastical lady and yet in her being so little delicate in her love to clerimont which one would expect should be her motive as to join to trick and marry one of the greatest fools in the world that it was surprising to me that it could pass either author or audience  then tipkins character is unnaturally stupidly yet knavishly bad  sir harry gubbin is a father who never could have his fellow and after furiously bearing his son is reconciled to his marriage as instantly as mrs clerimont is converted and that to an unknown person who appears to him in mans clothes for the sake of  000 l fortune only although he had been quarrelling with tipkin about  000 l out of  0000 l which his son was to have with bridget  numps his son is a character take it all together quite out of nature and probability it is hardly possible that a savage brought up in a wood who never conversed with man or woman could be so stupid and easily might a poet form a plot for a play if such a character could be admitted as numpss  the aunt is credulous and affected beyond probability also  miss bridget delicately indelicate in many places and improbably fantastic in all  pounce shamelessly glorying and succeeding in his villainy and deeming the worst of rogueries a panegyric and such immoralities mingled with obscenities that i was glad when the play was over  but yet to say truth there are very pretty descriptions and a great deal of wit and humor in it the dialogue is lively the painters scene entertaining and that between sir harry and tipkin diverting though low which together with the fantastic airs of mrs clerimont and miss bridget and the farcical humors of numps make it the less wonder that such as did not attend to nature probability and morality were struck with the life and spirit of the performance and especially as mr wilks who acted captain clerimont and mrs oldfield who acted miss bridget so incomparably performed their parts as must have saved a play even of a worse tendency than the accomplished fools  the moral i will transcribe although i doubt it is a very inapplicable one to the characters and so is far from making amends for a long performance that in such a variety of characters has not one moral one in it not so much as one just or generous design pursued throughout the play you have seem the extremes of the domestic life a son too much confined  too free a wife by generous bonds you either should restrain and only on their inclinations gain   this i call inapplicable because it was needless advice to such husbands as mr clerimont for whom it seems designed for he was generous to excess carrying her abroad to italy and france and paying all her debts of honor implicitly whence the name of the play the tender husband  wives to obey must love  clerimont did everything to make a grateful woman love him before his strange plot to reclaim her   children revere while only slaves are governed by their fear mrs clerimont was not treated like a slave yet is reclaimed only by fear so that the moral seems to be calculated for the numpss the fools and idiots and the sir harries two characters that as i humbly apprehend never were in nature any more it is to be hoped than are the rest  it looks to me in short as if the author had forgot the moral all the way and being put in mind of it by some kind friend mr addison perhaps was at a loss to draw one from such characters and plots as he had produced and so put down what came uppermost for the sake of custom without much regard to propriety and truly i should imagine likewise that the play was begun with a design to draw more amiable characters answerable to the title of the tender husband but that the author being drawn away by the luxuriancy of a genius which he had not the heart to prune on a general survey of the whole distrusting the propriety of that title added the underone with an  or the accomplished fools in justice to his piece and compliment to his audience and pardon me madam had he called it the accomplished knaves i would not have been angry at him because there would have been more propriety in the title  i wish i could for the sake of the authors have praised every scene of this play i hoped to have reason for it judge then my dear lady what a mortification it was to me not to be able to say i liked above one the painters scene and am forced to disapprove of every character in it and the views of every one i am dearest madam  your most obliged sister and servant p b   letter xvi my dear lady although i cannot tell how you received my observations on the tragedy of the distressed mother and the comedy of the tender husband yet will i proceed to give your ladyship my opinion of the opera i was at last night  but what can i say when i have mentioned what you so well know the fine scenes the genteel company the charming voices and delightful music  if madam like the nightingale one were all voice or were all ear and lost to every sense but that and harmony surely the italian opera would be a transporting thing  but when one finds good sense and instruction and propriety sacrificed to the charms of sound what an unedifying what a mere temporary delight does it afford for what does one carry home but the remembrance of having been pleased so many hours by air well beaten and played upon which being but sound you cannot bring away with you and must therefore enter the time passed in such a diversion into the account of those blank hours from which one has not reaped so much as one improving lesson  i speak this with regard to myself who know nothing of the italian language but yet i may not be very unhappy that i do not if i may form my opinion of the sentiments by the enervating softness of the sound and the unmanly attitudes and gestures made use of to express the passions of the menperformers and from the amorous complainings of the women as visible in the soft the toosoft action of each  then though i cannot but say that the music is most melodious yet to see a hero as an alexander or a julius caesar warbling out his achievements in war his military conquests as well as his love in a soft song it seems to me to be making a jest of both  and how much more absurd is it still to hear some dying chieftain some unfortunate hero chanting forth his woes and his calamities and taking his leave of the world with less propriety than our english criminals at the fatal tree in a sonetta what can this move how can this pierce be the story ever so dismal any thing but ones ears  every nation mr b says has its peculiar excellence the french taste is comedy and harlequinery the italian melody and opera the english masculine and nervous sense whether in tragedy or comedy  why cannot one methinks keep to ones own particular national excellence and let others retain theirs for mr b observes that when once sound is preferred to sense we shall depart from all our own worthiness and at best be but the apes yea the dupes of those whom we may strive to imitate but never can reach much less excel  mr b says sometimes that this taste is almost the only good fruit our young nobility gather and bring home from their foreign tours and that he found the english nation much ridiculed on this score by those very people who are benefited by the depravity and if this be the best what must the other qualifications be which they bring home  yet every one does not return with so little improvement it is to be hoped  but what have i said what can i say of an italian opera  only little to the purpose as it is i wonder how i have been able to say so much for who can describe sound or what words shall be found to imbody air  and when we return and are asked our opinion of what we have seen or heard we are only able to answer as i hinted above the scenery is fine the company splendid and genteel the music charming for the time  the action not extraordinary the language unintelligible and for all these reasons  the instruction none at all  this is all that the thing itself gives me to say of the italian opera very probably for want of a polite taste and a knowledge of the language  in my next i believe i shall give you madam my opinion of a diversion or amusement which i doubt i shall like still less and that is a masquerade for i fear i shall not be excused going to one although i have no manner of liking to it especially in my present way i am madam  your ladyships most obliged and faithful p b i must add another halfsheet to this letter on the subject matter of it the opera and am sure your ladyship will not be displeased with the addition     mr b coming up just as i had concluded my letter asked me what was my subject i told him i was giving your ladyship my notions of the italian opera let me see said he what they are my dear for this is a subject that very few of those who admire them and fewer still of those who decry them know any thing of  he read the above and was pleased to commend it italian operas said be are very sad things in england to what they are in italy and the translations given of them abominable and indeed our language will not do them justice  every nation as you take notice has its excellencies and you say well that ours should not quit the manly nervous sense which is the distinction of the english drama one play of our celebrated shakespeare will give infinitely more pleasure to a sensible mind than a dozen english italian operas but my dear in italy they are quite another thing and the sense is not as here sacrificed so much to the sound but that they are both very compatible  be pleased sir to give me your observation on this head in writing and then i shall have something to send worthy of lady daverss acceptance do sir pray do  i will my dear and he took the pen in his hand and wrote the enclosed which i beg your ladyship to return me because i will keep it by me for my instruction if i should be led to talk of this subject in company you must let my sister know said he that i have given myself no time to reperuse what i have written she will do well therefore to correct it and return it to you  in italy judges of operas are so far from thinking the drama a poetical part of their operas nonsense as the unskilled in italian rashly conclude in england that if the libretto as they call it is not approved the opera notwithstanding the excellence of the music will be condemned for the italians justly determine that the very music of an opera cannot be complete and pleasing if the drama be incongruous as i may call it in its composition because in order to please it must have the necessary contraste of the grave and light that is the diverting equally blended through the whole if there be too much of the first let the music express as i may say love and the tender ever so much it will come out heavy and tiresome if the latter prevail it will surfeit with jig and minuit wherefore it is the poets business to adapt the words for this agreeable mixture for the music is but secondary and subservient to the words and if there be an artful contraste in the drama there will be the same in the music supposing the composer to be a skilful master  now as in england the practice has been to mutilate curtail and patch up a drama in italian in order to throw in a glut of minuitish airs collected from an author the contraste has always been broken thereby and the opera damned without knowing the reason and as ignorant mercenary prompters though italians have been employed in the hotchpotch and in translating our dramas from italian into english how could such operas appear any other than incongruous nonsense  recitativos to avoid the natural dissonance and irregularity in common speech recitativos in music and dramatical performances were invented and although the time in pronouncing the words contained in them is scarce longer than in common conversation yet the concatenation of sounds is by this means so artfully contrived as that the cadences or dialogue of basses shall unite and delight the ear with their opposites the highest tenors and trebles wherefore recitativos are a regular way of speaking by art as i may say in order to avoid and correct the irregularities of speech often found in nature and to express the passions without offense to the ear    permit me dear madam to repeat my assurances that i am and must ever be  your obliged sister and servant p b  letter xvii well now my dear lady i will give you my poor opinion of a masquerade to which mr b persuaded me to accompany miss darnford for as i hinted in my former i had a great indifference or rather dislike to go and miss therefore wanted so powerful a second to get me with her because i was afraid the freedoms which i had heard were used there would not be very agreeable to my apprehensive temper at this time especially  but finding mr b chose to have me go if as he was pleased to say i had no objection i said i will have none sir i can have none when you tell me it is your choice and so send for the habits you like and that you would have me appear in and i will cheerfully attend you  the habit mr b pitched upon was that of a spanish don and it well befitted the majesty of his person and air and miss chose that of a young widow and mr b recommended that of a quaker for me we all admired one another in our dresses and mr b promising to have me always in his eye we took coach and went thither  but i never desire to be present at another mr b was singled out by a bold nun who talked italian to him with such free airs that i did not much like it though i know not what she said for i thought the dear gentleman no more kept to his spanish gravity than she to the requisites of the habit she wore when i had imagined that all that was tolerable in a masquerade was the acting up to the characters each person assumed and this gave me no objection to the quakers dress for i thought i was prim enough for that naturally  i said softly dear miss for mr b and the nun were out of sight in a moment what is become of that nun  rather whispered she what is become of the spaniard  a cardinal attacked me instantly in french but i answered in english not knowing what he said quakers are not fit company for redhats  they are said he in the same language for a quaker and a jesuit is the same thing  miss was addressed by the name of the sprightly widow another asked how long she intended to wear those weeds and a footman in a rich livery answered for her eyes through her mask that it would not be a month  but i was startled when a presbyterian parson came up to me and bid me look after my musidorus  so that i doubted not by this it must be somebody who knew my name to be pamela and i presently thought of one of my lawyers whose characters i gave in a former letter  indeed he needed not to bid me for i was sorry on more accounts than that of my timorousness to have lost sight of him out upon these nasty masquerades thought i i cannot abide them already  an egregious beauish appearance came up to miss and said you hang out a very pretty sign widow   not replied miss to invite such fops as you to my shop  any customer would be welcome returned he in my opinion  i whisper this as a secret  and i whisper another said miss that no place warrants ill manners  are you angry widow  she affected a laugh no indeed it int worth while  he turned to me  and i was afraid of some such hit as he gave me  i hope friend thou art prepared with a father for the light within thee  that was his free word  is this wit said i turning to miss i have enough of this diversion where nothing but coarse jests appear barefaced  at last mr b accosted us as if he had not known us so lovely a widow and so sweet a friend no wonder you do not separate for i see not in this various assemblee a third person of your sex fit to join with you  not one sir  said i  will not a penitent nun make a good third with a mournful widow and a prim quaker  not for more than ten minutes at most  instantly the nun a fine person of a lady with a noble air though i did not like her joined us and spoke in italian something very free as it seemed by her manner and mr bs smiling answer but neither miss nor i understood that language and mr b would not explain it to us  but she gave him a signal to follow her seeming to be much taken with his person and air for though there were three other spanish habits there he was called the stately spaniard by one and the handsome spaniard by another in our hearing as he passed with us to the dessert where we drank each of us a glass of champaign and eat a few sweetmeats with a crowd about us but we appeared not to know one another while several odd appearances as one indian prince one chinese mandarin several domines of both sexes a dutch skipper a jewish rabbi a greek monk an harlequin a turkish bashaw and a capuchin friar glided by us as we returned into company signifying that we were strangers to them by squeaking out i know you  which is half the wit of the place  mr b had more attacks made upon him by ladies than we had by gentlemen and his fine person noble air and a deportment so suited to his habit only in the encounter of the nun when he had more of the french freedom as i thought than the spanish gravity made him many admirers and more when the spanish minister who was there in a french dress spoke to him in spanish and received a polite answer from him in the same while there were several who personated foreign characters and knew nothing of the language of the country whose habits they assumed  there were diverse antic figures some with caps and bells one dressed like a punch several harlequins and other ludicrous forms that jumped and ran about like mad and seemed as if they would have it thought that all their wit lay in their heels  two ladies one in a very fantastic partycolored habit with a plume of feathers the other in a rustic one with a garland of flowers round her head were much taken notice of for their freedom and having something to say to every body they were as seldom separated as miss and i and were followed by a crowd wherever they went  the partycolored one came up to me friend said she there is something in thy person that attracts every ones notice but if a sack had not been a profane thing it would have become thee almost as well  i thank thee friend said i for thy counsel but if thou had been pleased to look at home thou would not have taken so much pains to join such advice and such an appearance together as thou make  this made every one that heard it laugh  one said the butterfly had met with her match  she returned with an affected laugh  smartly said  but art thou come hither friend to make thy light shine before men or women  verily friend neither replied i but out of mere curiosity to look into the minds of both sexes which i read in their dresses  a general satire on the assemblee by the mass said a fat monk  the nun whiskd to us we are all concerned in my friends remark   and no disgrace to a fair nun returned i if her behavior answer her dress  nor to a reverend friar turning to the monk if his mind be not a discredit to his appearance  nor yet to a country girl turning to the partycolored ladys companion if she has not weeds in her heart to disgrace the flowers on her head  an odd figure representing a merry andrew took my hand and said i had the most piquant wit he had met with that night and friend said he let us be better acquainted  forbear said i withdrawing my hand not a companion for a jackpudden neither  a roman senator just then accosted miss and mr b seeing me so much engaged twere hard said he if our nation in spite of cervantes produced not one cavalier to protect a fair lady thus surrounded  though surrounded not distressed my good knight errant said the nun the fair quaker will be too hard for half a dozen antagonists and wants not your protection  but your poor nun bespeaks it whispered she who has not a word to say for herself  mr b answered her in italian i wish i understood italian  and she had recourse to her beads  you cannot imagine madam how this nun haunted the dear gentleman  indeed my lady you cannot imagine it  i must needs say i dont like these masquerades at all many ladies on these occasions are so very free that the censorious will be apt to blame the whole sex for their conduct and to say their hearts are as faulty as those of the most culpable men since they scruple not to show as much when they think they cannot be known by their faces but it is my humble opinion that could there be a standard fixed by which one could determine readily what is and what is not wit decency would not be so often wounded by attempts to be witty as it is for here every one that can give himself the liberty to say things that shock a modester person not meeting with due rebuke but perhaps a smile without considering whether it be of contempt or approbation mistakes courage for wit and every thing sacred or civil becomes the subject of his frothy jest  how else can one account for the liberties of expression and behavior taken by some of those who personated bishops cardinals priests nuns etc  for the freest things i heard said were from persons in those habits who behaved with so much levity and indecorum as if they were resolved as much as in them lay to throw those venerable characters into ridicule for no other reason than because they are by the generality of the world deemed venerable but if it was once determined that nothing should be called true wit as nothing certainly ought but what will stand the test of examination but what is consistent with decency and good manners and what will make an innocent heart brilliant and cheerful and give its sanction to the happy expression by trying to keep up and return the ball in like virtuous and lively raillery then we should have our public entertainments such as the most scrupulous might join to countenance and applaud  but what a moralizer am i will your ladyship say indeed i cannot help it  and especially on such a subject as a masquerade which i dislike more than any thing i ever saw i could say a great deal more on this occasion but upon my word i am quite of humor with it for i liked my english mr b better than my spaniard and the nun i approved not by any means though there were some who observed that she was one of the gracefullest figures in the place and indeed in spite of my own heart i could not help thinking so too  your ladyship knows so well what masquerades are that i may well be excused saying any thing further on a subject i am so little pleased with for you only desire my notions of those diversions because i am a novice to them and this i doubt not will doubly serve to answer that purpose  i shall only therefore add that after an hundred other impertinencies spoken to miss and me and retorted with spirit by miss and as well as i could by myself quite sick of the place i feigned to be more indisposed than i was and so got my beloved spaniard to go off with us and reached home by three in the morning and so much for masquerades i hope i shall never have occasion to mention them again to your ladyship i am my dearest lady  your everobliged sister and servant p b  letter xviii my dearest lady my mind is so wholly engrossed by thoughts of a very different nature from those which the diversions of the town and theaters inspire that i beg to be dispensed for the present from these lighter subjects but yet if it please god to spare my life as your ladyship does not disapprove of my remarks i intend to make a little book which i will present to your ladyship containing my poor observations on all the dramatick entertainments i have seen and shall see this winter and for this purpose i have made brief notes in the margin of the printed plays i have bought as i saw them with a pencil by referring to which as helps to my memory i shall be able to give your ladyship my thoughts at the time of seeing them pretty nearly with the same advantage as if i had written them at my return from each  i have obtained of sir simon and lady darnford the very great pleasure of their permission to miss to stay with me till it shall be seen how it will please god to deal with me and i owe this favor partly to a kind letter written in my behalf to sir simon by mr b and partly to misss earnest request to her papa to oblige me sir simon having made some difficulty to comply as mr murray and his bride have left them and he says he cannot live long if he has not the company of his beloved daughter  i cannot but say i have many more anxieties and apprehensions than perhaps i ought on the approaching occasion but i was always a sad coward and too thoughtful a good deal but i have so much to lose such a dear dear gentleman to part with if i must part with him such generous friends and lovers as i may say of both sexes and then the circumstance itself has so many terrors to an apprehensive mind attending it that i am out of breath sometimes at the thoughts of it and want to run away from myself if i could  but it cannot be and when i charge my mind with the reflections that religion inspires and ask myself who it was that gave me all these blessings and who it is that has a right to recall them if he pleases and when and in what way he pleases and that if i leave them not now i must be separated from them another day i endeavor to bring my mind to a resignation to the divine will  but what shall i say madam when i find my frailty is so much increased that i cannot with the same intenseness of devotion that i used to be blessed with apply myself to the throne of grace nor of consequence find my invocations answered by that delight and inward satisfaction with which i used to please myself when the present near prospect was more remote  i hope i shall not be deserted in the hour of trial and that this my weakness of mind will not be punished with a spiritual dereliction for suffering myself to be too much attached to those worldly delights and pleasures which no mortal ever enjoyed in a more exalted degree than myself and i beseech you my dearest lady let me be always remembered in your prayers  only for a resignation to the divine will a cheerful resignation i presume not to prescribe to his gracious providence for if one has but that one has every thing that one need to have yet my dear lady there is such a natural repugnance between life and death that nature will shrink when one comes to the trial let one have never so much fortitude at a distance yet i hope i may be forgiven for nowandthen i comfort myself with the divine exemplar which prayed in bloody sweats for the bitter cup to be removed but gave us the example of resignation that i am wishing to be able to follow however not mine but thy will be done  forgive me my dearest lady for being so deeply serious i have just now been contending with a severe pang that is for the present gone off what effect its return may have god only knows and if this is the last line i shall ever write it will be the more satisfactory to me as with my humble respects to my good lord davers and the dear countess and praying for the continuance of all your healths and happiness both here and hereafter i am permitted to subscribe myself  your ladyships obliged sister and humble servant p b  letter xix from lady davers to mr b my dearest brother although i believe it is needless to put a gentleman of your generous spirit in mind of doing a worthy action yet as i do not know whether you have thought of what i am going to hint to you i cannot forbear a line or two with regard to the good old couple in kent  i am sure if for our sins god almighty should take from us my incomparable sister forgive me my dear brother but to intimate what may be although i hourly pray as her trying minute approaches that it will not you will for her sake take care that her honest parents have not the loss of your favor to deepen the inconsolable one they will have in such a case of the best of daughters  i say i am sure you will do as generously by them as ever and i dare say your sweet pamela doubts it not yet as you know how sensible she is of every favor done to them it is the countesss opinion and mine and lady bettys too that you give her this assurance in some legal way for as she is naturally apprehensive and thinks more of her circumstance than for your sake she chooses to express to you it will be like a cordial to her dutiful and grateful heart and i do not know if it will not contribute more than any one thing to make her go through her task with ease and safety  i know how much your heart is wrapped up in the dear creature and you are a worthy brother to let it be so  you will excuse me therefore i am sure for this my officiousness  i have no doubt that god will spare her to us because although we may not be worthy of so much excellence yet we now all unite so gratefully to thank him for such a worthy relation that i hope we shall not be deprived of an example so necessary to us all  i can have but one fear and that is that young as she is she seems ripened for glory she seems to have lived long enough for herself but for you and for us that god will still spare her shall be the hourly prayer of  my dear worthy brother your ever affectionate sister b davers have you got her mother with you i hope you have god give you a son and heir if it be his blessed will but however that be preserve your pamela to you for you never can have such another wife    letter xx from mrs b to mr b my ever dear and ever honored mr b as i know not how it may please god almighty to deal with me on the approaching occasion i should think myself inexcusable if i could not find one or two select hours to dedicate to you out of the very many in the writing way in which your goodness has indulged me because you saw i took delight in it  but yet think not o best beloved of my heart that i have any boon to beg any favor to ask either for myself or for my friends or so much as the continuance of your favor to the one or the other as to them you have prevented and exceeded all my wishes as to myself if it please god to spare me i know i shall always be rewarded beyond my desert let my deservings be what they will i have only therefore to acknowledge with the deepest sense of your goodness to me and with the most heartaffecting gratitude that from the happy the thrice happy hour that you so generously made me yours till this moment you have not left me one thing on my own part to wish for but the continuance and increase of your felicity and that i might be worthier and worthier of the unexampled goodness tenderness and condescension wherewith you have always treated me  no my dearest my best beloved master friend husband my first my last and only love believe me i have nothing to wish for but your honor and felicity temporary and eternal and i make no doubt that god in his infinite goodness and mercy will perfect his own good work begun in your dear heart and whatever may now happen give us a happy meeting never more to part from one another for although as you were pleased to question the other day when you were resolving some of my doubts  and oh what a sweet expositor have you been to me upon all those occasions on which my diffident mind led me to you for information and direction whether the happiness of the blessed was not too exalted an happiness to be subjected to the poor ties of relationship and sense which now delight and attach so much to them our narrow minds and conceptions yet cannot i willingly give up the pleasing the charming hope that i shall one day rejoice distinguishingly rejoice in the society of my best beloved husband and friend and in that of my dear parents and i will keep and encourage this dear hope so consolatory to us in the separation which dearest friends must experience so long as it can stand me in any stead and till i shall be all intellect and above the soothing impressions which are now so agreeable to sense and to conjugal and filial piety  let me then beg of you my dearest protector and best friend to pardon all my imperfections and defects and if ever since i have had the honor to be yours i have in looks or in word or in deed given you cause to wish me other than i was that you will kindly put it to the score of natural infirmity for in thought or intention i can truly boast i never wilfully erred your tenderness for me and your generous politeness to me always gave me apprehension that i was not what you wished me to be because you would not find fault with me so often as i fear i deserved and this makes me beg of you to do as i hope god almighty will pardon all my involuntary errors and omissions  you have enabled me sir to do all the good to my poor neighbors and to distressed objects that was in my own heart to do and i hope i have dispensed the power you have so generously entrusted to my disposal without extravagance or dishonor with regard to you and with comfort and suitableness to the particular cases recommended to me but yet as it is necessary i should render some account of my stewardship in relation to the large sums you have put into my hands for charitable uses you will find my beloved master and best friend your poor stewards accounts of every thing in the cabinet that was my honored ladys till your goodness made it mine in a see vol ii p     vellom book which is written on the first leaf title page wise humble returns for divine mercies and you will see a balance struck down to this very day and the little surplus in the green purse upon the book and if you will be pleased sir to perfect by your generosity the happiness of the cases i have marked with a star thus  which are such as are not fully recovered and will be pleased to keep up my little school i dare ask no more for my dearest mr b if i should be called from your service to my new place your next steward and long i hope for your honorable familys sake you will not be without one may find out another and better method for your honor and her own to dispense your bounty than that i have taken  the rich jewels and equipage with which your generous goodness adorned my unworthiness will be found in the same cabinet in the private drawer and if i may be pardoned for one extravagant wish your circumstances dear sir are very great and your future lady will not wear any thing that was mine it is that my dear miss darnford may be desired as the effect of your own goodness and generous consideration for my memory to wear the diamond necklace which i know she admires but is far from wishing for it or expecting it although the neck that it was given to adorn and to make more worthy of you should be laid low by the irresistible leveller  in the bottom drawer on the left hand of the cabinet you will find sir all my unfinished scribble and among the rest a little parcel indorsed mr h and p barlow the title will surprise you but as i know not what may happen to make doubts and puzzles in the affair mentioned in those papers when i cannot obviate them i thought it was best to give a brief history of it in writing with his letter to me on the occasion and i humbly beg the whole may be kept within your own breast unless that vile affair which has much disturbed me should be revived although i have no reason to apprehend it will because the poor girl i hope is sincerely penitent and mr h himself seems in another way of thinking as to her  will you be pleased sir to bestow on my dearest miss goodwin as a remembrance of her aunts true love the diamond solitaire and the second pair of earrings perhaps my dearest lady davers would not disdain to wear as a present from her beloved brother my best diamond ring and if my most beloved and most valued ring of all the dear first pledge of my happiness were for the first time since i was honored with it by your own putting it on taken from my finger and inamelld it would be a mournful yet a pleasing token for my poor mother and a sweet memento of your bounty to them and of your inexpressible goodness and favor to her poor daughter  but how i presume and yet just now said i had nothing to ask  now i am unawares to myself upon the subject of petitioning how it would please me could i know it if the dear child i have just named were given to the care and example of my excellent miss darnford if she would be pleased to accept of the trust and if lady davers has no objection and would not choose to take the pretty soul under her own wing  i had once great pleasure in the hope of having this dear miss committed to my care  but what pleasures what happiness have i not had crowded into this last and this first happy thrice happy year  even more than most of my sex have had to boast of and those not unhappy neither in a long long life every day has brought with it some new felicity some new happiness as unlooked for as undeserved for oh best beloved of my heart how have you always met me in your comingsin left me at your goingsout with smiles and complacency the latter only distinguished from the former by a kind regret as the other was from that by a joy next to transport when all your dear generous heart appeared in your noble countenance and set my faithful one into responsive flutters to meet and receive it with all the grateful emotions that the chastest conjugal flame could inspire   but i must not dwell upon these charming charming reflections  my present doubts will not permit me to indulge them for if i were  how would my desires be rivetted to this earth  with what regret should i transfer my thoughts to a still more important and more necessary subject and with what ingratitude look up to a diviner and still more noble master who ought to be the ultimate of all our wishes and desires and who has given me you my dearest mr b and with you all that this world can make desirable  and has therefore a right to take away what he has given  and if i now die what a glory will it be to me to be permitted to discharge part of my obligations to the worthiest of gentlemen by laying down my life in the service of his honorable family  but let me say one word for my dear worthy mrs jervis her care and fidelity will be very necessary for your affairs dear sir while you remain single which i hope will not be long but whenever sir you make a second choice be pleased to allow her such an annuity as may make her independent and pass away the remainder of her life with comfort and ease and this the rather i presume to request as my late honored lady see vol iii p  0  once intimated the same thing to your generosity if i were to name what that may be it would not be with the thought of heightening but of limiting rather the natural bounty of your heart and fifty pounds a year would be a rich provision in her opinion and will intail upon you dear sir the blessings of one of the faithfullest and worthiest hearts in the kingdom  nor will christian charity permit me to forget the once wicked but now penitent jewkes i understand by miss darnford that she begs for nothing but to have the pleasure of dying in your service and of having by that means an opportunity given her of atoning for some small slips and mistakes in her accounts which she had made formerly as she accuses herself for she will have it that mr longman has been better to her than she deserved in passing one see for a hint of this vol i p    account particularly to which he had with too much reason objected do dear sir if your future happy lady has no great dislike to the poor woman be pleased to grant her request except her own mind should alter and she desire her dismission and be pleased to present her with my little book of select devotions with my notes in the interleaves it is in the bottom drawer of the right hand among my devotional miscellanies or rather much rather be pleased to order a copy of it to be made out for her and to give the original being mostly my own handwriting to my dear father this is a better thought by much for the dear good man will esteem it the more for that i wonder i did not think of this before   to the other servants i have only to leave my thanks and best wishes for their respectful love and dutiful behavior to one who from being once hardly the equal to some of them has been exalted to the honorable station of their mistress by your superlative goodness and favor no servants my dear mr b ever deserved a mistresss thanks if they do not for they every one of them most cheerfully came into all my little schemes and regulations and they have encouraged me by their ready obedience and their respectful loves to pursue to them the natural dictates of my own heart and have made all assumings and pride as unnecessary as they would have been grievous to me and censurable by every one else for was it not my high concern so to behave myself to all low as well as high that my best beloved benefactor should not by my arrogance or inattention have censurers of him added to enviers of me for the step he had taken so derogatory to his own honor and to that of his ancient and splendid family  to the favor of the best of masters i therefore leave them with this testimony of their merits and my kind regard to them which makes me venture to call them without one exception from my silverhaird jonathan to the lowest menial the best set of servants that gentleman ever had nor by miss darnfords account of the behavior of those at the hall do i find them at all unworthy of being classd with these here in the happy character and let me say my dearest mr b that i have been not a little attentive to their respective behaviors as well from my own as more particularly from mrs jerviss observations because i thought it my duty as well in justice to your dear self as to them  as to polly barlow to whom i was willing to behave with an eye to my dear good ladys kindness to myself i have nothing to say by way of distinction from the rest having hinted to mrs jervis to give her her advice from time to time and that if a good honest husband should offer she should advise the poor girl not to decline it  forgive me dearest sir for thus mentioning to you in this solemn letter so particularly your servants but the pleasure which their regularity and worthiness have given me together with the knowledge i have of their fidelity and affectionate duty to you methinks call for this testimony of my satisfaction in them and recommendation of them to your favor  and now what have i farther to say but to beg of god to shower down his most precious blessings upon you my dearest my first my last and my only love and to return to you an hundredfold the benefits which you have conferred upon me and mine and upon so many poor souls as you have blessed through my hands and that you may in your next choice be happy with a lady who may have every thing i want and who may love and honor you with the same affectionate duty which has been my delight and my glory to pay you for in this i am sure no one can exceed me  and after having given you long life prosperity and increase of honor translate you into a blessed eternity where through the merits of our common redeemer i hope i shall be allowed a place and be permitted o let me indulge that pleasing that consolatory thought to receive and rejoice in my restored spouse and principal earthly good for ever and ever are the prayers the last prayers if it so please god of my dearest dear mr b  your dutiful and affectionate wife and faithful servant p b  letter xxi from miss darnford to lady darnford my honored mamma you cannot conceive how you and my dear papa have delighted the heart of my good mrs b and obliged her mr b by the permission you have given me to attend her till the important hour shall be over with her for the dear lady is exceedingly apprehensive and one can hardly blame her for i dont believe there is such a happy couple in the world  i am glad to hear that the ceremony is over so much to both your satisfactions may this matrimony be but a tenth part as happy as that i am witness to and mr and mrs murray will have that to boast of which few married people have even among those we call happy  for my part i believe i shall never care to marry at all for though i cannot be so deserving yet i shall not bear to think of an husband much less excellent than mr b and by what i see in her apprehensions and by what i can conceive of the circumstance i dont think a young lady can be requited with a less worthy one for all she suffers on an husbands account and for the sake of his family and name  mrs andrews a discreet worthy soul as ever i knew and who in her aspect and behavior is far from being a disgrace even to mr bs lady is with her dear daughter to her no small satisfaction as you may suppose who nowandthen says what a foolish creature my dear mother have you for a daughter  you did not behave so weakly as i do when you were in the same circumstances i dare say and yet you had a dear good husband though not a rich one to hope to live for  but come i will have a good heart to make myself as worthy of the company and chearings of three such friends as i am blessed with in my mother my miss darnford and mrs jervis  mr b asked my advice yesterday about having in the house a midwife to be at hand at a moments warning i told him i feared the sight of such a person would terrify her and so he instantly started an expedient which her mother mrs jervis and myself approved of and have put into practice for this day i have mrs harris a distant relation of mine though not of yours sir and madam come to make me a visit from essex and mr b was so good as to prevail upon her in compliment to me as was pretended to accept of her board in his house while she stays in town which she says will be about a week  now you must know that this mrs harris being a discreet modest matronlike person mrs b took a liking to her at first sight and is already very familiar with her and understanding that she is a gentlewoman who was a doctor of physicks lady and takes as much delight in administering to the health of her own sex as her husband used to do to that of both mrs b says it is very fortunate that she has so experienced a lady to consult as she is such a novice in her own case  mr b however to carry on the honest imposture better just now in presence of mrs harris and mrs andrews and me asked the former if it was not necessary to have in the house the good woman this frighted mrs b who turned pale and said she could not bear the thoughts of it mrs harris said it was highly necessary that mrs b if she would not permit the gentlewoman to be in the house should see her and that then she apprehended there would be no necessity as she supposed she did not live far off to have her in the house since mrs b was so uneasy upon that account this pleased mrs b much and mrs thomas was admitted to attend her  now you must know that this is the assistant of my new relation and she being apprisd of the matter came but never did i see so much shyness and apprehension as mrs b showed all the time mrs thomas was with her holding sometimes her mother sometimes mrs harris by the hand and being ready to sweat with terror  mrs harris scraped acquaintance with mrs thomas who pretending to recollect her gave mrs harris great praises which increased mrs bs confidence in her and she undertakes to govern the whole so that the dreaded mrs thomas need not come till the very moment which is no small pleasure to the dear overnice lady and she seems every hour to be better pleased with mrs harris who by her prudent talk will more and more familiarize her to the circumstance unawares to herself in a manner but notwithstanding this precaution of a midwife in the house mr b intends to have a gentleman of the profession in readiness for fear of the worst  i tell mr b he is very happy in this stratagem but that i suppose he has been more used to contrivances of this sort than he ought and was so free as to add that i presumed his lady is hardly the first he has cheated into a child and indeed i think mrs bs merit to the rest of her sex is very great were it only in reforming such an uncommonly agreeable and manly rake as this for no doubt he has done and would have done a world of mischief among the thoughtless and indiscreet in upper life for his taste when at the worst always lay it seems above the vulgar  mrs b has written a letter and the superscription following will tell you to whom it is directed to the ever honored and ever dear mr b with prayers for his health honor and prosperity in this world and everlasting felicity in that to come p b it is sealed with black wax and she gave it me this moment on her being taken ill to give to mr b if she dies but god of his mercy avert that and preserve the dear lady for the honor of her sex and the happiness of all that know her and particularly for that of your polly darnford for i cannot have a greater loss i am sure while my honored papa and mamma are living and may that be for many very many happy years  i will not close this letter till all is over happily as i hope  mrs b is better again and has occasionally made some fine reflections directing herself to me but designed for the benefit of her polly on the subject of the inconsideration of some of our sex with regard to this circumstance inferring that if such are her apprehensions though a lawful wife and such the danger attending this case how must it leave a poor creature destitute of all spiritual consolation as well as of the assistance and comfortings of the nearest friends and of a kind husband when she has sacrificed her honor and cannot think of any thing so probable as the moment approaches but that god will punish her in kind as she called it that is to say added she by the very sufferings which are the natural consequences of the sin she has so wickedly committed  i knew what her design was and said ay polly let you and me and every single young body bear these reflections in mind pronounced by so excellent a lady in moments so arduous as these  the girl wept and very movingly fell down by the door on her knees praying to god to preserve her dear lady and she should be happy for ever  that as mrs b so often prettily writes was her word  mrs b is exceedingly pleased with my new relation mrs harris as we call her who behaves with so much prudence that she suspects nothing and told mrs jervis she wished nobody else was to come near her and as she goes out being a person of eminence in her way two or three times a day and last night staid out late mrs b said she hoped she would not be out when she should wish her to be at home  i have the pleasure the very great pleasure my dear papa and mamma to acquaint you and i know you will rejoice with me upon it that just half an hour ago my dear mrs b was brought tobed of a fine boy  we are all out of our wits for joy almost i ran down to mr b myself who received me with trembling impatience a boy a fine boy dear mr b said i a son and heir indeed  but how does my pamela is she safe is she like to do well we hope so said i or i had not come down to you i will assure you he folded me in his arms in a joyful rapture how happy you make me dearest miss darnford if my pamela is safe the boy is welcome welcome indeed  but when may i go up to thank my jewel   mrs andrews is so overjoyed and so thankful that there is no getting her from her knees  a man and horse is dispatched already to lady davers and another ordered to kent to the good old man  mrs jervis when i went up said she must go down and release the good folks from their knees for half an hour before they declared they would not stir from that posture till they heard how it went with their lady and when the happy news was brought them of her safety and a young master they were quite ecstatick she says in their joy and not a dry eye among them shaking hands and congratulating one another men and maids which must make it one of the most affecting sights that can be imagined and mr longman who had no power to leave the house for three days past though business required his presence in bedfordshire sought his worthy principal and never was so much moving joy seen as this honesthearted steward ran over with  i have not mrs bs pen so cannot draw these affecting scenes of joy as she could have done had she been in my case  let me only say i never saw such a familyjoy in my life and who would care for royalty and all its pageantry when virtue can thus interest every body in its concerns and on such an occasion as this give that general and sincere joy to all within its circle that could fill a nation on the birth of a firstborn prince from sovereigns the most beloved  i did a foolish thing in my joy  i gave mr b the letter designed for him had an unhappy event followed and he will not give it me again but says he will obtain mrs bs leave when she is better to open it and the happier turn will augment his thankfulness to god and love to her when he shall by this means be blessed with sentiments so different from what the other case would have afforded but i will get it from him if i can and give it her back for one knows not what it may contain yet her innocence and purity make one less apprehensive a good deal for i dare say she has no excuses to make for failings he knows nothing of  mrs b had a very sharp time never more my dear papa talk of a husband to me indeed in the mind i am in i will never be married  place all your expectations on nancy not one of these men that i have yet seen mr b excepted and you know what a chance it was that he would be so good is worth running these risques for but his indearments and tenderness to his lady his thankful and manly gratitude and politeness when he was admitted to pay his respects to her and his behavior to mrs andrews and to us all though but for a visit of ten minutes was alone worthy of all her risque  i would give you a description of it had i mrs bs pen and of twenty agreeable scenes and conversations besides but for want of that must conclude with my humble duty as becomes honored sir and madam  your ever grateful polly darnford you may guess at our hurry for i have been three days writing this letter piece by piece    letter xxii from the same my honored papa and mamma we have nothing but joy and festivity in this house and it would be endless to tell you the congratulations the happy family receives every day from tenants and friends mr b you know was always deemed one of the kindest landlords in england and his tenants are so overjoyed at the happy event which has given them a young landlord of his name for all those who live in that large part of the estate which came by lady b his mother were much afraid of having any of sir jacob swynfords family for their landlord who they say are all made up of pride and cruelty and would have racked them to death that they had a voluntary meeting of about twenty of the principal of them to rejoice on the occasion and it was unanimously agreed to make a present of a piece of gilt plate to serve as a basin for the christening to the value of one hundred guineas on which is to be engraven the following inscription in acknowlegement of the humanity and generosity of the best of landlords and as a token of his tenants joy on the happy birth of a son and heir who will it is hoped inherit his fathers generosity and his mothers virtues this piece of plate is with all due gratitude presented as a christening basin to all the children that shall proceed from such worthy parents and their descendants to the end of time  by the obliged and joyful tenants of the maternal estate in bedfordshire and gloucestershire the initials of whose names are underingraven viz     then are to follow the first letters of each persons christian and surname   what an honor is this to a landlord in my opinion far very far surpassing the misnomerd freegifts that we read of in some kingdoms on extraordinary occasions some of them like this for here it is all truly spontaneous  a free gift indeed and mr b took it very kindly and has put off the christening for a week to give time for its being completed and inscribed as above  such good tenants such a good wife such blessings from heaven following him nobody i tell mr b has so much encouragement to be good as he has and if hereafter he should swerve he would not have the least excuse and would be the ungratefullest man breathing  the earl and countess of c  and lord and lady davers are here to stand in person at the christening and you cannot conceive how greatly my lady davers is transported with joy to have a son and heir to the estate she is every hour almost thanking her dear sister for him and reads in the child all the great qualities she forms to herself in him it is indeed a charming boy and has a great deal if one may judge of a child so very young of his fathers manly aspect the dear lady herself is still but weak but the joy of all around her and her spouses tenderness and politeness give her cheerful and free spirits and she is all serenity ease and thankfulness  mrs b as soon as the danger was over asked me for her letter with the black seal i had been very earnest to get it from mr b but to no purpose so i was forced to tell her who had it she said but very composedly she was sorry for it and hoped he had not opened it  he came into her chamber soon after and i demanded it before her he said he had designed to ask her leave to break the seal which he had not yet done nor would without her consent  you will see nothing in it sir said the dear lady but a grateful heart a faithful love and my prayers that god will be as good to you as you have been to me  will you give me leave my dear said he to break the seal if you do sir let it not be in my presence but it is too serious not my dear now the apprehension is so happily over it may now add to my joy and my thankfulness on that account then do as you please sir but i had rather you would not  then here it is miss darnford i had it from you it was put into your hands and there i place it again that is something like said i considering the gentleman mrs b i hope we shall bring him into good order between us in time  so i returned it to the dear writer who lifted up her eyes and her lips moving showed a thankful ejaculation that she was spared to receive it back again and put it into her bosom  i related to lady davers when she came this circumstance and she i believe has got leave to take it with her she is very proud of all opportunities now of justifying her brothers choice and doing honor to his spouse with lady betty c who is her great favorite and who delights to read mrs bs letters  you desire to know my honored papa how mr b passes his time and whether it be in his ladys chamber no indeed catch gentlemen the best of them in too great a complaisance that way if you can what then does he pass his time with me you are pleased to ask what a disadvantage a man lies under who has been once a rake but i am so generally with mrs b that when i tell you sir that his visits to her are pretty much polite form i believe i answer all you mean by your questions and especially when i remind you sir thai lady and lord davers and the earl and countess and your unworthy daughter are at dinner and suppertime always together for mrs andrews who is not yet gone back to kent breakfasts dines and sups with her beloved daughter and is hardly ever out of her room  then sir mr b and the earl and lord davers give pretty constant application to the business of parliament and nowandthen sup abroad  so sir we are all upon honor and i could wish only that your pleasantry always gives me joy as it is a token that you have your muchdesired health and freedom of spirits that even in jest my mammas daughter might pass unquestioned  but i know why you do it it is only to put me out of heart to ask to stay longer yet i wish  but i know you will not permit me to go through the whole winter here  will my dear papa grant it do you think my honored mamma if you were to lay the highest obligation upon your dutiful daughter and petition for me and should you care to try  i dare not hope it myself you see madam but when one sees a gentleman here who denies his lady nothing that she asks it makes one be ready to wish methinks that lady darnford was as happy in that particular as lady b   your indulgence for this winter this one winter or rather this small remainder of winter i make not so much doubt of you see madam i know you will call me a bold girl but then you always when you do condescend to grant my request and i will be as good as ever i can afterward i will fetch up all the lost time rise an hour sooner in the morning go tobed an hour sooner at night flower my papa any thing he pleases read him to sleep when he pleases put his gout into good humor when it will be soothed  and mrs b will to crown all come down with me by permission of her sovereign lord who will attend her you may be sure and will not all this do to procure me a month or two more  if it will not why then i will thank you for your past indulgence and with all duty and cheerfulness bid adieu to this dear london this dearer family and attend a still dearer papa and mamma whose dutiful daughter i will ever be whilst  polly darnford  letter xxiii to the same my honored papa and mamma i have received your joint commands and intnd to set out on wednesday next week i hope i shall find my papa in better health than he is at present and in better humor too for i am very sorry he is displeased with my petitioning for a little longer time in london it is very severe to impute to me want of duty and affection to you both which would if deserved make me very unworthy of your indulgence  mr b and his dear lady are resolved to accompany me in their coach and six till your chariot meets me if you will be pleased to permit it so to do and even set me down at your gate if it do not but he vows that he will not alight at your house nor let his lady neither but i say that this is a misplaced resentment because i ought to think it a favor that you have indulged me so much as you have and yet even this is likewise a favor on their side to me because it is an instance of their fondness for your unworthy daughters company  mrs b is if possible more lovely since her lyingin than before she has so much delight in her nursery that i fear it will take her off from her pen which will be a great loss to all whom she used to oblige with her correspondence indeed this new object of her care is a charming child and she is exceedingly pleased with her nurse  for she is not permitted as she very much desired to perform that office herself  she makes a great proficiency in the french and italian languages and well she may for she has the best schoolmaster in the world and one whom she loves better than lady ever loved a tutor he is lofty and will not be disputed with but i never saw a more polite and tender husband for all that and well may a lady blessed as she is bear with a little imperiousness sometimes which however she nips in the bud by her sweetness of temper and ready compliance but then he is a man of sense and a lady need be the less concerned to yield a point to a man of sense and of generosity as he is who is incapable of treating her the worse for her resignation and complacency whenever i marry it shall be to a man of sense and a generous man against the world for such an one cannot treat a woman ill as mrs b often observes  we had a splendid christening and exceedingly well ordered and every body was highly delighted at it the quality gossips went away but on tuesday and my lady davers took leave of her charming sister with all the blessings and all the kindness and affectionate fondness to her that could be expressed  mr andrews that worthy old man came up to see his grandson yesterday and in order to attend his wife down you would never have forgotten the good mans behavior had you seen it to his daughter and to the charming child i wish i could describe it to you but i am apt to think mrs b will take notice of it to lady davers and if she enters into the description of it while i stay i will beg a copy of it to bring down with me because i know you were pleased with the sensible plain good man and his ways when at the hall in your neighborhood  the child is named william that i should have told you but i write without any manner of connection just as things come uppermost but dont my dear papa construe this too as an instance of disrespect i wish you was not so angry with me it makes me almost afraid to see you  as i said i shall set out next wednesday in mr bs coach and six and as we shall keep the main road all the way i shall see by my being met how i am to be received or whether pardoned or not mr b says he will take me back again if my dear papa frown at me ever so little and he will not deliver me up into any other hands but his neither  we have been at several plays and at the opera diverse times for we make the best of our time as it is so short and we feared how it would be though i hoped i should not have anger neither mrs b is taken up with writing between whiles remarks upon the plays etc she sees in a little book for lady davers she sent that lady her remarks upon one or two with which she is so well pleased that she will not let even her nursery pass for an excuse from writing on upon those subjects and this will so ingross the dear ladys pen that i shall not be favored so much as i used to be but lady davers promises me to lend me the book when she has read it so that will be some satisfaction  i see but one thing that can possibly happen to disturb the felicity of this charming couple and that i will mention in confidence mr b and mrs b and myself were at the masquerade before she layin there was a lady greatly taken with mr b she was in a nuns habit and followed him wherever he went and mr turner a gentleman of one of the inns of court who visits mr b sometimes and is an old acquaintance of his tells me by the bye that the lady took an opportunity to unmask to mr b mr turner has since found she is the young countess dowager of  a fine lady but not the most prudent in her conduct of late since her widowhood and he has since discovered as he says that a letter or two has passed between mr b and that lady if not more  now mrs b with all her perfections has as she owns a little spice of jealousy and should she be once alarmed i tremble for the consequences to both their happiness  it is my opinion that if ever any thing makes a misunderstanding between them it will be from some such quarter as this but it is a thousand pities it should and i hope as to the actual correspondence begun mr turner is mistaken  but be it as it will i would not for the world the first hints of this matter should come from me  mr b is a very enterprising and gallant gentleman is a fine figure of a man and very genteel and i dont wonder a lady may like him but be seems so pleased so satisfied with his lady and carries it to her with so much tenderness and affection that i hope her merit and this his affection for her will secure his conjugal fidelity  if it prove otherwise and she discovers it i know no one that would be more miserable than mrs b as well from motives of piety and virtue as from the excessive love she bears him  but i hope for better things for both their sakes   my humble thanks for all your indulgences to me with hopes that you will not my dear papa and mamma hold your displeasure against me when i throw myself at your feet as i now soon hope to do conclude me  your dutiful daughter m darnford  letter xxiv from mrs b to lady davers my dear lady we are just returned from accompanying the worthy miss darnford as far as bedford in her way home where her papa and mamma met her in a coach and four sir simon put on his pleasant airs and schooled mr b for persuading his daughter to stay so long from him me for putting her upon asking to stay longer and miss for being persuaded by us  i think he is worse than ever in his way of talk and for my rebukes to him for he ran on a deal of stuff about me and my late circumstance and would have it that i am so much improved that i ought to make a courtsy to mr b once an hour he said when i was angry at him and his lady blamed him that it was all pure revenge for my letter see vol iii p  0        and for keeping miss so long from him  we tarried two days together at bedford for we knew not how to part and then we took a most affectionate leave of each other  we struck out of the road a little to make a visit to the dear house where we tarried one night and next morning before any body could come to congratulate us designing to be incog we proceeded on our journey to london and found my dearest dear boy in charming health  what a new pleasure has god almightys goodness bestowed upon me which after every little absence rises upon me in a true maternal tenderness every step i move toward the dear little blessing  yet sometimes i think your dear brother is not so fond of him as i wish him to be he says it is time enough for him to mind him when he can return his notice and be grateful  a negligent word int it madam  considering   my dear father came to town to accompany my good mother down to kent and they set out three or four days after your ladyship left us it is impossible to describe the joy with which his worthy heart overflowed when he congratulated us on the happy event and as he had been apprehensive for his daughters safety judge my lady what his transports must be to see us all safe and well and happy and a son given to dear mr b by his greatly honored daughter  i was in the nursery when he came so was my mother miss darnford also was there and mr b who was in his closet at his arrival after having received his most respectful congratulations himself brought him up though he has not been there since indeed he has not pamela said the dear gentleman see who is here  i sprung to him and kneeled for his kind blessing o my father said i see pointing to the dear baby at the nurses breast how god almighty has answered all our prayers  he dropped down on his reverend knees by me clasping me in his indulgent arms o my daughter  o my blessed daughter  and do i once more see you and see you safe and well  i do i do  blessed be thy name o gracious god for these thy mercies  while we were thus joined happy father and happy daughter in one thanksgiving prayer the sweet baby having fallen asleep the nurse had put it into the cradle and when my father rose from me he went to my mother god bless my dear betty said he i longed to see you after this separation here is joy here is pleasure o how happy are we and taking her hand he kneeled down on one side the cradle and my mother on the other both looking at the dear baby with eyes running over and hand in hand he prayed in the most fervent manner for a blessing upon the dear infant and that god almighty would make him an honor to his fathers family and to his mothers virtue that was his kind word and that in the words of scripture he might grow on and be in favor both with the lord and with men   they both rose and mr b taking my hand and miss darnfords your ladyship may guess how we were moved for miss is a sweetnaturd lady you know madam my dear pamela how these kind these grateful hearts affect me  do you often my dear miss darnford see scenes wrought up by the poets to this moving height  here we behold and admire that noble simplicity in which nature always triumphs over her handmaid art  and which makes a scene of joy as affecting to a noble mind as that of the deepest distress else how could it display its force thus sweetly on your lovely cheek and he saluted the dear miss and me too  mr b has just put into my hands mr lockess treatise on education and he commands me to give him my thoughts upon it in writing he has a very high regard for this author and tells me that my tenderness for billy will make me think some of the first advice given in it a little harsh perhaps but although he has not read it through only having dipped into it here and there he believes from the name of the author i cannot have a better directory and my opinion of it after i have well considered it will inform him he says of my own capacity and prudence and how far he may rely upon both in the point of a first education  i asked if i might not be excused writing only making my observations here and there to himself as i found occasion but he says i shall myself better consider it and be more a mistress of the subject and he shall the better attend to my reasonings when they are put into writing and surely my dear said he you may in such an important point as this as well oblige me with a little of your penmanship as our other dear friends  after this your ladyship will judge i had not another word to say he cuts one to the heart when he speaks so seriously  i have looked a little into it it is a book quite accommodated to my case being written to a gentlegentleman the authors friend for the regulation of his conduct toward his children but how shall i do madam if in such a famed and renowned author i see already some few things that i think want clearing up will not it look like intolerable vanity in such a one as me to find fault with such a genius as mr lockes  but i will consider of the matter thoroughly before i set pen to paper for although he writes in a very familiar and intelligible style perhaps i may not understand him at once reading  but i must on this occasion give your ladyship the particulars of a short conversation between your dear brother and me which however perhaps will not be to my advantage because it will show you what a teizing body i can be if i am indulged  but mr b will not spoil me neither in that way no fear of that i dare say  your ladyship will see this in the very dialogue i shall give you  thus it was i had been reading in mr lockes book and mr b asked me how i liked it exceedingly well sir but i have a proposal to make which if you will be pleased to comply with will give me a charming opportunity of understanding mr lock  what is your proposal my dear i see it is some very particular one by that sweet earnestness in your look  why so it is replied i and i must know whether you are in a high good humor with me before i make it i think you look grave upon me and my proposal will not then do i am sure  you have all the amusing ways of your sex my dear pamela but tell me what you would say you know i dont love suspense  may be youre busy sir perhaps i break in upon you i believe you were going into your closet  true woman  said he how you love to put one upon the tenters yet my life for yours by your parade what i just now thought important is some pretty trifle  speak it at once or i will be angry with you and tappd my cheek  well i wish i had not come just now  i see you are not in a quite good humor enough for my proposal  so pray sir excuse me till tomorrow  he took my hand and led me to his closet calling me his pretty impertinent and then urging me i said  you know sir i have not been used to the company of children your dear billy will not make me fit for a long time to judge of any part of education i can learn of the charming boy nothing but the baby conduct but now if you would permit me to take into the house some little master of three or four years old or miss of five or six i should watch over all their little ways and now reading a chapter in the child and now a chapter in the book i shall be enabled to look forward and with advantage into the subject and to go through all the parts of education tolerably for one of my capacity for sir i can by my own defects and what i have wished to mend know how to judge of and supply that part of life which carries one up to eleven or twelve years of age which was mine when my lady took me  a pretty thought pamela but tell me who will part with their child think you would you do it if it were your own case although you were ever so well assured of the advantages your littleone would reap by it  for dont you consider my dear that the child ought to be wholly subjected to your authority that its father or mother ought seldom to see it because it should think itself absolutely dependent upon you  and where my dear will you meet with parents so resigned  besides one would have the child descended of genteel parents and not such as could do nothing for it otherwise the turn of mind and education you would give it might do it more harm than good  all this is true sir very true but would you have no other objection if one could find a genteelly descended young master and would you join to persuade his papa to give me up this power only from three months to three months as i liked and the child liked and as the papa approved of my proceedings  this is so reasonable with these last conditions pamela that i should be pleased with your notion if it could be put in practice because the child would be benefited by your instruction and you would be improved in an art that i could wish to see you an adept in  but perhaps sir you had rather it were a miss than a master  i had my dear if a miss could be found whose parents would give her up to you but i suppose you have some master in your head by your putting it upon that sex at first  let me see sir you say you are in a good humor let me see if you be  looking boldly in his face  he saluted me what now would the pretty fool be at  only sir that you have nothing to do but to speak the word and there is a miss whose papa and mamma too i am sure would consent to give up to me for my own instruction as well as for her sake and if to speak in the scripture phrase i have found grace in your sight kind sir speak this word to the dear misss papa  and have you thus come over with me pamela  go i am half angry with you for leading me on in this manner against myself this looks so artful that i will not love you  dear sir  and dear madam too begone i say  you have surprised me by art when your talent is nature and you should keep to that  i was sadly balkd and vexed and had neither power to go nor stay  at last seeing i had put him into a kind of flutter as now he had put me i moved my unwilling feet toward the door  he took a turn about the closet mean time  yet stay said he there is something so generous in your art that on recollection i cannot part with you  he took notice of the starting tear  i am to blame  you had surprised me so that my hasty temper got the better of my consideration let me kiss away this pearly fugitive forgive me my dearest love what brutes are such passionate wretches as me when compared to such angels as my pamela i see at once now all the force and all the merit of your amiable generosity and to make you amends for this my hastiness and inconsiderate harshness i will cooly consider of this matter and will either satisfy you by my compliance or by the reasons i will give for the contrary  but say my pamela can you forgive my hastiness  can i sir yes indeed clasping my arms about him and bid me go and begone twenty times a day if i am to be thus kindly called back to you thus nobly and condescendingly treated in the same breath almost  i see dear sir continued i that i must be in fault if ever you are lastingly displeased with me  for as soon as you turn yourself about your anger vanishes and you make me rich amends for speaking a few harsh words only one thing dear sir let me add if i have dealt artfully with you impute it to my fear of offending you through the nature of my petition and not through design and that i took the example of the prophet to king david in the parable of the ewelamb  i remember it my dear  and you have well pointed your parable and had nothing to do but to say thou art the man  i am called upon by my dear benefactor for a little airing and he suffers me only to conclude this long letter knowing to whom i have the honor to write this being postday and so i am obliged with greater abruptness than i had designed to mention thankfully your ladyships goodness to me particularly in that kind kind letter see letter xix in this volume  which your dear brother showed me this morning and not before  i believe for fear i should be so much oppressed by the sense of your ladyships unmerited goodness to me had he showed it me before your departure from us that i should not be able to look up to you heaping favors and blessings upon me as you hourly were besides what a happy happy creature am i  but my gratitude runs me into length and sorry i am that i cannot have time just now to indulge it  but yet i am apt sometimes to doubt whether i ought to think myself so very happy and whether it is not an argument of a mean spirit because i am under obligations unreturnable obligations to every living soul as well as to your ladyship and yet can rejoice in them as if it was such a glorious thing to be obliged when it is not in ones power to oblige again  is there nothing my dear lord and lady davers is there nothing my dear countess and my good lord c that i can do to show at least that i have a will and am not an ungrateful and a sordid creature  and yet if you give me power to do any thing that will have the appearance of a return even that power will be laying a fresh obligation upon me  which however i should be very proud of because i should thereby convince you by something more than words how much i am most particularly to yourself my dearest lady davers my sister my friend my patroness  your most obliged and faithful servant p b your dear brother joins in respectful thankfulfulness to his four noble gossips and i made my billy by his lips subscribe his i hope so to direct his earliest notions as to make him sensible of his dutiful obligations to such noble and good godpapas and mammas    letter xxv from lady davers to mrs b my dearest pamela talk not to us of unreturnable obligations and all that as by your last letter you do more for us in the entertainment you give us all by your letters than we have done or ever can for you and as to me i know no greater pleasure in the world than my brothers felicity and yours god continue it to you both i am sure it will be his fault and not yours if it be at all diminished  we have heard some idle rumors here as if you were a little uneasy of late and having not had a letter from you for this fortnight past it makes me write to ask how you all do and whether you expected an answer from me to your last  i hope you wont be punctilious with me my pamela for we have nothing to write to you about except it be how much we all love and honor you and that you believe already or else you dont do us justice  i suppose you will be going out of town soon now the parliament is rising my lord is resolved to put his proxy into another hand and intends i believe to take my brothers advice in it both the earl and his lordship are highly pleased with my brothers moderate and independent principles he has got great credit among all unprejudiced men by the part he acted throughout the last sessions in which he has shown that he would no more join to distress and clog the wheels of government by an unreasonable opposition than he would do the dirty work of any administration as he has so noble a fortune and wants nothing of any body he would be doubly to blame to take any other part than that of his country in which he has so great a stake  may he act out of the house and in the house with equal honor and he will be his countrys pride and your pride and mine too which is the wish of  your affectionate sister b davers if you want a pretense to kiss my dear boy give him nowandthen one for me i hope he improves under the eye of so careful a mamma the little rogue will else be unworthier than i wish him to be i hope you proceed with my book i must see your observations on lock too twas a charming pretty thought of yours that of miss goodwin a hasty wretch how could he be angry  twas well he so soon considered of the matter and asked pardon    letter xxvi my dearest lady i have been a little in disorder that i have some little rubs have happened i hope they will be happily removed but i am unwilling to believe all that is said this is a wicked town though i wish we were out of it but i see not when that will be i wish mr b would let me and my billy go into kent but i dont care to leave him behind me neither and he is not inclined to go excuse my brevity my dearest lady but i must break off with only assuring your ladyship that i am and ever will be  your obliged and grateful p b  letter xxvii my dearest pamela i understand things go not so well as i wish if you think my coming up to town and resideing with you while you stay in it will be of service to you or help to get you out of it i will set out directly i will pretend some indisposition and a desire of consulting your london physicians or any thing you shall think fit to be done by  your affectionate sister and faithful friend b davers  letter xxviii my dearest lady a thousand thanks for your goodness to me but i hope all will be well i hope god will enable me to act so prudent a part as will touch his generous breast be pleased to tell me what your ladyship has heard but it becomes not me i think till i cannot help it to make any appeals for i know those will not be excused and i do all i can to suppress my uneasiness before him but i pay for it when i am alone my nursery and my reliance on god i should have said the latter first are all my consolation  god preserve and bless you my good lady and my noble lord but i am apt to think your ladyships presence will not avail prays  your affectionate and obliged p b  letter xxix why does not my sweet girl subscribe sister as usual i have done nothing amiss to you i love you dearly and ever will i cannot help my brothers faults but i hope he uses you with politeness and decency he shall be none of my brother if he dont i rest a great deal upon your prudence and it will be very meritorious if you can overcome yourself so as to act unexceptionably though it may not be deserved on this occasion for in doing so you will have a triumph over nature itself for my dear girl as you have formerly owned you have a little touch see p  0 of this volume of jealousy in your composition  what i have heard is no secret to any body the injured party is generally the last that hears in these cases and you shall not first be told any thing by me that must afflict you but cannot you more than it does me god give you patience and comfort the wicked lady has a deal to answer for to disturb such an uncommon happiness but no more than that i am  your ever affectionate sister b davers i am all impatience to hear how you conduct yourself on this trying occasion let me know what you have heard and how you came to hear it    letter xxx why dont i subscribe sister asks my dearest lady davers  i have not had the courage to do it of late for my title to that honor arises from the dear thrice dear mr b and how long i may be permitted to call him mine i cannot say but since you command it i will call your ladyship by that beloved name let the rest happen as god shall see fit  mr b cannot be unpolite but he is cold and a little cross and short in his speeches to me i try to hide my grief from every body and from him most for my dear lady neither my father mother nor miss darnford know any thing from me mrs jervis from whom i seldom hide any thing as she is on the spot with me hears not my complainings nor my uneasiness for i would not lessen the dear gentleman he may yet see the error of the way he is in god grant it for his own sake as well as mine  i am even sorry your ladyship is afflicted with the knowledge of the matter  the poor unhappy lady god forgive her is to be pitied she loves him and having strong passions and being unused to be controlled is lost to a sense of honor and justice poor poor lady  o these wicked masquerades from them springs all my unhappiness my spaniard was too amiable and met with a lady who was no nun but in habit every one was taken with him in that habit so suited to the natural dignity of his person  o these wicked wicked masquerades  i am all patience in appearance all uneasiness in reality i did not think i could especially in this point this most affecting point be such an hypocrite it has cost me  your ladyship knows not what it has cost me to be able to assume that character yet my eyes are swelled with crying and look red although i am always breatheing on my hand and patting them with that and my warm breath to hide the distress that will from my overcharged heart appear in them  then he says what is the matter with the little fool youre always in this way what ails you pamela  only a little vapourish sir  nasty vapors dont be angry at me  then billy i thought was not very well  this boy will spoil your temper at this rate what should be your joy will become your misfortune dont receive me in this manner i charge you  in what manner sir i always receive you with a grateful heart if any thing troubles me it is in your absence but see sir then i try to smile and seem pleased i am all sunshine now you are come  dont you see i am  yes your sunshine of late is all through a cloud  i know not what is the matter with you your temper will alter and then   it shall not alter sir  it shall not  if i can help it  and then i kissed his hand that dear hand that perhaps was last about his more beloved countesss neck  distracting reflection  but come maybe i think the worst  to be sure i do  for my apprehensions were ever aforehand with events and bad must be the case if it is worse than i think it but it will ripen of itself it is a corroding evil it will increase to its crisis and then it may dissipate happily or end in death  all that grieves me for i have had the happiness of a whole life crowded thick upon me into a few past months and so ought to be grateful for the good i have reaped is for his own dear sake for his souls sake  but come he is a young gentleman and may see his error  this may be a trial to him as well as to me and if he should conquer it what a charming charming thing would that be  you command me to let you know what i have heard and how i came to hear it i told your ladyship in one of my former see this vol p  0  that two gentlemen brought up to the law but above the practice of it though i doubt not above practices less honorable had visited us on coming to town  they have been often here since mr turner particularly and sometimes by himself when mr b has happened to be out and he it was as i guessed that gave me at the wicked masquerade the caution of looking after my musidorus ibid p       i did not like their visits and his much less for he seemed to me a man of an intriguing spirit but about three weeks ago mr b setting out upon a party of pleasure to oxford he came and pretending great business with me and i happening to be at breakfast in the parlour only polly attending me admitted him to drink a dish of chocolate with me and when polly had stepped down he told me after many apologies that he had discovered who the nun was at the masquerade that had engaged mr b  i said it was very indifferent to me who the lady was  he replied making still more apologies and pretending great reluctance to speak out that it was no less a lady than the young countess dowager of  a lady noted for her wit and her beauty but of a gay character though he believed not yet culpable  i was alarmed but would not let him see it and he run into the topic of the injustice of married gentlemen who had virtuous wives and gave themselves up to intrigues of this kind  i remembered some of mr bs lessons formerly of which i once gave your ladyship a transcript see vol ii p      particularly that of drawing a kind veil over his faults and extenuating those i could not hide and still more particularly that caution that if ever rakes attempted a married lady their encouragement proceeded from the slights and contempts with which they endeavored to inspire her against her husband and i told mr turner that i was so well satisfied in mr bs affection for me and his wellknown honor that i could not think myself obliged to any gentleman who should endeavor to give me a less opinion of either than i ought to have  he then bluntly told me that the very party mr b was upon was with the countess for one and the lord  who had married her sister  i said i was glad he was in such good company and wished him all manner of pleasure in it  he hoped he said he might trust to my discretion that i would not let mr b know from whom i had the information that indeed his motive was selfinterest in mentioning it to me for that he had presumed to make some overtures of an honorable nature to the countess in his own behalf which had been rejected since that masquerade night and that he hoped the prudent use i would make of the intimation might somehow be a means to break off that correspondence before it was attended with bad consequences  i told him coldly though it stung me to the heart that i should not interfere in the matter at all that i was fully assured of mr bs honor and was sorry he mr turner had so bad an opinion of a lady for whom he professed so high a consideration and rising up will you excuse me sir that i cannot attend at all to such a subject as this and think i ought not and so must withdraw  only madam one word he offered to take my hand but i would not permit it  and then he swore a great oath that he had told me his true and his only motive and that letters had passed between the countess and mr b adding that one day i would blame myself for not endeavoring to stifle a flame that might now perhaps be kept under but which if it got head would be of more fatal consequence to my repose than i at present imagined  but said he i beg you will keep it in your own breast else it may from two such hasty spirits as his and mine possibly be attended with still worse consequences  i will never sir enter into a subject that is not proper to be communicated every tittle of it to mr b and this must be my excuse for withdrawing and away i went from him  your ladyship will judge with how uneasy an heart which became more so when i sat down to reflect upon what he had told me but i was resolved to give it as little credit as i could or that any thing would come of it till mr bs own behavior should convince me to my affliction that i had some reason to be alarmed so i opened not my lips about it to mrs jervis or any body  at mr bs return i received him in my usual affectionate and unreserved manner and he behaved himself with as great goodness and kindness to me as usual or at least with so little difference that had not the gentlemans officiousness made me more watchful i should not have perceived it  but next day a letter was brought by a footman for mr b he was out so john gave it to me the superscription was a ladys writing the seal the dowager ladys with a coronet this gave me great uneasiness and when mr b came in i said here is a letter for you sir and from a lady too  what then  said he with quickness  i was balked and withdrew for i saw him turn the seal about and about as if he would see if i had endeavored to look into it  he needed not to have been so afraid for i would not have done such a thing had i known my life was to depend upon it  i went up and could not help weeping at his quick answer yet i did my endeavor to hide it when he came up  was not my girl a little inquisitive upon me just now  i spoke pleasantly sir  but you were very quick upon your girl  it is my temper my dear  you know i mean nothing you should not mind it  i should not sir if i had been used to it  he looked at me with sternness  do you doubt my honor madam  madam did you say sir  i will not take that word  dear sir call it back  i will not be called madam  call me your girl your rustic your pamela  call me any thing but madam  my charmer then my life my soul will any of those do and saluted me but whatever you do let me not see that you have any doubts of my honor to you  the very mention of the word dear sir is a security to me i want no other i cannot doubt but if you speak short to me how shall i bear that  he withdrew speaking nothing of the contents of his letter as i dare say he would had the subject been such as he chose to mention to me  we being alone after supper i took the liberty to ask him who was of his party to oxford he named the viscountess  and her lord mr howard and his daughter mr herbert and his lady and i had a partner too my dear to  present you  i am much obliged to the lady sir be she who she would  why my dear you are so engaged in your nursery then this was a sudden thing as you know i told you  nay sir as long as it was agreeable to you i had nothing to do but to be pleased with it  he watched my eyes and the turn of my countenance  you look pamela as if you would be glad to return the lady thanks in person shall i engage her to visit you she longs to see you  sir  sir  hesitated i  as you please  i cannot be  i cannot be  displeased  displeased  interrupted he why that word and why that hesitation in your answer you speak very volubly my dear when youre not moved  dear sir said i almost as quick as himself why should i be moved what occasion is there for it i hope you have a better opinion of me than   than what  pamela  what would you say i know youre a little jealous slut i know you are  but dear sir why should you think of imputing jealousy to me on this score  what a creature must i be if you could not be abroad with a lady but i must be jealous of you  no sir i have reason to rely upon your honor and i do rely upon it and   and what why my dear you are giving me assurances as if you thought the case required it  ah thought i so it does i see too plainly or apprehend i do but i durst not say so nor give him any hint about my informant though now i was enough confirmed of the truth of what mr turner had told me  yet i resolved if possible not to alter my conduct but my frequent weepings when by myself could not be hid as i wished my eyes not keeping my hearts counsel  and this gives occasion to some of the stern words which i have mentioned above  all that he further said at this time was with a negligent yet a determined air  well pamela dont be doubtful of my honor you know how much i love you but one day or other i shall gratify this ladys curiosity and will bring her to pay you a visit and you shall see you need not be ashamed of her acquaintance  whenever you please sir  was all i cared to say farther for i saw he was upon the catch and looked steadfastly upon me whenever i moved my lips and i am not a finished hypocrite and he can read the lines of ones face and the motions of ones heart i think  i am sure mine is a very uneasy one but till i reflected and weighed well the matter it was worse and my natural imperfection of this sort made me see a necessity to be the more watchful over myself and to doubt my own prudence and thus i reasoned when he withdrew  here thought i i have had a greater proportion of happiness without alloy fallen to my share than any of my sex and i ought to be prepared for some trials  it is true this is of the sorest kind it is worse than death itself to me who had an opinion of the dear gentlemans reformation and prided myself not a little on that account so that the blow is full upon my sore place it is on the side i could be the most easily penetrated but achilles could be touched only in his heel and if he was to die by an enemys hand must not the arrow find out that only vulnerable place  my jealousy is that place with me as your ladyship observes see this vol p      but is seated deeper than the heel it is in my heart and the barbed dart has found it out and there it sticks up to the very feathers  yet thought i i will take care that i do not exasperate him by upbraidings when i should try to move him by patience and forbearance for the breach of his duty cannot warrant the neglect of mine my business is to reclaim and not to provoke and when if it please god this storm shall be overblown let me not by my present behavior leave any room for heartburnings but like a skilful surgeon so heal the wound to the bottom though the operation be painful that it may not fester and break out again with fresh violence on future misunderstandings if any shall happen  he is a young gentleman has been used to have his own will thought i this may be a permitted stumbling block in his way to make him stand the firmer when recovered the lady may be unhappy that she cannot conquer her faulty love they may both see their error and stop short of crime if not he is a gentleman of fine sense he may run an undue length but may reclaim and then i shall be his superior by my preserved virtue and duty and have it in my power to forgive the dear gentleman and so repay him some of those obligations which i shall never otherwise have it in my power to repay  nor indeed wish to have it in this way if it please god to prevent it  then thought i how much better is it to be the suffering than the offending person  but yet madam to have so fine a gentleman who had advanced so far up the hill of virtue to slide back all at once and between your ladyship and me to have him sink down to the character he had despised and at last if his dear life should be spared as is my hourly prayer to have him carry his vices into advanced years and become such a poor gentleman as we see sir simon darnford retaining a love of his juvenile follies even after the practice has left him how my heart shudders at such a thought for my mr b  well but thought i let the worst come to the worst he may perhaps be so good as to permit me to pass the remainder of my days with my dear billy in kent with my father and mother and so when i cannot rejoice in possession of a virtuous husband i shall be employed in praying for him and enjoy a two fold happiness that of doing my own duty to my dear baby  and a pleasing entertainment that will be  and that of comforting my worthy parents and being comforted by them  and no small consolation this  and who knows but i may be permitted to steal a visit nowandthen to dear lady davers and be called sister and be deemed a faultless sister too  and that will be a fine thing but remember my dear lady that if ever it come to this i will not bear that for my sake you shall with too much asperity blame your dear brother for i will be ingenious to find excuses or extenuations for him and i will nowandthen in some disguised habit steal the pleasure of seeing him and his happier countess and give him with a silent tear my blessing for the good i and mine have reaped at his dear hands  but oh if he takes from me my dear billy who must after all be his heir and gives him to the cruel countess he will at once burst asunder the strings of my heart for oh my happy rivaless if you tear from me my husband he is in his own disposal and i cannot help it  nor can i indeed if he will give you my billy but this i am sure of that my child and my life must go together  your ladyship will think i rave indeed i am almost crazed at times for the dear gentleman is so negligent so cold so haughty that i cannot bear it he says just now you are quite altered pamela i believe i am madam but what can i do he knows not that i know so much i dare not tell him for he will have me then reveal my intelligencer and what may be the case between them  i weep in the night when he is asleep and in the day when he is absent and i am happy when i can unobserved steal this poor relief i believe already i have shed as many tears as would drown my poor baby how many more i may have to shed god only knows  for oh madam after all my fortitude and my recollection to fall from so much happiness and so soon is a trying thing  but i will hope still the best and resign to gods will and his and see how far the dear gentleman will be permitted to exercise me so dont my good lady be overmuch concerned for me  for you know i am apt to be too apprehensive and should this matter blow over i shall be ashamed of my weakness and the trouble i must give to your generous heart for one so undeservedly favored by you as is  your obliged sister and most humble servant p b dear my lady let no soul see any part of this our present correspondence for your dear brothers sake and your sake and my sake    letter xxxi my dearest pamela you need not be afraid of any bodys knowing what passes between us on this cutting subject though i hear of it from every mouth yet i pretend it is all falsehood and malice yet lady betty will have it that there is more in it than i will own and that i know my brothers wickedness by my pensive looks she will make a vow she says never to marry any man living  i am greatly moved by your affecting periods charming pamela what a tempest do you raise in ones mind when you please and lay it too at your own will your colorings are strong but i hope your imagination carries you much farther than it is possible he should go  i am pleased with your prudent reasonings and your wise resolutions i see nobody can advise or help you god only can and his direction you beg so hourly that i make no doubt you will have it  what vexes me is that on the noble uncle of this vile lady  why dont you call her so as well as i  expostulating with her on the scandals she brought on her character and family she pretended to argue foolish creature for polygamy and said she had rather be a certain gentlemans second wife than the first to the greatest man in england  i leave you to your own workings but if i find your prudence unrewarded by the wretch the storm you saw raised at the hall shall be nothing to the hurricane i will excite to tear up by the roots all the happiness the two wretches propose to themselves  dont let my intelligence which is undoubted grieve you overmuch try some way to move the wretch what must be done must be by touching his generosity he has that in some perfection but how in this case to move it is beyond my power or skill to prescribe  god bless you my dearest pamela you shall be my only sister and i will never own my brother if he be so base to your superlative merit adieu once more  from your sister and friend b davers  letter xxxii my dearest lady a thousand thanks for your kind your truly sisterly letter and advice mr b is just returned from a tour to portsmouth i believe with the countess but am not sure  here i am forced to leave off  let me scratch through this last surmise it seems she was not with him this is some comfort however  he is very kind and billy not being well when he came in my grief passed off without blame he has said a great many kind things to me but added that if i gave myself so much uneasiness every time the child ailed any thing he would hire the nurse to overlay him bless me madam what hardhearted what shocking things are these men capable of saying  the farthest from their hearts indeed so they had need  for he was as glad of the childs being better as i could be  in the morning he went out in the chariot for about an hour and returned in a very good humor saying twenty agreeable things to me which makes me so proud and so pleased  he is gone out again  could i but find this matter happily conquered for his own souls sake  but he seems by what your ladyship mentions to have carried this polygamy point with the lady  can i live with him madam  ought i  if this be the case i have it under his hand that the laws of his country were sufficient to deter him from this practice but oh he knew not this countess then they say she is a fine woman   but here i must break off he is returned and coming up go into my bosom for the present o letter dedicated to dear lady davers  come to my hand the play employment so unsuited to my present afflicted mind  here he comes  o but madam madam my heart is almost broken  just now mr b tells me that the countessdowager and the viscountess her sister are to be here to see my billy and to drink tea with me this very afternoon  i was all confusion when he told me this i looked around and around and upon every thing but him  will not my friends be welcome pamela said he sternly  o yes sir very welcome  but i have those nasty vapors so that i wish i might be excused  i wish i might be allowed to take an airing in the chariot for two or three hours for i shall not be fit to be seen by such  ladies  said i half out of breath  you will be fit to be seen by nobody my dear if you go on thus  but do as you please  he was going and i took his hand stay dear sir let me know what you would have me to do if you would have me stay i will  to be sure i would  well sir then i will for it is hard thought i if an innocent person cannot look up in her own house too as it is at present as i may say to a guilty one  guilty in her heart at least  though poor lady i hope she is not so in fact and if god hears my prayers never will for all three of our sakes  but madam think for me what a task i have how my heart throbs in my bosom how i tremble how i struggle with myself what rules i form for my behavior to this naughty lady how they are dashed in pieces as soon as formed and new ones taken up and yet i doubt myself when i come to the test  but one thing will help me i pity the poor lady and as she comes with the heart of a robber to invade me in my lawful right i pride myself in a superiority over this countess and will endeavor to show her the countrygirl in a light which would better become her to appear in  i must be forced to leave off here for mr b is just come in to receive his guests and i am in a sad flutter upon it all my resolution fails me what shall i do  o that this countess was come and gone  i tremble so that i shall behave like a guilty one before the guilty who will enjoy their minds i will warrant as if they were innocent  why should that be  but surely if all was bad as this turner has said they could not act thus barbarously by me for i have not deserved to be given up to be insulted i hope i have not  for what have i done  i have one comfort however in the midst of all my griefs and that is in your ladyships goodness who gives me leave to assume the honored title that let what will happen will always give me equal pride and pleasure in subscribing myself  your ladyships obliged sister and humble servant p b  letter xxxiii my dear lady i will now pursue my last affecting subject for the visit is over but a sad situation i am in with mr b for all that but i will try to forget it till i come to it in course bad as it is  at four in the afternoon mr b came in to receive his guests whom he expected at five he came up to me i had just closed my last letter but put it up and set before me your ladyships play subjects  so pamela  how do you now  your ladyship may guess by what i wrote before that i could not give any extraordinary account of myself  as well  as well sir as possible  half out of breath  you give yourself strange melancholy airs of late my dear  you dont do well  all that cheerfulness which used to delight me whenever i saw you i am sorry for it is quite vanished of late  you and i must shortly have a little serious talk together  when you please sir  i believe it is only not being used to this smoaky thick air of london  i shall be better when you carry me into the country  i dare say i shall  but i never was in london so long before you know sir  all in good time pamela  but is this the best appearance you choose to make to receive such guests  if it displease you sir i will dress otherwise in a minute  you look well in any thing  but i thought you would have had your jewels  yet they would never have less become you for of late your eyes have lost that brilliancy that used to strike me with a luster much surpassing that of the finest diamonds  i am sorry for it sir  but as i never could pride myself in deserving such a kind compliment i should be too happy forgive me my dearest mr b if the failure be not rather in your eyes than my own  he looked at me steadfastly  i fear pamela  but dont be a fool  you are angry with me sir  no not i  would you have me dress better  no not i  if your eyes looked a little more brilliant you want no addition  down he went  strange short speeches these my lady to what you have heard from his dear mouth  yet they shall not rob me of the merit of a patient sufferer i am resolved thought i  now my lady as i doubted not my rival would come adorned with every outward ornament i put on only a white damask gown having no desire to vie with her in appearance for a virtuous and honest heart is my glory i bless god i wish the countess had the same to boast of  about five their ladyships came in the countesss new chariot for she has not been long out of her transitory mourning and dressed as rich as jewels and a profusion of expense could make her  i saw them from the window alight o how my heart throbbd  lie still said i busy thing why all this emotion  those shining ornaments cover not such a guileless flutterer as thou why then all this emotion  i would not be so officious as to be below to receive them polly barlow came up instantly from mr b  i hastened down tremble tremble tremble went my feet in spite of all the resolution i had been so long endeavoring to collect together  mr b presented the countess to me both of us covered with blushes but from very different motives as i imagine  the countess of  my dear  she saluted me and looked as i thought half with envy half with shame but one is apt to form peoples countenances by what one judges of their hearts  o too lovely too charming rivaless thought i  would to heaven i saw less attractions in you  for indeed indeed madam she is a charming lady  yet she could not help calling me mrs b that was some pride and said she had heard me so much praised that she quite longed to see me  oh these villainous masquerades thought i  you would never have wanted to see me but for them poor naughty nun that was  mr b presented also the viscountess to me i saluted her ladyship her sister saluted me  she is a graceful lady better as i hope in heart but not equal in person to her sister  you have taken no pains my dear in your dress today  the ladies will excuse it sir i am so often in the nursery when you are absent  mrs b answers her character said the countess she wants no ornaments you have a charming little master i am told madam but no wonder from such a pair  o dear heart thought i int it so  your ladyship may guess what i thought further  will your ladyship see him now said mr b  he did not look down no not one bit  though the countess played with her fan and looked at him and looked at me and then looked down by turns a little consciously while i wrapped up myself in my innocence my first flutters being over and thought i was superior by reason of that to a countess  with all my heart mr b said she  i rang polly bid nurse bring my billy down  my said i with an emphasis  i met the nurse at the stairs foot and brought in my dear baby in my arms such a child and such a mamma said the viscountess  will you give master to my arms one moment madam said the countess  yes thought i much rather than my dear naughty gentleman should any other  i yielded it to her i thought she would have stifled it with her warm kisses sweet boy charming creature and pressed it to her too lovely bosom with such emotion looking on the child and on mr b that i liked it not by any means  go you naughty lady thought i  but i durst not say so and go naughty man too thought i for you seem to look too much gratified in your pride by her fondness for your boy i wish i did not love you so well as i do  but neither your ladyship may believe did i say this  mr b looked at me but with a bravery i thought too like what i had seen him look in some former scenes in as bad a cause  but thought i god delivered me then i will confide in him  he will now i doubt not restore thy heart to my prayers untainted i hope for thy own dear sake as well as mine  the viscountess took the child from her sister and kissed him with great pleasure she is a married lady would to god the countess was too for mr b never corresponded as i told your ladyship once see vol iii p          with married ladies so i was not afraid of her love to my billy  but let me said the viscountess have the pleasure of restoring master to his charming mamma i thought added she i never saw a lovelier sight in my life than when in his mammas arms  why i cannot say said the countess but master and his mamma do credit to one another dear madam let us have the pleasure of seeing him still on your lap while he is so good  i wondered the dear baby was so quiet though he is generally so but he might surely if but by sympathy have complained for his poor mamma though she durst not for herself  how apt one is to engage every thing in ones distress when it is deep and one wonders too that things animate and inanimate look with the same face when we are greatly moved by any extraordinary and interesting event  i sat down with my baby on my lap looking i believe with a righteous boldness i will call it so for well says the text the righteous is as bold as a lion now on my billy now on his dear papa and now on the countess with such a triumph in my heart for i saw her blush and look down and the dear gentleman seemed to eye me with a kind of conscious tenderness as i thought  a silence of five minutes i believe succeeded we all four looking upon one another and the little dear was awake and stared full upon me with such innocent smiles as if he promised to love me and make me amends for all  i kissed him and took his pretty little hand in mine  you are very good my charmer in this noble company said i  i remembered madam a scene that made greatly for me in the papers you have seen see vol i p  0  when instead of recriminating as i might have done before mr longman for hard usage for oh my lady your dear brother has a hard heart indeed he has when he pleases i only prayed for him on my knees  and i hope i was not now too mean for i had dignity and a proud superiority in my vain heart over them all  then it was not my part to be upon defiances where i loved and where i hoped to reclaim besides what had i done by it but justified seemingly by afteracts in a passionate resentment to their minds at least their too wicked treatment of me moreover your ladyship will remember that mr b knew not that i was acquainted with his intrigue i must call it so  if he had he is too noble to insult me by such a visit and he had told me i should see the lady he was at oxford with  and this breaking silence he mentioned saying i gave you hope my dear that i should procure you the honor of a visit from the lady who put herself under my care at oxford  i bowed my head to the countess but my tears being ready to start i kissed my billy dearest baby said i you are not going to cry are you  i would have had him just then to cry instead of me  the tea equipage was brought in polly carry the child to nurse i gave it another kiss and the countess desired another i grudged it to think her naughty lips should so closely follow mine her sister kissed it also and carried him to mr b take him away polly said he  i owe him my blessing  oh these young gentlemen papas said the countess  they are like young unbroken horses just put into the traces  are they so thought i  matrimony must not expect your good word i doubt  mr b after tea at which i was far from being talkative for i could not tell what to say though i tried as much as i could not to appear sullen desired the countess to play one tune upon the spinnet she did and sung at his request an italian song to it very prettily too prettily i thought i wanted to find some faults some great faults in her but oh madam she has too many outward excellencies pity she wants a good heart  he could ask nothing that she was not ready to oblige him in indeed he could not  she desired me to touch the keys i would have been excused but could not and the ladies commended my performance but neither my heart to play nor my fingers in playing deserved their praises mr b said indeed you play better sometimes my dear  do i sir was all the answer i made  the countess hoped she said i would return her visit and so said the viscountess  i replied mr b would command me whenever he pleased  she said she hoped to be better acquainted  i hope not thought i and that i would give her my company for a week or so upon the forest it seems she has a seat upon windsor forest  mr b says added she you cannot ride a single horse but well learn you there it is a sweet place for that purpose  how came mr b thought i to tell you that madam i suppose you know more of me than i do myself indeed my lady this may be too true for she may know what is to become of me  i told her i was very much obliged to her ladyship but mr b directed all my motions  what say you sir said the countess  i cannot promise that madam for mrs b wants to go down to kent before we go to bedfordshire and i am afraid i cannot give her my company thither  then sir i shall not choose to go without you  i suppose not my dear but if you are disposed to oblige the countess for a week as you never were at windsor   i believe sir interrupted i what with my little nursery and one thing or another i must deny myself that honor for this season  well madam then i will expect you in pallmall  i bowed my head and said mr b would command me  they took leave with a politeness natural to them  mr b as he handed them to their chariot said something in italian to the countess the word pamela was in what he said she answered him with a downcast look in the same language half pleased half serious and the chariot drove away  i would give said i a good deal sir to know what her ladyship said to you she looked with so particular a meaning if i may so say  i will tell you truly pamela i said to her well now your ladyship has seen my pamela  is she not the charmingst girl in the world  she answered mrs b is very grave for so young a lady but i must needs say she is a lovely creature  and did you say so sir and did her ladyship so answer  and my heart was ready to leap out of my bosom for joy  but my folly spoiled all again for to my own surprise and great regret i burst out into tears though i even sobbd to have suppressed them but could not and so i lost a fine opportunity to have talked to him while he was so kind for he was angry with me  what made me such a fool i wonder but i had so long struggled with myself and not expecting so kind a question from the dear gentleman or such a favorable answer from the countess i had no longer any command of myself  what ails the little fool said he with a wrathful countenance that made me worse  take care take care pamela  you will drive me from you in spite of my own heart  so he went into the best parlour and put on his sword and took his hat  sir sir with my arms expanded was all i could say but he avoided me putting on his hat with an air and out he went bidding abraham follow him  this is the dilemma into which as i hinted at the beginning of this letter i have brought myself with mr b how strong how prevalent is the passion of jealousy that thus it will show itself uppermost when it is uppermost in spite of ones most watchful regards  my mind is so perplexed that i must lay down my pen and indeed your ladyship will wonder all things considered that i could write the above account as i have done in this cruel suspense and with such apprehensions but writing is all the diversion i have when my mind is oppressed it is a temporary relief and this interview was so interesting that it took up a great deal of my attention while i wrote but now i am come to a period of it and so unhappy an one as has resulted from my ungoverned passion my apprehensions are returned upon me with double strength why did i drive the dear gentleman from me upon such a promising appearance  why did i  but all this had been prevented had not this nasty mr turner put into my head worse thoughts  how shall i do to look up to him now on his return to be sure he plainly sees to what my emotion is owing  yet i dare not tell him either my information or my informant because if he knows the one he will know the other and then what may be the consequence  past ten oclock at night i have only time to tell your ladyship for the postman waits that mr b is just come in he is gone into his closet and has shut the door and taken the key on the inside so i dare not go to him there in this uncertainty and suspense pity and pray for  your ladyships afflicted sister and servant p b  letter xxxiv my dear lady i will now proceed with my melancholy account  not knowing what to do and mr b not coming near me and the clock striking twelve i ventured to send this billet to him by polly  dear sir i know you choose not to be invaded when you retire into your closet and yet being very uneasy on account of your abrupt departure and heavy displeasure i take the liberty to write these few lines  i own sir that the sudden flow of tears which involuntarily burst from me at your kind expressions to the countess in my favor when i had thought for more than a month past you were angry with me and which had distressed my weak mind beyond expression might appear unaccountable to you but had you kindly waited but one moment till this fit which was rather owing to my joy and my gratitude than to perverseness had been over and i knew the time when you would have generously soothed it i should have had the happiness of a more serene and favorable parting  will you permit me sir  polly shall wait your answer to attend you i dare not come without your permission for should you be as angry as you were i know not how i should bear it but if you say i may come down i hope to satisfy you that i intended not any offense do dear sir permit me to attend you i can say no more than that i am  your ever dutiful p b polly returned with the following  so thought i a letter i could have spared that i am sure i expected no favor from it so tremblingly opened it     my dear i would not have you sit up for me we are getting apace into the matrimonial recriminations you knew the time  so did i my dear  but it seems that time is over with both and i have had the mortification for some past weeks i may say to come home to a very different pamela than i used to leave all company and all pleasure for  i hope we shall better understand one another but you cannot see me at present with any advantage to yourself and i would not that any thing farther should pass to add to the regrets of both i wish you good rest i will give your cause a fair hearing when i am more fit than at present to hear all your pleas and your excuses i cannot be insensible that the reason for the concern you have lately shown must lie deeper than perhaps you will own at present as soon as you are prepared to speak all that is upon your mind and i to hear it with temper then we may come to an eclaircissement till when i am  your affectionate etc my busy apprehension immediately suggested to me that i was to be terrified with a high hand into a compliance with some new scheme or other that was projecting but i had resolved to make their way as clear to one another as was in my power if they would have it so and so i tried to allay my grief as much as i could and it being near one and hearing nothing from mr b i bid polly go to bed thinking she would wonder at our intercourse by letter if i should send again  so down i ventured my feet however trembling all the way and tappd at the door of his closet  who is that  i sir one word if you please dont be more angry however sir  he opened the door thus poor hester to her royal husband ventured her life to break in upon him unbidden but that eastern monarch great as he was extended to the fainting suppliant the golden scepter  he took my hand i hope my dear by this tragedy speech we are not to expect any sad catastrophe to our present misunderstanding  i hope not sir but it is all as god and you shall please i am resolved to do my duty sir if possible but indeed i cannot bear this cruel suspense let me know what is to become of me  let me know but what is designed for me and you shall be sure of all the acquiescence that my duty and conscience can give to your pleasure  what means the dear creature what means my pamela  surely your head child is a little affected  i cannot tell sir but it may  but let me have my trial that you write about appoint my day of hearing and speedily too for i would not bear such another month as the last has been for the world  come my dear said he let me attend you to your chamber but your mind has taken much too solemn a turn to enter further now upon this subject think as well of me as i do of you and i shall be happy as ever  i wept  be not angry dear sir your kind words have just the same effect upon me now as in the afternoon  your apprehensions my dear must be very strong that a kind word as you call it has such an effect upon you but let us wave the subject for a few days because i am to set out on a little journey at four and had not intended to go to bed for so few hours  when we came up i said i was very bold sir to break in upon you but i could not help it if my life had been the forfeit and you received me with more goodness than i could have expected but will you pardon me if i ask whither you go so soon and if you had intended to have gone without taking leave of me  i go to tunbridge my dear i should have stepped up and taken leave of you before i went  well sir i will not ask you who is of your party  i will not  no putting my hand to his lips  dont tell me sir it may not be proper   dont fear my dear i will not tell you nor am i certain whether it be proper or not till we are come to a better understanding  only once more think as well of me as i do of you  would to heaven thought i there was the same reason for the one as the other  i intended for my heart was full to enter further into this subject so fatal to my repose but the dear gentleman had no sooner laid his hand on the pillow but he fell asleep or seemed to do so and that was as prohibitory to my talking as if he had so i had all my own entertaining reflections to myself which gave me not one wink of sleep but made me of so much service to him as to tell him when the clock struck four that he should not though i did not say so you may think madam make my ready rivaless for i doubted not her being one of the party wait for him  he arose and was dressed instantly and saluting me bid me be easy and happy while it was yet in my own power  he said he should be back on saturday night as he believed and i wished him most fervently i am sure health pleasure and safety  here madam must i end this letter my next will perhaps contain my trial and my sentence god give me but patience and resignation and then whatever occurs i shall not be unhappy especially while i can have in the last resource the pleasure of calling myself  your ladyships most obliged sister and servant p b     letter xxxv my dear lady i will be preparing to write to you as i have opportunity not doubting but this present letter must be a long one and having some apprehensions that as things may fall out i may want either head or heart to write to your ladyship were i to defer it till the catastrophe of this cruel cruel suspense  o what a happiness am i sunk from  and in so few days too  o the wicked wicked masquerades they shall be always followed with the execrations of an injured wife in me who but for that wretched diversion had still been the happiest of her sex  but i was too secure it was fit perhaps that i should be humbled and mortified and i must try to make a virtue of the cruel necessity and see if by the divine grace i cannot bring real good out of this appearing evil  the following letter in a womans hand and signed as you will see by a womans name and spelt as i spell it will account to your ladyship for my beginning so heavily it came by the penypost  madame i am unknown to you but you are not so altogathar to me because i have been edefyd by yowre pius behafior at church whir i see you with plaisir every sabbath day i am well acquaintid with the famely of the coumptesse of  and you may possibly have hard what you wishid not to have hard concerning her butt this very morninge i can assure you her ladishippe is gone with yowre spowse to tonbrigge and their they are to take lodginges or a house and mr b is after to come to town and settel matters to go down to her where they are to live as man and wiffe make what use you pleas of thiss informasion and believe me to have noe other motife than to serve you because of yowre vartues which make you deserve a better return i am thof i shall not set my true name  yowre great admirer and servant thomasine fuller wednesday morninge   oclocke  just above i called my state a state of cruel suspense but i recall the words for now it is no longer suspense since if this letter says truth i know the worst and there is too much appearance that it does let the writer be who it will or his or her motive what it will for after all i am apt to fansy this a contrivance of mr turners though for fear of ill consequences i will not say so  and now madam i am endeavoring by the help of religion and cool reflection to bring my mind to bear this heavy evil and to recollect what i was and how much more honorable an estate i am in than i could ever have expected to be and that my virtue and good name are secured and i can return innocent to my dear father and mother and these were once the only pride of my hope  then additional to what i was at that time and yet i pleased myself with my prospects poor as they were i have honest parents bountifully provided for thank god and your ever dear brother for this blessing  and not only provided for  but made useful to him to the amount of their provision well nigh there is a pride my lady  then i shall have better conditions from his generosity to support myself than i can wish for or make use of  then i have my dear charming billy  o be contented too charming and too happy rivaless with my husband and tear not from me my dearest baby the pledge the beloved pledge of our happier affections and the dear remembrance of what i once was  but if my dear mr b you doubt the education i can give him fit for the heir to your great fortune for such he must be despised or abandoned as his poor mother may be and will remove him from me and grief kill me not before that sad hour let me have some office not incompatible with that of his tutor to instill virtue into his ductile mind for tutors although they may make youth learned do not always make them virtuous and let me watch over his steps and wherever he goes let me go i shall value no dangers nor risques the most distant clime shall be native to me wherever my billy is so that i may be a guard under god to his morals that he make no virgins heart sigh nor mothers bleed as mine has done in both states  but how i rave will your ladyship be apt to say  this is no good symptom you will think that i have reaped at present that consolation from religious considerations which to a right turn of mind they will afford in the heaviest misfortunes but this was only in fear they would take my billy from me a thousand pleasing prospects that had begun to dawn on my mind i can bear to have dissipated but i cannot permit my dear mr bs son and heir to be torn from me  yet i hope they will not be so cruel for i will give them no provocation to do it if i can help it no lawsuits no complainings no asperities of expression much less bitter reflections shall they ever have from me i will be no conscience to them they will be punished too much greatly too much in their own for what i wish and they shall always be followed by my prayers i shall have leisure for that exercise and shall be happy and serene when i doubt i doubt they will not be so  but still i am running on in a strain that shows my impatience rather than my resignation yet some struggles must be allowed me i could not have loved as i love if i could easily part with my interest in so beloved a husband  for madam my interest i will part with and will sooner die than live with a gentleman who has another wife though i was the first  let countesses if they can and ladies of birth choose to humble themselves to this baseness  the lowborn pamela cannot stoop to such meanness pardon me madam you know i only write this with a view to this poor ladys answer to her noble uncle of which you wrote me word  friday is now concluding i hope i am calmer a great deal for being disappointed in all likelihood of twenty agreeable schemes and projects i am now forming new ones with as much pleasure to myself as i may for my lady it is ones duty you know to suit ones mind to ones condition and i hope i shall be enabled to do good in kent if i cannot in london and bedfordshire and lincolnshire god everywhere provides us with objects on which to exercise ones gratitude and beneficence  i am thinking to try to get good mrs jervis with me  come madam you must not be too much concerned for me after a while i shall be no unhappy person for though i was thankful for my splendid fortunes and should have been glad to be sure i should of continuing in them with so dear a gentleman yet a high estate had never such dazzling charms with me as it has with some if it had i could not have resisted so many temptations possibly as god enabled me to resist  saturday night is now come it is nine and no mr b  o why as deborah makes the mother of sisera say is his chariot so long in coming why tarry the wheels of his chariot  i have this note now at eleven oclock my dearest pamela i dispatch this messenger lest expecting me this night you should be uneasy i shall not be with you till monday when i hope to dine with my dearest life  ever affectionately yours     so i will go up and pray for him and then to bed yet it is a sad thing  i have had but poor rest for a great while nor shall have any till my fate is decided hardhearted gentleman he knows under what uneasiness he left me  monday eleven if god almighty hears my yesterdays and indeed my hourly prayers the dear gentleman will be good still but my aching heart every time i think in what company he is for i find the countess is certainly one of the party bodes me little satisfaction  he is come he is come now just now come i will have my trial over before this night be past if possible i will go down and meet him with love unfeigned and a duty equal to my love although he may forget his to me if i conquer myself on this occasion i conquer nature as your ladyship says and then by gods grace i can conquer every thing they have taken their house i suppose  but what need they when they will have one in bedfordshire and one in lincolnshire but they know best god bless him and reform her that is all the harm i wish them or will wish them  the dear gentleman has received me with great affection and tenderness sure he cannot be so bad  sure he cannot  i know my dear said he i left you in great anxiety but it is an anxiety you have brought upon yourself and i have not been easy ever since i left you  i am sorry for it sir  why my dear love there is still a melancholy air in your countenance indeed it seems mingled with a kind of joy i hope at my return to you but it is easy to see which of the two is the most natural  you should see nothing sir that you would not wish to see if i could help it  i am sorry you cannot replied he but i am come home to hear all your grievances and to redress them if in my power  when sir am i to come upon my trial i have a great deal to say to you i will tell you every thing i think and as it may be the last grievances as you are pleased to call em i may ever trouble you with you must promise to answer me not one word till i have said all i have to say for if it does but hold i have great courage i have indeed  you dont know half the sauciness that is in your girl yet but when i come upon my trial you will wonder at my boldness  what means my dearest and took me in his arms you alarm me exceedingly by this moving sedateness  dont let it alarm you sir i mean you nothing but good  but i have been preparing myself to tell you all my mind and as an instance of what you may expect from me sometimes sir i will be your judge and put home questions to you and sometimes you shall be mine and at last pronounce sentence upon me or if you will not i will upon myself a severe one to me it shall be but an agreeable one perhaps to you  when comes on the trial sir  he looked steadily upon me but was silent and i said but dont be afraid sir i will invade your province for though i shall count myself your judge in some cases you shall be judge paramount still  dear charmer of my heart said he and clasped me to his bosom what a new pamela have i in my arms a mysterious charmer let us instantly go to my closet or yours and come upon our mutual trial for you have fired my soul with impatience  no sir if you please we will dine first i have hardly eaten any thing these four days and your company will give me an appetite perhaps i shall be pleased to sit down at table with you sir taking his hand and trying to smile upon him for the moments i may have of your company may be some time hence very precious to my remembrance  i was forced then to turn my head to hide from him my eyes brimful as they were of tears  he took me again in his arms  my dearest pamela if you love me distract not my soul thus by your dark and mysterious speeches you are displeased with me and i thought i had reason to take something amiss in your late conduct but instead of your suffering by my anger you have words and an air that penetrate my very soul  o sir sir treat me not thus kindly put on an awfuller brow or how shall i retain my purpose how shall i  dear dear creature make not use of all your powers to melt me half of them is enough for there is eloquence in your eyes i cannot resist but in your present solemn air and affecting sentences you mould me to every purpose of your heart so that i am a mere machine a passive instrument to be played upon at your pleasure  dear kind sir how you revive my heart by your goodness perhaps i have had only a frightful dream of a few weeks continuance and am but just now awakened  but we will not anticipate our trial only sir give orders that you are not to be spoken with by any body when we have dined for i must have you all to my self without interruption  just as i had said this a gentleman called on him and i retired to my chamber and wrote to this place  mr b dismissed his friend without asking him to dine with him so i had him all to myself at dinner but we said little and sat not above a quarter of an hour looking at each other he with impatience and some seeming uneasiness i with more steadiness i believe but nowandthen a tear starting  i could eat but little though i tried all i could and especially as he helped me and courted me by words of tenderness and sweetness  o why were ever such things as masquerades permitted in a christian nation  i chose to go into my closet rather than into his and here i sit waiting the dear gentlemans coming up to me if i keep but my courage i shall be pleased i know the worst and that will help me for he is too noble to use me roughly when he sees i mean not to provoke him by upbraidings any more than i will act in this case beneath the character i ought to assume as his wife  for my dear lady this is a point of high importance it has touched and raised my soul beyond its pitch i am a new pamela as he says and a proud pamela as he will find  for madam the person who can support herself under an injury like this and can resolve to forgive it has a superiority to the injurer let him be a prince though she were but a beggarborn but the difficulty will be how to avoid being melted by my own softness and love for the man more dear to me than life yea more dear to me than my billy and than all my hopes in the charming boy but here he comes  now pamela  now see what thou can do  thou know the worst remember that  and may not be unhappy even at the worst if thou trustest in god  i am commanded my dear lady now to write particularly my trial for a reason i shall mention to you in the conclusion of this letter and i must beg you to favor me with the return of all my letters to you on this affecting subject  the reason will appear in its place  and oh congratulate me my dear dear lady for i am happy and shall be happier than i ever was and that i thought so did every body was impossible but i will not anticipate the account of my trial and the effects the blessed effects it has produced thus then it was  mr b came up with great impatience in his looks i met him at my chamber door with as sedate a countenance as i possibly could put on and my heart was high with my purpose and supported me better than i could have expected  yet on recollection now i impute to myself something of that kind of noble enthusiasm that was wont to inspire the innocent sufferers of old for a still worthier cause than mine though their motives could hardly be more pure in that one hope i had to be an humble means of saving the man i love and honor from errors that might be fatal to his soul  i took his hand with boldness dear sir leading him to my closet here is the bar at which i am to take my trial pointing to the backs of three chairs which i had placed in a joined row leaving just room to go by on each side  you must give me sir all my own way this is the first and perhaps the last time that i shall desire it  nay dear sir turning my face from him look not upon me with an eye of tenderness if you do i may lose my purposes important to me as they are and however fantastic my behavior may seem to you i want not to move your passions but your reason and if that can be done i am safe and shall fear no relapse the others will raise but a transient hope which the winds of sense may easily dissipate and i regard it accordingly  what means all this parade my dear let me perish that was his word if i know how to account for you or your humor  you will presently sir but give me all my way  i pray you do this once  this one time only  well so this is your bar is it there is an elbowchair i see take your place in it pamela and here i will stand to answer all your questions  no sir that must not be so i boldly led him to the elbowchair you are the judge sir it is i that am to be tried yet i will not say i am a criminal i know i am not but that must be proved sir you know  well take your way but i fear for your head my dear in all this  i fear only my heart sir that is all but there you must sit  so here retiring to the three chairs and leaning on the backs here i stand  and now my dearest mr b you must begin first when you showed me the house of peers their bar at which causes are heard and sometimes peers are tried looked awful to me and the present occasion requires that this should now dear sir you must be my accuser as well as my judge  i have nothing to accuse you of my dear if i must give into your moving whimsy you are every thing i wish you to be but for the last month you have seemed to be uneasy and have not done me the justice to acquaint me with your reasons for it  i was in hopes sir my reasons might prove to be no reasons and i would not trouble you with my ungrounded apprehensions but now sir we are come directly to the point and methinks i stand here as paul did before felix and like that poor prisoner if i sir reason of righteousness temperance and judgment to come even to make you as the great felix did tremble dont put me off to another day to a more convenient season as that governor did paul for you must bear patiently with all i have to say  strange uncommon girl how unaccountable is all this  prythee my dear and he pulled a chair by him come and sit down by me and without these romantic airs let me hear all you have to say and teize me not with this parade  no sir let me stand if you please while i can stand when i am weary i will sit down at my bar  now sir as you are so good as to say you have nothing but change of temper to accuse me of i am to answer to that and assign a cause and i will do it without evasion or reserve but i beseech you say not one word but yes or no to my questions till i have said all i have to say and then you shall find me all silence and resignation  well my strange dear  but sure your head is a little turned  what is your question  whether sir the nun  i speak boldly the case requires it  who followed you at the masquerade everywhere is not the countess of   what then my dear speaking with quickness  i thought the occasion of your sullenness and reserve was this  but pamela   nay sir interrupted i only yes or no if you please i will be all silence byandby  yes then  well sir then let me tell you for i ask you not it may be too bold in me to multiply questions that she loves you that you correspond by letters with her  yes sir before that letter from her ladyship came which you received from my hand in so short and angry a manner for fear i should have had a curiosity to see its contents which would have been inexcusable in me i own if i had you have talked over to her all your polygamy notions and her ladyship seems so well convinced of them that she has declared to her noble uncle who expostulated with her on the occasions she gave for talk that she had rather be a certain gentlemans second wife than the first to the greatest man in england and you are but just returned from a journey to tunbridge in which that lady was a party and the motive for it i am acquainted with by a letter here in my hand  he was displeased and frowned i looked down being resolved not to be terrified if i could help it  i have cautioned you pamela   i know you have sir interrupted i but be pleased to answer me has not the countess taken a house or lodgings at tunbridge  she has  and what then  and is her ladyship there or in town  there and what then  are you to go to tunbridge sir soon or not be pleased to answer me but that one question  i will know rising up in anger your informants pamela  dear sir so you shall in proper time you shall know all as soon as i am convinced that your wrath will not be attended with bad consequences to yourself and others that is wholly the cause of my reserve in this point for i have not a thought and never had since i have been yours that i wish to be concealed from you  but dear sir your knowledge of the informants makes nothing at all as to the truth of the information  nor will i press you too home i doubt not you are soon to go down to tunbridge again  i am and what then  must the consequence be crime enough to warrant your jealousy  dear sir dont be so very angry still looking down for i durst not trust myself to look up i dont do this as you charged me in your letter in a spirit of matrimonial recrimination if you dont tell me that you see the countess with pleasure i ask it not of you nor have i any thing to say by way of upbraiding it is my misfortune that she is too lovely and too attractive and it is the less wonder that a fine young gentleman as you are and a fine young lady as she is should engage one anothers affections  i knew all this except what this letter which you shall read presently communicates when you brought the two noble sisters to visit me hence proceeded my grief and should i sir have deserved to be what i am if i was not grieved religion has helped me sir and god has answered my supplications to enable me to act this new and uncommon part before you at this imaginary bar you shall see sir that as on one hand i want not as i said before to move your passions in my favor so on the other i shall not be terrified by your displeasure dreaded by me as it used to be and as it will be again the moment that my raised spirits sink down to their usual level or are diverted from this my long meditated purpose to tell you all my mind  i repeat then sir that i knew all this when the two noble sisters came to visit your poor girl and your billy yet grave as the countess called me dear sir might i not well be grave knowing what i knew did i betray any impatience of speech or action any discomposure  no sir patting my hand on my breast here all the discomposure lay struggling vehemently struggling nowandthen and wanting that vent at my eyes which it seems overcome by my joy to hear myself favorably spoken of by you and the lady it too soon made itself but i could not help it  you might have seen sir i could not  but i want neither to recriminate nor expostulate nor yet sir to form excuses for my general conduct for that you accuse not in the main  but be pleased sir to read this letter it was brought by the penypost as you will see by the mark who the writer is i know not and did you sir that knowledge and your resentment upon it will not alter the fact or give it a more favorable appearance  i stepped to him and giving him the letter came back to my bar and sat down on one of the chairs while he read it drying my eyes for they would overflow as i talked do what i could  he was much moved at the contents of this letter called it d  nd malice and hoped he might find out the author of it saying he would advertise  00 guineas reward for the discoverer  he put the letter in his pocket well pamela you believe all that you have said no doubt and this matter has a black appearance indeed if you do but who was your first informant was that by letter or personally that d  nd turner i doubt not is at the bottom of all this the vain coxcomb has had the insolence to imagine the countess would favor an address of his and is enraged to meet with a repulse and has taken liberties upon it that have given birth to all the scandals which have been scattered about on this occasion nor do i doubt but he has been the serpent at the ear of my eve  i stood up at my bar and said dont be too hasty sir in your judgment  you may be mistaken  but am i mistaken pamela  you never yet told me an untruth in cases the most arduous am i mistaken  dear sir if i should tell you it is not mr turner you will guess at somebody else and what avails all this to the matter in hand you are your own master and must stand and fall by your own conscience god grant that that may acquit you  but my intention is not either to accuse or upbraid you  but my dear to the fact then this is a malicious and a villainous piece of intelligence given you perhaps for the sake of designs and views that may not yet be proper to be avowed  by gods grace sir i defy all designs and views of any one upon my honor  but my dear the charge is basely false we have not agreed upon any such way of life  well sir all this only proves that the intelligence may be a little premature but now let me sir sit down one minute or two to recover my failing spirits and then i will tell you all i purpose to do and all i have to say and that with as much brevity as i can for fear neither my head nor my heart should perform the parts i have been so long endeavoring to prevail upon them to perform  i sat down then he taking the letter out of his pocket and looking upon it again with much vexation and anger in his countenance and after a few tears and sobs that would needs be so officious as to offer their service unbidden and undesired to introduce what i had to say i rose up my feet trembling as well as my knees which however leaning against the seats of the chairs which made my bar as my hand held by the back tolerably supported me i cleared my voice wiped my eyes and said  you have all the excuses dear mr b that a gentleman can have in the object of your present passion  present passion pamela  dear sir hear me out without interruption  the countess is a charming lady she excels your poor girl in all those outward graces of form that your kind fancy more valued by me than the opinion of all the world besides had made you attribute to me and she has all those additional advantages as nobleness of birth of alliance and deportment which i want happy for you sir that you had known her ladyship some months ago before you disgraced yourself by the honors you have done me this therefore frees you from the aggravated crime of those who prefer to their own ladies less amiable and less deserving persons and i have not the sting that these must have who are contemned and illtreated for their inferiors yet cannot the countess love you better than your girl not even for your person which must i doubt be her principal attachment when i can truly say all noble and attracting to the outward eye as you are that is the least consideration by far with me no sir it is your mind your generous and beneficent mind that is the principal object of my affection and the pride i took in hoping that i might be an humble means in the hands of providence to bless you hereafter as well as here gave me more joy than all the blessings i reaped from your name or your fortune judge then my dearest mr b what my grief and my disappointment must be  but i will not expostulate i will not because it must be to no purpose for could my fondness for you and my watchful duty to you have kept you steady i should not now have appeared before you in this solemn manner and i know the charms of my rivaless are too powerful for me to contend with nothing but divine grace can touch your heart and that i expect not from the nature of the case should be instantaneous  i will therefore sir dear as you are to me dont look with such tender surprise upon me give up your person to my happier to my worthier rivaless for since such is your will and such seem to be your engagements what avails it me to oppose them  i have only to beg therefore that you will be so good as to permit me to go down to kent to my dear parents who with many more are daily rejoicing in your favor and bounty  i will there holding up my folded hands pray for you every hour of my life and for every one who shall be dear to you not excepting your charming countess  i will never take your name into my lips nor suffer any other in my hearing but with reverence and gratitude for the good i and mine have reaped at your hands nor will i wish to be freed from my obligations to you except you shall choose to be divorced from me and if you should i will give your wishes all the forwardness that i honorably can with regard to my own character and yours and that of my beloved baby  but you must give me something worth living for along with me your billy and mine  unless it is your desire to kill me quite and then it is done and nothing will stand in your happy countesss way if you tear from my arms my second earthly good after i am deprived of you my first  i will there sir dedicate all my time to my first duties happier far than once i could have hoped to be and if by any accident any misunderstanding between you you should part by consent and you will have it so my heart will be ever yours and my hopes will be resumed of being an instrument still for your future good and i will receive your returning ever valued heart as if nothing had happened the moment i can be sure it will be wholly mine  for think not dear sir whatever be your notions of polygamy that i will were my life to depend upon it consent to live with a gentleman dear as god is my witness lifting up my tearful eyes you are to me who lives in what i cannot but think open sin with another you know sir and i appeal to you for the purity and i will aver piety of my motives when i say this that i would not and as you do know this i cannot doubt but my proposal will be agreeable to you both and i beg of you dear sir to take me at my word and dont let me be tortured as i have been so many weeks with such anguish of mind that nothing but religious considerations can make supportable to me  and are you in earnest pamela said the dear gentleman coming to me and folding me in his arms over the chairs back the seat of which supported my trembling knees  can you so easily part with me  i can sir and i will  rather than divide my interest in you knowingly with any lady on earth but say not however can i part with you sir it is you that part with me and tell me sir tell me but what you had intended should become of me  you talk to me my dearest life as if all you had heard against me was true and you would have me answer you would you as if it was  i want nothing to convince me sir that the countess loves you you know the rest of my information judge for me what i can what i ought to believe  you know the rumors of the world concerning you even i who stay so much at home and have not taken the least pains to find out my wretchedness nor to confirm it since i knew it have come to the hearing of it and if you know the license taken with both your characters and yet correspond so openly must it not look to me that you value not your honor in the worlds eye nor my lady hers i told you sir the answer she made to her uncle  you told me my dear as you were told be tender of a ladys reputation  for your own sake no one is exempted from calumny and even words said and the occasion of saying them not known may bear a very different construction from what they would have done had the occasion been told  this may be all true sir i wish my lady would be as tender of her reputation as i would be let her injure me in your affections as she will but can you say sir that there is nothing between you that should not be according to my notions of virtue and honor and according to your own sir which i took pride in before that fatal masquerade  you answer me not continued i and may i not fairly presume you are not able to answer me as i wish to be answered but come dearest sir and i put my arms round his neck let me not urge you too boldly i will never forget your benefits and your past kindness to me i have been a happy creature no one till within these few weeks was ever so happy as i i will love you still with a passion as ardent as ever i loved you absence cannot lessen such a love as mine i am sure it cannot  i see your difficulties you have gone too far to recede if you can make it easy to your conscience i will wait with patience my happier destiny and i will wish to live if i can be convinced you wish me not to die in order to pray for you and to be a directress to the first education of my dearest baby  you sigh dear sir repose your beloved face next to my fond heart it is all your own and ever shall be let it be worthy of the honor in your estimation or not  but yet my dear sir if one could as easily in the prime of sensual youth look twenty years forward as one can twenty years backward what an empty vanity what a mere nothing will be all those grosser satisfactions that now give wings of desire to our debased appetites  motives of religion will have their due force upon your mind one day i hope as blessed be god they have enabled me to talk to you on such a touching point after infinite struggles i own with so much temper and resignation and then my dearest mr b when we come to that last bed from which the piey of our friends shall lift us but from which we shall never be able to raise ourselves for dear sir your countess and you and your poor pamela must all come to this  we shall find what it is will give us the true joy and enable us to support the pangs of the dying hour  think you my dearest sir and i pressed my lips to his forehead as his head was reclined on my throbbing bosom that then in that important moment what now gives us so much pleasure will have any part in our consideration but as it may give us woe or comfort in the reflection  but i will not i will not o best beloved of my soul thus afflict you  why should i thus sadden all your gaudy prospects i have said enough to such a heart as yours if divine grace touches it and if not all i can say will be of no avail  i will leave you therefore to that and to your own reflections and after giving you ten thousand thanks for your kind your indulgent patience with me i will only beg that i may set out in a week for kent with my dear billy that you will receive one letter from me at least of gratitude and blessings it shall not be of upbraidings and exclamations  but my child you must not deny me for i shall haunt like his shadow every place wherein you shall put my billy if you should be so unkind to deny him to me  and if moreover you will permit me to have the dear miss goodwin with me as you had almost given me room to hope i will read over all the books of education and digest them as well as i am able in order to send you my scheme and to show you how fit i hope your indulgence at least will make you think me of having two such precious trusts reposed in me  i was silent waiting in tears his answer but his generous heart was touched and seemed to labor within him for expression  he came round to me at last and took me in his arms exalted generosity said he nobleminded pamela let no bar be put between us henceforth no wonder when one looks back to thy first promising dawn of excellence that thy fuller day should thus irresistibly dazzle such weak eyes as mine whatever it costs me and i have been inconsiderately led on by blind passion for an object too charming but which i never thought equal to my pamela i will for it is yet i bless god in my power restore to your virtue an husband all your own  oh sir sir and i should have sunk down with joy had not his kind arms supported me what have you said  can i be so happy as to behold you innocent as to deed god of his infinite goodness continue you both so  and oh that the dear lady would make me as truly love her for the graces of her mind as i admire her for the advantages of her person  you are virtue itself my dearest life and from this moment i will reverence you as my tutelary angel i shall behold you with awe and implicitly give up myself to all your dictates for what you say and what you do must be ever right  but i will not my dearest life too lavishly promise lest you should think it the sudden effect of passions thus movingly touched and which may subside again when the soul as you observed in your own case sinks to its former level but this i promise you and i hope you believe me and will pardon the pain i have given you which made me fear more than once that your dear head was affected so uncommon yet so like yourself has been the manner of your acting that i will break off a correspondence that has given you so much uneasiness and my pamela may believe that if i can be as good as my word in this point she will never more be in danger of any rivaless whatever  but say my dear love added the charming charming man say you forgive me and resume but your former cheerfulness and affectionate regards to me else i shall suspect the sincerity of your forgiveness and you shall indeed go to kent but not without me nor your boy neither and if you insist upon it the poor miss you have wished so often and so generously to have shall be given up absolutely to your disposal  do you think my lady i could speak any one distinct sentence no indeed i could not  pardon pardon you dear sir  and i sunk down on my knees from his arms  all i beg  all i hope  your pardon  my thankfulness  o spare me  spare me but words  and indeed i was just choked with my joy i never was so in my whole life before and my eyes were fixed as the dear gentleman told me for he was a little startled seeing nothing but the whites for the sight was out of its orbits in a manner lifted up to heaven  in ecstasy for a turn so unexpected  we were forced to separate soon after for there was no bearing each other so excessive was my joy and his goodnesss he left me and went down to his own closet  judge my employment you will i am sure my dear lady i had new ecstasy to be blessed with in a joy and thankfulness so exalted that they left me all light and pleasant as if i had shook off body and trod in air so much heaviness had i lost and so much joy had i received from two such extremes how was it possible i could presently hit the medium  for when i had given up my beloved husband as lost to me and had dreaded the consequences to his future state to find him not only untainted as to deed but in all probability mine upon better and surer terms than ever  o madam is not this a joy beyond all joy and surpassing all expression  about eight oclock my dear mr b sent me up these lines from his closet which will explain what i meant as to the papers i must beg your ladyship to return me  my dear pamela i have so much real concern at the anguish i have given you and am so much affected with the recollection of the uncommon scenes between us just now that i write because i know not how to look so excellent a creature in the face  you must therefore sup without me and take your mrs jervis to bed with you who i doubt not knows all this affair and you may tell her the happy event you must not interfere with me just now my dear while i am writing upon a subject which takes up all my attention and which requiring great delicacy i may possibly be all night before i can please myself in it i am determined absolutely to make good my promise to you but if you have written to your mother to miss darnford or to lady davers any thing of this affair you must show me the copies of your letters and let me into every tittle how you came by your information  i solemnly promise you on my honor that has not yet been violated to you and i hope never will that not a soul shall know or suffer by the communication not even turner for i am confident he has had some hand in it this request you must comply with if you can confide in me for i shall make some use of it as prudent an one as i am able for the sake of every one concerned in the conclusion of the correspondence between the lady and myself whatever you may have said in the bitterness of your heart in the letters i require to see or whatever any of those to whom they are directed shall say on the bad prospect shall be forgiven and looked upon as deserved by  your ever obliged and faithful etc   i returned the following dearest dear sir i will not break in upon you while you are so importantly employed mrs jervis has indeed seen my concern for some time past and has heard rumors as i know by hints she has from time to time given me but her prudence and my reserves have kept us from saying any thing to one another of it neither my mother nor miss darnford know a tittle of it from me i have received a letter of civility from miss and have answered it taking and giving thanks for the pleasure of each others company and best respects from her and the lincolnshire families to your dear self these my copy and her original you shall see when you please but in truth all that has passed is between lady davers and me and i have not kept copies of mine but i will dispatch a messenger to her ladyship for them if you please in the morning before it is light not doubting your kind promise of excusing every thing and every body i beg dear sir you will take care your health suffers not by your sitting up for the nights are cold and damp i will now you have given me the liberty let mrs jervis know how happy you have made me by dissipating my fears and the idle rumors as i shall call them to her of calumniators god bless you dear sir for your goodness and favor to  your ever dutiful p b     he was pleased to return me this my dear life you need not be in such haste to send if you write to lady davers how the matter has ended let me see the copy of it and be very particular in your or rather my trial it shall be a standing lesson to me for my future instruction as it will be a fresh demonstration of your excellence which every hour i more and more admire i am glad lady davers only knows the matter i think i ought to avoid seeing you till i can assure you that every thing is accommodated to your desire longman has sent me some advices that will make it proper for me to meet him at bedford or gloucester i will not go to tunbridge till i have all your papers and so you will have three days time to procure them your boy and your penmanship will find you no disagreeable employment till i return nevertheless on second thoughts i will do myself the pleasure of breakfasting with you in the morning to reassure you of my unalterable purpose to approve myself  my dearest life ever faithfully yours thus i hope is happily ended this dreadful affair my next shall inform your ladyship of the particulars of our breakfast conversation but i would not slip this post without acquainting you with this blessed turn and to beg the favor to send me back my letters which will lay a new obligation upon  dear madam your obliged sister and humble servant p b       letter xxxvi my dearest lady your joyful correspondent has obtained leave to get every thing ready to quit london by friday next when your kind brother promises to carry me down to kent and allows me to take my charmer with me there is happiness for you madam to see as i hope i shall see upon one blessed spot a dear faithful husband a beloved child and a father and mother whom i so much love and honor  mr b told me this voluntarily this morning at breakfast and then in the kindest manner he took leave of me and set out for bedfordshire  but i should according to my promise give your ladyship a few particulars of our breakfast conference  i bid polly withdraw when her master came up to breakfast and i ran to the door to meet him and threw myself on my knees o forgive me dearest dear sir all my boldness of yesterday  my heart was strangely affected  or i could not have acted as i did but never fear my dearest mr b that my future conduct shall be different from what it used to be or that i shall keep up to a spirit that you hardly thought had place in the heart of your dutiful pamela till she was thus severely tried  i have weighed well your conduct my dear life said the generous gentleman raising me to his bosom and i find an uniformity in it that is surprisingly just  there is in your composition indeed the strangest mixture of meekness and high spirit that ever i met with never was a saucier dear girl than you in your maiden days when you thought your honor in danger never a more condescending goodness when your fears were at an end now again when you had reason as you believed to apprehend a conduct in me unworthy of my obligations to you and of your purity you rise in your spirit with a dignity that becomes an injured person and yet you forget not in the height of your resentments that angelick sweetness of temper and readiness to forgive which so well become a lady who lives as you live and practices what you practice my dearest pamela i see continued he serves not god for naught in a better sense i speak it than the maligner spoke it of job since in every action and motion of yours the heavenly direction you so constantly invoke shows itself thus beautifully  and now again this charming condescension the moment you are made easy is an assurance that your affectionate sweetness is returned and i cannot fear any thing but that i shall never be able to deserve it  he led me to the teatable and sat down close by me polly came in if every thing said he be here that your lady wants you may withdraw and let mr colbrand and abraham know i shall be with them presently nobody shall wait upon me but you my dear  polly withdrew  you are all goodness sir and how generously how kindly do you account for that mixture in my temper you speak of  depend upon it dear sir that i will never grow upon this your indulgence  i always loved you my dearest said he and that with a passionate fondness which has not i dare say many examples in the married life but i revere you now and so great is my reverence for your virtue that i chose to sit up all night as now to leave you for a few days until by disingaging myself from all intercourses that have given you uneasiness i can convince you that i have rendered myself as worthy as i can be of such an angel even upon your own terms i will account to you continued he for every step i shall take and will reveal to you every step i have taken for this i can do because the ladys honor is untainted and wicked rumor has treated her worse than she could deserve  i told him that since he had been pleased to name my lady i would take the liberty to say i was glad for her own sake to hear that he changing the subject a little precipitately as if it gave him pain told me as above that i might prepare on friday for kent and i parted with him with greater joy and gratitude than ever i did in my life so necessary sometimes are afflictions not only to teach one how to subdue ones passions and to make us in our happiest states know we are still on earth but even when they are everblown to augment and redouble our joys  i am now giving orders my dear lady for my beloved journey and quitting this undelightful town as it has been and is to me my next will be from kent i hope and perhaps i shall then have an opportunity to acquaint your ladyship with the particulars and if god answers my prayers the conclusion of the affair which has given me so much uneasiness mean time i am with the greatest gratitude for the kind share you have taken in my past afflictions my good lady  your ladyships most obliged sister and servant p b  letter xxxvii my dearest pamela enclosed are all the letters you send for i rejoice with you upon the turn this afflicting affair has taken through your inimitable prudence and a courage i thought not in you  a wretch  to give you so much discomposure  but i will not if he be good now rave against him as i was going to do  i am impatient to hear what account he gives of the matter i hope he will be able to abandon this  i wont call her names for she loves the wretch and that if he be just to you will be her punishment  what care ought these young widows to take of their reputation  and how watchful ought they to be over themselves  she was hardly out of her weeds and yet must go to a masquerade and tempt her fate with all her passions about her with an independence and an affluence of fortune that made her able to think of nothing but gratifying them  then her lord and she had been married but barely two years and one of them she was forced with the gayest temper in the world to be his nurse for always inclined to a consumptive indisposition he languishd without hope a twelvemonth and then died  she has good qualities  is generous  noble  but has strong passions and is thoughtless and precipitant  my lord came home to me last tuesday with a long story of my brother and her for i had kept the matter as secret as i could for his sake and yours it seems he had it from sir john  uncle to the young lord c who is very earnest to bring on a treaty of marriage between her and his nephew who is in love with her and is a fine young gentleman but has held back on the liberties she has lately given herself with my brother i hope she is innocent as to fact but i know not what to say to it he ought to be hanged if he did not say she was yet i have a great opinion of his veracity and yet he is so bold a wretch  and her inconsideration is so great   but lest i should alarm your fears i will wait till i have the account he gives you of this dark affair till when i congratulate you upon the leave you have obtained to quit the town and on your setting out for a place so much nearer to tunbriige forgive me pamela but he is an intriguing wretch and i would not have you to be too secure lest the disappointment should be worse for you than what you knew before for assure yourself that i am in all cases and events  your affectionate sister and almirer b davers p s your bar and some other parts of your conduct in your trial as you call it make me as by your account it seemed to do him apprehensive that you would hardly have been able to have kept your intellect so untouched as were to be wished had this affair proceeded and this as it would have been the most deplorable misfortune that could have befallen us who love and admire you so justly redoubles my joy that it is likely to end so happily god send it may    letter xxxviii from mrs b to lady davers my dearest lady mr b with great goodness came back from bedfordshire to his time every thing being in readiness we set out my baby and his nurse and polly and rachel in the coach mr b and myself in the chariot the other maids are to go down with mrs jervis when every thing in london is settled by her direction to bedfordshire and all the menservants too except mr jonathan and abraham and john who went down with us on horseback as also did mr colbrand  we were met by my father and mother in a chaise and pair that your dear brother had unknown to me presented to them that they might often take the air together and go to church in it which is at some distance from them on sundays the driver is clothed in a good brown cloth suit but no livery for that my parents could not have borne as mr bs goodness made him consider  your ladyship must needs think how much we were all overjoyed at this meeting for my own part i cannot express how much i was transported when we arrived at the farmhouse to see all i delighted in upon one happy spot together  mr b is much pleased with the alterations made here see vol iii letter i  and it is a sweet rural and convenient place  we were at church together on sunday and welcomed into these parts by the bells and by the minister and the people of most note  mr b is to set out on tuesday for tunbridge with my papers a happy issue attend that affair i pray god he has given me the following particulars of it to the time of my trial beginning at the masquerade  he says that at the masquerade when pleased with the fair nuns shape air and voice he had followed her to a corner most unobserved she said in italian why are my retirements invaded audacious spaniard  because replied he my dear nun i hope you would have it so  i can no otherwise returned she strike dead thy bold presumption than to show thee my scorn and anger thus  and unmasking she surprised me said mr b with a face as beautiful but not so soft as my pamelas  and i said mr b to show i can defy your resentment will show you a countenance as intrepid as yours is lovely and so he drew aside his mask too  he says he observed his fair nun followed wherever she went by a mask habited like testimony in sir courtly nice whose attention was fixed upon them and he doubted not that it was mr turner so he and the fair nun took different ways and he joined me and miss darnford and found me engaged in the manner i related to your ladyship and his nun at his elbow unexpected  that afterward as he was engaged in french with a lady who had the dress of an indian princess and the mask of an ethiopian his fair nun said in broken spanish art thou at all complections  by st ignatius i believe you are a rover  i am trying replied he in italian whether i can meet with any lady comparable to my lovely nun  and what is the result  not one no not one  i wish you could not help being in earnest said she and slid from him  he engaged her next at the sideboard drinking under her veil a glass of champaign you know pamela said he there never was a sweeter mouth in the world than the countesss except your own she drew away the glass as if unobserved by any body to show me the lower part of her face  i cannot say continued he but i was struck with her charming manner and an unreservedness of air and behavior that i had not before seen so becoming  the place and the freedom of conversation and deportment allowed there gave her manner great advantages in my eye although her habit required as i thought continued he a little more gravity and circumspection and i could not tell how to resist a secret pride and vanity which is but too natural to both sexes when they are taken notice of by persons so worthy of regard  naturally fond of any thing that carried the face of an intrigue i longed to know proceeded he who this charming nun was  and next time i engaged her my good sister said i how happy should i be if i might be admitted to a conversation with you at your grate  answer me thou bold spaniard for that was a name she seemed fond to call me by said he which gave me to imagine that boldness was a qualification with which she was not displeased it is not unusual with our vain sex observed he to construe even reproaches to our advantage is the lady here whose shackles thou wearest  do i look like a man shackled my fairest nun  n  no not much like such an one but i fansy thy wife is either a widow or a quaker  neither replied i taking by equivocation her question literally  and art thou not a married wretch answer me quickly  we are observed  no  said i  swear to me thou art not   by st ignatius then for my dear i was no wretch you know  enough said she  and slid away and the fanatic would fain have engaged her but she avoided him as industriously  before i was aware continued mr b she was at my elbow and in italian said that fair quaker yonder is the wit of the assemblee her eyes seem always directed to thy motions and her person shows some intimacies have passed with somebody it is with thee  it would be my glory if it was said i were her face answerable to her person  is it not  i long to know replied mr b  i am glad thou do not  i am glad to hear my fair nun say that  do thou said she hate shackles or is it that thy hour is not come  i wish replied he this be not the hour the very hour  pretending naughty gentleman  what ways these men have  to sigh  she went again to the sideboard put her hand kerchief upon it mr b followed her and observed all her motions she drank a glass of lemonade as he of burgundy and a person in a domine who was supposed to be the king taking every ones attention and mr b eying her handkerchief which he doubted not she laid on purpose to forget taking up she left it there and slipping by him he unobserved as he believes took it and put it in his pocket and at one corner found the cover of a letter to the right honorable the countess dowager of   that after this the fair nun was so shy so reserved and seemed so studiously to avoid him that he had no opportunity to return her handkerchief and the fanatic observing how she shunned him said in french what monsieur have you done to your nun  found her to be a very coquet and told her so  and she is offended  how could you affront a lady replied he with such a charming face  by that i had reason to think said mr b that he had seen her unmask and i said  it becomes not any character but that you wear to pry into the secrets of others in order to make illnatured remarks and perhaps to take ungentlemanly advantages  no man would make that observation returned he whose views would bear prying into  i was nettled said mr b at this warm retort and drew aside my mask nor would any man who wore not a mask tell me so  he took not the challenge and slid from me and i saw him no more that night  so thinks i another instance this might have been of the glorious consequences of masquerading  o my lady these masquerades are abominable things   the king they said met with a free speaker that night in truth i was not very sorry for it for if monarchs will lay aside their sovereign distinctions and mingle thus in masquerade with the worst as well as the highest i cannot say best of their subjects let em take the consequence  perhaps they might have a chance to hear more truth here than in their palaces  the only good that possibly can accrue from them  that is to say  if they made a good use of it when they heard it for you see my monarch though told the truth as it happened received the hint with more resentment than thankfulness  so it is too likely did the monarch of us both  and now my lady you need not doubt that so polite a gentleman would find an opportunity to return the nun her handkerchief  to be sure he would for what man of honor would rob a lady of any part of her apparel and should he that wanted to steal a heart content himself with a handkerchief  no no that was not to be expected  so what does he do but the very next day after dinner the soonest opportunity he could well take because of the late hours the night before resolve to pursue this affair accordingly the poor quaker little thinking of the matter away goes her naughty spaniard to find out his nun at her grate or in her parlour rather  he asks for the countess is admitted into the outward parlour  her woman comes down requires his name and business his name he mentioned not his business was to restore into her ladys own hands something she had dropped the night before  was desired to wait  i should have told your ladyship that he was dressed very richly  having no design at all to make conquests no not he  o this wicked love of intrigue  a kind of olivecolourd velvet and fine brocaded waistcoat i said when he took leave of me youre a charming mr b  and saluted him more pressingly than he returned it but little did i think when i plaited so smooth his richlacd ruffles and bosom where he was going or what he had in his plotting heart  he went in his own chariot that he did so that he had no design to conceal who he was  but intrigue a new conquest vanity pride  o these men  they had need talk of ladies  but it is half our own fault indeed it is to encourage their vanity  well madam he waited till his stateliness was moved to send up again that he would wait on her ladyship some other time  so down she came dressed most richly jewels in her breast and in her hair and ears  but with a very reserved and stately air  he approached her  methinks i see him dear saucy gentleman you know madam what a noble manner of address he has  he took the handkerchief from his bosom with an air and kissing it presented it to her saying this happy estray thus restored begs leave by me to acknowledge its lovely owner  what mean you sir  who be you sir  what mean you  your ladyship will excuse me but i am incapable of meaning any thing but what is honorable  no to be sure  this madam you left last night when the domine took up every ones attention but mine which was much better engaged and i take the liberty to restore it to you  she turned to the mark a coronet at one corner it is true sir i see now it is one of mine but such a trifle was not worthy of being brought by such a gentleman as you seem to be nor of my trouble to receive it in person your servant sir might have delivered the bagatelle to mine  nothing should be called so that belongs to the countess of   she was no countess sir that dropped that handkerchief and a gentleman would not attempt to penetrate unbecomingly through the disguises that a lady thinks proper to assume especially at such a place where every inquiry should begin and end  this madam from a lady who had unmasked  because she would not be known  very pretty indeed  oh these slight cobweb airs of modesty so easily seen through  hence such advantages against us are taken by the men  she had looked out of her window and seen no arms quartered with his own for you know my lady i would never permit any to be procured for me so she doubted not it seems but he was an unmarried gentleman as he had intimated to her the night before  he told her it was impossible after having had the opportunity of seeing the finest lady in the world not to wish to see her again and that he hoped he did not unbecomingly break through her ladyships reserves nor had he made any inquiries either on the spot or off of it having had a much better direction by accident  as how sir said she as he told me with so bewitching an air between attentive and pleasant that bold gentleman forgetting all manner of distance so early too he clasped his arms round her waist and saluted her struggling with anger and indignation he says but i think little of that   whence this insolence  hownow sir  begone were her words and she rung the bell but he set his back against the door  i never heard such boldness in my life madam  till she would forgive him  and it is plain she was not so angry as she pretended for her woman coming she was calmer nelthorpe said she fetch my snuff box with the lavender in it  her woman went and then she said you told me sir last night of your intrepidness i think you are the boldest man i ever met with but sir surely you ought to know that you are not now in the haymarket  i think truly madam the lady might have saved herself that speech for upon my word they neither of em wore masks  though they ought both to have put on one of blushes  i am sure i do for em while i am writing  her irresistible loveliness served for an excuse that she could not disapprove from a man she disliked not and his irresistible  may i say assurance madam  found too ready an excuse  well but sir said i pray when her ladyship was made acquainted that you were a married gentleman how then  i long to hear how then  pray did she find it out or did you tell her  patience my dear  well pray sir go on  what was next  why next i put on a more respectful and tender air i would have taken her hand indeed but she would not permit it and when she saw i would not go till her lavender snuff came down for so i told her and her woman was not in haste she seated herself and i took my place by her and began upon a subject of a charming lady i saw the night before after i had parted with her ladyship but not equal by any means to her and i was confident this would engage her attention for i never knew the lady who thought herself handsome that was not taken by this topic flattery and admiration pamela are the two principal engines by which our sex make their first approaches to yours and if you listen to us we are sure either by the sap or the mine to succeed and blow you up whenever we please if we do but take care to suit ourselves to your particular foibles or to carry on the metaphor point our batteries to your weak side for the strongest fortresses my dear are weaker in one place than another  a fine thing sir said i to be so learned a gentleman  i wish though you had always come honestly by your knowledge thought i  when the lavender snuff came down continued he we were engaged in an agreeable disputation that i had raised on purpose to excite her opposition she having all the advantage in it and in order to give it up when she was intent upon it as a mark of my consideration for her  i the less wonder sir said i at your boldness pardon the word with such a lady in your first visit because of her freedoms when masked her unmasking and her handkerchief and lettercover to be sure the lady when she saw next day such a fine gentleman and such an handsome equipage had little reason after her other freedoms to be so very nice with you as to decline an insnaring conversation calculated on purpose to engage her attention and to lengthen out your visit but did she not ask you who you were  her servants did of mine  and her woman for i knew all afterward when we were better acquainted came and whispered her lady that i was mr b of bedfordshire and had an immense estate to which they were so kind as to add two or three thousand pounds a year out of pure goodwill to me i thank them  but pray dear sir what had you in view in all this did you intend to carry this matter at first as far as ever you could  i had at first my dear no view but such as pride and vanity suggested to me i was carried away by inconsideration and the love of intrigue without so much as giving myself any thought about the consequences the lady i observed had abundance of fine qualities i thought i could converse with her on a very agreeable foot and her honor i knew at any time would preserve me mine if ever i should find it in danger and in my soul i preferred my pamela to all the ladies on earth and questioned not but that and your virtue would be another barrier to my fidelity  as to the notion of polygamy i never but in the levity of speech and the wantonness of argument like other lively young fellows who think they have wit to show when they advance something out of the common way had it in my head i thought myself doubly bound by the laws of my country to discourage that way of thinking as i was a five hundredth part of one of the branches of the legislature and inconsiderable as that is yet it makes one too considerable in my opinion to break those laws one should rather join all ones interest to enforce  in a word therefore pride vanity thoughtlessness were my misguiders as i said the countesss honor and character and your virtue and merit my dear and my obligations to you were my defenses but i find one should avoid the first appearances of evil one knows not ones own strength it is presumptuous to depend upon it where wit and beauty are in the way on one side and youth and strong passions on the other  you certainly sir say right but be pleased to tell me what her ladyship said when she knew you were married  the countesss woman was in my interest and let me into some of her ladys secrets having a great share in her confidence and particularly acquainted me how loath her lady was to believe i was married i had paid her three visits in town and attended her once to her seat upon the forest before she heard that i was but when she was assured of it and directed her nelthorpe to ask me about it and i readily owned it she was greatly incensed though nothing but general civilities and intimacies not inconsistent with honorable friendship had passed between us the consequence was she forbid me ever seeing her again and set out with her sister and the viscount for tunbridge where she stayed about three weeks  i thought i had already gone too far and blamed myself for permitting her ladyship so long to believe me a single man and here the matter had dropped in all probability had not a ball given by lord  to which unknown to each other we were both as also the viscountess invited brought us again into one anothers company the lady withdrew after a while with her sister to another apartment and being resolved upon personal recrimination which is what a lady who is resolved to break with a favored object should never trust herself with sent for me and reproached me on my conduct in which her sister joined  i owned frankly that it was rather gaiety than design that made me give cause at the masquerade for her ladyship to think i was not married for that i had a wife who had a thousand excellencies and was my pride and my boast that i held it very possible for a gentleman and lady to carry on an innocent and honorable friendship in a family way and i was sure when she and her sister saw my spouse they would not be displeased with her acquaintance and all that i had to reproach myself with was that after having at the masquerade given reason to think i was not married i had been loath officiously to say i was although it never was my intention to conceal it  in short i acquitted myself so well to both ladies that a family intimacy was consented to  i renewed my visits and we accounted to one anothers honor by entering upon a kind of platonic system in which sex was to have no manner of concern  but my dear pamela i must own myself extremely blameable because i knew the world and human nature i will say better than the lady who never before had been trusted into it upon her own feet and who notwithstanding that wit and vivacity which every one admires in her gave herself little time for consideration as she had met with a man whose person and conversation she did not dislike and whose circumstances and spirit set him above sordid or mercenary views and besides i made myself useful to her in some of her affairs wherein she had been grossly abused which brought us into more intimate and frequent conversations than otherwise we should have had opportunities for  i ought therefore to have more carefully guarded against inconveniences that i knew were so likely to arise from such intimacies and the rather as i hinted because the lady had no apprehension at all of any so that my dear if i have no excuse from human frailty from youth and the charms of the object i am entirely destitute of any  i see dear sir said i there is a great deal to be said for the lady i wish i could say there was for the gentleman but such a fine lady had been safe with all her inconsideration and so forgive me sir would the gentleman with all his intriguing spirit had it not been for these vile masquerades never dear sir think of going to another  why my dear he was pleased to say those are least of all to be trusted at those diversions who are most desirous to go to them  of this i am now fully convinced  well dear sir i long to hear the further particulars of this story for this generous openness now the affair is over cannot but be grateful to me as it shows me you have no reserves and as it tends to convince me that the lady was less blameable than i apprehended she was for dearly do i love for the honor of my sex to find ladies of birth and quality innocent who have so many opportunities of knowing and practicing their duties above what meaner persons can have  else what one fails in through surprise and ignorance it will look as if the others did from inclination and what a disgrace is that upon the sex in general and what a triumph to the wicked ones of yours  well observed my dear this is like your generous and deep way of thinking  well but dear sir proceed if you please  your reconciliation is now effected a friendship quadrupartite is commenced and the viscountess and myself are to find cement for the erecting of an edifice that is to be devoted to platonic love what may i ask came next and what did you design should come of it  the oxford journey my dear followed next and it was my fault that you made not a party in it for both ladies were very desirous of your company but it being about the time you were going abroad after your lyingin i excused you to them yet they both longed to see you especially as by this time you may believe they knew all your story and besides whenever you were mentioned i always did justice as well to your mind as your person and this not only for the sake of justice but to say truth because it gave the two sisters and the viscount whose softly character and his ladys prudent and respectful conduct to him notwithstanding that are both so well known less cause of suspicion that i had any dishonorable designs upon the dowager lady  miss darnford will have it permit me my dear lady to observe that i have some merit with regard to the rest of my sex if i am enabled to reform such a dangerous spirit of intrigue as your dear brother possessed and the history of this affair from his own mouth made me begin to pride myself on this head for was he not think you my lady in this case a sad gentleman  and how deeply was he able to lay his mischiefs and how much had this fine lady been to be pitied had she fallen by his arts who was the only man almost that from the gracefulness of his person the nobleness of his mind his generosity courage ample fortunes and wit could have made her unhappy  god be praised that it was stopped in time though as it seems but just in time as well for the poor ladys sake as for mr bs and my own  excuse me madam for this digression but yet for what i am going to repeat i shall still want further excuse for i cannot resist a little rising vanity upon a comparison though only as to features drawn by your dear brother between the countess and me which however the preference he gives me in it may be undeserved yet it cannot but be very agreeable in this particular case of a rivalry to one who takes so much pride in his good opinion and who makes it her chief study by all honest and laudable means to preserve it but who else i hope is far from considering such a transitory advantage had i it in as great a degree as his kind fancy imputes to me but as it deserves i will give it as near as i can in his own words  it may not be altogether amiss my dear now i have mentioned the justice i always did your character and merit to give you a brief account of a comparison which once the countesss curiosity drew from me between your features and hers  she and i were alone in the bowwindow of her library which commands a fine view over windsor forest but which view we could not enjoy for it rained and blew a hurricane almost which though ready dressed to go abroad detained us within  i began a subject which never fails to make the worst of weather agreeable to a fine lady that of praising her beauty and the symmetry of her features telling her how much i thought every graceful one in her face adorned the rest as if they were all formed to give and receive advantage from each other i added approaching her as if the more attentively to peruse her fine face that i believed it possible from the transparent whiteness of her skin and the clear blueness of her veins to discover the circulation without a microscope  keep your distance mr b said she does your magnifying thus egregiously the graces you impute to my outward form agree with your platonic scheme your eye penetrating as you imagine it pierces not deep enough for a platonic if you cannot look farther than the white and the blue and discover the circulation of the spirit for our friendship is all mind you know  true madam but if the face is the index of the mind when i contemplate yours i see and revere the beauties of both in one and what platonic laws forbid us to do justice to the one when we admire the other  well sit you down bold mr b sit you down and answer me a question or two on this subject since you will be always raising my vanity upon it  i did saluting her hand only that was his word which i took notice of in the dear platonic though i said nothing  tell me now of a truth with all the charms your too agreeable flattery gives me which is the most lovely your pamela or myself  i told her you were both inimitable in a different way  well said she i give up the person and air in general because i have heard that she is slenderer and better shaped than most ladies but for a few particulars as to face invidious as the camparison may be and concerned as you are to justify your choice i will begin with the hair mr b whose hair is of most advantage to her complexion  come i fansy i shall at least divide perfections with your pamela  your ladyships delicate light brown is extremely beautiful and infinitely better becomes your complexion and features than would that lovely shineing auburn which suits best with my girls  you must know pamela i always called you my girl to her as i do frequently to yourself and others  so she excels me there i find  i dont say so  well but as to the forehead mr b  indeed madam my girl has some advantage i presume to think in her forehead she has a noble openness and freedom there that bespeaks her mind and every bodys favor the moment she appears not but that your ladyships next to hers is the finest i ever saw  so  next to hers rubbing her forehead  well brows mr b  your ladyships fine archbrow is a beauty in your fair face that a pencil cannot imitate but then your fairer hair shows it not to that advantage i must needs say that her darker hair gives her for as to complexion your are both so charmingly fair that i cannot for my life give a preference to either  well well foolish man said she peevishly thou art strangely taken with thy girl  i wish thou would go about thy business  what signifies a little bad weather to men  but if her complexion is as good as mine it must look better because of her dark hair  i shall come poorly off i find  let us have the eyes however  for black eyes in my girl and blue in your ladyship they are both the loveliest i ever beheld  and pamela i was wicked enough to say that it would be the sweetest traveling in the world to have you both placed at fifty miles distance from each other and to pass the prime of ones life from black to blue and from blue to black and it would be impossible to know which to prefer but the present  ah naughty mr b said i were you not worse than the countess a great deal  the countess is not bad my dear i was all in fault  but what sir did she say to you  say why the saucy lady did what very few ladies have ever done she made the powder fly out of my wig by a smart cuff with her nimble fingers  and how sir did you take that  how my dear  why i kissed her in revenge  fine doings between two platonicks thought i  but i will own to you madam that my vanity in this comparison was too much soothed not to wish to hear how it was carried on  well sir did you proceed further in your comparison  i knew my dear you would not let me finish at half your picture  o pamela  who says you are absolutely perfect who says there is no sex in your mind and tappd my neck  all is owing sir to the pride i take in your opinion i care not how indifferent i appear in the eyes of all the world besides  the cheek came next proceeded mr b i allowed her ladyship to have a livelier carmine in hers and that it was somewhat rounder her ladyship being a little plumper than my girl but that your face my dear being rather smaller featured of the two there was an inimitably finer turn in your cheek than i had ever seen in my life  her ladyship stroked her cheekbones which however madam i think are far from being high though to be sure she is a little larger featured in excellent proportion for all that as she is of a taller and a larger make than me and said very well sir you are determined to mortify me but added her ladyship which showed madam she little depended upon platonicism in him if you have a view in this you will be greatly mistaken i will assure you for let me tell you sir the lady who can think meanly of herself is any mans purchase  the nose i left in doubt said mr b but allowed that each were exquisitely beautiful on its own proper face  her ladyship was sure of a preference in her mouth i allowed that her lips were somewhat plumper  and saluting her by surprise for which i had much ado to preserve my wig from another disorder  a little softer of consequence but not quite so red  for said i i never saw a lip of so rich and balmy a red in my life as my girls  but your smiles madam are more bewitchingly free and attractive for my girl is a little too grave  and my lady charming as your teeth are i think hers not a whit inferior in whiteness and regularity  her chin my lady is a sweet addition to her face by that easy soft half round that looks as if nature had begun at top and gave that as her finishing stroke to the rest while my dear lady yours is a little little too strong featured but such as so infinitely becomes your face that my girls chin would not have half the beauty upon your face  her ears my lady are just such as your own  must they not be beautiful then her neck though it must not presume  let me see madam approaching her  keep your distance sir i was forced to do so  though it must not pretend to excel yours for whiteness yet except yours did i never see any neck so beautiful but your ladyship it must be confessed being a little plumper in person has the advantage here  i had a smart rap on my knuckles with her fan and she would hear no more but was resolved she would see you she said  and my dear i am the more particular in repeating this comparative description of the two charmingst persons in england because you will see the reason and that it was not to insult you as you rightly judged in your letter to my sister see p     l     but to your advantage that i gave way to the importunity of the countes to see you for i little thought you were so well acquainted with our intimacy much less that we had been made more intimate to you than ever in truth we were or perhaps might have been and when i asked you why you were not richer dressed and had not your jewels you may believe as i had no reason to doubt that the countess would come in all her ornaments i was not willing my girl should give way to the noble emulatress in any thing being concerned for your own honor as well as mine in the superiority of beauty i had so justly given you  well sir to be sure this was kind very kind and little was i disposed knowing what i knew to pass so favorable a construction on your generosity to me  my question to her ladyship continued mr b at going away whether you was not the charmingst girl in the world which seeing you together at one view rich as she was dressed and plain as you gave me the double pleasure a pleasure she said afterward i exulted in of deciding in your favor my readiness to explain to you what we both said and her not ungenerous answer i thought would have entitled me to a better return than a flood of tears which confirmed me that your past uneasiness was a jealousy i was not willing to allow in you though i should have been more indulgent to it had i known the grounds you thought you had for it and this was the reason of my leaving you so abruptly as i did  here madam mr b broke off referring to another time the conclusion of his narrative and having written a great deal i will here also close this letter though possibly i may not send it till i send the conclusion of this story in my next with the assurance that i am  your ladyships obliged sister and servant p b  letter xxxix my dear lady now i will proceed with my former subject and with the greater pleasure as what follows makes still more in favor of the countesss character than what went before although that set it in a better light than it had once appeared to me in i began as follows  will you be pleased sir to favor me with the continuation of our last subject i will my dear you left off sir with acquitting me as knowing what i knew for breaking out into that flood of tears which occasioned your abrupt departure but dear sir will you be pleased to satisfy me about that affecting information of your intention and my ladys to live at tunbridge together  it is absolutely malice and falsehood our intimacy had not proceeded so far and thoughtless as my sisters letters suppose the lady she would have spurned at such a proposition i dare say  well but then sir as to the expression to her uncle that she had rather have been a certain gentlemans second wife  i believe she might say something like it in passion to him he had been teizing her from the time that i held an argument in favor of that foolish topic polygamy in his company and his nieces and in that of her sister and the viscount with cautions against conversing with a man who having as he was pleased to say behind my back married beneath him wanted to engage the affections of a lady of birth in order to recover by doubling the fault upon her the reputation he had lost  she despised his insinuation enough to answer him that she thought my arguments in behalf of polygamy were convincing this set him a raving and he threw some coarse reflections upon her which could not be repeated if one may guess at them by her being incapable to tell me what they were and then to vex him more and to revenge herself she said something like what was reported and this was handle enough for her uncle who took care to propagate it with an indiscretion peculiar to himself for i heard of it in three different companies before i knew any thing of it from herself and when i did it was so repeated as you my dear would hardly have censured her for it the provocation considered  well but then dear sir there is nothing at all amiss at this rate in the correspondence between my lady and you  not on her side i dare say if her ladyship can be excused to punctilio and for having a greater esteem for a married man than he can deserve or than may be strictly defended to a person of your purity and niceness  well sir this is very noble in you i love to hear the gentlemen generous in points where the honor of our sex is concerned  but pray sir what then was there on your side in that matter that made you give me so patient and so kind a hearing  now my dear you come to the point at first it was as i have said before nothing in me but vanity pride and love of intrigue to try my strength where i had met with some encouragement as i thought at the masquerade where the lady went further too than she would have done had she not thought i was a single man for by what i have told you pamela you will observe that she endeavored to satisfy herself on that head as soon as she well could mrs nelthorpe acquainted me afterward when we were better known to one another that her lady was so partial in my favor who can always govern their fancies my dear as to think so early as at the masquerade that if every thing answered appearances and that i were a single man she who has a noble and independent fortune might possibly be induced to make me happy in her choice  supposing then that i was unmarryd she left a signal for me in her handkerchief i visited her had the honor after the customary first shyness of being well received by her and continued my visits till perhaps she would have been glad i had not been married but when she found i was she avoided me as i have told you till the accident i mentioned threw us again upon one another which renewed our intimacy upon terms perhaps too inconsiderate on one side and too designing on the other  for myself what can i say only that you without cause as i thought gave me great disgusts by your unwonted reception of me ever in tears and grief the countess ever cheerful and lively and apprehending that your temper was entirely changing i believed i had no bad excuse to make myself easy and cheerful abroad since my home became more irksome to me than ever i believed it could be then as we naturally love those who love us i had vanity and some reason for my vanity indeed all vain men believe they have  to think the countess had more than an indifference for me she was so exasperated by the wrong methods taken with an independent lady of her generous spirit to break off the acquaintance with me that in revenge she denied me less than ever opportunities of her company the pleasure we took in each others conversation was reciprocal the worlds reports had united us in one common cause and you as i said had made home less delightful to me than it used to be what might not then have been apprehended from so many circumstances concurring with the ladys beauty and my frailty  i waited on her to tunbridge she took an house there where peoples tongues will take so much liberty when they have no foundation for it at all and where the utmost circumspection is used what will they not say where so little of the latter is aimed at no wonder then that terms were said to be agreed upon between us from her uncles story of polygamy proposed by me and agreed to by her no wonder that all your thomasinefullers information was surmised  and thus stood the matter when i was determined to give your cause for uneasiness a fair hearing and to take my measures according to what should result from that hearing  from this account dear sir said i it will not be so difficult as i was afraid it would be to end this affair even to her ladyships satisfaction  i hope not my dear  but if now sir the countess should still be desirous not to break with you from so charming a lady who knows what may happen  very true pamela but to make you still easier i will tell you that her ladyship has a first cousin married to a person with a public character to several of the italian courts and had it not been for my persuasions she would have accepted of their earnest invitations and passed a year or two in italy where she once resided for three years together which makes her so perfect a mistress of italian  now i will let her know additional to what i have written to her the uneasiness i have given you and so far as it is proper what is come to your ears and your generous account of her and the charms of her person of which she will not be a little proud for she has really noble and generous sentiments and thinks well though her sister in pleasantry will have it a little enviously of you and when i shall endeavor to persuade her to go for the sake of her own character to a place and country of which she was always fond i am apt to think she will come into it for she has a greater opinion of my judgment than it deserves and i know a young lord that may be easily persuaded to follow her thither and bring her back his lady if he can obtain her consent and what say you pamela to this  o sir i believe i shall begin to love the lady dearly and that is what i never thought i should i hope this will be brought about  but i see give me leave to say sir how dangerously you might have gone on both you and my lady under the notion of this platonic love till two precious souls might have been lost and this shows one as well in spirituals as temporals from what slight beginnings the greatest mischiefs sometimes spring and how easy at first a breach may be stopped that when neglected the waves of passion will improve and bear down all before them  your observation my dear is just replied he and though i am confident the lady was more in earnest than myself in the notion of platonic love yet am i convinced and always was that platonic love is platonic nonsense it is the fly buzzing about the blaze till its wings are scorched or to speak still stronger it is a bait of the devil to catch the unexperienced and thoughtless nor ought such notions to be pretended to till the parties are five or ten years on the other side of their grand climacterick for age old age and nothing else must establish the barriers to platonic love but continued he this was my comparative consolation though a very bad one that had i swerved i should not have been the only instance where persons more scrupulous than i pretend to be have begun friendships even with spiritual views and ended them as grossly as i could do were the lady to have been as frail as her tempter  here madam mr b finished his narrative he is now set out for tunbridge with all my papers i have no doubt in his honor and kind assurances and hope my next will be a joyful letter and that i shall inform you in it that the affair which went so near my heart is absolutely concluded to my satisfaction to mr bs and to the countess for if it be so to all three my happiness will be founded on a permanent basis i hope mean time i am my dear good lady  your most affectionate and obliged sister and servant p b  letter xl a new misfortune my dear lady  but this is of god almightys sending so must bear it patiently my dear baby is taken with the smallpox to how many troubles are the happiest of us subjected in this life one need not multiply them by ones own wilful mismanagements  i am able to mind nothing else  i had so much joy as i told your ladyship in the beginning of my last letter but one to see on our arrival at the farmhouse my dearest mr b my beloved baby and my good father and mother all upon one happy spot together that i fear i was too proud  yet i was truly thankful  i am sure i was  but i had notwithstanding too much pride and too much pleasure on this happy occasion  i told your ladyship in my last that your dear brother set out on tuesday morning for tunbridge with my papers and i was longing to know the result hoping that every thing would be concluded to the satisfaction of all three for thought i if this be so my happiness must be permanent but alas alas there is nothing permanent in this life i feel it by experience now  i knew it before by theory but that was not so near and so interesting by half  for in the midst of all my pleasures and hopes in the midst of my dear parents joy and congratulations on our arrival and on what had passed so happily since we were last here together in the birth of the dear child and my safety for which they had been so apprehensive the dear baby was taken ill it was on that very tuesday afternoon his papa set out for tunbridge but we knew not it would be the smallpox till thursday oh madam how are all the pleasures i had formed to myself sickend now upon me for my billy is very bad  they talk of a kind sort but alas they talk at random for they come not out at all how then can they say they are kind  i fear the nurses constitution is too hale and too rich for the dear baby  had i been permitted  but hush all my repining ifs  except one if and that  if it be got happily over it will be best he had it so young and while at the breast  oh madam madam the small appearance that there was is gone in again and my child my dear baby will die  the doctors seem to think so  they want to send for mr b to keep me from him  but i forbid it  for what signifies life or any thing if i cannot see my baby while he is so dangerously ill  my father and mother are for the first time quite cruel to me they have forbid me and i never was so desirous of disobeying them before to attend the darling of my heart and why  for fear of this poor face  for fear i should get it myself  but i am living low very low and have taken proper precautions by bleeding and the like to lessen the distempers fury if i should have it and the rest i leave to providence and if mr bs value is confined so much to this poor transitory sightliness he must not break with his countess i think and if i am ever so deformed in person my poor intellects i hope will not be impaired and i shall if god spare my billy be useful in his first education and be helpful to dear miss goodwin  or to any babies  with all my heart  he may make me an humble nurse to  how peevish sinfully so i doubt does this accident and their affectionate contradiction make one  i have this moment received the following from mr b  maidstone my dearest love i am greatly touched with the dear boys malady which i have this moment heard of i desire you instantly to come to me hither in the chariot with the bearer mr colbrand i know what your grief must be but as you can do the child no good i beg you will oblige me every thing is in a happy train but i can think of nobody but you and for your sake principally but not a little for my own my boy i will set out to meet you for i choose not to come myself lest you should endeavor to persuade me to permit your tarrying about him and i should be sorry to deny you any thing i have taken here handsome apartments for you till the event which i pray god may be happy shall better determine me what to do i will be ever  your most affectionate and faithful   maidstone indeed is not so very far off but one may hear every day once or twice by a man and horse so i will go to show my obedience since mr b is so intent upon it  but i cannot live if i am not permitted to come back  oh let me be enabled gracious father to close this letter more happily than i have begun it  i have been so dreadfully uneasy at maidstone that mr b has been so good as to return with me hither and i find my babys case not yet quite desperate  i am easier now i see him in presence of his beloved papa  who lets me have all my way and approves of my preparative method for myself and he tells me that since i will have it so he will indulge me in my attendance on the child and endeavor to imitate my reliance on god  that is his kind expression and leave the issue to him and on my telling him that i feared nothing in the distemper but the loss of his love he said in presence of the doctors and my father and mother pressing my hand to his lips my dearest life make yourself easy under this affliction and apprehend nothing for yourself i love you more for your mind than your face that and your person will be the same and were that sweet face to be covered with seams and scars i will value you the more for the misfortune and glad i am that i had your picture so well drawn in town to satisfy those who have heard of your loveliness what you were and hitherto are for myself my admiration lies deeper and drawing me to the other end of the room whisperingly he said the last uneasiness between us was now i begin to think necessary because it has turned all my delight in you more than ever to the perfections of your mind and so god preserves to me the life of my pamela i care not for my own part what ravages the distemper makes here and tappd my cheek  how generous how noble how comforting was this  i will make this use of it i will now be resigned more and more to this dispensation and prepare myself for the worst for it is the dispensation of that god who gave me my baby and all i have  when i retired the reflections which i made on supposing the worst gave birth to the following serious lines for i cannot live without pen and ink in my hand written as by a third person suppose a good minister your ladyship will be pleased to give them your favorable allowances  tell me fond weeping parent why thou fearst so much thy child should die it is true though human frailty may yet reason cannot have much to say what is it thou thyself have found in this dull heavy tiresome round of life  to make thee wish thy son should through the like dark mazes run suppose the worst  twill end thy fears and free thee from a world of cares for oh what anxious thoughts arise from hopefullst youths to damp our joys who from the mornings brightest ray can promise what will be the day when i went from my apartment to go to my child my dear mr b met me at the nursery door and led me back again you must not go in again my dearest they have just been giving the child other things to try to drive out the malady and some pustules seem to promise on his breast i made no doubt my baby was then in extremity and i would have given the world to have shed a few tears but i could not  with the most soothing goodness he led me to my desk and withdrew to attend the dear baby himself  to see his last gaspings poor little lamb i make no doubt  this suspense and my own strange hardness of heart that would not give up one tear for the passage from that to my eyes seemed quite choked up which used to be so open and ready on other occasions affecting ones too produced these lines why does my fullswoln heart deny the tear reliefful to my eye if all my joys are passed away and thou dear boy to parent clay art hasting the last debt to pay resign me to thy will my god let me with patience bear this rod however heavy be the stroke if thou will not his doom revoke let me all sinful anguish shun and say resigned thy will be done   two days have passed dreadful days of suspense and now blessed be god who has given me hope that our prayers are heard the pustules come kindly out very thick in his breast and on his face but of a good sort they tell me  they will not let me see him indeed they will not  what cruel kindness is this one must believe all they tell one  but my dear lady my spirits are so weak and i have such a violent headache and have such a strange shivering disorder all running down my back and i was so hot just now and am so cold at this present  aguishly inclined  i dont know how  that i must leave off the post going away with the assurance that i am and will be to the last hour of my life  your ladyships grateful and obliged sister and servant p b  letter xli from mr b to lady davers my dear sister i take very kindly your solicitude for the health of my beloved pamela the last line she wrote was to you for she took to her bed the moment she laid down her pen  i told her your kind message and wishes for her safety by my lords gentleman and she begged i would write a line to thank you in her name for your affectionate regards to her  she is in a fine way to do well for with her accustomed prudence she had begun to prepare herself by a proper regimen the moment she knew the childs illness was the smallpox  the worst is over with the boy which keeps up her spirits and her mother is so excellent a nurse to both and we are so happy likewise in the care of a skilful physician dr m ho directs and approves of every thing the good dame does that it is a singular providence this malady seized them here and affords no small comfort to the dear creature herself  when i tell you that to all appearance her charming face will not receive any disfigurement by this cruel enemy to beauty i am sure you will congratulate me upon a felicity so desirable but were it to be otherwise if i were capable of slighting a person whose principal beauties are much deeper than the skin i should deserve to be thought the most unworthy and superficial of husbands  whatever your notions have been my everready censuring lady davers of your brother on a certain affair i do assure you that i never did and never can love any lady as i love my pamela  it is indeed impossible i can ever love her better than i do and her outward beauties are far from being indifferent to me yet if i know myself i am sure i have justice enough to love her equally and generosity enough to be more tender of her were she to suffer by this distemper but as her humility and her affection to me would induce her to think herself under greater obligation to me for such my tenderness to her were she to lose any the least valuable of her perfections i rejoice that she will have no reason for mortification on that score  my respects to lord davers and all your noble neighbors i am  your affectionate brother and humble servant  letter xlii from lady davers in answer to the preceding my dear brother i do most heartily congratulate you on the recovery of master billy and the good way my sister is in i am the more rejoiced as her sweet face is not likely to suffer by the malady for be the beauties of the mind what they will those of person are no small recommendation with some folks i am sure and i began to be afraid that when it was hardly possible for both conjoined to keep a roving mind constant that one only would not be sufficient  this news gives me the more pleasure because i am well informed that a certain gay lady was pleased to give herself airs upon hearing of my sisters illness as that she could not be sorry for it for now she should look upon herself as the prettiest woman in england she meant only i suppose as to outward prettiness brother  you give me the name of a ready censurer i own i think myself to be not a little interested in all that regards my brother and his honor but when some people are not readier to censure than others to trespass i know not whether they can with justice be styled censorious  but however that be the rod seems to have been held up as a warning  and that the blow in the irreparable deprivation is not given is a mercy that i hope will be deserved though you never can those very signal ones you receive at the divine hands beyond any gentleman i know for even if i shall not be deemed censorious again your very vices have been turned to your felicity as if god would try the nobleness of the heart he has given you by overcoming you in answer to my sisters constant prayers as well as mine by mercies rather than by judgments  i might give instances of the truth of this 0bservation in almost all the actions and attempts of your past life and take care if you are displeased i will speak it take care thou bold wretch that if this method be ingratefully slighted the uplifted arm fall not down with double weight on thy devoted head  i must always love and honor my brother but cannot help speaking my mind which after all is the natural result of that very love and honor and which obliges me to style myself  your truly affectionate sister b davers  letter xliii from mrs b to lady davers my dearest lady my first letter and my first devoirs after those of thankfulness to that gracious god who has so happily conducted me through two such heavy trials as my childs and my own illness must be directed to your ladyship with all due acknowlegement of your generous and affectionate concern for me  we are now preparing for our journey to bedfordshire and there to my great satisfaction i am to be favored with the care of miss goodwin  after we have tarried about a month there mr b will make a tour with me through several counties taking the hall in the way for about a fortnight and show me what is remarkable everywhere as we pass for this he is pleased to think will better contribute to my health than any other method for the distemper has left upon me a kind of weariness and listlessness and he proposes to be out with me till the bath season begins and by the aid of those healing and balsamic waters he hopes i shall be quite established afterward he purposes to return to bedfordshire for a little while then to london then to kent and if nothing hinders has a great mind to carry me over to paris  thus most kindly does he amuse and divert me with his agreeable schemes and proposals but i have made one amendment to them and that is that i must not be denied to pay my respects to your ladyship at your seat and to my good lady countess and this will be far from being the loast of my pleasures  i have had congratulations without number on my recovery but one among the rest i did not expect from the countess dowager could you think it madam who sent me by her gentleman the following letter from tunbridge   dear mrs b i hope among the congratulations of your numerous admirers on your happy recovery my very sincere ones will not be unacceptable i have no other motive for making you my compliments on this occasion on so slender an acquaintance than the pleasure it gives me that the public as well as your private friends have not been deprived of a lady whose example in every duty of life is of so much concern to both may you madam long rejoice in an uninterrupted state of happiness answerable to your merits and to your own wishes are those of  your most obedient humble servant   to this kind letter i returned the following my good lady i am under the highest obligation to your generous favor in your kind compliments of congratulation on my recovery there is something so noble and so condescending in the honor you have done me on so slender an acquaintance that it bespeaks the exalted mind and character of a lady who in the principles of generosity and in true nobleness of nature has no example may god almighty bless you my dear lady with all the good you wish me and with increase of honor and glory both here and hereafter prays and will always pray   your ladyships most obliged and obedient servant p b     this leads me to mention to your ladyship what my illness would not permit me to do before that mr b met with such a reception and audience from the countess when he attended her in all he had to offer and propose to her and in her patient hearing of what he thought fit to read her from your ladyships letters and mine that he said dont be jealous my dear pamela but i must admire her as long as i live  he gave me the particulars so much to her ladyships honor that i told him he should not only be welcome to admire her ladyship but that i would admire her too  they parted very good friends and with great professions of esteem for each other  and as mr b had undertaken to inspect into some exceptionable accounts and managements of her ladyships bailiff one of her servants brought a letter for him on monday last wholly written on that subject but her ladyship was so kindly considerate as to send it unsealed in a cover directed to me when i opened it i was frighted to see it begin to mr b and i hastened to find him in the walk up to the newraised mount  dear sir  here is some mistake  you see the direction is to mrs b  it is very plain  but upon my word i have not read it  dont be uneasy my love  i know what the subject must be but i dare swear there is nothing nor will there ever be but what you or any body may see  he read it and giving it to me to peruse said answer yourself the postscript my dear  that was  if sir the trouble i give you is likely to subject you or your lady to uneasiness or apprehensions i beg you will not interfere in it i will then set about the matter myself for my uncle i will not trouble yet women enter into these particulars with as little advantage to themselves as inclination  i told him i was entirely easy and unapprehensive and after all his goodness to me should be so if he saw the countess every day that is kindly said my dear returned he but i will not trust myself to see her every day or at all for the present i will assure you i will not  but i shall be obliged to correspond with her for a month or so on this occasion unless you prohibit it and it shall be in your power to do so  i said with my whole heart he might and i should be quite easy in both their honors  yet will i not pamela said he unless you see our letters for i know she will always now she has begun send in a cover to you what she will write to me unsealed and whether i am at home or abroad i shall take it unkindly if you do not read them  he went in with me and wrote an answer which he sent by the messenger but would make me whether i would or not read it and seal it up with his seal but all this needed not to me now who think so much better of the lady than i did before and am so well satisfied in his own honor and generous affection for me for you saw madam in what i wrote before that he always loved me though he was angry at times at my change of temper as he apprehended it not knowing that i was apprised of what passed between him and the countess  i really am better pleased with this correspondence than i should have been had it not been carried on because the servants on both sides will see by my deportment on the occasion and i will officiously with a smiling countenance throw myself in their observation that it is quite innocent and this may help to silence the mouths of those who have so freely censured their conduct  indeed madam i think i have received no small good myself by that affair which once lay so heavy upon me for i dont believe i shall ever be jealous again indeed i dont think i shall and will not that be an ugly foible overcome i see what may be done in cases not favorable to our wishes by the aid of proper reflection and that the be is not the only creature that may make honey out of the bitter flowers as well as the sweet  my best and most grateful respects and thanks to my good lord davers to the earl and his excellent countess and most particularly to lady betty with whose kind compliments your ladyship acquaints me and to mr h for all your united congratulations on my recovery what obligations do i lie under to such noble and generous wellwishers  i can make no return but by my prayers that god by his goodness will supply all my defects and these will always attend you from my dearest lady  your ever obliged sister and humble servant p b mr h is just arrived he says he comes a special messenger to make a report how my face has come off he makes me many compliments upon it how kind your ladyship is to enter so favorably into the minutest concerns which you think may any way affect my future happiness in your dear brothers wishes  i want to pour out all my joy and my thankfulness to god before your ladyship and my good lady countess of c  for i am a happy yea a blessed creature  mr bs boy your ladyships boy and my boy is charmingly well quite strong and very forward for his months and his papa is delighted with him more and more    letter xliv my dear miss darnford i hope you are happy and well you kindly say you cannot be so till you hear of my perfect recovery and this blessed be god you have heard already from mr b  as to your intimation of the fair nun it is all happily over blessed be god for that too and i have a better and more indearing husband than ever did you think that could be  my billy too improves every day and my dear father and mother seem to have their youth renewed like the eagles how many blessings have i to be thankful for  we are about to turn travelers to the northern counties i think quite to the borders and afterward to the western to bath to bristol and i know not whither myself but among the rest to lincolnshire that you may be sure of then how happy shall i be in my dear miss darnford  i long to hear whether poor mrs jewkes is better or worse for the advice of the doctor whom i ordered to attend her from stamford and in what frame her mind is  do my dear miss vouchsafe her a visit in my name tell her if she be lowspirited what god has done for me as to my recovery and comfort her all you can and bid her spare neither expense nor attendance nor any thing her heart can wish for nor the company of any relations or friends she may desire to be with her  if she is in her last stage poor soul how noble will it be in you to give her comfort and consolation in her dying hours  although we can merit nothing at the hand of god yet i have a notion that we cannot deserve more of one another and in some sense for that reason of him than in our charities on so trying an exigence when the poor soul stands shivering as it were on the edge of life and has nothing strong but its fears and doubts  then a little balm poured into the wounds of the mind a little comforting advice to rely on gods mercies from a good person how consolatory must it be and how like morning mists before the sun must all diffidences and gloomy doubts be chased away by it  but my dear miss the great occasion of my writing to you just now is by lady daverss desire on a quite different subject she knows how we love one another and she has sent me the following lines by her kinsman who came to kent purposely to inquire how my face fared in the smallpox and accompanied us from kent hither  i e to bedfordshire and sets out tomorrow for lord daverss  my dear pamela  jackey will tell you the reason of his journey my curiosity on your own account and i send this letter by him but he knows not the contents my good lord davers wants to have his nephew married and settled in the world and his noble father leaves the whole matter to my lord as to the person settlements etc  now i as well as my lord think so highly of the prudence the person and family of your miss darnford that we shall be obliged to you to sound that young lady on this score  i know mr h would wish for no greater happiness but if miss is engaged or cannot love my nephew i dont care nor would my lord that such a proposal should be received with undue slight his birth the title and estate he is heir to are advantages that require a ladys consideration he has not indeed so much wit as miss but he has enough for a lord whose friends are born before him as the phrase is is very goodhumored no fool no sot no debauchee and let me tell you these are circumstances not to be met with every day in a young man of quality  as to settlements fortune etc i fansy there would be no great difficulties the business is if miss could love him well enough for a husband that we leave to you to sound the young lady and if she thinks she can we will directly begin a treaty with sir simon on that subject i am my dearest pamela  your ever affectionate sister b davers   now my dear miss as my lady has so well stated the case i beg you to enable me to reurn an answer i will not say one word pro or con till i know your mind  only that i think he is goodhumored and might be easily persuaded to any thing a lady should think reasonable  and now i must tell you another piece of news in the matrimonial way mr williams has been here to congratulate us on our multiplied blessings and he has acquainted mr b that an overture has been made him by his new patron for i suppose you know that all is adjusted according to the scheme i formerly acquainted you with see vol iii p          between mr adams and him and both are settled in their respective livings only that i ought to have to have told you that mr williams on mature consideration declined the stipulated  0 l per annum from mr adams as he thought it would have a simoniacal appearance of a kinswoman of his lordships a lady of virtue and merit and a fortune of  000 l to make him amends as the earl tells him for quitting a better living to oblige him and that he is in great hope of obtaining the ladys consent which is all that is wanting mr b is very much pleased with so good a prospect in mr williamss favor and has been in the ladys company formerly at a ball at gloucester and he says she is a prudent and deserving lady and offers to make a journey on purpose to forward it if he can be of service  but now my hands in let me tell you of a third matrimonial proposition which gives me more puzzle and dislike a great deal and that is mr adams has with great reluctance and after abundance of bashful apologies requested of me to know if i have any objection to his making his addresses to polly barlow which however he told me he had not mentioned to her nor to any body living because he would first know whether i should take it amiss as her service was so immediately about my person  this unexpected motion perplexed me a good deal the gentleman is a worthy and a pious man he has now a very good living but is but just entered upon it and i think according to his accustomed prudence in other respects had better have turned himself about first  but that is not the point with me neither i have a great regard to the function i think it is as necessary in order to preserve the respect due to the clergy that their wives should be nearly if not quite as unblemished and as circumspect as themselves and this for the gentlemans own sake as well as in the eye of the world for how shall he pursue his studies with comfort to himself if he be made uneasy at home or how shall he expect his female parishioners will regard his public preaching when he cannot influence the private practice of his wife  i cannot say excepting in the instance of mr h but polly is a good sort of body enough so far as i know but that is such a blot in the poor girls escutcheon a thing not accidental not surprised into not owing to inattention but to cool premeditation after she had slept over and over upon it that i think i could wish mr adams a wife more unexceptionable  it is true mr adams knows not this  but that is one of my difficulties if i tell him i shall hurt the poor maiden irreparably and deprive her of a gentleman for a husband to whom she may possibly make a good wife  for she is not very meanly descended  much better than myself as the world would account it were they to judge from my my fathers low estate when i was exalted  i never dear miss shall be ashamed of these retrospections  she is genteel has a very innocent look a good face is neat in her person and not addicted to any excess that i know of but still my dear miss that one premeditated fault is so sad a one that though she might make a good wife for any middling man of business  yet she wants methinks that purity that conduct which i would always have in the wife of a good clergyman  then besides she has not applied her thoughts to that sort of economy which is proper for the wife of a country clergyman to know something of and she has a turn to dress and appearance that i can see if indulged she would not be one that would help to remove the scandal which some severe remarkers are apt to throw upon the wives of parsons as they call them  the maiden i believe likes mr adams not a little she is very courteous to every body but most to him of any body and never has missed being present at our sunday duties and five or six times mrs jervis tells me she has found her desirous to have mr adams expound this text and that difficulty and the good man is taken with her piety which and her reformation i hope is sincere but oh miss she is very sly very subtle as i have found in several instances as foolish as she was in the affair i hint at  so sometimes i say to myself the girl may love mr adams ay but then i answer so she did mr h and on his own very bad terms too  in short  but i will not be too censorious neither  so i will say no more than that i was perplexed and yet should be very glad to have polly well married for since that time i have always had some diffidences about her  because you know miss  her fault was so enormous and so premeditated i wanted you to advise with  but this was the method i took  i appointed mr adams to drink a dish of tea with me in the afternoon polly attended as she generally does for i cannot say i love men attendants in these womanly offices  a teakettle in a mans hand that would if there was no better employment for him be fitter to hold a plough or handle a flail or a scythe has such a look with it  this is like my low breeding some would say perhaps  but i cannot call things polite that i think unseemly and moreover let me tell you lady davers keeps me in countenance in this my notion and who doubts her politeness  well but polly attended as i said and there were strange simperings and bowing and courtsying between them the honest gentleman seeming not to know how to let his mistress wait upon him while she behaved with as much respect and officiousness as if she could not do too much for him  very well thought i i have such an opinion of your veracity mr adams that i dare say you have not because you told me you have not mentioned the matter to polly but between her officiousness and your mutual simperings and complaisance i see you have found out a language between you that is full as significant as plain english words polly thought i sees no difficulty in this text nor need you mr adams have much trouble to make her understand when you come to expound on this subject  i was forced in short to put on a statelier and more reserved appearance than usual to make them avoid acts of complaisance for one another that might not be proper to be shown before me from one who sat as my companion to my servant  when she withdrew the modest gentleman hemmed and looked on one side and turned to the right and left as if his seat was uneasy to him and i saw knew not how to speak so i began in mere compassion to him and said mr adams i have been thinking of what you mentioned to me as to polly barlow  hem hem said he and pulled out his handkerchief and wiped his mouth  very well madam  i hope no offense madam  no sir none at all but i am at a loss how to distinguish in this case whether it may not be from a motive of too humble gratitude that you dont think yourself above matching with polly as you may suppose her a favorite of mine or whether it be your value for her person and qualities that makes her more agreeable in your eyes than any other person would be  madam  madam said the bashful gentleman hesitatingly  i do  i must needs say  i cannot but own  that  mrs mary  is a person  whom i think very agreeable and no less modest and virtuous  you know sir your own circumstances to be sure you have a very pretty house and a good living to carry a wife to and a gentleman of your prudence and discretion wants not any advice but you have reaped no benefits by your living it has been an expense to you rather that you will not presently get up do you propose an early marriage sir or were it not better that you suspended your intentions of that sort for a year or two more  madam if your ladyship choose not to part with   nay mr adams interrupted i i say not any thing for my own sake in this point that is out of the question with me i can very willingly part with polly were it tomorrow for her good and yours  madam said he i humbly beg pardon but  but  delays  may breed dangers  oh very well thought i i will be further if the artful girl has not let him know by some means or other that she has some other humble servant  and so miss it has proved  for dismissing my gentleman with assuring him that i had no objection at all to the matter or to parting with polly as soon as it suited with their convenience  i founded her and asked if she thought mr adams had any affection for her  she said he was a very good gentleman  i know it polly and are you not of opinion he loves you a little  dear mam good your ladyship  love me  i dont know what such a gentleman as mr adams should see in me to love me  oh thought i does the objection lie on that side then  i see it is not of thine  well but polly if you have another sweetheart you should do the fair thing that you should it would be wrong if you encouraged any body else if you thought of mr adams  indeed mam i had a letter sent me  a letter that i received  from  from a young man in bedford but i never gave an answer to it  oh thought i then thou would not encourage two at once this was as plain a declaration as i wanted that she had thoughts of mr adams  but how came mr adams polly to know of this letter  how came mr adams to know of it mam  repeated she  half surprised  why i dont know i cannot tell how it was  but i dropped it near his desk  pulling out my handkerchief i believe mam and he brought it after me and gave it me again  well thought i you are an intriguing slut i doubt polly  delays may breed dangers quoth the poor gentleman  ah girl girl thought i but did not say so thou deservest to be blown up and to have thy plot spoiled that thou do  but if thy forwardness should expose thee afterward to evils which thou may avoid if thy schemes take place i should very much blame myself and i see he loves thee  so let the matter take its course i will trouble myself no more about it it is an invidious task and i wish thou will but make mr adams the wife he deserves  and so i dismissed her telling her that whoever thought of being a clergymans wife should resolve to be as good as himself to set an example to all her sex in the parish and show how much his doctrines had weight with her should be humble circumspect gentle in her temper and manners frugal not proud nor vying in dress with the ladies of the laity should resolve to sweeten his labors and to be obliging in her deportment to poor as well as rich that her husband got no discredit through her means which would weaken his influence upon his auditors and that she must be most of all obliging to him and study his temper that his mind might be more disengaged in order to pursue his studies with the better effect  and so much my dear miss darnford for your humble servant and for mr williamss and mr adamss matrimonial prospects  and dont think me disrespectful that i have mentioned my pollys affair in the same letter with yours for in high and low i forget the latin phrase  i have not had a lesson a long long while from my dear tutor love is in all the same  but whether you will like mr h as well as polly does mr adams that is the question but leaving that to your own decision i conclude with one observation that although i thought ours was a house of as little intriguing as any bodys since the dear master of it has left off that practice yet i cannot see that any family can be clear of some of it long together where there are men and women worth plotting for as husbands and wives  my best wishes and respects attend you all my most worthy neighbors i hope ere many months are past to assure you all severally to wit sir simon my lady and your dear self mrs jones mr peters and his lady and niece whose kind congratulations make me very proud and very thankful how much i am obliged to you and particularly my dear miss how much i am  your ever affectionate and faithful friend and servant p b  letter xlv from miss darnford in answer to the preceding my dear mrs b i have been several times in company with mr peters to see mrs jewkes the poor woman is very bad and cannot live many days we comfort her all we can but she often accuses herself of her past behavior to so excellent a lady and with blessings upon blessings heaped upon you and her master and your charming little boy she is continually declaring how much your goodness to her exasperates her former faults to her own conscience  she has her sisterinlaw and her niece with her and has settled all her affairs and thinks she is not long for this world  her distemper is an inward decay all at once as it were from a constitution that seemed like one of iron and she is a mere skeleton you would not know her i am sure  i will see her every day and she has given me up all her keys and accounts to give mr longman who is daily expected and i hope will be here soon for her sisterinlaw she says herself is a woman of this world as she has been  mr peters calling on me to go with him to visit her i will break off here  mrs jewkes is much as she was but your faithful steward is come i am glad of it  and so is she  nevertheless i will go every day and do all the good i can for the poor woman according to your charitable desires and excellent intentions  i thank you madam for your communication of lady daverss letter i am much obliged to my lord and her ladyship and should have been proud of an alliance with that noble family but with all mr hs good qualities as my lady paints them out i could not for the world make him my husband  i will tell you one of my objections in confidence though for you are only to sound me you know and i would not have it mentioned that i have taken any thought about the matter because a stronger reason may be given such an one as my lord and lady will both allow which i will communicate to you byandby  my objection arises even from what you intimate of mr hs good humor and his persuadableness if i may so say now madam were i of a boisterous temper and high spirit such an one as required great patience in a husband to bear with me then mr hs character of good humor might have been a consideration with me but when i have i pride myself in the thought a temper not wholly unlike your own and such an one as would not want to contend for superiority with a husband it is no recommendation to me that mr h is a goodhumored gentleman and will bear with faults i design not to be guilty of  but my dear mrs b my husband must be a man of sense and must give me reason to think he has a superior judgment to my own or i shall be unhappy he will otherwise do wrongheaded things i shall be forced to oppose him in them he will be obstinate and tenacious and will be taught to talk of prerogative and to call himself a man without knowing how to behave as one and i to despise him of course and so be deemed a bad wife when i hope i have qualities that would make me a tolerable good one with a man of sense for my husband you know who says for fools pardon me this harsh word it is in my author for fools are stubborn in their way as coins are hardened by the allay and obstinacys never so stiff as when it is in a wrong belief   now you must not think i would dispense with real good humor in a man no i make it one of my indispensables in a husband a goodnatured man will put the best constructions on what happens but he must have sense to distinguish the best he will be kind to little unwilful undesigned failings but he must have judgment to distinguish what are or are not so  but mr hs good humor is softness as i may call it and my husband must be such an one in short as i need not be ashamed to be seen with in company one who being my head must not be beneath all the gentlemen he may happen to fall in with and who every time he is adjusting his mouth for speech will give me pain at my heart and blushes in my face even before he speaks  i could not bear that every gentleman and every lady we encountered should be prepared whenever he offered to open his lips by their contemptuous smiles to expect some weak and silly things from him and when he had spoken that he should with a booby grin seem pleased that he had not disappointed them  the only recommendatory point in mr h is that he dresses exceedingly smart and is no contemptible figure of a man but dear madam you know that is so much the worse when the mans talent is not taciturnity except before his aunt mr b and you when he is not conscious of internal defect and values himself upon outward appearance  as to his attempt upon your polly though i dont like him the better for it yet it is a fault so wickedly common among gentlemen that when a lady resolves never to marry till a quite virtuous man addresses her it is in other words resolving to die single so that i make not this the chief objection although i must tell you i would abate in my expectations of half a dozen other good qualities rather than that one of virtue in a husband  but when i reflect upon the figure mr h made in that affair i cannot bear him and if i may judge of other coxcombs by him what wretches are these smart welldressing querpofellows many of which you and i have seen admiring themselves at the plays and operas  this is one of my infallible rules and i know it is yours too that he who is taken up with the admiration of his own sweet person will never admire a wifes his delights are centred in himself and he will not wish to get out of that narrow that exceeding narrow circle and in my opinion should keep no company but that of tailors wigpuffers and milaners  but i will run on no further upon this subject but will tell you a reason that you may give to lady davers why her kind intentions to me cannot be answered and which she will take better than what i have said were she to know it as i hope you will not let her and this is my papa has had a proposal made to him from a gentleman you have seen and have thought polite see vol iii p      it is from sir w g of this county who is one of your great admirers and mr bs too and that you must suppose makes me have never the worse opinion of him or of his understanding although it requires no great sagacity or penetration to see how much you adorn our sex and human nature too  every thing was adjusted between my papa and mamma and sir william on condition we approved of each other before i came down which i knew not till i had seen him here four times and then my papa surprised me into an half approbation of him and this it seems was one of the reasons i was so hurried down from you  i cannot say but i like the gentleman as well as most i have seen he is a man of sense and sobriety to give him his due and is in very easy circumstances and much respected by all who know him and that is no bad earnest you are sensible in a marriage prospect  but hitherto he seems to like me better than i do him i dont know how it is but i have often observed that when any thing is in our own power we are not half so much taken with it as we should be perhaps if we were kept in suspense why should this be  but this i am convinced of there is no comparison between sir william and mr murray  now i have named this brotherinlaw of mine what do you think  why that good couple have had their house on fire three times already and that very dangerously too for once it was put out by mr murrays mother who lives near them and twice sir simon has been forced to carry water to extinguish it for truly mrs murray would go home again to her papa she would not live with such a surly wretch and it was with all his heart a fair riddance for there was no bearing the house with such an illnatured wife  her sister polly was worth a thousand of her  i am sorry heartily sorry for their unhappiness but could she think every body must bear with her and her fretful ways  they will jangle on i reckon till they are better used to one another and when he sees she cannot help it why he will bear with her as husbands generally do with illtemperd wives that is to say he will try to make himself happy abroad and leave her to quarrel with her maids instead of him for she must have somebody to vent her spleen upon poor nancy  i am glad to hear of mr williamss good fortune  as mr adams knows not pollys fault and it was prevented in time they may be happy enough she is a sly girl i always thought her so something so innocent and yet so artful in her very looks she is an odd compound of a girl but these worthy and piously turned young gentlemen who have but just quitted the college are mere novices as to the world indeed they are above it while in it they therefore give themselves little trouble to study it and so depending on the goodness of their own hearts are more liable to be imposed upon than people of half their understanding  i think as he seems to love her you do right not to hinder the girls fortune but i wish she may take your advice in her behavior to him at least for as to her carriage to her neighbors i doubt she will be one of the heads of the parish presently in her own estimation  it is pity methinks any worthy gentleman of the cloth should have a wife who by a bad example should pull down as fast as he by a good one can build up  this is not the case of mrs peters however whose example i wish was more generally followed by gentlewomen who are made so by marrying a good clergyman if they were not so before  dont be surprised if you should hear that poor jewkes is given over  she made a very exemplary  full of blessings  and more easy and resigned than i apprehended she would be  i know you will shed a tear for the poor woman  i cannot help it myself but you will be pleased that she had so much time given her and made so good use of it  mr peters has been every thing that one would wish one of his function to be in his attendances and advice to the poor woman mr longman will take proper care of every thing  so i will only add that i am with the sincerest respects in hopes to see you soon for i have a multitude of things to talk to you about dear mrs b  your ever faithful and affectionate polly darnford  letter xlvi from mrs b to lady davers my dear lady davers i understand from miss darnford that before she went down from us her papa had encouraged a proposal made by sir wg whom you saw when your ladyship was a kind visitor in bedfordshire we all agreed if your ladyship remembers that he was a polite and sensible gentleman and i find it is countenanced on all hands  poor mrs jewkes madam as miss informs me has paid her last debt i hope through mercy she is happy poor poor woman  but why say i so  since in that case she will be richer than an earthly monarch at least till he is levelled with her in death  your ladyship was once mentioning a sister of mrs wordens whom you could be glad to recommend to some worthy family  shall i beg of you madam to oblige mr bs in this particular i am sure she must have merit if your ladyship thinks well of her and your commands in this as well as in every other particular shall have their due weight with  your ladyships obliged sister and humble servant p b just now dear madam mr b tells me i shall have miss goodwin brought me hither tomorrow    letter xlvii from lady davers to mrs b in answer to the preceding my dear pamela i am glad miss darnford is likely to be so happy in a husband as sir w g will certainly make her i was afraid that the proposal i made would not do with miss had she not had so good a tender i want too to have the foolishfellow married  for several reasons one of which is he is continually teizing us to permit him to go up to town in order for him to reside there for some months to see the world as he calls it but we are convinced he would feel it as well as see it if we gave way to his request for in understanding dress and inconsiderate vanity he is so exactly sized and cut out for a town fop coxcomb or pretty fellow as it is called that he will undoubtedly fall into all the vices of those people and perhaps having such expectations as he has will be made the property of rakes and sharpers he complains that we use him like a child in a gocart or a baby with leadingstrings and that he must not be trusted out of our sight it is a sad thing that these bodies will grow up to the stature of men when the minds improve not at all with them but are still those of boys and children yet he would certainly make a fond husband for at present he has no very bad qualities but is such a narcissus  but this between ourselves for his uncle is wrapped up in the fellow  and why because he is goodhumored that is all he has vexed me lately which makes me write so angrily about him  but it is not worth troubling you with the particulars  i hope mrs jewkes is happy as you say  poor woman she seemed to promise for a longer life but what shall we say  your compliment to me of my becks sister is a very kind one i am greatly obliged to you for it mrs oldham is a sober grave widow a little aforehand in the world but not much has lived well understands household management thoroughly is diligent and has a turn to serious things which will make you like her the better  i will order beck and her to wait on you in a chaise and pair and she will satisfy you in every thing as to what you may and may not expect of her  you cannot think how kindly i take this motion from you you forget nothing that can oblige your friends little did think you would remember me of what i had forgotten in a manner my favorable opinion and wishes for her expressed so long ago  but you are what you are  a dear obliging creature  beck is all joy and gratitude upon it and her sister had rather serve you than the princess you need be under no difficulties about terms she would serve you for nothing if you would accept of her service  i am glad because it pleases you so much that miss goodwin will be soon put into your care it will be happy for the child and i hope she will be so dutiful to you as to give you no pain for your generous goodness to her her mamma has sent me a present of some choice products of that climate with acknowlegements of my kindness to miss i will send part of it to you by your new servant for so i presume to call her already  what a naughty sister you are however to be so far advanced again as to be obliged to shorten your intended excursions and yet not to send me word of it yourself dont you know how much i interest myself in every thing that makes for my brothers happiness and yours  more especially in so material a point as is the increase of a family that it is my boast to be sprung from  yet i must find this out by accident and by other hands  is not this very slighting  but never do so again and i will forgive you now because of the joy it gives me who am  your truly affectionate and obliged sister b davers i thank you for your book upon the plays you saw enclosed is a list of some others which i desire you to read and to oblige me with your remarks upon them at your leisure though you may not perhaps have seen them by the time you will favor me with your observations    letter xlviii from mrs b to lady davers my dear lady davers i have a valuable present made me by the same excellent lady so hope you will not take it amiss that with abundance of thanks i return yours by mrs worden whose sister i much approve of and thank your ladyship for your kind recommendation of so worthy a gentlewoman we begin with so much good liking to one another that i doubt not we shall be very happy together  a moving letter much more valuable to me than the handsome present was put into my hands at the same time with that of which the following is a copy  letter from mrs wrightson formerly miss sally godfrey to mrs b happy deservedly happy dear lady permit these lines to kiss your hands from one who though she is a stranger to your person is not so to your character that has reached us here in this remote part of the world where you have as many admirers as have heard of you but i more particularly am bound to be so by an obligation that i can never discharge but by my daily prayers for you and the blessings i continually implore upon you and yours  i can write my whole mind to you though i cannot from the most deplorable infelicity receive from you the wished for favor of a few lines in return written with the same unreservedness so unhappy am i from the effects of an inconsideration and weakness on one hand and temptations on the other which you at a tenderer age most nobly for your own honor and that of your sex have escaped whilst i  but let my tears in these blots speak the rest  as my heart bleeds and has constantly bled ever since at the grievous remembrance  but believe me however dear madam that it is shame and sorrow and not pride and impenitence that makes me loath to speak out to so much purity of life and manners my own odious weakness  nevertheless i ought and i will accuse myself by name imagine then illustrious lady truly illustrious for virtues which are infinitely superior to all the advantages of birth and fortune  imagine i say that in this letter you see before you the once guilty and therefore i doubt always guilty but ever penitent sarah godfrey the unhappy though fond and tender mother of the poor infant to whom your generous goodness as i am informed has extended itself in such manner as to make you desirous of taking her under your worthy protection god for ever bless you for it prays an indulgent mother who admires at an awful distance that virtue in you which she could not practice herself  and will you my dearest lady will you take under your own immediate protection the poor unguilty infant will you love her for the sake of her suffering mamma whom you know not for the sake of the gentleman now so dear to you and so worthy of you as i hear with pleasure he is and will you by the best example in the world give me a moral assurance that she will never sink into the fault the weakness the crime i ought not to scruple to call it so of her poor inconsiderate  but you are her mamma now i will not think of a guilty one therefore and what a joy is it to me in the midst of my heavy reflections on my past misconduct that my beloved sally can boast a virtuous and innocent mamma who has withstood the snares and temptations that have been so fatal  elsewhere  and whose example and instructions next to gods grace will be the strongest fences that can be wished for to her honor  once more i say and on my knees i write it god for ever bless you here and augment your joys hereafter for your generous goodness to my poor and till now motherless infant  i hope the dear child by her duty and obligeingness will do all in her little power to make you amends and never give you cause to repent this your unexampled kindness to her and to me she cannot i hope except her mothers crime has had an influence upon her too much like that of an original stain be of a sordid or an ungrateful nature and o my poor sally if you are and if you ever fail in your duty to your new mamma to whose care and authority i transfer my whole right in you remember that you have no more a mamma in me nor can you be entitled to my blessing or to the fruits of my prayers for you which i make now on that only condition your implicit obedience to all your new mammas commands and directions  you may have the curiosity madam to wish to know how i live for no doubt you have heard all my sad sad story  know then that i am as happy as a poor creature can be who has once so deplorably so inexcusably fallen i have a worthy gentleman for my husband who married me as a widow whose only child by my former was the care of her papas friends particularly of good lady davers and her brother  poor unhappy i to be under such a sad necessity to disguise the truth  mr wrightson whose name i am unworthily honored by has several times earnestly entreated me to send for the poor child and to let her be joined as his  killing thought that it cannot be  with two others i have by him  judge my good lady how that very generosity which had i been guiltless would have added to my joys must wound me deeper than even ungenerous or unkind usage from him could do and how heavy that crime must lie upon me which turns my very pleasures to misery and fixes all the joy i can know in repentance for my past misdeeds  how happy are you madam on the contrary you who have nothing of this sort to pall nothing to mingle with your felicities who blessed in an honor untainted and a conscience that cannot reproach you are enabled to enjoy every welldeserved comfort as it offers itself and can improve it too by reflection on your past conduct while mine  alas  like a winter frost nips in the bud every rising satisfaction  my spouse is rich as well as generous and very tender of me  happy if i could think myself as deserving as he thinks me  my principal comfort as i hinted is in my penitence for my past faults and that i have a merciful god for my judge who knows that penitence to be sincere  you may guess madam from what i have said in what light i must appear here and if you would favor me with a line or two in answer to the letter you have now in your hand it will be one of the greatest pleasures i can receive a pleasure next to that which i have received in knowing that the gentleman you love best has had the grace to repent of all his evils has early seen his errors and has thereby i hope freed two persons from being one day mutual accusers of each other for now i please myself to think that the crimes of both may be washed away in the blood of that savior god whom both had so grievously offended  may that good god who has not suffered me to be abandoned entirely to my own shame as i deserved continue to shower down upon you those blessings which a virtue like yours may expect from his mercy may you long be happy in the possession of all you wish and late very late for the good of thousands i wish this may you receive the reward of your piety your generosity and your filial your social and conjugal virtues are the prayers of  your most unworthy admirer and obliged humble servant sarah wrightson mr wrightson begs your acceptance of a small present part of which can have no value but what its excelling qualities for what it is will give it at so great a distance as that dear england which i once left with so much shame and regret but with a laudable purpose however because i would not incur still greater shame and of consequence give cause for still greater regret     to this letter my dear lady davers i have written the following answer which mr b will take care to have conveyed to the good lady  dearest madam i embrace with great pleasure the opportunity you have so kindly given me of writing to a lady whose person though i have not the honor to know yet whose character and noble qualities i truly revere  i am infinitely obliged to you madam for the precious trust you have reposed in me and the right you make over to me of your maternal interest in a child on whom i set my heart the moment i saw her  lady davers whose love and tenderness for miss as well for her mammas sake as your late worthy spouses had from her kind opinion of me consented to grant me this favor and i was by mr bs leave in actual possession of my pretty ward about a week before your kind letter came to my hands  as i had been long very solicitous for this favor judge how welcome your kind concurrence was to me and the rather as had i known that a letter from you was on the way to me i should have apprehended that you had yielded to the entreaties of your worthy spouse and would have insisted upon depriving the surviving friends of her dear papa of the pleasure they all take in the dear miss indeed madam i believe we should one and all have joined to disobey you had that been the case and it is a very great satisfaction to us that we are not under so hard a necessity as the disputing with a tender mamma the enjoyment of her own child would have been  assure yourself dearest worthiest kindest madam of a care and tenderness in me to your dear miss truly maternal and answerable as much as is in my power to the trust you repose in me the little boy that god has given me shall not be more dear to me than my sweet miss shall be and my care by gods grace shall extend to her future as well as her present prospects that she may be worthy of that piety and truly religious excellence which i admire in your character  we all rejoice dear madam in the account you give of your present happiness it was impossible that god almighty should desert a lady so exemplarily deserving and he certainly conducted you in your resolutions to abandon every thing that you loved in england after the loss of your dear spouse because it seems to have been the intention of his providence that you should reward the merit of mr wrightson and meet with your own reward in so doing  miss is very fond of my little billy she is a charming child is easy and genteel in her shape and very pretty she dances finely has a sweet air and is improving every day in music works with her needle and reads admirably for her years and takes a delight in both which gives me no small pleasure but she is not very forward in her penmanship as you will see by what follows the inditing too is her own but in that and the writing miss took a good deal of time on a separate paper  dearest dear mamma your sally is full of joy to have any commands from her honored mamma i promise to follow all your directions indeed and upon my word i will you please me mightily in giving me so dear a new mamma here now i know indeed i have a mamma and i will love and obey her as if she was you your own self indeed i will you must always bless me because i will be always good i hope you will believe me because i am above telling fibs i am my honored mamma on the other side of the water and ever will be as if you was here  your dutiful daughter sally goodwin   miss permit me dear madam to subjoin is a very goodtemperd child easy to be persuaded and i hope loves me dearly and i will endeavor to make her love me better and better for on that love will depend the regard which i hope she will pay to all i shall say and do for her good  repeating my acknowlegements for the kind trust you repose in me and with thanks for the valuable present you have sent me we all here join in respects to worthy mr wrightson and in wishing you madam a continuance and increase of worldly felicity and i particularly beg leave to assure you that i am and ever will be with the highest respect and gratitude though personally unknown dearest madam  the affectionate admirer of your piety and your obliged humble servant p b   your ladyship will see how i was circumscribed and limited otherwise i would have told the good lady what i have mentioned more than once how i admire and honor her for her penitence and that noble resolution which enabled her to do what thousands could not have had the heart to do abandon her country her relations friends baby and all that was dear to her as well as the wicked seducer whom she too well loved and hazard the sea the dangers of pirates and possibly of other wicked attempters of the mischievous sex in a world she knew nothing of among strangers and all to avoid repeating a sin she had been unhappily drawn into and for which the dear good lady still abhors herself  must not such a lady as this dear madam have as much merit as many even of those who having not had her temptations have not fallen this at least one may aver that next to not committing an error is certainly the resolution to retrieve it all that one may to repent of it and studiously to avoid the repetition of it but who besides this excellent mrs wrightson having so fallen and being still so ardently solicited and pursued and flattered perhaps by fond hopes that her spoiler would one day do her all the justice he could  for who can do complete justice to a lady he has robbed of her honor  could resolve as she resolved and act as she acted  miss is a sweet pretty dear but permit me to say has a little of her papas spirit hasty yet generous and acknowleging when she is convinced of her fault a little haughtier and prouder than i wish her to be but in every thing else deserves the character i give of her to her mamma  she is very fond of fine clothes is a little too lively to the servants  told me once when i took notice that softness and mildness of speech became a young lady that they were but servants and she could say no more than pray and i desire and i wish you would be so kind  to her uncle or to me  i told her our servants were not common servants and deserved any civil distinctions and that so long as they were ready to oblige her in every thing by a kind word it would be very wrong to give them imperative ones which could serve for no other end but to convince every one of the haughtiness of ones own temper and looked as if one would question their compliance with ones own will unless we would exact it with an high hand which might cast a slur upon the command we gave as if we thought it was hardly so reasonable as otherwise to obtain their observation of it  besides my dear said i you dont consider that if you speak as haughtily and commandingly to them on common as on extraordinary occasions you weaken your own authority if ever you should be permitted to have any and they will regard you no more in the one case than in the other  she takes great notice of what i say and when her little proud heart is subdued by reasonings she cannot answer she will sit as if she were studying what to say that she may come off as flyingly as she can and as the case requires i let her off easily or i push the little dear to her last refuge and make her quit her post and yield up her spirit captive to reason and discretion two excellent commanders with whom i tell her i must bring her to be intimately acquainted  yet after all till i can be sure that i can inspire her with the love of virtue for its own sake i will rather try to conduct her spirit to proper ends than endeavor totally to subdue it being sensible our passions are given us for excellent ends and may by a proper direction be made subservient to the noblest purposes  i tell her sometimes there is a decent pride in humility and that it is very possible for a young lady to behave with so much true dignity as shall command respect by the turn of her eye sooner than by asperity of speech and that she may depend upon it that the person who is always finding faults frequently causes them and that it is no glory to be better born than servants if she is not better behaved too  besides i tell her humility is a grace that shines in an high condition but cannot equally in a low one because that is already too much humbled perhaps and that though there is a censure lies against being poor and proud yet i would rather forgive pride in a poor body than in a rich for in the rich it is insult and arrogance proceeding from their high condition but in the poor it may be a defensative against dishonesty and may show a natural bravery of mind perhaps if properly directed and manifested on right occasions that the frowns of fortune cannot depress  she says she hears every day things from me that her governess never taught her  that may very well be i tell her because her governess has many young ladies to take care of i but one and that i want to make her wise and prudent betimes that she may be an example to other misses and that governesses and mammas shall say to their misses when will you be like miss goodwin do you ever hear miss goodwin say a naughty word would miss goodwin think you have done so or so  she threw her arms about my neck on one such occasion as this oh said she what a charming mamma have i got i will be in every thing as like you madam as ever i can  and then you will love me and so will my uncle and everybody else  mr b whom nowandthen she says she loves as well as if he were her own papa sees with pleasure how we go on and loves us both if possible better and better but she tells me i must not have any daughter but her and is very jealous on the occasion about which your ladyship so kindly reproaches me  there is a pride you know madam in some of our sex that serves to useful purposes and is a good defense against improper matches and mean actions and this is not wholly to be subdued for that reason for though it is not virtue yet if it can be virtues substitute in high rash and inconsiderate minds it may turn to good account so i will not quite discourage my dear pupil neither till i see what discretion and riper years may add to her distinguishing faculty for as some have no notion of pride separate from imperiousness and arrogance so others know no difference between humility and meanness  there is a golden mean in every thing and if it please god to spare us both i will endeavor to point her passions and such even of those foibles which seem too deeply rooted to be soon eradicated to useful purposes choosing to imitate physicians who in certain chronical illnesses as i have read in lord bacon rather proceed by palliatives than by harsh extirpatives which through the resistance given to them by the constitution may create such ferments in it as may destroy that health it was their intention to establish  but whither am i running  your ladyship i hope will excuse this parading freedom of my pen for though these notions are well enough with regard to miss goodwin they must be very impertinent to a lady who can so much better instruct misss tutoress than that vain tutoress can her pupil and therefore with my humblest respects to my good lord davers and your noble neighbors and to mr h i hasten to conclude myself  your ladyships obliged sister and obedient servant p b your billy madam is a charming dear  i long to have you see him he sends you a kiss upon this paper you will see it stained just here the charmer has cut two teeth and is about more so you will excuse the dear pretty slabbering boy miss goodwin is ready to eat him with love and mr b is fonder and fonder of us all and then your ladyship and my good lord davers love us too o my dear lady what a blessed creature am i  miss begs i will send her duty to her noble uncle and aunt that is her just distinction always when she speaks of you both which is not seldom she asked me pretty dear just now if i think there is such an happy girl in the world as she is i tell her god always blesses good misses and makes them happier and happier    letter xlix my dear lady davers i have three marriages to acquaint you with in one letter in the first place sir w g has sent by the particular desire of my dear friend that he was made one of the happiest gentlemen in england on the   th past and so i have no longer any miss darnford to boast of i have a very good opinion of the gentleman but if he be but half as good an husband as she will make a wife they will be exceedingly happy in one another  mr williamss marriage to a kinswoman of his noble patron as you have heard was in treaty is the next and there is great reason to believe from the character of both that they will likewise do credit to the state  the third is mr adams and polly barlow and i wish them for both their sakes as happy as either of the former they are set out to his living highly pleased with one another and i hope will have reason to continue so to be  as to the first i did not indeed think the affair would have been so soon concluded and miss kept it off so long as i understand that her papa was angry with her and indeed as the gentlemans family circumstances and character were such that there could lie no objection against him i think it would have been wrong to have delayed it  i should have written to your ladyship before but have been favored with mr bs company into kent on a visit to my good mother who was indisposed we tarried there a week and left both my dear parents to my thankful satisfaction in as good health as ever they were in their lives  mrs judy swynford or miss swynford as she refuses not being called nowandthen has been with us for this week past and she expects her brother sir jacob to fetch her away about a week hence  it does not become me to write the least word that may appear disrespectful of any person who has the honor to bear a relation to your ladyship and mr b otherwise i should say that the bs and the s  s are directly the opposites of one another but yet as she says she never saw your ladyship but once you will forgive me to mention a word or two about this lady because she is a character that is in a manner new to me  she is a maiden lady as you know madam and though she will not part with the green leaf from her hand one sees by the greygoose down on her brows and her head that she cannot be less than fiftyfive  but so much pains does she take by powder to have never a dark hair in her head because she has one half of them white that i am sorry to see what is a subject for reverence should be deemed by the good lady matter of concealment  she is often in conversation indeed seemingly reproaching herself that she is an old maid and an old woman but it is very discernible that she expects a compliment that she is not so every time she is so free with herself and if nobody makes her one she will say something of that sort in her own behalf  she takes particular care that of all the public transactions which happen to be talked of her memory will never carry her back above thirty years and then it is about thirty years ago when i was a girl or when i was in hangingsleeves and so she makes herself for twenty years of her life a very useless and insignificant person  if her teeth which for her time of life are very good though not overwhite and which by the care she takes of them she seems to look upon as the last remains of her better days would but fail her i imagine it would help her to a conviction that would set her ten years forwarder at least but poor lady she is so young in spite of her wrinkles that i am really concerned for her affectation because it exposes her to the remarks and ridicule of the gentlemen and gives one pain for her  surely these ladies dont act prudently at all since for every year mrs judy would take from her age her censurers add two to it and behind her back make her going on toward seventy whereas if she would lay claim to her reverentials as i may say and not endeavor to conceal her age she would have a great many compliments for looking so well at her time of life and many a young body would hope to be the better for her advice and experience who now are afraid of affronting her if they suppose she has lived much longer in the world than themselves  then she laughs back to the years she owns when more flippant ladies at the laughingtime of life delight to be frolic she tries to sing too although if ever she had a voice she has outlived it and her songs are of so antique a date that they would betray her only as she tells us they were learnt her by her grandmother who was a fine lady at the restoration she will join in a dance and though her limbs move not so pliantly as might be expected of a lady no older than she would be thought to be and whose dancingdays are not entirely over yet that was owing to a fall from her horse some years ago which she doubts she shall never recover so as to be quite well though she finds she grows better and better every year  thus she loses the respect the reverence she might receive were it not for this miserable affectation takes pains by aping youth to make herself unworthy of her years and even less valuably discreet than she would be thought for fear she should be imagined older if she appeared wiser  what a sad thing is this madam  what a mistaken conduct  we pray to live to old age and it is promised as a blessing and as a reward for the performance of certain duties and yet when we come to it we had rather be thought as foolish as youth than to be deemed wise and in possession of it and so we show how little we deserve what we have been so long coveting and yet covet on for what why to be more and more ashamed and more and more unworthy of what we covet  how fantastic a character is this  well may irreverent unthinking youth despise instead of revering the hoary head which the wearer is so much ashamed of  will you forgive me madam the lady boasts a relationship to you and to mr b and i think i am very bold but my reverence for years and the disgust i have to see any body behave unworthy of them makes me take the greater liberty which however i shall wish i had not taken if it meets not with that allowance which i have always had from your ladyship in what i write  god knows whether ever i may enjoy the blessing i so much revere in others for now my heavy time approaches but i was so apprehensive before and so troublesome to my best friends with my vapourish fears that now with a perfect resignation to the divine will i will only add that i am  your ladyships most obliged sister and servant p b my dear billy and miss goodwin improve both of them every day and are all i can desire or expect them to be could misss poor mamma be here with a wish and back again how much would she be delighted with one of our afternoon conferences our sunday employments especially  and let me tell your ladyship that i am very happy in another young gentleman of the deans recommending instead of mr adams    letter l my dearest lady i am once more blessed be god for all his mercies to me enabled to dedicate to you the first fruits of my penmanship on my upsitting to thank you and my noble lord for all your kind solicitudes for my welfare billy every day improves miss is all i wish her to be and my second dear boy continues to be as lovely and as fine a baby as your ladyship was pleased to think him and their papa the best of gentlemen and of husbands  i am glad to hear lady betty is likely to be so happy mr b says her noble admirer is as worthy a gentleman as the peerage boasts and i beg of your ladyship to congratulate the dear lady and her noble parents in my name if i should be at a distance when the nuptials are celebrated  i have had the honor of a visit from my lady the countess dowager on occasion of her leaving the kingdom for one year for which space she designs to reside in italy principally at naples or florence  mr b was abroad when her ladyship came having taken a turn to gloucester the day before and i expected him not till the next day her ladyship sent her gentleman the preceding evening to let me know that business had brought her as far as wooburn and if it would not be unacceptable she would pay her respects to me at breakfast the next morning being speedily to leave england i returned that i should be very proud of that honor and about ten her ladyship came  she was exceedingly fond of my two boys the little man and the pretty baby as she called them and i had very different emotions from the expression of her love to them and her visit to me from what i had once before she was sorry she said mr b was abroad though her business was principally with me for mrs b said she i come to tell you all that passed between mr b and myself that you may not think worse of either of us than we deserve and i could not leave england till i had done myself the pleasure of waiting on you for this purpose  i said i was very sorry i had ever been uneasy when i had two persons of so much honor  nay said she interrupting me you have no need to apologize things looked bad enough as they were represented to you to justify greater uneasiness than you expressed  she asked me who that pretty genteel miss was  i said a relation of lord davers who was entrusted lately to my care then miss said her ladyship and kissed her you are very happy  believing the countess was desirous of being alone with me i said my dear miss goodwin will not you go to your little nursery my love for so she calls my last blessing  you would be sorry the baby should cry for you  for miss was so taken with the charming lady that she was loath to leave us  but on my saying this withdrew  when we were alone the countess began her story with a sweet confusion that added to her loveliness she said she would be brief because she should exact all my attention and not suffer me to interrupt her till she had done  she began with acknowleging that she thought when she saw mr b first at the masquerade that he was the finest gentleman she had ever seen that the allowed freedoms of the place had made her take liberties in following him and engaging him wherever he went she blamed him very freely for passing for a single gentleman for that she said as she had so splendid a fortune of her own was all she was solicitous about having never as she confessed seen a gentleman she could like so well her former marriage having been in some sort forced upon her at an age when she knew not how to distinguish and that she was very loath to believe him married even when she had no reason to doubt it yet this i must say madam said her ladyship i never heard a gentleman when he owned he was married express himself of a lady with more affectionate regard and fondness than he when he spoke of you to me which made me long to see you for i had a great opinion of those personal advantages which every one flattered me with and i was very unwilling to yield the palm of beauty to you  i believe you will censure me mrs b said she for permitting his visits after i knew how happy he was in such a lady  these were her words to be sure that was a thoughtless and a faulty conduct in me  but the worlds saucy censures and my friends indiscreet interposals incensed me and knowing the uprightness of my own heart i was resolved to disregard both when i found they could not think worse of me than they did  i am naturally said she of a haughty spirit impatient of contradiction always gave myself freedoms for which satisfied with my own innocence and honor i thought myself above being accountable to any body  and then mr b has such noble sentiments a courage and fearlessness which i saw on more occasions than one that all ladies who know the weakness of their own sex and how much they want the protection of the brave are taken with then his personal address was so peculiarly distinguishing that having an opinion of his honor i was imbarassd greatly how to deny myself his conversation although you will pardon me mrs b i began to be afraid that my honor might suffer in the worlds opinion for the indulgence  then said she when i had resolved as several times was the case to see him no more some unforeseen accident threw him in my way again at one public entertainment or other for i love balls and concerts and public diversions perhaps better than i ought and i had all my resolves to begin again  yet this said she i can truly say whatever his views were i never heard from his lips the least indecent expression nor saw in his behavior to me aught that might make me very apprehensive saving that i began to fear that by his insinuating address and noble manner i should be too much in his power and too little in my own if i went on so little doubting and so little alarmed if ever he should pull off the mask and avow dishonorable designs  i had often lamented said her ladyship that our sex were prohibited by the designs of the other upon their honor and by the worlds censures from conversing with the same ease and freedom with gentlemen as with one another and when once i asked myself to what this conversation might tend at last and where the pleasure each seemed to take in the others might possibly end i resolved to break it off and told him my resolution next time i saw him but he stopped my mouth with a romantic notion as i since think it though a sorry plea will have weight in favor of a proposal one has no aversion to of platonic love and we had an intercourse by letters to the number of six or eight i believe on that and other subjects  all this time i was the less apprehensive continued her ladyship because he always spoke so tenderly and even with delight whenever he mentioned his lady and i could not find that you were at all alarmed at our acquaintance for i never scrupled to send my letters by my own livery to your house sealed with my own seal  at last indeed he began to tell me that from the sweetest and the evenest temper in the world you seemed to be leaning toward melancholy were always in tears or showed you had been weeping when he came home and that you did not make his return to you so agreeable as he used to find it  i asked if it was not owing to some alteration in his own temper if you might not be uneasy at our acquaintance and at his frequent absence from you and the like he answered no  that you were above disguises were of a noble and frank nature and would have taken some opportunity to hint it to him if you had  this however gave me but little satisfaction and i began to think seriously of the matter and was more and more convinced that my honor required it of me to break off this intimacy  and although i permitted mr b to go with me to tunbridge when i went to take a house there yet i was uneasy as he saw and indeed so was he though he tarried a day or two longer than he designed on account of a little excursion my sister and her lord and he and i made into sussex to see an estate that i had thoughts of purchasing for he was so good as to look into my affairs for me and has put them upon an admirable establishment  his uneasiness he told me was upon your account and he sent you a letter to excuse himself for not waiting on you on saturday and to tell you he would dine with you on monday and i remember when i said mr b you seem to be chagrind at something you are more thoughtful than usual his answer was  madam you are right mrs b and i have had a little misunderstanding she is so solemn and so melancholy of late that i fear it will be too easy a matter to put her out of her right mind and i love her so well that then i should hardly keep my own  is there no reason think you said i continued the countess to imagine that your acquaintance and mine gives her uneasiness you know mr b how that villain t a gentleman said she whose insolent address i rejected with the contempt it deserved has slandered us how know you but he has found a way to your wifes ear as he has done to my uncles and to all my friends and if so it is best for us both to discontinue a friendship that may be attended with disagreeable consequences  he said he should find it out on his return to you and will you said i ingenuously acquaint me with the issue of your inquiries for added i i never beheld a countenance in so young a lady that seemed to mean more than mrs bs when i saw you in town and notwithstanding her prudence i could see a reserve and thoughtfulness in it that if it was not natural to it must indicate too much  he returned to you madam he wrote to me in a very moving letter the issue of your conference and referred to some papers of yours that he would show me as soon as he could procure them they being out of your own hands and let me know that t was the accuser as i had suspected  in brief madam when you went down into kent he came to me and read some part of your account to lady davers of your informant and information your apprehensions your prudence your affection for him the reason of your melancholy and according to the appearance things bore reason enough you had especially from the letter of thomasine fuller which was one of ts vile forgeries for though we had often for arguments sake talked of polygamy he arguing for it i against it yet had not mr b dared i will say nor was he inclined i verily believe to propose any such thing to me no madam i was not so much abandoned of a sense of honor as to give reason for any one but my impertinent and foolish uncle to impute such a folly to me and he had so behaved to me that i cared not what he thought  then what he read to me here and there as he pleased gave me reason to admire you for your generous opinion of one you had so much seeming cause to be afraid of he told me his apprehensions from your uncommon manner that your mind was in some degree affected and your strange proposal of parting with an husband every one knows you so dearly love and we agreed to forbear seeing each other and all manner of correspondence except the latter for one month by letter till some of my affairs were settled which had been in great disorder and were in his kind management then and i had not one relation whom i cared to trouble with them because of their treatment of me on mr bs account and this i told him should not be neither but through your hands and with your consent  and thus madam said her ladyship have i told you the naked truth of the whole affair  i have seen mr b but once since and that at an horserace in the open field  i respect him greatly you must allow me to say that except in the article of permitting me to believe for some time that he was a single gentleman which is a fault he cannot be excused for and which made me heartily quarrel with him when i first knew it he has always behaved toward me with so much generosity and honor that i could have wished i had been of his sex since he has a lady so much more deserving than myself and never would there have been then had he had the same esteem for me a more perfect friendship  i am now going continued her ladyship to embark for france and shall pass a year in italy and then i shall i hope return as solid as grave as circumspect though not so wise as mrs b  in this manner the countess concluded her narrative and i told her that i was greatly obliged to her ladyship for the honor she did me in this visit and the kind and considerate occasion of it but that mr b had made me entirely happy in every particular and had done her ladyship the justice she so well deserved having taken upon himself the blame of passing as a single gentleman at his first acquaintance with her ladyship  i added that i could hope her ladyship might be prevented by some happy gentleman from leaving a kingdom to which she was so great an ornament as well by her birth her quality and fortune as by her perfections of person and mind  she said she had not been the happiest of her sex in her former marriage although nobody her youth considered thought her a bad wife and her lords goodness to her at his death had demonstrated his own favorable opinion of her by deeds as he had done by words upon all occasions but that she was yet young a little too gay and unsettled and had her head turned toward france and italy for one tour of a year at least having passed some time in those countries which she thought of with pleasure though then but a girl of twelve or thirteen that for this reason and having been on a late occasion still more unsettled looking down with blushes which often overspread her lovely face as she talked she had refused some offers not despisable that indeed lord c  threatened to follow her to italy in hopes of meeting better success there but if he did though she would make no resolutions she believed she should be too much offended with him to give him reason to boast of his journey  she wished to see mr b and to take leave of him but not out of my company she was pleased to say your ladyships consideration for me replied i lays me under high obligation but indeed madam there is no occasion for it from any diffidences i have in yours or mr bs honor and if your ladyship will give me the pleasure of knowing when it will be most acceptable i will beg of mr b to oblige me with his company to return this favor the first visit i make abroad  you are very kind my dear mrs b said she but i think to go to tunbridge for a fortnight when i have disposed of every thing for my imbarkation and so set out from thence and if you should then be both in kent i should be glad to take you at your word  to be sure i said mr b at least would attend her ladyship there if any thing should happen to deprive me of that honor and if it would be agreeable to her ladyship i made no doubt he would with as high a pleasure as i should receive in his doing so attend her ladyship on board and see her safe on the other side  you are a generous lady said the countess  i take great concern to myself for having been the means of giving you a moments uneasiness formerly but i must now endeavor to be circumspect in order to retrieve my character which has been so basely traduced by that presumptuous fellow turner that was her word who hoped i suppose thereby to bring me down to his level  her ladyship would not be prevailed upon to stay dinner and saying she should be at wooburn all the next day took a very kind and tender leave of me wishing me all manner of happiness as i did her  mr b came home in the evening and next morning rode to wooburn to pay his respects to the countess and came back in the evening thus happily and to the satisfaction of all three as i hope ended this perplexing affair  mr b asks me madam how i relish mr lockes treatise of education which he put into my hands some time since as i told your ladyship i answered very well and i thought it an excellent piece in the main  i will tell you said he what you shall do you have not showed me any thing you have written for a good while i would be glad you would fill up your leisuretime as you cannot be without pen and ink with your observations on that treatise that i may know what you can object to it for you say in the main which shows that you do not entirely approve of every part of it  but will not that be presumptuous sir  i admire mr lock replied he and i admire my pamela i have no doubt of his excellencies but i want to know the sentiments of a young mother as well as of a learned gentleman upon the subject of education because i have heard several ladies censure some part of his regimen when i am convinced that the fault lies in their own overgreat fondness for their children  as to myself sir said i who in the early part of my life have not been brought up too tenderly you will hardly meet with any objection to the part which i imagine you have heard most objected to by ladies who have been more indulgently treated in their first stage but there are a few other things that want clearing up to my understanding but which however may be the fault of that  then my dear suppose me at a distance from you cannot you give me your remarks in the same manner as if you were writing to lady davers or miss darnford that was  yes sir depending on your kind favor to me i believe i could  do then returned he and the less restraint you write with the more i shall be pleased with it but i confine you not to time or place we will make our excursions as i once proposed to you and do you write me a letter nowandthen upon the subject for the places and remarkables you will see will be new only to yourself nor will either of those ladies expect from you an itinerary or a particular description of countries which they will find better described by authors who have made it their business to treat upon those subjects by this means you will be usefully employed in your own way which may turn to good account to us both and to the dear children which it may please god to bestow upon us  you dont expect sir any thing regular or digested from me  i dont my dear let your fancy and your judgment be both employed and i require no method for i know in your easy natural way that would be a confinement that would cramp your genius and give what you write a stiff formal air that i might expect in a pedagogue but not in my pamela  well but sir said i although i may write nothing to the purpose yet if lady davers is desirous to give it a reading will you allow me to transmit what i shall write to her hands when you have perused it yourself for your good sister is so indulgent to my scribble that she will expect to be always hearing from me and this way i shall oblige her ladyship while i obey her dear brother  with all my heart he was pleased to say  so my lady i shall nowandthen pay my respects to you in the writing way though i must address myself it seems to my dearest mr b and i hope i shall be received on these my own terms since they are your brothers terms also and at the same time such as will convince you how much i wish to approve myself to the best of my poor ability  your ladyships most obliged sister and humble servant p b  letter li my dearest mr b i have been considering of your commands in relation to mr lockes book and as you are pleased to give me time to acquit myself of the task i shall take the liberty to propose to include in a little book my humble sentiments as i did to lady davers in that i showed you in relation to the plays i had seen and since you confine me not to time or place perhaps i shall be three or four years in completing it because i shall reserve some subjects to my further experience in childrens ways and tempers and in order to benefit myself by those good lessons and instructions which i shall receive from your delightful conversation in that compass of time if god spare us to one another and then it will moreover be more worthy than it can otherwise be of the perusal of the most honored and bestbeloved of all my correspondents much honored and beloved as they all are  i must needs say my dear mr b that this is a subject to which i was always particularly attentive and among the charities your bountiful heart permits me to dispense to the poor and indigent i have had always a watchful eye upon the children of such and endeavored by questions put to them as well as to their parents to inform myself of their little ways and tempers and how nature delights to work in different minds and how it might be pointed to their good according to their respective capacities and i have for this purpose erected with your approbation a little school of seven or eight children among which are four in the earliest stages when they can but just speak and call for what they want or love and i am not a little pleased to observe when i visit them in their schooltime that principles of goodness and virtue may be instilled into their little hearts much earlier than is usually imagined and why should it not be so for may not the child that can tell its wants and make known its inclination be easily made sensible of yours and what you expect from it provided you take a proper method for sometimes signs and tokens and even looks uniformly practiced will do as well as words as we see in such of the young of the brute creation as we are disposed to domesticate and to teach to practice those little tricks of which the aptness or docility of their natures makes them capable  but yet dearest sir i know not enough of the next stage or the maturer life to touch upon that as i wish to do and yet there is a natural connection and progression from the one to the other and i would not be thought a vain creature who believes herself equal to every subject because she is indulged with the good opinions of her friends in a few that are supposed to be within her own capacity for  i humbly conceive that it is no small point of wisdom to know and not to mistake ones own talents and for this reason permit me dear sir to suspend till i am better qualified for it even my own proposal of beginning my little book and in the mean time to touch upon a few places of the admirable author you have put into my hand that seem to me to warrant another way of thinking than that which he prescribes  but dear sir let me premise that all that your dear babies can demand of my attention for some time to come is their health and it has pleased god to bless them with such sound limbs and to all appearance good constitutions that i have very little to do but to pray for them every time i pray for their dear papa and that is hourly and yet not so often as you confer upon me benefits and favors and new obligations even to the prevention of all my wishes were i to sit down to study for what must be the next  as to this point of health mr lock gives these plain and easy to be observed rules  he prescribes first plenty of open air that this is right the infant will inform one who though it cannot speak will make signs to be carried abroad and is never so well pleased as when it is enjoying the open and free air for which reason i conclude that this is one of those natural pointings as one may call it that is implanted in every creature teaching it to choose its good and to avoid its evil  sleep is the next which he injoins to be indulged to its utmost extent an admirable rule as i humbly conceive since sound sleep is one of the greatest nourishers in nature both to the once young and to the twice young if i may so phrase it and i the rather approve this rule to children because it keeps the nurse unimployd who otherwise perhaps would be doing it the greatest mischief by cramming and stuffing its little bowels till they were ready to burst and if i am right what an inconsiderate and foolish as well as pernicious practice is it for a nurse to waken the child from its nourishing sleep for fear it should suffer by hunger and instantly pop the breast into its pretty mouth or provoke it to feed when it has no inclination to either and for want of digestion must have its nutriment turn to repletion and bad humors  excuse me dear sir these lesser particulars mr lock begins with them and surely they may be allowed to a young mamma writing however it be to a gentleman of genius and learning to a papa on a subject that in its lowest beginnings ought not to be unattended to by either i will therefore pursue my excellent author without further apology since you have put his work into my hands  the next thing then which he prescribes is plain diet this speaks for itself for the baby can have no corrupt taste to gratify all is pure as out of the hand of nature and what is not plain and natural must vitiate and offend  then no wine or strong drink equally just and for the same reasons  little or no physic undoubtedly right for the use of physic without necessity or by way of precaution as some call it begets the necessity of physic and the very word supposes distemper or disorder and where there is none would a parent beget one or render its salutary force ineffectual by frequent use when it was wanted  next he forbids too warm and too straight clothing dear sir this is just as i wish it how has my heart ached many and many a time when i have seen poor babies rolled and swathed ten or a dozen times round then blanket upon blanket mantle upon that its little neck pinned down to one posture its head more than it frequently needs triplecrownd like a young pope with covering upon covering its legs and arms as if to prevent that kindly stretching which we rather ought to promote when it is in health and is aiming at growth and enlargement the former bundled up the latter pinned down and how the poor thing lies on the nurses lap a miserable little pinioned captive goggling and staring with its eyes the only organs it has at liberty as if it was supplicating for freedom to its fettered limbs nor has it any comfort at all till with a sigh or two like a dying deer it drops asleep and happy then will it be till the officious nurses care shall awaken it for its undesired food just as if the good woman were resolved to try its constitution and were willing to see how many difficulties it could overcome  then this gentleman advises that the head and feet should be kept cold and the latter often used to cold water and exposed to wet in order to lay the foundation as he says of an healthy and hardy constitution  now sir what a pleasure is it to your girl that her notions and her practice too fall in so exactly with this learned gentlemans advice that excepting one article which is that your billy has not yet been accustomed to be wetshed every other particular has been observed  and dont you see what a charming charming baby he is  nay and so is your little davers for his age  pretty soul  perhaps some were they to see this would not be so ready as i know you will be to excuse me and would be apt to say what nursery impertinencies are these to trouble a man with  but with all their wisdom they would be mistaken for if a child has not good health and are not these rules the moral foundation as i may say of that blessing its animal organs will play but poorly in a weak or crasy case these therefore are necessary rules to be observed for the first two or three years for then the little buds of their minds will begin to open and their watchful mamma will be employed like a skilful gardener in assisting and encouraging the charming flower through its several hopeful stages to perfection when it shall become one of the principal ornaments of that delicate garden your honored family pardon me sir if in the above paragraph i am too figurative i begin to be afraid i am out of my sphere writing to your dear self on these important subjects  but be that as it may i will here put an end to this my first letter on the earliest part of my subject rejoicing in the opportunity you have given me of producing a fresh instance of that duty and affection wherewith i am and shall ever be my dearest mr b  your gratefully happy p b  letter lii i will now my dearest my bestbeloved correspondent of all begin since the tender age of my dear babies will not permit me to have an eye yet to their better part to tell you what are the little matters to which i am not quite so well reconciled in mr lock and this i shall be better enabled to do by my observations upon the temper and natural bent of my dear miss goodwin as well as by those which the visits i make nowandthen to the bigger children of my little school and those at the cottages adjacent have enabled me to form for human nature sir you are not to be told is human nature whether in the highborn or in the low  this excellent author in his fiftysecond section having justly disallowed of slavish and corporal punishments in the education of those we would have to be wise good and ingenious men adds  on the other side to flatter children by rewards of things that are pleasant to them is as carefully to be avoided he that will give his son apples or sugarplums or what else of this kind he is most delighted with to make him learn his book does but authorize his love of pleasure and cockers up that dangerous propensity which he ought by all means to subdue and stifle in him you can never hope to teach him to master it whilst you compound for the check you give his inclination in one place by the satisfaction you propose to it in another to make a good a wise and a virtuous man it is fit he should learn to cross his appetite and deny his inclination to riches finery or pleasing his palate etc  this sir is excellently said but is it not a little too philosophical and abstracted not only for the generality of children but for the age he supposes them to be of if one may guess by the apples and the sugarplums proposed for the rewards of their welldoing would not this sir require in children that memory and reflection which the same author in another place calls the concomitant of prudence and age and not of childhood  it is undoubtedly very right to check an unreasonable appetite and that at its first appearance but if so small and so reasonable an inducement will prevail surely sir it might be complied with a generous mind takes delight to win over others by good usage and mildness rather than by severity and it must be a great pain to such an one to be always inculcating on his children or pupils the doctrine of selfdenial by methods quite grievous to his own nature  what i would then humbly propose is that the encouragements offered to youth should indeed be innocent ones as the gentleman injoins and not such as would lead to luxury either of food or apparel but i humbly think it necessary that rewards proper rewards should be proposed as incentives to laudable actions for is it not by this method that the whole world is influenced and governed does not god himself by rewards and punishments make it our interest as well as our duty to obey him and can we propose to ourselves for the government of our children a better example than that of the almighty  this fine author seems dear sir to think he had been a little of the strictest and liable to some exception i say not this proceeds he     that i would have children kept from the conveniences or pleasures of life that are not injurious to their health or virtue on the contrary i would have their lives made as pleasant and as agreeable to them as may be in a plentiful enjoyment of whatsoever might innocently delight them and yet dear sir he immediately subjoins a very hard and difficult proviso to the indulgence he has just granted  provided says he it be with this caution that they have those enjoyments only as the consequences of the state of esteem and acceptance they are in with their parents and governors  i doubt my dear mr b this is expecting such a distinction and discretion in children as they are seldom capable of in their tender years and requiring such capacities as are not commonly to be met with so that it is not prescribing to the generality as this excellent author intended it is i humbly conceive next to impossible that their tender minds should distinguish beyond facts they covet this or that plaything and have no other motive than being gratified in the possession of what they desire the parent or governor has another motive in obliging the child he takes advantage of its desires and annexes to the indulgence which the child hopes for such or such a task or duty as a condition and shows himself pleased with its compliance with it so the child wins its plaything and receives the praise and commendation so necessary to lead on young minds to laudable pursuits but dear sir shall it not be suffered to enjoy the innocent reward of its compliance unless it can give satisfaction that its greatest delight is not in having the thing coveted but in performing the task or obeying the injunctions imposed upon it as a condition of its being obliged i doubt sir this is a little too strict and not to be expected from children a servant fullgrown would not be able to show one that on condition he complied with such and such terms which it is to be supposed by the offer he would not have complied with but for that inducement that he should have such and such a reward i say he would hardly be able to show one that he preferred the pleasure of performing the requisite conditions to the stipulated reward how then is it to be expected from a child who is less capable of distinguishing  let therefore if sir i may presume to say so innocent rewards be proposed and let us be contented to lead on the ductile minds of children to a love of their duty by obliging them with such we may tell them what we expect in this case but we ought not i humbly conceive to be too rigorous in exacting it for after all the inducement will certainly be the uppermost consideration with the child it is out of nature to suppose it otherwise nor had it been offered to it if the parent himself had not thought so and therefore we can only let the child know his duty in this respect and that he ought to give a preference to that and then rest ourselves contented although we should discern that the reward is the chief incentive if it do but oblige to the performance of it for this from whatever motive inculcated may beget a habit in the child of doing it and then as it improves in years one may hope that reason will take place and enable him from the most solid and durable motives to give a preference to the duty  upon the whole then may i sir venture to say that we should not insist upon it that the child should so nicely distinguish away its little innate passions as if we expected it to be born a philosopher selfdenial is indeed a most excellent doctrine to be inculcated in children and it must be done early too but we must not be too severe in our exacting it for a duty too rigidly insisted upon will make it odious this mr lock himself excellently observes in another place on the head of too great severity which he illustrates by a familiar comparison offensive circumstances says he ordinarily infect innocent things which they are joined with and the very sight of a cup wherein any one uses to take nauseous physic turns his stomach so that nothing will relish well out of it though the cup be never so clean and wellshapd and of the richest materials  permit me dear sir to add that mr lock proceeds to explain himself still more rigorously on the subject of rewards which i quote to show i have not misunderstood him but these enjoyments says he should never be offered or bestowed on children as the rewards of this or that particular performance that they show an aversion to or to which they would not have applied themselves without that temptation if my dear mr b the minds of children can be led on by innocent inducements to the performance of a duty of which they are capable what i have humbly offered is enough i presume to convince one that it may be done but if ever a particular study be proposed to be mastered or a byas to be overcome that is not an indispensable requisite to his future life or morals to which the child shows an aversion i would not methinks have him be too much tempted or compelled to conquer or subdue it especially if it appear to be a natural or rivetted aversion  for sir permit me to observe that the education and studies of children ought as much as possible to be suited to their capacities and inclinations and by this means we may expect to have always useful and often great men in different professions for that genius that will not take to one study may shine in another no less necessary part of science but if innocent the promise of innocent rewards will conquer this aversion as it is called it will then hardly bear that name and let them by all means if i may presume to say so be proposed for their encouragement nevertheless i must repeat that if as the child grows up and is capable of so much reason that from the love of the inducement one can raise his mind to the love of the duty it should be done by all means but my dear mr b i am afraid that that parent or tutor will meet but with little success who in a childs tender years shall refuse to comply with its foibles till he sees it values its duty and the pleasure of obeying its commands beyond the little enjoyment on which its heart is fixed for as i humbly conceive that mind which can be brought to prefer its duty to its appetites will want little of the perfection of the wisest philosophers  besides sir permit me to say that i am afraid this perpetual opposition between the passions of the child and the duty to be enforced especially when he sees how other children are indulged for if this regimen could be observed by any it would be impossible it should become general while the fond and the inconsiderate parents are so large a part of mankind will cow and dispirit a child and will perhaps produce a necessity of making use of severity to subdue him to this temper of selfdenial for if the child refuses the parent must insist and what will be the consequence  must it not introduce a harsher discipline than this gentleman allows of  and which i presume to say did never yet do good to any but to slavish and base spirits if to them a discipline which mr lock everywhere justly condemns  see here dear sir a specimen of the presumption of your girl what will she come to in time you will perhaps say  her next step will be to arraign myself  no no dear sir dont think so for my duty my love and my reverence shall be your guards and defend you from every thing saucy in me but the bold approaches of my gratitude which shall always testify for me how much i am  your obliged and dutiful p b  letter liii my dearest mr b i will continue my subject although i have not had an opportunity to know whether you approve of my notions or not by reason of the excursions you have been pleased to allow me to make in your beloved company to the seaports of this kingdom and to the more noted inland towns of essex kent sussex hampshire and dorsetshire which have given me infinite delight and pleasure and enlarged my notions of the wealth and power of the kingdom in which gods goodness has given you so considerable a stake  my next topic will be upon an home education which mr lock prefers for several weighty reasons to a school one provided such a tutor can be procured as he makes next to an impossibility to procure the gentleman has set forth the inconveniences of both and was himself so discouraged on a review of them that he was ready as he says to throw up his pen my chief cares dear sir on this head are threefold   st the difficulty which as i said mr lock makes almost insuperable to find a tutor qualified   dly the necessity there is according to mr lock of keeping the youth out of the company of the meaner servants who may set him bad examples and next those still greater difficulties which will arise from the examples of his parents if they are not very discreet and circumspect  as to the qualifications of the tutor mr lock supposes that he is to be so learned so discreet so wise in short so perfect a man that i doubt and so does mr lock such an one is hardly possible to be met with for this humble and slavish employment i presume sir to call it so because of the too little regard that is generally paid to these useful men in the families of the great where they are too frequently put upon a foot with the uppermost servants and the rather if they happen to be men of modesty  i would says this gentleman from childrens first beginning to talk have some discreet sober nay wise person about them whose care it should be to fashion them right and to keep them from all ill especially the infection of bad company i think continues he this province requires great sobriety temperance tenderness diligence and discretion qualities hardly to be found united in persons that are to be had for ordinary salaries nor easily to be found anywhere  if this sir be the case does not this excellent author recommend a scheme that is rendered in a manner impracticable from this difficulty  as to these qualities being more rarely to be met with in persons that are to be had for ordinary salaries i cannot help being of opinion although with mr lock i think no expense should be spared if that would do that there is as good a chance of finding such an one among the needy scholars as among those better provided for because the necessities of the former as they became a spur to his own learning and improvement so will they at first setting out in the world quicken his diligence and in hopes of recommending him to a worthier lot make him be glad of embracing an offer of this kind in a family which has interest enough to prefer him  i say not this dear sir to encourage that wretched niggardliness which this gentleman justly censures of those who grudge an handsome consideration to so necessary and painful a labor as that of a tutor which where a deserving man can be met with cannot be too genteelly rewarded nor himself too respectfully treated i only take the liberty to deliver my opinion that an humble condition is as likely as any other to produce a gentleman of these good qualities as well for the reason i have hinted at as for others which might be mentioned to which to name no more the merit of mr williams and mr adams will bear witness  but mr lock proceeds with his difficulties in this particular to form a young gentleman as he should be says he it is fit his governor should be wellbred understand the ways of carriage and measures of civility in all the variety of persons times and places and keep his pupil as far as his age requires constantly to the observation of them this is an art continues he not to be learnt or taught by books nothing can give it but good company and observation joined together  and in another place besides being wellbred the tutor should know the world well the ways the humors the follies the cheats the faults of the age he is fallen into and particularly of the country he lives in these he should be able to show to his pupil as he finds him capable teach him skill in men and their manners pull off the mask which their several callings and pretenses cover them with and make his pupil discern what lies at the bottom under such appearances that he may not as unexperienced young men are apt to do if they are unwarnd take one thing for another judge by the outsides and give himself up to show and the insinuation of a fair carriage or an obliging application teach him to guess at and beware of the designs of men he has to do with neither with too much suspicion nor too much confidence  this dear sir is excellently said it is noble theory and if the tutor is a man void of resentment and caprice and will not be governed by partial considerations in his own judgment of persons and things it will be well but if otherwise he may take advantage of the confidence placed in him to the injury of some worthy person and by degrees monopolize the young gentleman to himself and govern his passions as absolutely as i have heard some first ministers have done those of their prince equally to his own personal disreputation and to the disadvantage of his people but  all this and much more according to mr lock is the duty of a tutor and on the finding out such an one depends his scheme of an home education no wonder then that he himself says when i consider the scruples and cautions i here lay in your way methinks it looks as if i advised you to something which i would have offered at but in effect not done etc permit me dear sir in this place to express my fear that it is hardly possible for any one of talents inferior to those of mr lock himself to come up to the rules he has laid down on this subject and it is to be questioned whether even he with all that vast stock of natural reason and solid sense for which as you tell me sir he was so famous had attained to these perfections at his first setting out into life  now therefore dear sir you cannot imagine how these difficulties perplex me as to my knowing how to judge which is best an home or a school education  for hear what this excellent author so justly observes on the latter among other things no less to the purpose i am sure he who is able to be at the charge of a tutor at home may there give his son a more genteel carriage more manly thoughts and a sense of what is worthy and becoming with a greater proficiency in learning into the bargain and ripen him up sooner into a man than any at school can do not that i blame the schoolmaster in this says he or think it to be laid to his charge the difference is great between two or three pupils in the same house and three or fourscore boys lodged up and down for let the masters industry and skill be never so great it is impossible he should have  0 or  00 scholars under his eye any longer than they are in the school together but then sir if there be such a difficulty as mr lock says to meet with a proper tutor what a perplexing thing is this and what shall one say as to the preference he gives to an home education in which such a tutor is to be supposed necessary  but then according to this gentleman there is another difficulty attending an home education and is what i hinted at before in my second article the necessity there is to keep the youth out of the company of the meaner servants who may set him bad examples for thus he says here is another great inconvenience which children receive from the ill examples which they meet with from the meaner servants they are wholly if possible to be kept from such conversation for the contagion of these ill precedents both in civility and virtue horribly infects children as often as they come within reach of it they frequently learn from unbred or debauched servants such language untowardly tricks and vices as otherwise they would be ignorant of all their lives it is an hard matter wholly to prevent this mischief continues he you will have very good luck if you never have a clownish or vicious servant and if from them your children never get any infection  then sir my next point which i mentioned in the beginning of this letter is a still greater difficulty as it may happen in an home education to wit the example of the parents themselves if they be not very circumspect and discreet  all these difficulties in an home education being put together let me dear sir humbly propose it as a matter for your consideration and determination whether there be not a middle way to be found out in a school education that may remedy some of these inconveniences for suppose sir you cannot as the task is so difficult get a tutor so qualified as mr lock thinks he ought to be for your billy as he grows up suppose there is danger from your meaner servants and suppose we his parents should not be able to lay ourselves under the requisite restraints in order to form his mind by our own examples which i hope by gods grace however will not be the case  cannot some master be found out who shall be so well rewarded for his care of a few young gentlemen as shall make it worth his while to be contented with those few suppose five six seven or eight at most whose morals and breeding he may attend to as well as to their learning the farther this master lives from the young gentlemens friends the better it may be we will hope that he is a man of a mild disposition but strict in his discipline and who shall make it a rule not to give correction for small faults or till every other method has been tried who carries such a just dignity in his manner without the appearance of tyranny that his looks may be of greater force than the words of some and his words than the blows of others and who will rather endeavor to shame than terrify a youth out of his faults then sir suppose such an one was to allot such a portion of time for the more learned studies and before the youth was tired with them suppose such another portion was allotted for the writing and arithmetic parts and then to relieve his mind from both suppose the dancing master should take his part and innocent exercises of mere diversion to fill up the rest at his own choice in which diverted by such a rotation of employments all thus rendered delightful by their successive variety he would hardly wish to pass much time for the dancing of itself will answer both parts that of good breeding and that of exercise and thus different studies at one time may be mastered  moreover the emulation which will be inspired where there are several young gentlemen will be of inconceivable use both to tutor and pupil in lessening the trouble of the one and advancing the learning of the other which cannot be expected where there is but a single young gentleman to take care of  such a master will know it to be his interest as well as his duty to have a watchful eye over the conduct and behavior of his servants his assistants in the different branches of science and education will be persons of approved prudence for whom he will think himself answerable since his own reputation will depend upon their behavior as well as his livelihood the young gentlemen will have young gentlemen for their companions all under the influence of the same precepts and directions and if some chosen period were fixed once a week as a reward for some excellence where at a little desk raised a step or two above the other seats the excelling youth should be set to read under the masters direction a little portion from the best translations of the greek and roman historians and even from the best english authors this might in a very engaging manner initiate them into the knowledge of the history of past times and of their own country and give them a curiosity to pass some of their vacant hours in the same laudable pursuit for dear sir i must still insist that rewards and innocent gratifications as also little honors and distinctions must needs be very attractive to the minds of youth  and dont you think dear sir that the little ride and dairyhouse breakfasting see vol ii p   0 also this vol p     by which miss goodwins governess distinguishes the little ladies who excel in their allotted tasks is a sweet pretty encouragement to their ductile minds  yes it is to be sure  and i have often thought of it with pleasure and have partaken in a manner of the delight that i have supposed their pretty hearts must be filled with on the occasion and why may not such little triumphs be in proportion as incentive to children to master laudable tasks as the roman triumphs of different kinds and their mural and civick crowns all which i have heard you speak of were to their heroes and warriors of old for mr dryden well observes that men are but children of a larger growth our appetites are apt to change as theirs and full as craving too and full as vain   permit me sir to transcribe four or five lines more for the beauty of the thought and yet the soul shut up in her dark room viewing so clear abroad at home sees nothing but like a mole in earth busy and blind works all her folly up and casts it outward to the worlds open view    improving the thought methinks i can see the dear little miss who has in some eminent task borne away the palm making her public entry as i may call it after her dairy breakfast and pretty airing into her governesss courtyard through a row of her schoolfellows drawn out on each side to admire her her governess and assistants receiving her at the porch their little capitol and lifting her out with applauses and encomiums with a thus shall it be done to the miss whom her governess delights to honor i see not my mr b why the dear miss in this case as she moves through her admiring schoolfellows may not have her little heart beat with as much delight be as gloriously elated proportionally as that of the greatest hero in his triumphal car who has returned from exploits perhaps much less laudable  but how i ramble  yet surely sir you dont expect method or connection from your girl the education of our sex will not permit that where it is best we are forced to struggle for knowledge like the poor feeble infant in the month who as i described in my first letter on this subject is pinned and fettered down upon the nurses lap and who if its little arms happen by chance to escape its nurses observation and offer but to expand themselves are immediately taken into custody and pinioned down to their passive behavior so when a poor girl in spite of her narrow education breaks out into notice her genius is immediately tamed by trifling employments lest perhaps she should become the envy of one sex and the equal of the other but you sir act more nobly by your pamela for you throw in her way all the opportunities of improvement that can offer and she has only to regret that she cannot make a better use of them and of consequence render herself more worthy of your generous indulgence  i know not how sir to recover my thread and so must break off with that delight which i always take when i come near the bottom of my letters to your dear self because then i can boast of the honor which i have in being  your ever dutiful p b  letter live well but my dear mr b you will perhaps think from my last rambling letter that i am most inclined to a school education for your billy some years hence if it shall please god to spare him to us but indeed i cannot say that i am i only lay several things together in my usual indigested and roving way to take your opinion upon which as it ought will be always decisive with me and indeed i am so thoroughly convinced by mr lockes reasons where the behavior of servants can be so well answered for as that of yours can be where the example of the parents will be as i hope rather edifying than otherwise that without being swayed as i think by maternal fondness in this case i must needs give a preference to the home education and the little scheme i presumed to form in my last was only as you will be pleased to remember on a supposition that those necessary points could not be so well secured  in my observations on this head i shall take the liberty sir in one or two particulars a little to differ from an author that i admire exceedingly and that is the present design of my writing these letters for i shall hereafter if god spare my life in my little book when you have kindly decided upon the points in which i presume to differ from that gentleman show you sir my great reverence and esteem for him and shall then be able to let you know all my sentiments on this important subject and that more undoubtingly as i shall be more improved by years and your dear conversation especially sir if i have the honor and happiness of a foreign tour with you of which you give me hope so much are you pleased with the delight i take in these improving excursions which you have now favored me with at times through more than half the kingdom  well then sir i will proceed to consider a little more particularly the subject of an home education with an eye to those difficulties which mr lock takes notice of as i have mentioned in my last  as to the first the difficulty of finding a qualified tutor we must not expect so much perfection i doubt as mr lock lays down as necessary what therefore i humbly conceive is best to be done will be to avoid choosing a man of bigoted and narrow principles who yet shall not be tainted with skeptical or heterodox notions who shall not be a mere scholar or pedant who has traveled and yet preserved his moral character untainted and whose behavior and carriage is easy unaffected unformal and genteel as well acquiredly as naturally so if possible who shall not be dogmatical positive overbearing on one hand nor too yielding suppliant fawning on the other who shall study the childs natural bent in order to direct his studies to the point in which he is most likely to excel in order to preserve the respect due to his own character from every one he must not be a busybody in the family a whisperer a talebearer but be a person of a benevolent turn of mind ready to compose differences who shall avoid of all things that foppishness of dress and appearance which distinguishes the petitsmaitres and french ushers that i have seen at some boardingschools for coxcombs rather than guides of education for as i have heard you my best tutor often observe the peculiarities of habit where a person aims at something fantastic or out of character are an undoubted sign of a wrong head for such an one is so kind as always to hang out on his sign what sort of furniture he has in his shop to save you the trouble of asking questions about him so that one may know what he is as much as one can know a widow by her weeds  such a person as i have thus negatively described may be found without very much difficulty perhaps because some of these requisites are personal and others are such as are obvious at first sight to a common penetration or where not so may be found out by inquiry into his general character and behavior and to the care of such an one dear sir let me for the present suppose your billy is committed and so we acquit ourselves of the first difficulty as well as we can that of the tutor who to make himself more perfect may form himself as to what he wants by mr lockes excellent rules on that head  but before i quit this subject will you give me leave sir to remind you of your own opinion upon it in a conversation that passed between you and sir george stuart and his nephew in london in which you seemed to prefer a scottish gentleman for a tutor to those of your own nation and still more than to those of france dont you remember it dear sir and how much those gentlemen were pleased with your facetious freedom with their country and said you made them amends for that in the preference you gave to their learned and traveled youth if you have forgot it i will here transcribe it from my records as i call my book of memorandums for every time i am pleased with a conversation and have leisure before it goes out of my memory i enter it down as near the very words as i can and now you have made me your correspondent i shall sometimes perhaps give you back some valuables from your own treasure  miss darnford and mr turner and mr fanshaw were present i well remember these are your words as i have them written down  since the union of the two kingdoms we have many persons of condition who have taken tutors for their sons from scotland which practice to speak impartially has been attended with some advantageous circumstances that should not be overlooked for sir george it must be confessed that notwithstanding your narrow and stiff manner of education in scotland a spirit of manly learning a kind of poetic liberty as i may call it has begun to exert itself in that part of the island the blustering north forgive me gentlemen seems to have hardened the foreheads of her hungry sons and the keenness with which they set out for preferment in the kindlier south has taught them to know a good deal of the world betimes through the easy terms on which learning is generally attained there as it is earlier inculcated so it may probably take deeper root and since it is hardly possible forgive me dear sir george and mr stuart they can go to a worse country on this side greenland than some of the northern parts of scotland so their education with a view to travel and to better themselves by settlements in other countries may perhaps be so many reasons for them to take greater pains to qualify themselves for this employment and may make them succeed better in it especially when they have been able to shake off the fetters which are rivetted upon them under the narrow influences of a too tyrannical kirkdiscipline which you sir george have just now so freely censured  to these considerations when we add the necessity which these remote tutors lie under of behaving well because in the first place they seldom wish to return to their own country and in the next because that cannot prefer them if it would and thirdly because it would not if it could if the gentleman be of an enlarged genius and generous way of thinking i say when we add to the premises these considerations they all make a kind of security for their good behavior while those of our own country have often friends or acquaintance on whose favor they are apt to depend and for that reason give less attention to the duties requisite for this important office  besides as their kind friend aeolus who is accustomed to spread and strengthen the bold muscles of the strongfeaturd scot has generally blown away that inauspicious bashfulness which hangs a much longer time commonly on the faces of the southern students such an one if he falls not too egregiously into the contrary extreme so as to become insufferable may still be the more eligible person for a tutor as he may teach a young gentleman betimes that necessary presence of mind which those who are confined to a private education sometimes want  but after all if a gentleman of this nation be chosen for this employment it may be necessary that he should be such an one as has had as genteel and free an education himself as his country and opportunities will afford and has had moreover the native roughness of his climate filed off and polished by travel and conversation who has made at least the tour of france and italy and has a taste for the politeness of the former nation for from the natural boisterousness of a north briton and the fantastic politeness of a frenchman if happily blended such a mixture may result as may furnish out a more complete tutor than either of the two nations singly may be able to produce but it ought to be remembered that this person should by all means have conquered his native brogue as i may call it and be a master of the english pronunciation otherwise his conversation will be very disagreeable to an english ear  and permit me gentlemen to add that as an acquaintance with the muses contributes not a little to soften the manners and to give a graceful and delicate turn to the imagination and a kind of polish to severer studies i believe it would not be amiss that he should have a taste of poetry although perhaps it were not to be wished he had such strong inclinations that way as to make that lively and delectable amusement his predominant passion for we see very few poets whose warm imaginations do not run away with their judgments and yet in order to learn the dead languages in their purity it will be necessary as i apprehend to inculcate both the love and the study of the ancient poets which cannot fail of giving a youth a taste for poetry in general  permit me dear sir to ask you whether you advanced this for argumentsake as sometimes you love to amuse and entertain your friends in an uncommon way for i should imagine that our two universities which you have been so good as to show me and for which i have ever since had a greater reverence even than i had before are capable of furnishing as good tutors as any nation in the world for here the young gentlemen seem to me to live both in the world and in the university and we saw several gentlemen who had not only fine parts and polite behavior but deep learning as you assured me some of whom you entertained and were entertained by in so elegant a manner that no traveled gentleman if i may be allowed to judge could excel them and besides my dear mr b i know who is reckoned one of the politest and bestbred gentlemen in england by every body and learned as well as polite and yet had his education in one of those celebrated seats of learning i wish your billy never may fall short of the gentleman i mean in all these acquirements and he will be a dear happy creature i am sure  but how i wander again from my subject i have no other way to recover myself when i thus ramble but by bringing back myself to that one delightful point of reflection that i have the honor to be dear sir  your ever dutiful and obliged p b  letter lv dearest sir i now resume my subject i had gone through the article of the tutor as well as i could and now let me trouble you with a few lines upon what mr lock says that children are wholly if possible to be kept from the conversation of the meaner servants whom he supposes to be as too frequently they are unbred and debauched to use his own words  now sir let me observe on this head that i think it is very difficult to keep children from the conversation of servants at all times the care of personal attendance especially in the childs early age must fall upon servants of one denomination or other who little or much must be conversant with the inferior servants and so be liable to be tainted by their conversation and it will be difficult in this case to prevent the taint being communicated to the child wherefore it will be a surer as well as a more laudable method to insist upon the regular behavior of the whole family than to expect the child and its immediate attendant or tutor should be the only good ones in it  nor is this so difficult a thing to bring about as may be imagined your family dear sir affords an eminent instance of it the good have been confirmed the remiss have been reformed the passionate have been tamed and there is not a family in the kingdom i will venture to say to the honor of every individual of it more uniform more regular and freer from evil and more regardful of what they say and do than yours and i believe sir you will allow that though they were always honest yet they were not always so laudably so exemplarily virtuous as of late which i mention only to show the practicableness of a reformation even where bad habits have taken place  for your pamela sir arrogates not to herself the honor of this change it is owing to the divine grace shining upon hearts naturally good for else an example so easy so plain so simple from so young a mistress who moreover had been exalted from their own station could not have been attended with such happy effects  you see dear sir what a master and mistresss example could do with a poor soul so far gone as mrs jewkes and i dare be confident that if on the hiring of a new servant sobriety of manners and a virtuous conversation were insisted upon and they were told that a general inoffensiveness in words as well as actions was expected from them as indispensable conditions of their service and that a breach of that kind would be no more passed over than a wilful fraud or act of dishonesty and if added to these requisites their principals take care to support these injunctions by their own example i say in this case i dare be confident that if such a service did not find them good it would make them so  and why indeed should we not think this a very practicable scheme when it is considered that the servants we take are at years of discretion and have the strong tie of interest superadded to the obligations we require of them and which they must needs know let em have what bad habits they will are right for themselves to discharge as well as for us to exact  we all know of how much force the example of superiors is to inferiors it is generally and too justly said that the courts of princes abound with the most profligate of men insomuch that you cannot well give a man a more significantly bad title than by calling him a courtier yet even among these one shall see the force of example as i have heard you sir frequently observe for let but the land be blessed with a pious and religious prince who makes it a rule with him to countenance and promote none but men of virtue and probity and to put the case still stronger let such an one even succeed to the most libertine reign wherein the manners of the people have seemed to be wholly depraved yet a wonderful change will be immediately effected the flagitious livers will be chased away or reformed or at least will think it their duty or their interest which is a stronger tie with such to appear reformed and not a man will seek for the favor or countenance of his prince but by laudable pretenses or by worthy actions  there was a time the reign of king richard iii when as i have read deformity of body was the fashion and the nobility and gentry of the court thought it an indispensable requisite of a graceful form to pad for themselves a round shoulder because the king was crooked and can we think human nature so absurdly wicked that it would not much rather have tried to imitate a personal perfection than a deformity so shocking in its appearance in people who were naturally strait  it is a melancholy thing to reflect that of all professions of men the mariners who most behold the wonders of almighty power displayed in the great deep a sight that has struck me with awe and reverence only from a coast prospect and who every moment of their lives while at sea have but one frail plank betwixt themselves and inevitable destruction are yet generally speaking as i have often heard it observed the most abandoned invokers and blasphemers of the name of that god whose mercies they every moment unthankfully although so visibly experience yet as i heard it once remarked at your table sir on a particular occasion we have now living one commander in the british navy who to his honor has shown the force of an excellent example supporting the best precepts for on board of his ship not an oath or curse was to be heard while volleys of both issued from impious mouths in the same squadron out of his knowledge seemed to fill the sails of other ships with guilty breath calling aloud for that perdition to overtake them which perhaps his worthy injunctions might be of weight to suspend  if such then dear sir be the force of a good example what have parents to do who are disposed to bring up a child at home under their own eye according to mr lockes advice but first to have a strict regard to their own conduct this will not want its due influence on the servants especially if a proper care and scrutiny be made into their characters before they are entertained and a watchful eye be had over them to keep them up to those characters afterward and when they know they must forfeit the favor of a worthy master and their places too which may be thought to be the best of places because an uniform character must make all around it easy and happy they will readily observe such rules and directions as shall be prescribed to them  rules and directions which their own consciences will tell them are right to be prescribed and even right for them to follow were they not insisted upon by their superiors and this conviction must go a great way toward their thorough reformation for a person wholly convinced is half reformed and thus the hazard a child will run of being corrupted by conversing with the servants will be removed and all mr lockes other rules be better enforced  i have the boldness sir to make another objection and that is to the distance which mr lock prescribes to be kept between children and servants for may not this be a means to fill the minds of the former with a contempt of those below them and an arrogance that is not warranted by any rank or condition to their inferiors of the same species  i have transcribed sir see p          what mr lock has enjoined in relation to this distance where he says that the children are by all means to be kept wholly from the conversation of the meaner servants  but how much better advice does the same author give for the behavior of children to servants in the following words which i humbly presume to think are not so entirely consistent with the former as might be expected from so admirable an author  another way says he      to instill sentiments of humanity and to keep them lively in young folks will be to accustom them to civility in their language and deportment toward their inferiors and the meaner sort of people particularly servants it is not unusual to observe the children in gentlemens families treat the servants of the house with domineering words names of contempt and an imperious carriage as if they were of another race and species beneath them whether ill example the advantage of fortune or their natural vanity inspire this haughtiness it should be prevented or weeded out and a gentle courteous affable carriage toward the lower ranks of men placed in the room of it no part of their superiority continues this excellent author will be hereby lost but the distinction increased and their authority strengthened when love in inferiors is joined to outward respect and an esteem of the person has a share in their submission and domestics will pay a more ready and cheerful service when they find themselves not spurned because fortune has laid them below the level of others at their masters feet  these dear sir are certainly the sentiments of a generous and enlarged spirit but i hope i shall be forgiven if i observe that the great distance mr lock before injoins to be kept between children and servants is not very consistent with the above cited for if we would prevent this undue contempt of inferiors in the temper of children the best way as i humbly presume to think is not to make it so unpardonable a fault for them especially in their early years to be in their company for can one make the children shun the servants without rendering them odious or contemptible to them and representing them to the child in such disadvantageous lights as must needs make the servants vile in their eyes and themselves lofty and exalted in their own and thereby cause them to treat them with domineeringwords and an imperious carriage as if they were of another race or species beneath them and so as mr lock says nurse up their natural pride into an habitual contempt of those beneath them and then as he adds where will that probably end but in oppression and cruelty  but this matter dear sir as i presume to think will all be happily accommodated and reconciled when the servants good behavior is secured by the example and injunctions of the principals  upon the whole then of what mr lock has enjoined and what i have taken the liberty to suggest on this head it shall be my endeavor in that early part of your dear billys education which your goodness will entrust to me to inculcate betimes in his mind the principles of universal benevolence and kindness to others especially to inferiors  nor dear sir shall i fear that the little dear will be wanting to himself in assuming as he grows up an air of superiority and distance of behavior equal to his condition or that he will descend too low for his station for sir there is a pride and selflove natural to human minds that will seldom be kept so low as to make them humbler than they ought to be  i have observed before now instances of this in some of the families we visit between the young masters or misses and those children of lower degree who have been brought to play with them or divert them on the masters and misses side i have always seen they lead the play and prescribe the laws of it be the diversion what it will while on the other hand their lowerrank playfellows have generally given into their little humors though ever so contrary to their own and the difference of dress and appearance and the notion they have of the more eminent condition of their playfellows parents have begot in them a kind of awe and respect that perhaps more than sufficiently secures the superiority of the one and the subordination of the other  the advantage of this universal benevolence to a young gentleman as he grows up will be as i humbly conceive that it will so diffuse itself over his mind as to influence all his actions and give a grace to every thing he does or says and make him admired and respected from the best and most durable motives and will be of greater advantage to him for his attaining an handsome address and behavior for it will make him conscious that he merits the distinction he will meet with and encourage him still more to merit it than the best rules that can be given him for that purpose  i will therefore teach the little dear courteousness and affability from the properest motives i am able to think of and will instruct him in only one piece of pride that of being above doing a mean or low action i will caution him not to behave in a lordly or insolent manner even to the lowest servants i will tell him as i do my dear miss goodwin that that superiority is the most commendable and will be best maintained that is owing to humanity and kindness and which is grounded on the perfections of the mind rather than on the accidental advantages of fortune and condition that if his conduct be such as it ought to be there will be no occasion to tell a servant that he will be observed and respected that humility as i once told my miss goodwin see p     l     is a charming grace and most conspicuously charming in persons of distinction for that the poor who are humbled by their condition cannot glory in it as the rich may and that it makes the lower ranks of people love and admire the highborn who can so condescend whereas pride in such is meanness and insult as it owes its boast and its being to accidental advantages which at the same time are seldom of his procuring who can be so mean as to be proud that even i would sooner forgive pride in a low degree than in an high for it may be a security in the first against doing a base thing but in the rich it is a base thing itself and an impolitick one too for the more distinction a proud mind grasps at the less it will have and every poor despised person can whisper such an one in the ear when surrounded with and adorned by all his glittering splendors that he was born and must die in the same manner with those whom he despises  thus will the doctrine of benevolence and affability inculcated early in the mind of youth and duly cultivated as he grows up inspire the young gentleman with the requisite conduct to command respect from proper motives and at the same time that it will make the servants observe a decorum toward him it will oblige them to have a guard upon their words and actions in the presence of one whose manner of education and trainingup would be so great a reproach to them if they were grossly faulty so that hereby as i conceive a mutual benefit would flow to the manners of each and his good behavior would render him in some measure an instructive monitor to the whole family  but permit me sir to enlarge on the hint i have already given in relation to the example of the parents in case a preference be given to the home education for if this point cannot be secured i should always imagine it were best to put the child to such a school as i have taken the liberty to mention see p      but yet the subject sir might be spared by me in the present case as i write with a view only to your family though you will remember that while i follow mr lock whose work is public i must be considered as if i was directing myself to the generality of the world for sir i have the pleasure to say that your conduct in your family is unexceptionable and the pride to think that mine is no disgrace to it no one hears a word from your mouth unbecoming the character of a polite gentleman and i shall always endeavor to be very regardful of what falls from mine your temper sir is equal and kind to all your servants and they love you as well as awefully respect you and well does your generosity and bountiful and considerate mind deserve it of them all and they seeing i am watchful over my own conduct so as not to behave unworthy of your kind example regard me as much as i could wish they should for well do they know that their beloved master will have it so and greatly honors and esteems me himself  your tabletalk is such as persons of the strictest principles may hear and join in your guests and your friends are generally speaking persons of the genteelest life and of the best manners  so that mr lock would have advised you of all gentlemen had he been living and known you to give your children an home education and assigned these and still stronger reasons for it  but dear sir were we to speak to the generality it is to be feared this would be an almost insuperable objection to it for i am sorry to say it but when one turns ones eyes to the bad precedents given by the heads of some families it is hardly to be wondered at that there is so little virtue and religion among men for can those parents be surprised at the ungraciousness of their children who hardly ever show them that their own actions are governed by reasonable or moral motives can the gluttonous father expect a selfdenying son with how ill a grace must a man who will often be disguised in liquor preach sobriety a passionate man patience an irreligious man piety how will a parent whose hands are seldom without cards or dice be observed in lessons against the pernicious vice of gaming can the profuse father who is squandering away the fortunes of his children expect to be regarded in a lesson of frugality it is impossible he should except it were that the youth seeing how pernicious his fathers example is should have the grace to make a proper use of it and look upon it as a seamark as it were to enable him to shun the dangerous rocks on which he sees his father splitting and even in this best case let it be considered how much shame and disgrace this thoughtless parent ought to take to himself who can admonish his child by nothing but the odiousness of his own vice and how little it is owing to him that his guilt is not doubled by his sons treading in his steps let such an unhappy parent duly weigh this and think how likely he may be by his bad example to be the cause of his childs perdition as well as his own and stand unshockd and unamended if he can  give me leave to add that it is then of no avail to wish for discreet servants if the conduct of the parents is faulty if the fountainhead be polluted how shall the undercurrents run clear that master or mistress who would exact from their servants a behavior which they themselves dont practice will be but ill observed and that child who discovers great excesses and errors in his parents will be found to be less profited by their good precepts than prejudiced by their bad examples excessive fondness this hour violent passions and perhaps execrations the next unguarded jests an admiration for fashionable vanities rash censures are perhaps the best that the child sees in or hears from those who are most concerned to inculcate good precepts into his mind and where it is so an home education is not by any means surely to be chosen  having sir as well as my slender abilities will permit presumed to deliver my opinion upon three great points viz the qualifications of a tutor the necessity of having an eye to the morals of servants and the example of parents all which being taken care of gives a preference as i imagine to an home education permit me dear sir to offer one more point on this subject to your consideration although i just touched upon it before  it is that of emulation which i humbly conceive to be of great efficacy to lead children on in their duties and studies and how dear sir shall this advantage be procured for a young master who has no schoolfellows and who has no example to follow but that of his tutor whom he cannot from the disparity of years and other circumstances without pain because of this disparity think of emulating and this i conceive is a very great advantage to such a school education as i mentioned in my former letter see p      where there are no more scholars than the master can with ease and pleasure instruct  but one way in my humble opinion is left to answer this objection and still preserve the reason for the preference which mr lock gives to an home education and that is what i formerly hinted to you dear sir see p          to take into your family the child of some honest neighbor of but middling circumstances and like age with your own but who should give apparent indications of his natural promptitude ingenuous temper obliging behavior and good manners and to let him go handinhand with yours in his several studies and lessons under the same tutor  this child would be sensible of the benefit as well as the distinction he received and consequently of what was expected from him and would double his diligence and exert all his good qualities which would inspire the young gentleman with the wished for emulation and as i imagine would be so promotive of his learning that it would even greatly compensate the tutors pains with the additional scholar for the young gentleman would be ashamed to be outdone by one of like years and stature with himself and little rewards might be proposed to the greatest proficient in order to heighten the emulation  then sir permit me to add that the generosity of such a method to a gentleman of your fortune and beneficent mind would be its own reward were there no other benefit to be received by it  moreover such an ingenious youth might by his good morals and industry hereafter be of service in some place of trust in the family and it would be easy for a gentleman of your interest in the world if such a thing offered not to provide for the youth in the navy in some of the public offices or among your private friends  if he proved faulty in his morals his dismission would be in your own power and would be punishment enough  but if on the other hand he proved a sober and hopeful youth such an one would make an excellent companion for your billy in riper years as he would be in a manner a corroborator of his morals for as his circumstances would not support him in any extravagance so those circumstances would be a check upon his inclinations and this being seconded by the hopes of future preferment from your favor and interest which he could not expect but upon the terms of his perseverance in virtue he would find himself under a necessity of setting such an example as might be of great benefit to his companion who should be watched as he grew up that he did not if his ample fortune became dangerous to his virtue contribute of his affluence to draw the other after him into extravagance and to this end as i humbly conceive the noble doctrine of independence should be early instilled into both their minds and upon all occasions inculcated and enforced which would be an inducement for the one to endeavor to improve his fortune by his honest industry lest he should never be enabled to rise out of a state of dependence and to the other to keep if not improve his own lest he should ever fall into such a servile state and thereby lose the glorious power of conferring obligations on the deserving which surely is one of the highest pleasures that a generous mind can know  a pleasure sir which you have oftener experienced than thousands of gentlemen and which may you still continue to experience for a long long and happy succession of years to come is the prayer of one the most obliged of all others in her own person as well as in the persons of her dearest relations and who owes to this glorious beneficence the honor she boasts of being  your ever dutiful and grateful p b  letter lvi but now my dear mr b if you will indulge me in a letter or two more preparative to my little book that i mentioned i will take the liberty to touch upon one or two other places wherein i differ from this learned gentleman but first permit me to observe that if parents are above all things to avoid giving bad examples to their children they will be no less careful to shun the practice of such fond fathers and mothers as are wont to indulge their children in bad habits and give them their head at a time when like wax their tender minds may be molded into what shape they please this is a point that if it please god i will carefully attend to because it is the foundation on which the superstructure of the whole future man is to be erected for according as he is indulged or checked in his childish follies a ground is laid for his future happiness or misery and if once they are suffered to become habitual to him it cannot but be expected that they will grow up with him and that they will hardly ever be eradicated try it says mr lock speaking to this very point in a dog or an horse or any other creature and see whether the ill and resty tricks they have learned when young are easily to be mended when they are knit and yet none of these creatures are half so wilful and proud or half so desirous to be masters of themselves as men  and this brings me dear sir to the head of punishments in which as well as in the article of rewards which i have touched upon i have a little objection to somewhat advanced by mr lock  but permit me sir however to premise that i am exceedingly pleased with the method laid down by this excellent writer rather to shame the child out of his fault than beat him which latter serves generally for nothing but to harden his mind  obstinacy and telling a lie and committing a wilful fault and then persisting in it are i agree with this gentleman the only causes for which the child should be punished with stripes and i admire the reasons he gives against a too rigorous and severe treatment of children  but i will give mr lockes words to which i have some objection  it may be doubted says he concerning whipping when as the last remedy it comes to be necessary at what time and by whom it should be done whether presently upon the committing the fault whilst it is yet fresh and hot  i think it should not be done presently adds he lest passion mingle with it and so though it exceed the just proportion yet it lose of its due weight for even children discern whenever we do things in a passion  i must beg leave dear sir to differ from mr lock in this point for i think it ought rather to be a rule with parents who shall chastize their children to conquer what would be extreme in their own passion on this occasion for those parents who cannot do it are very unfit to be punishers of the wayward passions of their children than to defer the punishment especially if the child knows its fault has reached its parents ear it is otherwise methinks giving the child if of an obstinate disposition so much more time to harden its mind and bid defiance to its punishment  just now dear sir your billy is brought into my presence all smiling crowing to come to me and full of heartchearing promises and the subject i am upon goes to my heart surely surely i can never beat your billy  dear little life of my life how can i think thou can ever deserve it or i can ever inflict it  no my baby that shall be thy papas task if ever thou art so heinously naughty and whatever he does must be right  pardon my foolish fondness dear sir  i will proceed  if then i humbly presume to advise the fault be so atrocious as to deserve whipping and the parent be resolved on this exemplary punishment by no means i should imagine ought the child  poor dear little soul  to come into ones presence without meeting his due reward for else i should think a fondness too natural to be resisted will get the upperhand of ones resentment and how shall one be able to whip the dear creature one cannot be angry with then after he has once seen one without meeting his punishment will he not be inclined to hope for connivance at his fault and may he not be apt for childrens resentments are strong to impute to cruelty a correction that should always appear to be inflicted with reluctance and through motives of love  if from anger at his fault one should go above the due proportion i am sure i might be trusted for this let it take its course  how barbarously methinks i speak  he ought to feel the lash first because he deserves it poor little creature next because it is proposed to be exemplary and lastly because it is not intended to be often used and the very passion or displeasure one expresses if it be not enormous will show one is in earnest and inspire him with a necessary awe and make him be afraid to offend again the end of the correction is to show him the difference betwixt a kind parent and a provoked one and as it is proper to take him at his first offer of a full submission and repentance and not before and instantly dispassionate ones self and show him the difference by acts of pardon and kindness which will let him see that one punishes him out of necessity rather than choice so one would not be afraid to make him smart so sufficiently that he should not soon forget the severity of the discipline nor the disgrace of it there is a cruel mamma for you mr b what my practice may be i cannot tell but this theory i presume to think is right  as to the act itself i much approve mr lockes advice to do it by pauses mingling stripes and expostulations together to shame and terrify the more and the rather as the parent by this slow manner of inflicting the punishment will less need to be afraid of giving too violent a correction for those pauses will afford him as well as the child opportunities for consideration and reflection  but as to the person by whom the discipline should be performed i humbly conceive that this excellent author is here also to be objected to  if you have a discreet servant says he capable of it and has the place of governing your child for if you have a tutor there is no doubt i think it is best the smart should come immediately from anothers hand though by the parents order who should see it done whereby the parents authority will be preserved and the childs aversion for the pain it suffers rather be turned on the person that immediately inflicts it for i would have a father seldom strike the child but upon very urgent necessity and as the last remedy  it is in such an urgent case dear sir that we are supposing it should be done at all if there be not a reason strong enough for the fathers whipping the child himself there cannot be any sufficient for his ordering any other to do it and standing by to see it done but i humbly presume to think that if there be a necessity for it no one can be so fit as the father himself to do it the child cannot dispute his authority to punish from whom he receives and expects all the good things of this life he cannot question his love to him and after the smart is over and his obedience secured must believe that so tender so indulgent a father could have no other end in whipping him but his good against him he knows he has no remedy but must passively submit and when he is convinced he must he will in time conclude that he ought  but to have this severe office performed by a servant though at the fathers command and that professedly that the aversion of the child for the pain it suffers should be turned on the person who immediately inflicts it is i am humbly of opinion the reverse of what ought to be done and more so if this servant has any direction of the childs education and still much more so if it be his tutor notwithstanding mr lock says there is no doubt if there be a tutor that it should be done by him  for dear sir is there no doubt that the tutor should lay himself open to the aversion of the child whose morals he is to direct whose manners he is to form is it not the best method a tutor can take in order to enforce the lessons he would inculcate to endeavor to attract the love and attention of his pupil by the most winning mild and inviting ways that he can possibly think of and yet is he this very tutor out of all doubt to be the instrument of doing an harsh and disgraceful thing and that in the last resort when all other methods are found ineffectual and that too because he ought to incur the childs resentment and aversion rather than the father no surely sir it is not reasonable it should be so quite contrary in my humble notion there can be no doubt that it should be otherwise  it should methinks be enough for a tutor in case of a fault in the child to threaten to complain to his father but yet not to make such complaint without the child obstinately persists in his error which too should be of a nature to merit such an appeal and this methinks would highly contribute to preserve the parents authority who on this occasion should never fail of extorting a promise of amendment or of instantly punishing him with his own hands and to heighten the esteem of the child to his tutor and to reconcile him to him for complaining of him it might not possibly be amiss that his interposition in the childs favor if the fault were not too flagrant should be permitted to save him once or twice from the impending discipline  it is certain that the passions if i may so call them of affection and aversion are very early discoverable in children insomuch that they will even before they can speak afford us marks for the detection of an hypocritical appearance of love to it before the parents faces for the fondness or averseness of the child to some servants as i have observed in other families will at any time let one know whether their love to the baby is uniform and the same when one is absent as present for in one case the child will reject with sullenness all the little sycophancies that are made to it in ones sight while on the other its fondness of one who generally obliges it is an infallible rule to judge of such an ones sincerity behind ones back this little instance shows the strength of a childs resentments and its sagacity at the earliest age in discovering who obliges and who disobliges it and hence one may infer how improper a person he is whom we would have a child to love and respect or by whose precepts we would have it directed to be the punisher of his faults or to do any harsh or disagreeable office to it  for my own part dear sir i must take the liberty to declare that if the parent were not to inflict the punishment himself i think it much better it should be given him in the parents presence by the servant of the lowest consideration in the family and one whose manners and example one would be the least willing of any other he should follow just as the common executioner who is the lowest and most flagitious officer of the commonwealth and who frequently deserves as much as the criminal the punishment he is chosen to inflict is pitched upon to perform as a mark of greater ignominy those sentences which are intended as examples to deter others from the commission of heinous crimes and this was the method the almighty took when he was disposed to correct severely his chosen people for in that case he generally did it by the hands of the most profligate nations around them as we read in many places of the old testament  but the following rule among a thousand others equally excellent i admire in mr lock when says he for any misdemeanour the father or mother looks sour on the child every one else should put on the same coldness to him and nobody give him countenance till forgiveness asked and a reformation of his fault has set him right again and restored him to his former credit if this were constantly observed adds he i guess there would be little need of blows or chiding their own ease or satisfaction would quickly teach children to court commendation and avoid doing that which they found every body condemned and they were sure to suffer for without being chid or beaten this would teach them modesty and shame and they would quickly come to have a natural abhorrence for that which they found made them slighted and neglected by every body  this affords me dear sir a pretty hint for if ever your charming billy should be naughty what would i do but proclaim throughout your worthy family that the little dear was in disgrace and one should shun him another should decline answering him a third should say no master i cannot obey you till your mamma is pleased with you a fourth who should mind what little masters bid them do when little masters will not mind what their mammas say to them and when the dear little soul found this he would come in my way and i see pardon me my dear mr b he has some of his papas spirit already indeed he has and i will direct myself with double kindness to your beloved davers and to my miss goodwin and take no notice at all of the dear creature if i can help it till i see his papa forgive my boldness sir banished from his little sullen brow and all his mamma rise to his eyes and when his musical tongue shall be unlocked to own his fault and promise amendment  o then how shall i clasp him to my bosom and tears of joy i know will meet his tears of penitence  how these flights dear sir please a body  what delights have those mammas which some fashionable ladies are quite unacquainted with who can make their dear babies and their first educations their entertainment and diversion to watch the beamy dawnings of reason in them to direct their little passions as they show themselves to this or that particular point of benefit and use and to prepare the sweet virgin soil of their minds to receive the seeds of virtue and goodness so early that as they grow up one need only now a little pruning and now a little watering to make them the ornaments and delights of the garden of this life and then their pretty ways their fond and grateful endearments some new beauty every day rising to observation  o my dearest mr b whose enjoyments and pleasures are so great as those of such mammas as can bend their minds two or three hours every day to the duties of the nursery  i have a few other things to observe upon mr lockes treatise which when i have done i shall read admire and improve by the rest as my years and experiences advance of which in my proposed little book i shall give you better proofs than i am able to do at present raw crude and indigested as the notions of so young a mamma must needs be but these shall be the subjects of another letter for now i am come to the pride and the pleasure i always have when i subscribe myself dearest sir  your ever dutiful and grateful p b  letter lvii dear sir mr lock gives a great many very pretty instructions relating to the playgames of children but i humbly presume to think what he says in one or two places a little objectionable  he would not indulge them in any playthings but what they make themselves or endeavor to make a smooth pebble a piece of paper the mothers bunch of keys or any thing they cannot hurt themselves with he rightly says serves as much to divert little children as those more chargeable and curious toys from the shops which are presently put out of order and broken  these playthings may certainly do well enough as he observes for little ones but methinks to a person of easy circumstances as the making these toys imploys the industrious poor the buying them for the child might be dispensed with though they were easily broken and especially as they are of all prices and some less costly and more durable than others  tops gigs battledors mr lock observes which are to be used with labor should indeed be procured them  not for variety but exercise but if they had a top the scourgestick and leatherstrap should be left to their own making and fitting  but may i presume to say that whatever be the good mr lock proposes by this it cannot be equal to the mischief children may do themselves in making these playthings for must they not have implements to work with and is not a knife or other edged tool without which it is impossible they can make or shape a scourgestick or any of their playthings a fine instrument in a childs hands this advice is the reverse of the caution warranted from all antiquity that it is dangerous to meddle with edged tools and i am afraid the tutor must often act the surgeon and follow the indulgence with a styptick and a plaster and the young gentlemans hands might be so often bound up that it might indeed perhaps be one way to cure him of his earnest desire to play but i can hardly imagine any other good that it can do him for i doubt the excellent consequences proposed by our author from this doctrine such as to teach the child moderation in his desires application industry thought contrivance and good husbandry qualities that as he observes will be useful to him when he is a man are too remote to be ingrafted upon such beginnings although it must be confessed that as mr lock wisely observes good habits and industry cannot be too early inculcated  but then sir may i ask are not the very play and sports to which children accustom themselves whether they make their own playthings or not equivalent to the work or labor of grown persons yes sir i will venture to say they are and more than equivalent to the exercises and labor of many  mr lock advises that the childs playthings should be as few as possible which i entirely agree with that they should be in his tutors power who is to give him but one at once but as it is the nature of the human mind to court most what is prohibited and to set light by what is in its own power so i am half doubtful only that mr lock says it and the matter may not be so very important as other points in which i have taken the liberty to differ from that gentleman whether the childs absolute possession of his own playthings in some little repository of which he may be permitted to keep the key especially if he make no bad use of the privilege would not make him more indifferent to them while the contrary conduct might possibly inhance his value of them and if when he had done with any plaything he were obliged to put it into its allotted place and was accustomed to keep account of the number and places of them severally this would teach him order and at the same time instruct him to make a proper account of them and to avoid being a squanderer or waster and if he should omit to put them in their places or be careless of his playthings the command of them taken away for a time or threatening to give them away to others would make him be more heedful  mr lock says that he has known a child so distracted with the number and variety of his playgames that he tired his maid every day to look them over and was so accustomed to abundance that he never thought he had enough but was always asking what more what new thing shall i have a good introduction adds he to moderate desires and the ready way to make a contented happy man  all that i shall offer to this is that there are few men so philosophical as one would wish them to be much less children but no doubt that this variety engaged the childs activity which of the two might be turned to better purposes than sloth or indolence and if the maid was tired it might be because she was not so much alive as the child and perhaps the grievance might not be so great because if she was his attendant it is probable she had nothing else to do  however in the main as mr lock says it is no matter how few playthings the child is indulged with but yet i can hardly persuade myself that plenty of them can have such bad consequences as the gentleman apprehends and the rather because they will excite his attention and keep alive his industry and activity his inquiry after new things let him have few or many is to be expected as a branch of those natural desires which are implanted in him and will every day increase but this may be observed that as he grows in years he will be above some playthings and so the number of the old ones will be always reducible perhaps in a greater proportion than the new ones will increase  mr lock observes on the head of good breeding that there are two sorts of ill breeding the one a sheepish bashfulness and the other a misbecoming negligence and disrespect in our carriage both which says he are avoided by duly observing this one rule not to think meanly of ourselves and not to think meanly of others i think as mr lock explains this rule it is an excellent one but on this head i would beg leave to observe that however discommendable a bashful temper is in some instances where it must be deemed a weakness of the mind yet in my humble opinion it is generally the mark of an ingenuous one and is always to be preferred to an undistinguishing and hardy confidence which is as it seems to me the genuine production of unfeeling ignorance  what is faulty in it which mr lock calls sheepishness should indeed be shaken off as soon as possible because it is an enemy to merit in its advancement in the world but were i to choose a companion for your billy as he grows up i should not think the worse of the youth who not having had the opportunities of knowing men or seeing the world had this defect on the contrary i should be apt to look upon it as an outward fence or enclosure as i may say to his virtue which might keep off the lighter attacks of immorality the hussars of vice as i may say who are not able to carry on a formal siege against his morals and i should expect such an one to be docile humane goodhumored diffident of himself and so most likely to improve as well in mind as behavior while an hardened mind that never doubts itself must be a stranger to its own infirmities and suspecting none is impetuous overbearing incorrigible and if rich a tyrant if not possibly an invader of other mens properties  mr lock proposes      a very pretty method to cheat children as it were into learning but then he adds there may be dice and playthings with the letters on them to teach children the alphabet by playing and in another place      i know a person of great quality  who by pasting on the six vowels for in our language y is one on the six sides of a die and the remaining eighteen consonants on the sides of three other dice has made this a play for his children that he shall win who at one cast throws most words on these four dice whereby his eldest son yet in coats has played himself into spelling with great eagerness and without once having been chid for it or forced to it  i must needs say my dear mr b that i should rather your billy should be a twelvemonth backwarder for want of this method than forwarded by it for what may not be apprehended from so early inculcating the use of dice and gaming upon the minds of children let mr lock himself speak for this in his  0  and i should be glad to be able to reconcile the two passages in this excellent author  as to cards and dice says he i think the safest and best way is never to learn any play upon them and so to be incapacitated for these dangerous temptations and incroaching wasters of useful time  and he might have added of the noblest estates and fortunes while sharpers and scoundrels have been listed into distinction upon their ruins yet in     mr lock proceeds to give particular directions in relation to the dice he recommends  but after all if some innocent plays were fixed upon to cheat children into reading that as he says should look as little like a task as possible it must needs be of use for that purpose but let every gentleman who has a fortune to lose and who if he games is on a foot with the vilest company who generally have nothing at all to risque tremble at the thoughts of teaching his son though for the most laudable purposes the early use of dice and gaming  but dear sir permit me to say how much i am charmed with an hint in mr lock which makes your pamela hope she may be of greater use to your children even as they grow up than she could ever have flattered herself to be  it is a charming charming paragraph i must not skip one word of it thus it begins and i will observe upon it as i go along      but under whose care soever a child is put to be taught says mr lock during the tender and flexible years of his life this is certain it should be one who thinks latin and language the least part of education  how agreeable is this to my notions which i durst not have avowed but after so excellent a scholar for i have long had the thought that a deal of precious time is wasted to little purpose in the attaining of latin mr h i think says he was ten years in endeavoring to learn it and as far as i can find knows nothing at all of the matter neither  indeed he lays that to the wicked picture in his grammar which he took for granted as he has said several times as well as once see vol iii p  0  written was put there to teach boys to rob orchards instead of improving their minds in learning or common honesty  but for this is too light an instance for the subject mr lock proceeds  one who knowing how much virtue and a welltempered soul is to be preferred to any sort of learning or language what a noble writer is this makes it his chief business to form the mind of his scholars and give that a right disposition ay there dear sir is the thing which if once got though all the rest should be neglected charmingly observed would in due time without wicked dice i hope produce all the rest and which if it be not got and settled so as to keep out ill and vicious habits languages and sciences and all the other accomplishments of education will be to no purpose but to make the worse or more dangerous man now comes the place i am so much delighted with and indeed whatever stir there is made about getting of latin as the great and difficult business his mother o thank you thank you dear sir for putting this excellent author into my hands may teach it him herself if she will but spend two or three hours in a day with him   if she will never fear dear sir but i will with the highest pleasure in the world and make him read the evangelists in latin to her how i long to be five or six years older as well as my dearest babies that i may enter upon this charming scheme for she need but buy a latin testament and having got somebody to mark the last syllable but one where it is long in words above two syllables which is enough to regulate her pronunciation and accenting the words read daily in the gospels and then let her avoid understanding them in latin if she can why dearest dear sir you have taught me almost all this already and you my best and most beloved tutor have told me often i read and pronounce latin more than tolerably though i dont understand it but this method will teach me as well as your dear children but thus the good gentleman proceeds and when she understands the evangelists in latin let her in the same manner read aesops fables and so proceed on to eutropius justin and such other books i do not mention this adds mr lock as an imagination of what i fansy may do but as of a thing i have known done and the latin tongue got with ease this way  mr lock proceeds to mention other advantages which the child may receive from his mothers instruction which i will endeavor more and more to qualify myself for particularly after he has intimated that at the same time the child is learning french and latin he may be entered also in arithmetic geography chronology history and geometry too for if says he these be taught him in french or latin when he begins once to understand either of these tongues he will get a knowledge in these sciences and the language to boot after he has intimated this i say he proceeds geography i think should be begun with for the learning of the figure of the globe the situation and boundaries of the four parts of the world and that of particular kingdoms and countries being only an exercise of the eyes and memory a child with pleasure will learn and retain them and this is so certain that i now live in an house with a child whom his mother has so well instructed this way in geography but had she not do you think dear sir some of this good gentlemans kind assistance as he lived in the house with the child that he knew the limits of the four parts of the world would readily point being asked to any country upon the globe or any county in the map of england knew all the great rivers promontories streights and bays in the world and could find the longitude and latitude of any place before he was six years old  there is for you dear sir  see what a mother can do if she pleases  i remember sir formerly in that sweet see vol ii p        chariot conference at the dawning of my hopes when all my dangers were over a conference i still think of with pleasure that you asked me how i would bestow my time supposing the neighboring ladies would be above being seen in my company when i should have no visits to receive or return no parties of pleasure to join in no cardtables to employ my winter evenings  i then sir transported with my opening prospects prattled to you how well i would endeavor to pass my time in the family management and accounts in visits nowandthen to the indigent and worthy poor in music sometimes in reading in writing in my superior duties  and i hope i have not behaved quite unworthily of my promises  but i also remember dear sir what now that the fair prospect is no longer distant and that i have been so long your happy thrice happy wife i may speak without those blushes which then covered my face that you said with a modest grace and with that virtuous endearment that is so beautiful in your sex as well as becoming in ours whether in the character of lover or husband maiden or wife and i hope my pamela to have superadded to all these such an employment  as  in short sir i am now blessed with and writing of no less than the useful part i may be able to take in the first education of your lovely babies  and now i must add that this pleasing hope sets me above all other diversions i wish for no parties of pleasure but with you my dearest mr b and these are parties that will improve me and make me more capable of the other and more worthy of your conversation and of the time you pass beyond what i could ever have promised to my utmost wishes in such poor company as mine for no other reason but because i love to be instructed and take my lessons well as you are pleased to say and indeed i must be a sad dunce if i did not from so beloved a master  i want no cardtable amusements for i hope there is a proud hope in a few years to be able to teach my dear littleones the first rudiments as mr lock points the way of latin of french and of geography and arithmetic  o my dear mr b by your help and countenance what may i not be able to teach them and how may i prepare the way for a tutors instructions and give them up minds half cultivated to their hands  and all this time improve myself too not only in science but in nature by tracing in the little babes what all mankind are and have been from infancy to riper years and watching the sweet dawnings of reason and delighting in every bright emanation of that ray of divinity lent to the human mind for great and happy purposes when rightly pointed and directed  there is no going further in this letter after these charming recollections and hopes for they bring me to that grateful remembrance to whom under god i owe them all and also what i have been for so happy a period and what i am which is what will be ever my pride and my glory and well it may when i look back to my beginning which i ever shall with humble acknowlegement and can call myself dearest mr b  your honored and honoring and i hope i may say in time useful wife p b  letter lviii my dearest mr b having in my former letters said as much as is necessary to let you into my notion of the excellent book you put into my hands and having touched those points in which the children of both sexes may be concerned with some art in my intention i own in hopes that they would not be so much out of the way as to make you repent of the honor and pleasure you have done me in committing the dear miss goodwin to my care i shall now very quickly set myself about the little book which i have done myself the honor to mention to you  you have been so good as to tell me at the same time that you have not disapproved these my specimen letters as i may call them that you will kindly accept of my intended present and you encourage me to proceed in it and as i shall leave one side of the leaf blank for your corrections and alterations those corrections will be a fine help and instruction to me in the pleasing task which i propose to myself of assisting in the early education of the dear children which it has pleased god to give you and although i shall be years in writing it perhaps as the dear babies improve and as i improve by the opportunities which their advances in years will give me and the experience i shall gain i shall perhaps venture to give my notions and observations on the more material and nobler parts of education as well as the inferior for but that i think the subjects above my present abilities mr lockes book would lead me into several remarks that might not be unuseful and which appear to me entirely new though that may be owing to my slender reading and opportunities perhaps  but what my dearest mr b i would now touch upon is a word or two still more particularly upon the education of my own sex a topic which naturally rises to me from the subject of my last letter for there dear sir we saw that the mothers might teach the child this part of science and that part of instruction and who i pray as our sex is generally educated shall teach the mothers how in a word shall they come by their knowledge  i know you will be apt to say that miss goodwin gives all the promises of a fine young lady and takes her learning and loves reading and makes very pretty reflections on all she reads and asks very pertinent questions and is as knowing at her years as most young ladies this is very true sir but it is not every one that can boast miss goodwins capacity and goodness of temper which have enabled her to get up a good deal of lost time as i must call it for the first four years in the dear child were a perfect blank as far as i can find just as if the pretty dear was born the day she was four years old for what she had to unlearn as to temper and will and such things set against what little improvements she had made might very fairly be compounded for as a blank  i would indeed have a miss brought up to her needle but i would not have all her time employed in samplers and learning to mark and to do those unnecessary things which she will never probably be called upon to practice  and why pray my dear mr b are not girls entitled to the same first education though not to the same plays and diversions as boys so far at least as it is supposed by mr lock a mother can instruct them  would not this lay a foundation for their future improvement and direct their inclinations to useful subjects such as should make them above the imputations of some unkind gentlemen who allot to their parts common teatable prattle while they do all they can to make them fit for nothing else and then upbraid them for it and would not the men find us better and more suitable companions and assistants to them in every useful purpose of life  o that your lordly sex were all like my dear mr b  i dont mean that they should all take raw uncouth unbred lowly girls as i was from the cottage and destroying all distinction make such their wives i cannot mean this because it is a far greater likelihood that such an one when she comes to be lifted up into so dazzling a sphere would have her head made giddy with her exaltation than that she would balance herself well in it and then to what a blot over all the fair page of a long life would this little drop of dirty ink spread itself what a standing disreputation to the choice of a gentleman  but this i mean that after a gentleman had entered into the marriage state with a young creature saying nothing at all of birth or descent far inferior to him in learning in parts in knowledge of the world and in all the graces that make conversation agreeable and improving he would as you do endeavor to make her fit company for himself as he shall find she is willing to improve and capable of improvement that he would direct her taste point out to her proper subjects for her amusement and instruction travel with her nowandthen a month in a year perhaps and show her the world after he has encouraged her to put herself forward at his own table and at the houses of his friends and has seen that she will not do him great discredit anywhere what obligations and opportunities too will this give her to love and honor such an husband every hour more and more as she will see his wisdom in a thousand instances and experience his indulgence to her in ten thousand for which otherwise no opportunity could have so fitly offered to the praise of his politeness and the honor of them bath  and then when select parties of pleasure or business engaged him not abroad in his home conversation to have him as my dear mr b does delight to instruct and open her prospects and inspire her with an ambition to enlarge her mind and more and more to excel what an intellectual kind of married life as i may call it would such persons find theirs and how suitable to the rules of policy and selflove in the gentleman for is not the wife and are not her improvements all his own absolutely  as i may say his own and does not every excellence she can be adorned by redound to her husbands honor because she is his even more than to her own  in like manner as no dishonor affects a man so much as that which he receives from a bad wife  but where would some say were they to see what i write is such a gentlemen as mr b to be met with look around and see with all the advantages of sex of education of travel of conversation in the open world where a gentleman of his abilities to instruct and inform is to be found and there are others who perhaps will question the capacities and inclinations of our sex in general to improve in useful knowledge were they to meet with such kind indulgers either in the characters of a parent or husband  as to the first i grant that it is not easy to find such a gentleman but for the second would it be excused in me who am one of the sex and so may be thought partial to it i could by comparisons drawn from the gentlemen and ladies within the circle of my own acquaintance produce instances to the advantage of ladies which are so flagrantly in their favor that might make it suspected that it is policy more than justice in those who would keep our sex unacquainted with that more eligible turn of education which gives the gentlemen so many advantages over us in that and which will show that they have none at all in nature or genius  i know you will pardon me dear sir for you are so exalted above your pamela by nature and education too that you cannot apprehend any inconvenience from bold comparisons i will take the liberty therefore to mention a few instances among our friends where the ladies notwithstanding their more cramped and confined education make more than an equal figure with the gentlemen in all the graceful parts of conversation in spite of the contempts poured out upon our sex by some witty gentlemen whose writings i have in my eye  to begin then with mr murray and miss darnford that was mr murray has the reputation of scholarship and has traveled too but how infinitely is he surpassed in every noble and useful quality and in greatness of mind and judgment as well as wit by the young lady i have named this we saw when last at the hall in fifty instances where the gentleman was you know sir on a visit to sir simon and his lady  next dear sir permit me to observe that my good lord davers with all his advantages born a counselor of the realm and educated accordingly does not surpass his lady your noble sister  my countess as i delight to call her and lady betty her eldest daughter greatly surpass the earl and my lord her eldest brother in every point of knowledge and even learning as i may say although both ladies owe that advantage principally to their own cultivation and acquirement  let me presume sir to name mr h and when i have named him shall we be puzzled to find anywhere in our sex one remove from vulgar life a woman that will not outdo mr h  lady darnford upon all useful subjects makes a much brighter figure than sir simon whose knowledge of the world has not yet made him acquainted with himself  mr arthur excels not his lady  mrs towers a maiden lady is an overmatch for half a dozen of the neighboring gentlemen i could name in what is called wit and politeness and not inferior to any of them in judgment  i could multiply instances of this nature were it needful to the confutation of that low and i had almost said unmanly contempt with which a certain celebrated genius treats our sex in general in most of his pieces that i have seen particularly in his letter of advice to a newmarryd lady a letter written in such a manner as must disgust instead of instructing and looks more like the advice of an enemy to the sex and a partial one too than a friend to the particular lady but i ought to beg pardon for this my presumption for two reasons first because of the truly admirable talents of this writer and next because we know not what ladies the ingenious gentleman may have fallen among in his younger days  upon the whole therefore i conclude that mr b the nobleminded mr b is almost the only gentleman who excels every lady i have seen so greatly excels that even the emanations of his excellence irradiate a low cottageborn girl and make her pass among ladies of birth and education for somebody  forgive my pride dear sir but it would be almost a crime in your pamela not to glory in the mild benignity of those rays by which her beloved mr b endeavors to make her look up to his own funny sphere while she by the advantages only of his reflected glory in his absence which makes a dark night to her glides along with her paler and fainter beaminess and makes a distinguishing figure among such lesser planets as can only poorly twinkle and glimmer for want of the aids she boasts of though after all her silvery luster is easily overshadowd by those crossing clouds that make his glory shine the brighter  i dare not dear sir conjecture whence arises this more than parity in the genius of the sexes among the persons i have mentioned notwithstanding the disparity of education and the difference in the opportunities of each it might lead one into too proud a thought in favor of a sex too contemptuously treated by some other wits i might name who indeed are the less to be regarded as they love to jest upon all god almightys works yet might i better do it too than any body since as i have intimated above i am so infinitely transcended by my dear gentleman that no competition pride or vanity could be apprehended from me  but however i would only beg of the gentlemen who are so free in their contempts of us that they will for their own sakes and that with such generally goes a great way rather try to improve than depreciate us we shall then make better daughters better wives better mothers and better mistresses and who permit me sir to ask these people would be so much the better for these opportunities and amendments as our upbraiders themselves  on reperusing what i have written i must repeatedly beg your excuse dear sir for these proud notions in behalf of my sex i can truly say that they are not if i know myself owing to partiality because i have the honor to be one of it but to a better motive by far for what does this contemptuous treatment of one half if not the better half of the human species naturally produce but libertinism and abandoned wickedness for does it not tend to make the daughters the sisters the wives of gentlemen the subjects of profligate attempts  does it not render the sex vile in the eyes of the most vile and when a lady is no longer beheld by such persons with that dignity and reverence with which perhaps the graces of her person and the innocence of her mind should sacredly as it were encompass her do not her very excellencies become so many incentives for base wretches to attempt her virtue and bring about her ruin  what then may not wicked wit have to answer for when its possessors prostitute it to such unmanly purposes and as if they had never had a mother a sister a daughter of their own throw down as much as in them lies those sacred fences which may lay the fair enclosure open to the invasions of every clumsier and viler beast of prey who though destitute of their wit yet corrupted by it shall fill their mouths as well as their hearts with the borrowed mischief and propagate it from one to another to the end of time and who otherwise would have passed by the uninvaded fence and only showed their teeth and snarld at the wellsecured fold within it  you cannot my dearest mr b i know you cannot be angry at this romantic painting since you are not affected by it for when you were at worst you acted more dangerously it is true for the poor innocents a principal part and were as a lion among beasts  do dear sir let me say among this one time  you scorned to borrow any mans wit see vol ii p  0  and if nobody had followed your example till they had had your qualities the number of rakes would have been but small yet dearest sir dont mistake me neither i am not so mean as to bespeak your favor by extenuating your failings if i were you would deservedly despise me for undoubtedly i must say it sir your faults were the greater for your perfections and such talents misapplied as they made you more capable of mischief so did they increase the evil of your practices all then that i mean by saying you are not affected by this painting is that you are not affected by the description i have given of clumsy and sordid rakes whose wit is borrowed and their wickedness only what they may call their own  then dear sir since that noble conversation which you held with me at tunbridge in relation to the consequences that might had it not been for gods grace intervening have followed the masquerade affair i have the pleasure the inexpressible pleasure to find a thorough reformation from the best motives taking place and your joining with me in my closet as opportunity permits in my evening duties is the charming confirmation of your kind and voluntary and i am proud to say your pious assurances so that this makes me fearless of your displeasure while i rather triumph in my joy for your precious souls sake than presume to think of recriminating and when only this one time for all and for ever i take the liberty of looking back from the delightful now to the painful formerly  but what a rambler am i again you command me sir to write to you all i think without fear i obey and as the phrase is do it without either fear or wit  if you are not displeased it is a mark of the true nobleness of your nature and the sincerity of your late pious declarations  if you are i shall be sure i have done wrong in having applied a corrosive to eat away the proud flesh of a wound that is not yet so thoroughly digested as to bear a painful application and requires balsam and a gentler treatment but when we were at bath i remember what you said once of the benefit of retrospection and you charged me when ever a proper opportunity offered to remind you by that one word retrospection of the charming conversation we had there on our return from the rooms  if this be not one of those proper opportunities forgive dearest sir the unseasonableness of your very impertinent but in intention and resolution  ever dutiful p b  letter lix from mrs b to her father and mother ever dear and ever honored i must write this one letter to you although i have had the happiness to see you so lately because mr b is now about to honor me with the tour he so kindly promised to me when with you and it may therefore be several months perhaps before i have again the pleasure of paying you the like dutiful respects  you know his kind promise that he would for every dear baby i present him with take an excursion with me afterward in order to establish and confirm my health  the task i have undertaken of dedicating all my writing amusements to the dearest of gentlemen the full employment i have when at home the frequent rambles he has been so often pleased to indulge me in with my dear miss goodwin to kent to london to bedfordshire to lincolnshire and to my lady daverss take from me the necessity of writing to your honored selves to my miss darnford that was and to lady davers so often as i formerly thought myself obliged to do when i saw all my worthy friends so seldom the same things moreover occurring this year as to our conversations visits friends employments and amusements with little variation that fell out the last as they must do in a family so uniform and methodical as ours  i have for these reasons more leisure to pursue my domestic duties which are increased upon me and when i have said that i am every day more and more happy in my beloved mr b in miss goodwin my billy and my davers and now newly in my sweet little pamela for so you know lady davers would have her called rather than by her own name what can i say more  as to the tour i spoke of you know the first part of mr bs obliging scheme is to carry me to france for he has already traveled with me over the greatest part of england and i am sure by my passage last year to the isle of wight i shall not be afraid of crossing the water from dover thither and he will when we are at paris he says take my further directions that was his kind expression whither to go next  my lord and lady davers are so good as to promise to accompany us to paris provided mr b will give them his and my company to aix la chapelle for a month or six weeks whither my lord is advised to go and mr h if he can get over his fear of crossing the salt water see vol iii p      is to be of the party  lady g miss darnford that was who likewise has lately lain in of a fine daughter and i are to correspond as opportunity offers and she is so good as to promise to send to you what i write as formerly but i have refused to say one word in my letters of the manners customs curiosities etc of the places we see because first i shall not have leisure and next because those things are so much better described in books already printed written by persons who made stricter and better observations than i can pretend to make so that what i shall write will relate only to our private selves and shall be as brief as possible  if we are to do as mr b has it in his thought he intends to be out of england two years  but how can i bear that if for your sakes only and for those of my dear babies  but this must be my time my only time mr b tells me to ramble and see distant places and countries for he is pleased to say that as soon as his littleones are capable of my instructions and begin to understand my looks and signs he will not spare me from them a week together and he is so kind as to propose that my dear bold boy for every one sees how greatly he resembles his papa in his dear forward spirit shall go with us and this pleases miss goodwin highly who is very fond of him and my little davers but vows she will never love so well my little blackeyd pamela  you see what a sweet girl miss is and you admired her much did i tell you what she said to me when first she saw you both with your silver hairs and reverend countenances  madam said she i dare say your papa and mamma honored their father and mother they did my dear but what is your reason for saying so  because replied she they have lived so long in the land which the lord their god has given them i took the dear charmer in my arms and kissed her three or four times as she deserved for was not this very pretty in the child  i must with inexpressible pleasure write you word how happily gods providence has turned for the best that affair which once made me so uneasy in relation to the fine countess who is gone abroad of whom you and my father had heard as you told me some reports which had you known at the time would have made you very apprehensive for mr bs morals as well as for my repose  i will give you the particulars of this dark affair so far as shall make you judges of my present joy  there was but one thing wanting my dear parents to complete all the happiness i wished for in this life and that was the remote hope i had entertained that one day my dear mrb who from a licentious gentleman became a moralist would be so touched by the divine grace as to become in time more than a moral a religious gentleman and that he would at last join in the duties which he had the goodness to countenance  for this reason i began with mere inidispensables i crowded not his gate with objects of charity i visited them at their homes and relieved them distinguishing the worthy indigent made so by unavoidable accidents and casualties from the wilfully or perversely or sottishly such by greater marks of my favor  i confined my morning and evening devotions to my own closet as privately as possible lest i should give offense and discouragement to so gay a temper so unaccustomed poor gentleman to acts of devotion and piety while i met his household together only on mornings and evenings of the sabbath day to prepare them for their public duties in the one and in hopes to confirm them in what they had heard at church in the other leaving them to their own reflections for the rest of the week after i had suggested to them a method i wished to be followed by themselves and in which they constantly obliged me  this good order had its desired effect and our sabbath day assemblies were held with so little parade that we were hardly any of us missed all in short was done with cheerful ease and composure and every one of us was better disposed to our domestic duties by this method i to attend the good pleasure of my best friend and they to attend that of us both  in this manner we went on very happily my neighbourly visits of charity taking up no more time than common airings and passing many of them for such my private duties being only between my first my heavenly benefactor and myself and my family ones personally confined to the day separated for these best of services and mr b pleased with my manner beheld the good effects and countenanced me by his praises and his endearments as acting discreetly as not falling into enthusiasm and as he used to say as not aiming at being righteous overmuch  but still i wanted and i waited for with humble impatience and i made it part of my constant prayers that the divine grace would at last touch his heart and make him more than a countenancer more than an applauder of my duties that he might for his own dear sake become a partaker a partner in them and then thought i when we can hand in hand heart in heart one spirit as well as one flesh join in the same closet in the same prayers and thanksgivings what an happy creature shall i be  i say closet for i durst not aspire so high as to hope he would favor me with his company among his servants in our sunday devotions  i knew it would be going too far in his opinion to expect it from him in me their mistress had i been ever so highborn it was not amiss because i and they every one of us were his i in one degree mr longman in another mrs jervis in another  but from a gentleman of his lordly temper and manner of education i knew i could never hope for it so would not lose every thing by grasping at too much  but in the midst of all these comfortable proceedings and my further charming hopes a nasty masquerade threw into the dear gentlemans way a temptation that for a time blasted all my prospects and indeed made me doubt my own head almost for judge what my disappointment must be when i found all my wishes frustrated all my prayers rendered ineffectual his very morality which i had flattered myself in time i should be an humble instrument to exalt into a religious frame of mind shocked and in danger and all the good work to begin again if offended grace should ever again offer itself to the dear wilful trespasser  but who shall pretend to scrutinize the councils of the almighty  for out of this evil appearance was to proceed the real good i had been so long and so often supplicating for  the dear gentleman was to be on the brink of relapsing it was proper that i should be so very uneasy as to assume a conduct not natural to my temper and to raise his generous concern for me and in the very crisis divine grace interposed made him sensible of his danger made him resolve against his error before it was yet too late and his sliding feet quitting the slippery path he was in collected new strength and he stood the firmer and more secure for his peril  for my dear parents having happily put an end to that affair he was pleased when we were at tunbridge together and in very serious discourse on divine subjects to say to this effect is there not my pamela a text that the unbelieving husband shall be saved by the believing wife while he beholds her chaste conversation coupled with fear  i need not tell you my dear mr b that there is nor where it is  then my dear i begin to hope that will be my case for from a late affair of which this spot of ground puts me more in mind i see so much reason to doubt my own strength which i had built and as i thought securely on moral foundations that i must look out for a better guide to conduct me than the proud word honor can be in the general acceptance of it among us lively young gentlemen  how often my dearest love continued he have i promised and i never promised but i intended to perform that i would be faithfully and only yours how often have i declared that i did not think i could possibly deserve my pamela till i could show her in my own mind a purity as nearly equal to hers as my past conduct would admit of  but i depended too much upon my own strength and i am now convinced that nothing but religious considerations and a resolution to watch over the very first appearances of evil and to check them as they arise can be of sufficient weight to keep steady to his good purposes a young vain mind too little accustomed to restraint and too much used to play upon the brink of dangers from a temerity and love of intrigue too natural to enterprising minds  you shall therefore my pamela from this instant be my guide and only taking care that you do not all at once by too rigorous injunctions damp and discourage the rising flame i will leave it to you to direct it as you please till by degrees it may be deemed worthy to mingle with your own  judge my dear parents how rapturous my joy was upon this occasion and how ready i was to bless god for a danger so narrowly escaped which was attended with the very consequences that i had so long prayed for and which i little thought the divine providence was bringing about by the very means that i apprehended would put an end to all my pleasing hopes and prospects of that nature  it is in vain for me to think of finding words to express what i felt and how i acted on this occasion i heard him out with twenty different and impatient emotions and then threw myself at his feet embracing his knees with arms the most ardently clasping my face lifted up to heaven and to his dear face by turns my eyes overflowing with tears of joy which half choked up the passage of my words  at last his kind arms clasping my neck and kissing my tearful cheek i could only say  my prayers my ardent prayers are at last  at last  heard  may god almighty dear sir confirm your pious purposes  and oh what an happy pamela have you at your feet  i wept for joy till i sobbd again  and he raising me to his kind arms when i could speak i said to have this heavenly prospect o best beloved of my heart added to all my earthly blessings  how shall i contain my joy  for oh to think that my dear mr b is and will be mine and in his through the mercies of god when this transitory life is past and gone to all eternity what a rich thought is this  methinks i am already dear sir ceasing to be mortal and beginning to taste the perfection of those joys which this thrice welcome declaration gives me hope of hereafter  but what shall i say obliged as i was beyond expression before and now doubly obliged in the rapturous view you have opened to me into an happy fururity  he was pleased to say he was delighted with me beyond expression that i was his ecstatick charmer  that the love i showed for his future good was the moving proof of the purity of my heart and my affection for him and that very evening he was pleased to join with me in my retired duties and at all proper opportunities favors me with his company in the same manner listening attentively to all my lessons as he calls my fond cheerful discourses on serious subjects  and now my dear parents do you not rejoice with me in this charming charming appearance for before i had the most generous the most beneficent the most noble the most affectionate but now i am likely to have the most pious of husbands what an happy wife what an happy daughter is his and your pamela  god of his infinite mercy continue and improve the ravishing prospects  i was forced to leave off here to enjoy the charming reflections which this lovely subject and my blessed prospects filled me with and now proceed to write a few lines more  i am under some concern on account of our going to travel into roman catholic countries for fear we should want the public opportunities of divine service for i presume the embassadors chapel will be the only protestant place of worship allowed of and paris the only city in france where there is one but we must endeavor to make it up in our private and domestic duties for as the phrase is when we are at rome we must do as they do at rome that is to say so far as not to give offense on one hand to the people we are among nor scandal on the other by compliances hurtful to ones conscience but my protector knows all these things so well no place in what is called the grand tour being new to him that i have no reason to be very uneasy on these accounts  and now my dearest dear honored parents let me by letter as i did on my knees at parting beg the continuance of your prayers and blessings and that god will preserve us to one another and give us and all our worthy friends a happy meeting again  kent you may be sure will be our first visit on our return for your sakes for my dear daverss sake and for my little pamelas sake who will be both sent down and put into your protection while my billy and miss goodwin for since i began this letter it is so determined are to be my delightful companions for mr b declared his boy shall not be one day out of my presence if he can help it because he is pleased to say his temper wants looking after and his notices of every thing are strong and significant  poor little dear he has indeed a little sort of perverseness and headstrongness as one may say in his will but he is but a baby and i shall i hope manage him pretty well for he takes great notice of all i say and of every look of mine already  he is besides very goodhumored and willing to part with any thing for a kind word and this gives me hope of a docile and benevolent disposition as he grows up  i thought when i began the last paragraph but one that i was within a line of concluding but it is to you and of my babies i am writing so shall go on to the bottom of this new sheet if i do not directly put an end to my scribbling which i do with assuring you both my dear good parents that wherever i am i shall always be thoughtful of you and remember you in my prayers as becomes  your ever dutiful daughter p b my respects to all your good neighbors in general mr longman will visit you nowandthen mrs jervis will take one journey to kent she says and it shall be to accompany my babies when they are carried down to you poor jonathan and she good folks seem declining in their health which much grieves me  once more god send us all an happy meeting if it be his blessed will adieu adieu my dear parents  your ever dutiful etc    letter lx my dear lady g i received your last letter at paris as we were disposing every thing for our return to england after an absence of near two years in which as i have informed you from time to time i have been a great traveller into holland the netherlands through the most considerable provinces of france into italy and in our return to paris again the principal place of our residence through several parts of germany  i told you of the favors and civilities we received at florence from the then countess dowager of  who with her humble servant lord c  that had so assiduously attended her for so many months in italy accompanied us from florence to inspruck  her ladyship made that worthy lord happy in about a month after she parted from us and the noble pair gave us an opportunity at paris in their way to england to return some of the civilities which we received from them in italy and they are now arrived at her ladyships seat on the forest  her lord is exceedingly fond of her as he well may for she is one of the most charming ladies in england and behaves to him with so much prudence and respect that they are as happy in each other as can be wished and let me just add that both in italy and at paris mr bs demeanor and her ladyships to one another was so nobly open and unaffectedly polite as well as highly discreet that neither lord c who had once been jealous of mr b nor the other party who had had a tincture of the same yellow evil as you know because of the countess had so much as a shadow of uneasiness remaining on that occasion  lord davers has had his health which had begun to decline in england so well that there was no persuading lady davers to return before now although i begged and prayed i might not have another little frenchman for fear they should as they grew up forget as i pleasantly used to say the obligations which their parentage lays them under to dearer england  and now my dearest friend i have shut up my rambles for my whole life for three little english folks and one little frenchman but a charming baby as well as the rest charley by name and a near prospect of a further increase you will say are family enough to employ all my cares at home  i have told you from time to time although i could not write to you so often as i would because of our being so constantly in motion what was most worthy of your knowledge relating to our particular and how happy we have all been in one another and i have the pleasure to confirm to you what i have several times written that mr b and my lord and lady davers are all that i could wish and hope for with regard to their first duties indeed indeed we are an happy family united by the best and most solid motives  miss goodwin is a charming young lady  i cannot express how much i love her she is a perfect mistress of the french language and speaks italian very prettily and as to myself i have improved so well under my dear tutors lessons together with the opportunity of conversing with the politest and most learned gentry of different nations that i will hold a conversation with you in two or three languages if you please when i have the happiness to see you there is a learned boaster for you my dear friend if the knowledge of different languages makes one learned but i shall bring you an heart as entirely english as ever for all that  we landed on thursday last at dover and directed our course to the dear farmhouse and you can better imagine than i express what a meeting we had with my dear father and mother and my beloved davers and pamela who are charming babies  but is not this the language of every fond mamma  miss goodwin is highly delighted now with my sweet little pamela and says she shall be her sister indeed for madam said she miss is a beauty  and we see no french beauties like master davers and miss  beauty my dear miss goodwin said i what is beauty if she be not a good girl  beauty is but a specious and as it may happen a dangerous recommendation a mere skindeep perfection and if as she grows up she is not as good as my miss goodwin she shall be none of my girl  what adds to my pleasure my dear friend is to see them both so well got over the smallpox it has been as happy for them as it was for their mamma and her billy that they had it under so skilful and kind a manager in that distemper as my dear mother i wish if it please god it was as happily over with my little pretty frenchman  every body is surprised to see what the past two years have done for miss goodwin and my billy  o my dear friend they are both of them almost  nay quite i think for their years all that i wish them to be  in order to make them keep their french which miss so well speaks and billy so prettily prattles i make them when they talk to one another and are in the nursery speak nothing else but at table except on particular occasions when french may be spoken they are to speak in english that is to say when they do speak for i tell them that little masters must do nothing but ask questions for information and say yes or no till their papas or mammas give them leave to speak nor little ladies neither till they are sixteen for my dear loves cry i you would not speak before you know how and knowledge is obtained by hearing and not by speaking and setting my billy on my lap in misss presence here said i taking an ear in the fingers of each hand are two ears my billy and then pointing to his mouth but one tongue my love so you must be sure to mind that you hear twice as much as you speak even when you grow a bigger master than you are now  you have so many pretty ways to learn one madam says miss nowandthen it is impossible we should not regard what you say to us  several french tutors when we were abroad were recommended to mr b but there is one english gentleman now on his travels with young mr r with whom mr b has agreed and in the mean time my best friend is pleased to compliment me that the children will not suffer for want of a tutor while i can take the pains i do which he will have to be too much for me especially that now on our return my davers and my pamela are added to my cares but what mother can take too much pains to cultivate the minds of her children  if my dear lady g it were not for these frequent lyingsin  but this is the time of life  though little did i think so early i should have so many careful blessings  i have as great credit as pleasure from my little family all our neighbors here in bedfordshire admire us more and more you will excuse my seeming for it is but seeming vanity i hope i know better than to have it real  never says mrs towers who is still a single lady did i see before a lady so much advantaged by her residence in that fantastic nation for she loves not the french and who brought home with her nothing of their affectations  she will have it that the french politeness and the english frankness and plainness of heart appear happily blended in all we say and do and she makes me a thousand compliments upon lord and lady daverss account who she would fain persuade me owe a great deal of improvement my lord in his conversation and my lady in her temper to living in the same house with us  indeed my lady davers is exceeding kind and good to me is always magnifying me to every body and says she knows not how to live from me and that i have been a means of saving half an hundred souls as well as her dear brothers on an indisposition of my lords at montpelier which made her ladyship very apprehensive she declared that were she to be deprived of his lordship she would not let us rest till we had consented to permit her to live with us saying that we had room enough in lincolnshire and she would enlarge the bedfordshire seat at her own expense  mr h is mr h still and that is the best i can say of him for i verily think he is more an ape than ever his whole head is now french twas half so before we had great difficulties with him abroad his aunt and i endeavoring to give him a serious and religious turn we had like to have turned him into a roman catholic for he was pleased much with the shewy part of that religion and the fine pictures and decorations in the churches of italy and having got into company with a dominican at padua a franciscan at milan and a jesuit at paris they lay so hard at him in their turns that we had like to have lost him to each assailant so were forced to let him take his own course for his aunt would have it that he had no other defense from the attacks of persons to make him embrace a faulty religion than to permit him to continue as he was that is to say to have none at all so she suspended attempting to proselyte the thoughtless creature till he came to england i wish her ladyship success here but i doubt he will not be a credit to any religion for a great while and as he is very desirous to go to london as he has always been it will be found when there that any fluttering coxcomb will do more to make him one of that class in an hour than his aunts lessons to make him a good man in a twelvemonth where much is given much is required the contrary of this i doubt is all poor mr h has to trust to  just now we have a messenger to tell us that his father who has been long ill is dead so now he is a lord indeed he flutters and struts about most strangely i warrant and is wholly employed in giving directions relating to his mourning equipage  and now there will be no holding of him in i doubt except his new title has so much virtue in it as to make him a wiser and a better man  he will now have a seat in the house of peers of great britain but i hope for the nations sake he will not meet with many more like himself there  for to me that is one of the most venerable assemblies in the world and it appears the more so since i have been abroad for an english gentleman is respected if he be any thing of a man above a foreign nobleman and an english nobleman above some petty sovereigns  if our traveling gentry duly considered this distinction in their favor they would for the honor of their country as well as for their own credit behave in a better manner in their foreign tours than i am sorry to say it some of them do but what can one expect from the unlickd cubs pardon the term sent abroad with only stature to make them look like men and equipage to attract respect without one other qualification to enforce it  here let me close this with a few tears to the memory of my dear mrs jervis my other mother my friend my adviser my protectress in my single state and my faithful second and partaker in the comforts of my higher life and better fortunes  what would i have given to have been present as it seems she so earnestly wished to close her dying eyes i should have done it with the piety and the concern of a truly affectionate daughter but that melancholy happiness was denied to us both for as i told you in the letter on the occasion the dear good woman who now is in the possession of her blessed reward and is rejoicing in gods mercies was no more when the news reached me so far off as at heidelburgh of her last illness and wishes  i cannot forbear every time i enter her parlour where i used to see with so much delight the good woman sitting always employed in some useful or pious work shedding a tear to her memory and in my sabbath duties missing her i miss half a dozen friends methinks and i sigh in remembrance of her and can only recover that cheerful frame which the performance of those duties always gave me by reflecting that she now is reaping the reward of that sincere piety which used to edify and encourage us all  the servants we brought home with us and those we left behind us met in tears at the name of mrs jervis mr longman lamented too in the most moving strain her loss and all i can do now in honor of her memory and her merit is to be a friend to those she loved most as i have already begun to be and none of them shall suffer in those concerns that can be answered now she is gone for the loss of so excellent a friend and relation is loss enough to all that knew her and claimed kindred with her  poor worthy jonathan too it is almost a misery to have so soft so susceptible an heart as i have or to have such good servants and friends as one cannot lose without such emotions as i feel for their loss his silver hairs which i have beheld with so much delight and thought i had a father in presence when i saw them adorning so honest and comely a face how are they now laid low  forgive me my dear lady g jonathan was not a common servant neither are any of ours so but jonathan excelled all that excelled in his class  i am told that these two worthy folks died within two days of one another a circumstance you mentioned not in your letter to me on which occasion i could not help saying to myself in the words of david over saul and his son jonathan the namesake of our worthy butler they were lovely and pleasant in their lives and in their deaths they were not divided  i might have continued on in the words of the royal lamenter for surely never did one fellow servants love another in my maiden state nor servant love a mistress in my exalted condition better than jonathan loved me i could see in his eyes a glistening pleasure whenever i passed by him if at such times i spoke to him as i seldom failed to do with a god bless you too in answer to his repeated blessings he had a kind of rejuvenescence may i say visibly running through his whole frame and nowandthen if i laid my hand upon his folded ones as i passed him on a sunday morning or evening praying for me with a how do you my worthy old acquaintance his heart would spring to his lips in a kind of rapture and his eyes would run over  o my beloved friend how the loss of these two worthies of my family oppresses me at times  mr b likewise showed a generous concern on the occasion and when all the servants welcomed us in a body on our return methinks my dear said the good gentleman i miss your mrs jervis and honest jonathan a starting tear and they are happy dear honest souls and a sigh were the tribute i paid to their memories on their beloved masters so kindly repeating their names  who knows had i been here  but away too painful reflection they lived to a good old age and fell like fruit fully ripe they died the death of the righteous i must follow them in time god knows how soon and oh that my latter end may be like theirs  once more forgive me my dear friend this small tribute to their memories and believe that i am not so ungrateful for gods mercies as to let the loss of these dear good folks lessen with me the joy and the delight i have still more than any other happy creature left me in the health and the love of the best of good husbands and good men in the children charming as ever mother boasted charming i mean principally in the dawning beauties of their minds and in the pleasure their towardliness of nature gives me including as i always do and have reason to do from her dutiful love as i may call it for me and observation of all i say to her my dear miss goodwin in the preservation to me of the best and worthiest of parents hearty though aged as they are in the love and friendship of good lord and lady davers and my excellent friend lady g god preserve all these to me not forgetting the worthy mr longman as i am truly thankful for his mercies  and then notwithstanding my affecting losses as above who will be so happy as i  that you my dear lady g may long continue so likewise in the love of a worthy husband and the delights of an increasing hopeful family which will make you some amends for the heavy losses you also have sustained in the two last years of an affectionate father and a most worthy mother and in mrs jones of a good neighbor prays  your ever affectionate friend and servant p b  letter lxi my beloved lady g you will excuse my long silence when you are reminded of the occasions to which it has been owing for some of them you know and when you are told the others  in the first place i was obliged to pay a dutiful and concerning visit to kent where my good father was taken ill of a fever and my mother of an ague and think madam how this must affect me from their time of life  o death death thou may knock at the doors of tenements so frail but so beloved we cannot help ourselves but we will not let thee in if we can possibly avoid it for the lives of such dear parents are a part of my own life and if god see fit i cannot spare them indeed i cannot  mr b kindly accompanied me apprehending that his beloved presence would be necessary if that recovery of them both in which i thankfully rejoice had not taken effect especially as a circumstance i am i think always in added more weight to his apprehensions  i had hardly returned from kent to bedfordshire and looked round when i was obliged to set out to attend lady davers who sent me word that she should die that was her strong term if she saw me not to comfort and recover by my counsel and presence so sshe was pleased to express herself her sick lord who was just got out of an intermittent fever which left him without any spirits and was occasioned by fretting at the conduct of her stupid nephew those also were her words  for you must have heard everybody hears when man of quality does a foolish thing and it has been in all the newspapers that  on wednesday last the right honorable john jackey they should have said lord h nephew to the right honorable william lord davers was married to the honorable mrs p relict of j p of twickenham esquire a lady of celebrated beauty and ample fortune  now my dear friend you must know that this celebrated lady is it is true of the  family whence her title of honorable but is indeed so celebrated that every fluttering coxcomb in town can give some account of her even before she was in keeping of the duke of  who had cast her off to the town he had robbed of her  in short my dear she is quite a common woman has no fortune at all as one may say only a small jointure encumbered and is much in debt  she is a shrew into the bargain and the poor wretch is a father already for he has had a girl of three years old her husband has been dead seven brought him home which he knew nothing of nor ever inquired if his widow had a child  and he is now employed in paying the mothers debts and trying to make the best of his bargain  this is the fruit of a london journey so long desired by him and his fluttering about there with his new title  he was drawn in by a brother of his lady and a friend of that brothers two town sharpers gamesters and bullies  poor sir joseph wittol that was his case and his character it seems in london  shall i present you with a curiosity it is a copy of his letter to his uncle who had as you may well think lost all patience with him on occasion of this abominable folly  my lord davers for if you will not call me nephew i have no reason to call you uncle surely you forget who it was you held up your cane to i have as little reason to value your displeasure as you have me for i am god be thanked a lord and a peer of the realm as well as you and as to your not owning me nor your brother b not looking upon me i care not a farthing and bad as you think i have done i have married a woman of family  take that among you  as to your personal abuses of her take care what you say you know the statute will defend us as well as you  and besides she has a brother that will not let her good name be called in question  mind that  some things i wish had been otherwise  perhaps i do  what then  must you my lord make more mischief and add to my plagues if i have any  is this your uncleship  but i shant want your advice i have as good an estate as you have and am as much a lord as yourself why the devil then am i to be treated as i am why the plague  but i will not swear neither  i desire not to see you any more than you do me i can tell you that and if we ever meet under one roof with my liking it must be at the house of peers where i shall be upon a par with you in every thing that is my comfort  as to my lady davers i desire not to see her ladyship for she was always plaguey nimble with her fingers but let my false step be what it will i have in other respects married a lady who is as well descended as herself and no disparagement neither so have not that to answer for to her pride and who has as good a spirit too if they were to come face to face or i am mistaken nor will she take affronts from any one so my lord leave me to make the best of my matters as i will you of yours so no more but that i am   your servant h  p s i mean no affront to mrs b she is the best of ye all  by g      i will not take up your time with further observations upon this poor creatures bad conduct his reflection must proceed from feeling and will that is the worst of it come too late come when or how it will i will only say i am sorry for it on his own account but more for that of lord and lady davers who take the matter very heavily and wish he had married the lowestborn creature in england so she had been honest and virtuous rather than done as he has done  but i suppose the poor gentleman was resolved to shun at all adventures mr bs fault and keep up to the pride of descent and family  and so married the only creature as i hope since it cannot be helped that is so great a disgrace to both for i presume to flatter myself for the sake of my sex that among the poor wretches who are sunk so low as the townwomen are there are very few of birth or education but such principally as have had their necessities or their ignorance taken advantage of by base men since birth and education must needs set the most unhappy of the sex above so sordid and so abandoned a guilt as the hourly wickedness of such a course of life subjects them to  but let me pursue my purpose of excusing my long silence i had hardly returned from lord and lady daverss and recovered my family management and resumed my nursery duties when my fourth dear boy my jemmy  for i think i am going on to make out the number lady davers allotted see this vol p       me pressed upon me in such a manner as not to be refused for one month or six weeks close attention and then a journey to lord daverss and that noble pair accompanying us to kent and daily and hourly pleasures crouding upon us narrow and confined as our room there was though we went with as few attendants as possible took up more of my time so that i hope you will forgive me on all these accounts because as soon as i returned i set about writing this as an excuse for myself in the first place to promise you the subject you insist upon in the next and to tell you that i am incapable of forgetfulness or negligence to such a friend as lady g for i must always be dear madam  your faithful and affectionate humble servant p b  letter lxii my dear lady g the remarks which your cousin fielding tells you i have made on the subject of young gentlemens traveling and which you request me to communicate to you are part of a little book upon education which i wrote for mr bs correction and amendment on occasion of his putting mr lockes treatise on that subject into my hands and requiring my observations upon it  i cannot flatter myself that they will answer your expectation for i am sensible they must be unworthy even of the opportunities i have had in the excursions in which i have been indulged by the best of gentlemen  but your requests are so many laws to me and i will give you a short abstract of what i read to miss fielding who has so greatly overrated it to you  that gentlemans book contains many excellent rules on the subject of education but this of travel i will only refer you to at present you will there see his objections against the age at which young gentlemen are sent abroad from sixteen to twentyone the time in all their lives he says in which young men are the least suited to these improvements and in which they have the least fence and guard against their passions  the age he proposes is from seven to fourteen because of the advantage they will then have to master foreign languages and to form the tongue to their true accents as well as that then they will be easier directed by their tutors or governors or else he proposes that more sedate time of life when the gentleman is able to travel without a tutor and to make his own observations and when he is thoroughly acquainted with the laws and fashions the natural and moral advantages and defects of his own country by which means as mr lock wisely observes the traveller will have something to exchange with those abroad from whose conversation he hopes to reap any knowledge this gentleman supports his opinion by excellent reasons to which i refer you  what i have written in my little book which i have not yet quite finished on this head relates principally to home traveling which mr b was always resolved his sons should undertake before they entered upon a foreign tour i have there observed that england abounds with curiosities both of art and nature worth the notice of a diligent inquirer and equal with some of those we admire in foreign parts and that if the youth be not sent abroad at mr lockes earliest time from seven to fourteen which i can hardly think will be worth while merely for the sake of attaining a perfection in the languages he may with good advantage begin at fourteen or fifteen the tour of great britain nowandthen by excursions in the summer months between his other studies and as a diversion to him  this i should wish might be entered upon in his papas company as well as his tutors if it could conveniently be done who thus initiating both the governed and the governor in the methods he would have observed by both will obtain no small satisfaction and amusement to himself  for the father would by this means be an eyewitness of the behavior of the one and the other and have a specimen how fit the young man was to be trusted or the tutor to be depended upon when they went abroad and were out of his sight as they would of what was expected from them by the father and hence a thousand benefits as i humbly conceive would arise to the young gentleman from the observations and reflections he would receive from his father as occasion offered with regard to expense company conversation hours and suchlike  if the father could not himself accompany his son he might appoint the stages the young gentleman should take and injoin both tutor and son to give at every stage an account of whatever they observed curious and remarkable not omitting the minutest occurrences traveling expenses etc by this means and the probability that he might hear of them and their proceedings from his friends acquaintance and relations who might fall in with them or at whose seats they might sometimes be entertained they would know the inspection they were under and have a greater regard to their conduct  by seeing thus the different customs manners and economy of different persons and families for in so mixed a nation as ours is there is as great a variety of that sort to be met with as in most and from their different treatment at their several stages a great deal of the world may be learned by the young gentleman he would be prepared to go abroad with more delight to himself as well as more experience and greater reputation to his family and country in such excursions as these the tutor would see the temper and inclination of the young gentleman and might give proper notices to the father if any thing was amiss that it might be set right while the youth was yet in his reach and more under his inspection than he would be in a foreign country and the observations the young gentleman would make at his return as well as in his letters would show how fit he was to be trusted and how likely to improve when at a greater distance  after england and wales as well the inland parts as the seacoasts let them if they behave according to expectation take a journey into scotland and ireland and visit the principal islands as guernsey jersey etc the young gentleman continuing to write down his observations all the way and keeping a journal of occurrences and let him employ the little time he will be on board of ship in these small trips from island to island or coastwise in observing upon the noble art of navigation of the theory of which it will not be amiss that he has some notion as well as of the curious structure of a ship its tackle and furniture a knowledge very far from being insignificant to a gentleman who is an islander and has a stake in the greatest maritime kingdom in the world and hence he will be taught to love and value that most useful and brave set of men the british sailors who are the natural defense and glory of the realm  hereby he will confirm his theory of the geography of the british dominions in europe he will be apprisd of the situation conveniences interests and constitution of his own country and will be able to lay a groundwork for the future government of his thoughts and actions if the interest he bears in his native country should call him to the public service in either house of parliament  with this foundation how excellently would he be qualified to go abroad and how properly then would he add to the knowledge he had attained of his own country that of the different customs manners and forms of government of others how would he be able to form comparisons and to make all his inquiries appear pertinent and manly all the occasions of that ignorant wonder which renders a novice the jest of all about him would be taken away he would be able to ask questions and to judge without leadingstrings nor would he think he has seen a country and answered the ends of his fathers expense and his own improvement by running through a kingdom and knowing nothing of it but the inns and stages at which he stopped to eat and drink for on the contrary he would make the best acquaintance and contract worthy friendships with such as would court and reverence him as one of the rising geniuss of his country  whereas most of the young gentlemen who are sent abroad raw and unprepared as if to wonder at every thing they see and to be laughed at by all that see them do but expose themselves and their country and if at their return by interest of friends by alliances or marriages they shall happen to be promoted to places of honor or profit their unmerited preferment will only serve to make those foreigners who were eyewitnesses of their weakness and follies when among them conclude greatly in disfavour of the whole nation or at least of the prince and his administration who could find no fitter subjects to distinguish  this my dear friend is a brief extract from my observations on the head of qualifying young gentlemen to travel with honor and improvement i doubt you will be apt to think me not a little out of my element but since you would have it i claim the allowances of a friend to which my ready compliance with your commands the rather intitles me  i am very sorry mr and mrs murray are so unhappy in each other were he a generous man the heavy loss the poor lady has sustained as well as her sister my beloved friend in so excellent a mother and so kind a father would make him bear with her infirmities a little  but really i have seen on twenty occasions that notwithstanding all the fine things gentlemen say to ladies before marriage if the latter do not improve upon their husbands hands their imputed graces when single will not protect them from indifference and probably from worse while the gentleman perhaps thinks he only of the two is entitled to go backward in acts of kindness and complaisance a strange and a shocking difference which too many ladies experience who from fond lovers prostrate at their feet find surly husbands trampling upon their necks  you my dear friend were happy in your days of courtship and are no less so in your state of wedlock and may you continue to be so to a good old age prays  your affectionate and faithful friend p b  letter lxiii my dear lady g i will cheerfully cause to be transcribed for you the conversation you desire between myself mrs towers and mrs arthur and the three young ladies their relations in presence of the dean and his daughter and mrs brooks and glad i shall be if it may be of use to the two thoughtless misses your neighbors who you are pleased to tell me are great admirers of my story and my example and will therefore as you say pay greater attention to what i write than to the more passionate and interested lessons of their mamma  i am only forty that you should have been under any concern about the supposed trouble you give me by having mislaid my former relation of it for besides obliging my dear lady g the hope that i may be able to do service by it to a family so worthy in a case so nearly affecting its honor as to make two headstrong young ladies recollect what belongs to their sex and their characters and what their filial duties require of them affords me high pleasure and if it shall be attended with the wished effects it will be an addition to my happiness  i said cause to be transcribed because i hope to answer a double end by it for after i had reconsiderd i set miss goodwin to transcribe it who writes a very pretty hand and is not a little fond of the task and indeed of any task i set her and will be more affected as she performs it than she could be by reading it only although she is a very good girl at present and gives me hopes that she will continue to be so  as soon as it is done i will enclose it that it may be read to the parties without this introduction if you think fit and you will forgive me for having added a few observations to this transcription with a view to the cases of your inconsiderate young ladies and for having corrected the former narrative in several places  my dear lady g the papers you have mislaid relating to the conversation between me and the young ladies relations of lady towers and lady arthur in presence of these two lastnamd ladies mrs brooks and the worthy dean and miss l of which in order to perfect your kind collection of my communications you request another copy contained as follows  i first began with apprising you that i had seen these three ladies twice or thrice before as visitors at their kinswomens houses so that they and i were not altogether strangers to one another and my two neighbors acquainted me with their respective tastes and dispositions and gave me their histories preparative to this visit to the following effect  that miss stapylton is overrun with the love of poetry and romance and delights much in flowery language and metaphorical flourishes is about eighteen wants not either sense or politeness and has read herself into a vein that is more amorous that was lady towerss word than discreet has extraordinary notions of a firstsight love and gives herself greater liberties with a pair of fine eyes in hopes to make sudden conquests in pursuance of that notion than is pretty in her sex and age which makes those who know her not conclude her bold and forward and is more than suspected with a mind thus prepared for instantaneous impressions to have experienced the argument to her own disadvantage and to be struck before she has stricken by a gentleman whom her friends think not at all worthy of her and to whom she was making some indiscreet advances under the name of philoclea to philoxenus in a letter which she entrusted to a servant of the family who discovering her design prevented her indiscretion for that time  that in other respects she has no mean accomplishments will have a fine fortune is genteel in her person though with some visible affectation dances well sings well and plays prettily on several instruments is fond of reading but affects the action and air and attitude of a tragedian and is too apt to give an emphasis in the wrong place in order to make an author mean more significantly than it is necessary he should even where the occasion is common and in a mere historical fact that requires as much simplicity in the readers accent as in the writers style no wonder then that when she reads a play she will put herself into a sweat as lady towers says distorting very agreeable features and making a multitude of wry mouths with one very pretty one in order to convince her hearers what a near neighbor her heart is to her lips  miss cope is a young lady of nineteen lovely in her person with a handsome fortune in possession and great prospects has a soft and gentle turn of mind which disposes her to be easily imposed upon is addressed by a libertine of quality whose courtship while permitted was imperiousness and tenderness insult having found the young lady too susceptible of impression open and unreservd and even valuing him the more as it seemed for treating her with ungenerous contempt for that she was always making excuses for slights illmanners and even rudeness which no other young lady would forgive  that this facility on her side and this insolence on his and an overfree and even indecent degree of ramping as it is called with miss which once her mamma surprised them in made her papa forbid his visits and her receiving them  that this however was so much to misss regret that she was detected in a design to elope to him out of the private gardendoor where in all probability the indelicate and dishonorable peer would have triumphed over her innocence having given out since that he intended to revenge himself on the daughter for the disgrace he had received from the parents  that though she was convinced of this twas feared she still loved him and would throw herself in his way the first convenient opportunity urging that his rash expressions were the effect only of his passion for that she knows he loves her too well to be dishonorable to her and by the same degree of favorable prepossession she will have it that his brutal roughness is the manliness of his nature that his most shocking expressions are sincerity of heart that his boasts of his former lewdness are but instances that he knows the world that his freedoms with her person are but excess of love and innocent gaiety of temper that his resenting the prohibition he has met with and his threats are other instances of his love and his courage and peers of the realm ought not to be bound down by little narrow rules like the vulgar for truly their honor which is regarded in the greatest cases equal with the oath of a common gentleman is a security that a lady may trust to if he is not a profligate indeed and that lord p cannot be  that excepting these weaknesses miss has many good qualities is charitable pious humane humble sings sweetly plays on the spinnet charmingly is meek fearful and never was resolute or courageous enough to step out of the regular path till her too flexible heart became touched with a passion that is said to tame lions and therefore her rough peer has none of it and animate the dove and miss cope has too much of it  that miss sutton a young lady of the like age with the two former has too lively and airy a turn of mind affects to be thought well read in the histories of kingdoms as well as in polite literature speaks french fluently talks upon all subjects much and has a great deal of that flippant wit which makes more enemies than friends however is innocent and unsuspectedly virtuous hitherto but makes herself cheap and accessible to fops and rakes and has not the worse opinion of a man for being such listens eagerly to stories told to the disadvantage of individuals of her own sex though affecting to be a great stickler for the honor of the sex in general will unpityingly propagate such stories thinks without considering to what the imprudence of her own conduct may subject her the woman that slips inexcusable asserts that it is the mans place to ask the womans to deny and by this means encourages the one in their vile attempts and gives up the other for their weakness in a kind of silly affectation to show her security in her own virtue at the very time that she is dancing upon the edge of a precipice presumptuously inattentive to her own danger  the worthy dean knowing the ladies intention in this visit to me brought his daughter with him as if by accident for miss l with many good qualities is of a remarkably soft temper though not so inconsiderately soft as miss cope but is too credulous and as her papa suspects entertains more than a liking to a wild young gentleman the heir to a noble fortune who makes visits to her full of tenderness and respect but without declareing himself this gives the dean a good deal of uneasiness and he is very desirous that miss should be in my company on all occasions as she is so kind to profess a great regard to my opinion and judgment  it is easy to see the poor young lady is in love and she makes no doubt that the young gentleman loves her but alas why then for he is not a bashful man as you shall hear does he not say so  he has deceived already two young creatures his father has cautioned the dean against his son has told him that he is sly subtle full of stratagem yet has so much command of himself which makes him more dangerous as not to precipitate his designs but can wait with patience till he thinks himself secure of his prey and then pulls off the mask at once and if he succeeds glories in his villainy  yet does the father beg of the dean to permit his visits for he would be glad he would marry miss l though greatly unequal in fortune to his son wishing for nothing so much as that he would marry and the dean owing his principal preferment to the old gentleman cares not to disoblige him or affront his son without some apparent reason for the latter especially as the father is bound up in him all the family hopes depending upon him having no other child and being himself half afraid of him lest if too much thwarted he should fly out entirely  so here madam are four young ladies of like years and different inclinations and tempers all of whom may be said to have dangers to encounter with resulting from their respective dispositions and who professing to admire my character and the example i had set were brought to me to be benefited as lady towers was pleased to say by my conversation and all was to be as if accidental none of them knowing how well i was acquainted with their respective characters  how proud my dear lady g would this compliment have made me from such a lady as mrs towers had i not been as proud as proud could be before in the good opinion of four beloved persons mr b lady davers the countess of c and your dear self  we were attended only by polly barlow who was as much concerned as any body in some of the points that came before us and as you know this was in the time of the visit paid us by lord and lady davers and that noble countess it is proper to say they were abroad together upon a visit from which knowing how i was to be engaged they excused me  the dean was well known to and valued by all the ladies and therefore was no manner of restraint upon the freedom of our conversation  i was above in my closet when they came and lady towers having presented each young lady to me when i came down said being all seated i can guess at your employment mrs b  writing i dare say i have often wished you for a correspondent for every one who can boast that favor exalts you to the skies and says your letters exceed your conversation but i always insisted upon it that that was impossible  lady towers said i is always saying the most obliging things in the world of her neighbors but may not one suffer dear madam for these kind prepossessions in the opinion of greater strangers who will judge more impartially than your favor will permit you to do  that said lady arthur will be so soon put out of doubt when mrs b begins to speak that we will refer to that and so put an end to every thing that looks like compliment  but mrs b said lady towers may one ask what particular subject was at this time your employment  i had been writing you must know lady g for the sake of engaging miss stapyltons flowery vein a little sketch of the style she is so fond of and hoped for some such opportunity as this question gave me to bring it on the carpet for my only fear with her and miss cope and miss sutton was that they would deem me too grave and so what should fall in the course of conversation would make the less impression upon them for even the best instructions in the world you know will be ineffectual if the method of conveying them is not adapted to the taste and temper of the person you would engage whence as i take it that excellent rule of the apostle of becoming all things to all men  i answered that i had been meditating upon the misfortune of a fine young lady who had been seduced and betrayed by a gentleman she loved and who notwithstanding had the grace to stop short indeed later than were to be wished and to abandon friends country lover in order to avoid any further intercourse with him and that god had blessed her penitence and resolution and she was now very happy in a neighboring dominion  a fine subject said miss stapylton  was the gentleman a man of wit madam was the lady a woman of taste  the gentleman miss was all that was desirable in man had he been virtuous the lady all that was excellent in woman had she been more circumspect but it was a first love on both sides and little did she think he could have taken advantage of her innocence and her affection for him  a sad sad story said miss cope but pray madam did their friends approve of their visits for danger sometimes as i have heard arises from the cruelty of friends who force lovers upon private and clandestine meetings when perhaps there can be no material objection why the gentleman and lady may not come together  well observed miss cope thought i how we are for making every case applicable to our own when our hearts are fixed upon a point  it cannot be called cruelty in friends miss said i when their cautions or even prohibitions are so well justified by the event as in this case  and generally by the wicked arts and practices of seducers and how happy is it for a lady when she suffers herself to be convinced that those who have lived forty years in the world may know twice as much at least of that world as she can possibly know at twenty ten of which moreover are almost a blank if they do not the one must be supposed very ignorant the other very knowing  but miss the lady whose hard case i was meditating hoped too much and feared too little that was her fault which made her give opportunities to the gentleman which neither liberty nor restraint could justify in her she had not the discretion poor lady in this one great point of all that the ladies i have in my eye i dare say would have had in her case  i beg pardon said miss and blushed i know not the case and ought to have been silent  ay miss thought i so you would had not you thought yourself more affected by it than were to be wished you were  i think said miss sutton the lady was the less to be pitied as she must know what her character required of her and that men will deceive wherever they are trusted it is their place to ask a ladys to deny  so miss replied i you are supposing a continual state of war between the two sexes one offensive the other defensive and indeed i think the notion not amiss for a lady will assuredly be less in danger when she rather fears an enemy than hopes a friend where so much depends upon the issue either of her doubt or of her confidence  i dont know neither madam returned miss very briskly whether the men should be set out to us as such bugbears as our mammas generally represent them it is doing too much honor to their sex it is making them too considerable and is a kind of reflection upon the discretion and virtue of our own supposing us weak indeed  the late czar i have read continued miss took a better method with the swedes who had often beat him when after a great victory he made his captives march in procession through the streets of his principal city to familiarize them to the russes and show them they were but men  very well observed miss replied i but then did you not say that this was thought necessary to be done because the russes had been often defeated by these swedes and thought too highly of them and when the swedes taking advantage of that prepossession had the greater contempt for the russes  miss looked a little disconcerted and being silent i proceeded  i am very far miss from thinking the generality of men considerable if our sex do justice to themselves and to what their characters require of them nevertheless give me leave to say that the men i thought altogether inconsiderable would not think worthy of my company nor give it to them when i could avoid it for when once they are persuaded that it is their privilege to ask and the ladys only to deny it will certainly imbolden them to solicit and to think themselves acting in character when they put the lady upon exerting her less active privilege and yet i am humbly of opinion with the poet he comes too near who comes to be denied  for these reasons miss i was pleased with your notion that it would be best to look upon that sex especially if we allow them the privilege you speak of in an hostile light  but permit me to observe with regard to the most contemptible of the species fops coxcombs and pretty fellows that many a good general has been defeated when trusting to his superior strength and skill he has despised a truly weak enemy  i believe madam returned miss your observation is very just i have read of such instances but dear madam permit me to ask whether we speak not too generally when we condemn every man who dresses well and is not a sloven as a fop or a coxcomb  no doubt we do when this is the case but permit me to observe that you hardly ever in your life miss saw a gentleman who was very nice about his person and dress that had any thing he thought of greater consequence to himself to regard it is natural it should be so for should not the man of body take the greatest care to set out and adorn the part for which he thinks himself most valuable and will not the man of mind bestow his principal care in improving that mind perhaps to the neglect of dress and outward appearance which is a fault but surely miss there is a middleway to be observed between both in these as in most other cases for a man need not be a sloven any more than a fop he need not show a contempt for dress and yet not think appearance his first and chief concern be ready to quarrel with a high wind for discomposing his peruque or to put on his hat for fear of depressing his foretop be more afraid of a spot upon his clothes than twenty in his mind be a selfadmirer and always at the glass which he would perhaps never look into could it show him the deformity of his mind as well as the finery of his person  who has a tailor for his tutor and a milaner for his schoolmistress who laughs at men of sense indeed excusably perhaps in revenge because they laugh at him who calls learning pedantry and looks upon the knowledge of the fashions as the only useful science to a fine gentleman  pardon me ladies i could proceed with the character of this species of men but i need not because every lady present i am sure would despise such an one as much as i do were he to fall in her way and the rather because it is a certain fact that he who admires himself will never admire his lady as he ought and if he maintains his niceness after marriage it will be with a preference to himself against her if not  will sink very probably into the worst of slovens for the mind that is capable of one extreme in every case of human life almost when that goes off if not a man of prudence constitutionally in a manner falls into its opposite  but to return to the former subject for the general attention encouraged me to proceed permit me miss sutton to add that a lady must run great risques to her reputation if not to her virtue who will admit into her company any gentleman who shall be of opinion and know it to be hers that it is his province to ask a favor that she thinks it becomes her to deny  i believe madam said miss i spoke these words a little too generally but i meant honorable questions to be sure  there can be but one honorable question thought i and that is seldom asked but when the affair is brought near a conclusion and there is a probability of its being granted and which a single lady while she has parents or guardians should never think of permitting to be put to herself much less of approving nor perhaps as the case may be of denying but i would not push her too far although there was room to have made the young lady blush for her inconsiderate notion  so i said i dont doubt miss but you meant honorable questions a young lady of miss suttons good sense and worthy character could not mean otherwise  and yet miss appeared to be under an agreeable confusion every lady by her eye seeming to think she had met with a deserved rebuke and which not seeming to expect it abated her liveliness all the time after and turned as i may say her tongue into ear  lady towers seasonably relieved us both from a subject too applicable if i may so express it saying but dear mrs b will you favor us with the result of your meditation if you have committed it to writing on the unhappy case you mentioned  i was rather madam exercising my fancy than my judgment such as it is upon the occasion i was aiming at a kind of allegorical or metaphorical style i know not which to call it and it is not fit to be read before such judges i doubt  o pray dear madam said miss stapylton favor us with it to choose for i am a great admirer of that style  we shall never know half your excellencies said lady arthur i have a great curiosity both from the subject and the style to hear what you have written and i beg you will oblige us all  do dear madam said miss l do dear mrs b said lady towers i beg it of you also said the dean do dear madam let us have it said all the ladies  it is short and unfinished it is designed to be woven into a letter to a dear friend and let it be ever so censurable i should be more so if i made any difficulties after such an unanimous request so taking it out of my lettercase i read as follows  while the banks of discretion keep within their natural chanel the proud waves of passion all calm and serene glides along the silver current inlivening the adjacent meadows as it passes with a brighter and more flowery verdure but if the torrents of sensual love are permitted to descend from the hills of credulous hope they may so swell the gentle stream as to make it difficult if not impossible to be retained in its usual bounds what then will be the consequence  why the trees of resolution and the shrubs of cautious fear whose intertwining roots had contributed to support the frail mound being loosened from their hold they and the bank itself will be seen floating on the surface of the triumphant waters  but here a dear lady having unhappily failed is enabled to set her foot in the newmade breach while yet it is possible to stop it and to say with little variation in the language of that power which only could enable her to say it hither ye proud waves of dissolute love although you have come yet no farther shall ye come is such an instance of magnanimous resolution and selfconquest as is very rarely to be met with  they were all greatly taken with what i read and the dean gave it beauties by his kind comments which he himself could hardly think it merited supposing no doubt that it might afford a subject for the young ladies to contemplate upon in their own taste as one may say miss stapylton particularly appeared so delighted with it that she desired a copy of it and the other three young ladies complaisantly joined in her request  whereupon i said that if it could have the benefit of the deans remarks upon it it would be worthy of their acceptance but however it was at their service for i had the rough sketch of it above  miss stapylton took it promising to give each a copy and honored it with a place in her bosom i mention this because it answered my end and slight as the cause was gave the young flighty ladies an high opinion of me which made them listen with the greater attention to all that succeeded  our conversation after this took a more general turn as to the air of it if i may say so which i thought right lest the young ladies should imagine it was a designed thing against them but yet it was such that every one of them found her character and taste little or much concerned in it and all seemed as lady towers afterward observed to me by their silence and attention to be busied with private applications  the dean began first with a view to his own daughter and seeing his drift i humored it accordingly and the rather as miss copes case was included in that of miss l he was pleased to say that i seemed designed by providence as a model as well as an exemplar for my sex and it was matter of great surprise to him that my tender years considered i should be capable of making those reflections by which persons of twice my age and experience might be instructed you see madam said he how attentive we all are when your lips begin to open and i beg we may have nothing to do but to be attentive  i have had such advantages sir replied i from the observations and cautions of my late excellent lady that did you but know half of them you would rather wonder i had made no greater improvement than that i have made so much she used to think me pretty and not illtemperd and of course not incredulous where i conceived a good opinion and was always arming me on that side as believing i might be the object of wicked attempts and the rather as my low fortunes subjected me to danger for had i been born to rank and condition as these young ladies here i should have had reason to think of myself as justly as no doubt they do and of consequence beyond the reach of any vile intriguer as i should have been above the greatest part of that species of mankind who for want of understanding or honor or through pernicious habits give themselves up to libertinism  charming humility said miss cope with her hands lifted up so said miss stapylton  these were great advantages no doubt said miss sutton but in you they met with a surprising genius it is very plain madam and there is not in my opinion a lady in england of your years who would have improved by them as you have done  i answered that i was much obliged to her for her good opinion but that i had always observed that the person who admired any good qualities in another gave a kind of natural demonstration that she had the same in an eminent degree herself although perhaps her modest diffidence would not permit her to trace the generous principle to its source  the dean in order to bring us back again to our subject repeated my remark that it was safer in cases where so much depended upon the issue as a ladys honor and reputation to fear an enemy than to hope a friend and praised my observation that even a weak enemy is not to be too much despised  i said i had very high notions of the honor and value of my own sex and very mean ones of the gay and frothy part of the other insomuch that i thought they could have no strength but what was founded in our weakness that indeed the difference of education must give men advantages even where the genius was naturally equal and among others courage and hardness of hearts which make ladies where they meet not with men of honor to engage upon very unequal terms for that it was so customary with them to make vows and promises and to set so light by them when made that an innocent lady cannot guard too watchfully against them and in my opinion should believe nothing they said or even vowed but what carried demonstration with it  i remember continued i my lady used often to observe that there was a time of life in all young persons which might properly be called the romantic which was a very dangerous period and required therefore a great guard of prudence that the risque was not a little augmented by reading novels and romances and that the poetical tribe had much to answer for on this head by reason of their inflaming and unnatural descriptions which did much hurt to thoughtless minds and lively imaginations for to those she would have it were principally owing the rashness and indiscretion of even soft and tender dispositions which in breach of their duty and even decorum of sex too frequently set them upon enterprises like what they have read in those pernicious writings which not seldom make them fall a sacrifice to the base designs of some vile intriguer and even in cases where their precipitation ends the best that is to say in marriage they too frequently in direct opposition to the cautions and commands of their tried their experienced and unquestionable friends throw themselves upon an almost stranger who had he not been unworthy of them would not nor needed to have taken indirect methods to obtain their favor  and the misfortune is continued i the most innocent are generally the most credulous they would do no harm to others themselves and cannot think others would do them any and with regard to the particular person who has obtained perhaps a share in her confidence he cannot surely she thinks be so ungrateful as to return evil for good were all the men in the world besides to prove false the beloved person cannot twould be unjust to her own merit as well as to his vows to suppose it and so design on his side and credulity and selfopinion on the ladys at last inroll the unhappy believer in the list of the toolate repenters  and what madam said the dean has not that wretch to answer for who makes sport of destroying a virtuous character and in being the wicked means of throwing perhaps upon the town and into the dregs of prostitution a poor creature whose love for him and confidence in him was all her crime and who otherwise might have made a worthy figure at the head of some reputable family propagating good examples instead of ruin and infamy to mankind and so have been an useful member of the commonwealth to say nothing of what is still worse the dreadful crime of occasioning the loss of a soul since final impenitence too genenerally follows the first sacrifice which the poor wretch is seduced to make of her honor  there are several gentlemen in our neighborhood said mrs brooks who might be benefited by this touching reflection if it was represented in the same strong lights from the pulpit and permit me to say mr dean that i think you should give us a sermon upon this subject for the sake of both sexes one for caution the other for conviction  i will think of it replied he but i am sorry to say that we have too many among our younger gentry who would think themselves pointed at were i to touch this subject ever so cautiously  i am sure said lady towers there cannot well be a more useful one and the very reason the dean gives is a convincing proof of it to me  when i have had the pleasure of hearing the further sentiments of such an assembly as this upon the delicate subject replied this polite divine i shall be better enabled to treat it and pray ladies proceed for it is from your conversation that i must take my hints  you have nothing to do then said lady towers but to engage mrs b to speak and you may be sure we will all be as attentive to her as we shall be to you when we shall have the pleasure to hear so fine a genius improving upon her hints from the pulpit  i bowed as the dean did to lady towers and knowing that she praised me so highly in order to induce the young ladies to give the greater attention to what she wished i should speak i said it would be almost an unpardonable presumption in me after so high a compliment to open my lips nevertheless as i was sure by speaking i should have the benefit of instruction whenever it made them speak i would not be backward to enter upon any subject for that i should consider myself as a young counsel in some great cause who served but to open it and prepare the way for those of greater skill and abilities  i beg then madam said miss stapylton you will open the cause be the subject what it will and i could almost wish that we had as many gentlemen here as ladies who would have reason to be ashamed of the liberties they take in censuring the conversations of the teatable since the pulpit as the worthy dean gives us reason to hope may be beholden to that of mrs b  nor is it much wonder replied i when the dean himself is with us and it is graced by so charming and distinguished a circle  if many of our young gentlemen were here said lady towers they might improve themselves in all the graces of polite and sincere complaisance but compared to this i have generally heard such trite and coarse stuff from our race of woudbewits that what they say may be compared to the fawnings and salutations of the ass in the fable who emulating the lapdog merited a cudgel rather than encouragement  but mrs b continued she begin i pray you to open and proceed in the cause for there will be no counsel employed but you i can tell you  then give me a subject that will suit me ladies and you shall see how my obedience to your commands will make me run on  will you madam said miss stapylton give us a few cautions and instructions on a theme of your own that a young lady should rather fear too much than hope too much a necessary doctrine perhaps but a difficult one to be practiced by a lady who has begun to love and supposes all truth and honor in the object of her favor  hope miss said i in my opinion should never be unaccompanyd by fear and the more reason will a lady ever have to fear and to suspect herself and doubt her lover when she once begins to find in her own breast a favor for him for then her danger is doubled since she has herself perhaps the more dangerous enemy of the two to guard against as well as him  she may secretly hope the best indeed but what has been the fate of others may be her own and though she thinks it not probable from such a faithful protester as he appears to her to be yet while it is possible she should never be off her guard nor will a prudent woman trust to his mercy or honor but to her own discretion and the rather because if he mean well he himself will value her the more for her caution since every man desires to have a virtuous and prudent wife if not well she will detect him the sooner and so by her prudence frustrate all his base designs  the ladies seeming by their silence to approve what i said i proceeded  but let me my dear ladies ask what that passion is which generally we dignify by the name of love and which when so dignified puts us upon a thousand extravagancies i believe if it were to be examined into it would be found too generally to owe its original to ungoverned fancy and were we to judge of it by the consequences that usually attend it it ought rather to be called rashness inconsideration weakness any thing but love for very seldom i doubt is the solid judgment so much concerned in it as the airy fancy but when once we dignify the wild misleader with the name of love all the absurdities which we have read in novels and romances take place and we are induced to follow examples that seldom end happily but in them  but permit me further to observe that love as we call it operates differently in the two sexes as to its effects for in woman it is a creeping thing in man an incroacher and this ought in my humble opinion to be very seriously attended to miss sutton intimated thus much when she observed that it was the mans province to ask the ladys to deny  excuse me miss the observation was just as to the mens notions although methinks i would not have a lady allow of it except in cases of caution to themselves  the doubt therefore proceeded i which a lady has of her lovers honor is needful to preserve her own and his too and if she does him wrong and he should be too just to deceive her she can make him amends by instances of greater confidence when she pleases but if she has been accustomed to grant him little favors can she easily recall them and will not the incroacher grow upon her indulgence pleading for a favor today which was not refused him yesterday and reproaching her want of confidence as a want of esteem till the poor lady who perhaps has given way to this creeping insinuating passion and has avowed her esteem for him puts herself too much in his power in order to manifest as she thinks the generosity of her affection and so by degrees is carried farther than she intended or nice honor ought to have permitted and all because to keep up to my theme she hopes too much and doubts too little and permit me ladies to add that there have been cases where a gentleman himself pursuing the dictates of his incroaching passion and finding a lady too conceding has taken advantages that probably at first he did not presume to think of  miss stapylton said that virtue itself spoke when i spoke and she was resolved when she came home to recollect as much of this conversation as was possible and write it down in her commonplace book where it would make a better figure than any thing she had there  i suppose miss said lady towers your chief collections are flowers of rhetoric picked up from the french and english poets and novelwriters i would give something for the pleasure of having it two hours in my possession  fie madam replied miss a little abashed how can you expose your kinswoman thus before the dean and mrs b  lady towers miss said i only says this to provoke you to show your collections i wish i had the pleasure of seeing them i doubt not but your commonplace book is a storehouse of wisdom  there is nothing bad in it i hope said miss but i would not that mrs b should see it for the world but let me tell you madam to lady towers there are many beautiful things and good instructions to be collected from novels and plays and romances and from the poetical writers particularly light as you are pleased to make of them pray madam to me have you ever been at all conversant in such writers  not a great deal miss there were very few novels and romances that my lady would permit me to read and those i did gave me no great pleasure for either they dealt so much in the mavelous and improbable or were so unnaturally inflaming to the passions and so full of love and intrigue that hardly any of them but seemed calculated to fire the imagination rather than to inform the judgment tilts and tournaments breaking of spears in honor of a mistress swimming of rivers engaging with monsters rambling in search of adventures making unnatural difficulties in order to show the knighterrants prowess in overcoming them is all that is required to constitute the hero in such pieces and what principally distinguishes the character of the heroine is when she is taught to consider her fathers house as an enchanted castle and her lover as the hero who is to dissolve the charm and to set her at liberty from one confinement in order to put her into another and too probably a worse to instruct her how to climb walls drop from windows leap precipices and do twenty other extravagant things in order to show the mad strength of a passion she ought to be ashamed of to make parents and guardians pass for tyrants and the voice of reason to be drowned in that of indiscreet love which exalts the other sex and debases her own and what is the instruction that can be gathered from such pieces for the conduct of common life  then have i been ready to quarrel with these writers for another reason and that is the dangerous notion which they hardly ever fail to propagate of a firstsight love for there is such a susceptibility supposed on both sides which however it may pass in a man very little becomes a ladys delicacy that they are smitten with a glance the fictitious blind god is made a real divinity and too often prudence and discretion are the first offerings at his shrine  i believe madam said miss stapylton blushing and playing with her fan there have been many instances of peoples loving at first sight which have ended very happily  no doubt of it miss replied i but there are three chances to one that so precipitate a liking does not for where can be the room for caution for inquiry for the display of merit and sincerity and even the assurance of a grateful return to a lady who thus suffers herself to be prepossessed is it not a random shot is it not a proof of weakness is it not giving up the negative voice which belongs to the sex even while she doubts to meet the affirmative one from him she wishes for  indeed ladies continued i i cannot help concluding and i am the less afraid of speaking my mind because of the opinion i have of the prudence of every lady that hears me that where this weakness is found it is no way favorable to a ladys character and to that discretion which ought to distinguish it it looks to me as if a ladys heart were too much in the power of her eye and that she had permitted her fancy to be much more busy than her judgment  miss stapylton blushed and looked around her  but i have generally observed mrs b said lady towers that whenever you censure any indiscretion you seldom fail to give cautions how to avoid it and pray let us know what is to be done in this case that is to say how a young lady ought to guard against and overcome the first favorable impressions  what i imagine replied i a young lady ought to do on any the least favorable impressions of this kind is immediately to withdraw into herself as one may say to reflect upon what she owes to her parents to her family to her character and to her sex and to resolve to check such a random prepossession which may much more probably as i hinted make her a prey to the undeserving than otherwise as there are so many of that character to one man of real merit  the most that i apprehend a firstsight favor can do is to inspire a liking and a liking is conquerable if the person will not brood over it till she hatches it into love then every man and woman has a black and a white side and it is easy to set the imperfections of the person against the supposed perfections while it is only liking but if the busy fancy be permitted to work as it pleases uncheckd uncontrolled then it is very likely were it but to keep itself in countenance for her first impressions she will see perfections in the object which no living soul can see but herself and it will hardly be expected but that as a consequence of her first indiscretion she will confirm as an act of her judgment what her wild and ungoverned fancy had misled her to think of with so much partial favor and too late as it may too probably happen she wilt see and lament her fatal and perhaps undutiful error  we are talking of the ladies only added i for i saw miss stapylton was become very grave but i believe the case of firstsight love often operates alike in both sexes and the same inconveniences may arise to both from a rashness of this kind and where it is so it will be very lucky shall i say if either gentleman or lady find reason on cool reflection to approve a choice which they were so ready to make without thought  it is allowed my dear mrs b said lady towers that rash and precipitate love may operate pretty much alike in the rash and precipitate of both sexes and whichsoever loves generally exalts the person beloved above his or her merits but i am desirous for the sake of us maiden ladies since it is a science in which you are so great an adept to have your advice how we should watch and guard against its first encroachments and that you will tell us what you apprehend gives the men most advantage over us  nay now lady towers you railly my presumption indeed  i admire you madam replied she and every thing you say and do and i will not forgive you to call what i so seriously say and think raillery for my own part continued she i never was in love yet nor i believe were any of these young ladies  miss cope looked a little silly upon this  and who can better instruct us to guard our hearts than a lady who has so well defended her own  why then madam if i must speak i think what gives the other sex the greatest advantage over even many of the most deserving of ours is that dangerous foible the love of praise and the desire to be flattered and admired a passion that i have observed to predominate more or less from sixteen to sixty in most of our sex we are too generally delighted with the company of those who extol our graces of person or mind for will not a grateful lady study hard to return a few compliments to a gentleman who makes her so many she is concerned to prove him a man of distinguishing sense or a polite man at least in regard to what she thinks of herself and so the flatterer shall be preferred to such of the sincere and worthy as cannot say what they do not think and by this means many an excellent lady has fallen a prey to some sordid designer  then i think nothing gives gentlemen so much advantage over our sex as to see how readily a virtuous lady can forgive the capital faults of the most abandoned of the other and that sad sad notion that a reformed rake makes the best husband a notion that has done more hurt and discredit too to our sex as it has given more encouragement to the profligates of the other and more discouragement to the sober gentlemen than can be easily imagined a fine thing indeed as if the wretch who had run through a course of iniquity to the endangering of soul and body was to be deemed the best companion for life to an innocent and virtuous young lady who is to owe the kindness of his treatment of her to his having never before accompanied with a modest woman nor till his interest on one hand to which his extravagance perhaps compels him to attend and his impaired constitution on the other oblige him him to it wished to accompany with one and who always made a jest of the married state and perhaps of every thing sacred and just  you observe very well my dear mrs b said lady towers but people will be apt to think that you have less reason than any of our sex to be severe against the notion you speak of for who was a greater rake than a certain gentleman and who a better husband  madam replied i the gentleman you mean never was a common townrake he is a gentleman of sense and fine understanding and his reformation secondarily as i may say has been the natural effect of those extraordinary qualities but besides madam i will presume to say that that gentleman as he has not many equals in the nobleness of his nature so is not likely i doubt to have many followers in a reformation begun in the bloom of youth upon selfconviction and altogether humanly speaking spontaneous  those young ladies who would plead his example in support of this pernicious notion should find out the same generous qualities in the gentleman before they trust to it and it will then do less harm though even then i could not wish it to be generally propagated  it is really unaccountable said lady towers after all as mrs b i remember once formerly said that our sex should not as much insist upon virtue and sobriety in the character of a gentleman as the gentleman be he ever such a rake does in that of a lady and it is certainly a great encouragement to libertinism that a wornout debauchee shall think himself at any time good enough for an husband and have the confidence to imagine that a modest lady will accept of his address with a preference  i can account for it but one way said the dean and that is that a modest lady is apt to be diffident of herself and she thinks this diffidence an imperfection a rake never is so he has in perfection a quality she thinks she wants and knowing too little of the world imagines she mends the matter by accepting of one who knows too much  that is well observed mr dean said lady towers but there is another fault in our sex which mrs b has not touched upon and that is the foolish pride some ladies take in taming a wild fellow and that they have been able to do more than many of their sex before them could do a pride that often costs them dear enough as i know in more than one instance  another weakness said i might be produced against some of our sex and that is in joining too readily to droll upon and sneer at the misfortune of any poor young creature who has shown too little regard for her honor and that instead of speaking of it with concern and thinking themselves happy it was not their own case and inveighing against the seducer they will too lightly sport with the unhappy creatures fall propagate the knowledge of it  i would not look upon miss sutton while i spoke this  and avoid her as an infection yet after a while not scruple to admit into their company the vile aggressor and even smile with him at his barbarous jests upon the poor sufferer of their own sex  i have known three or four instances of this in my time said lady towers that miss sutton might not take it to herself for she looked down and was a little serious  this rejoined i puts me in mind of a little humourous copy of verses written as i believe by mr b and which to the very purpose we are speaking of he calls  benefit of making others misfortunes our own  thoust heard it or read it a million of times that men are made up of falsehoods and crimes search all the old authors and ransack the new thou wilt find in lovestories scarce one mortal true then why this complaining and why this wry face is it cause you are affected most with thy own case had thou sooner made others misfortunes thy own thou never thyself this disaster had known thy compassionate caution had kept thee from evil and thou might have defied mankind and the devil the ladies were pleased with the lines but lady towers wanted to know she said at what time of mr bs life they could be written because added she i never suspected before that the good gentleman ever took pains to write cautions or exhortations to our sex to avoid the delusions of his own  these verses and this facetious but severe remark of lady towers made every young lady look up with a cheerful countenance because it pushed the ball from self and the dean said to his daughter so my dear you that have been so attentive must let us know what useful inferences you can draw from what mrs b and the other ladies have so excellently said  i observe sir said miss from the faults the ladies have so justly imputed to some of our sex that the advantage the gentlemen chiefly have over us is from our own weakness and that it behooves a prudent lady to guard against first impressions of favor since she will think herself obliged in compliment to her own judgment to find reasons if possible to confirm them  but i would be glad to know ladies added miss if there be any way that a lady can judge whether a gentleman means honorably or not in his address to her  mrs b can best inform you of that miss l said lady towers what say you mrs b  there are a few signs answered i easy to be known and i think almost infallible  pray let us have em said lady arthur and they all were very attentive  these are they replied i i lay it down as an undoubted truth that true love is one of the most respectful things in the world it strikes with awe and reverence the mind of the gentleman who boasts its impression it is chaste and pure in word and deed and cannot bear to have the least indecency mingle with it  if therefore a gentleman be his birth or quality what it will the higher the worse presume to wound a ladys ears with indecent words if he endeavor in his expressions or sentiments to convey gross or impure ideas to her mind if he is continually pressing for her confidence in his honor if he requests favors which a lady ought to refuse if he can be regardless of his conduct or behavior to her if he can use boisterous or rude freedoms either to her person or dress  here poor miss cope by her blushes bore witness to her case  if he avoids speaking of marriage when he has a fair opportunity of doing it   here miss l looked down and blushed  or leaves it once to a lady to wonder that he does not  in any or in all these cases he is to be suspected and a lady can have little hope of such a person nor as i humbly apprehend consistent with honor and discretion encourage his address  the ladies were so kind as to applaud all i said and so did the dean miss stapylton and miss cope and miss l were to try to recollect it when they came home and to write down what they could remember of the conversation and our noble guests coming in soon after with mr b the ladies would have departed but he prevailed upon them with some difficulty to pass the evening and miss l who has an admirable finger at the spinnet as i have heretofore told you obliged us with two or three tunes each of the ladies did the like and prevailed upon me to play a tune or two but miss cope as well as miss l surpassed me much we all sung too in turns and mr b took the violin in which he excels lord davers obliged us on the harpsichord mr h played on the flute and sung us a fops song and performed it in character so that we had an exceeding gay evening and parted with great satisfaction on all sides and high delight on the young ladies for this put them all into good humor and good spirits enlivening the former scene which otherwise might have closed perhaps more gravely than efficaciously  the distance of time since this conversation passed enables me to add what i could not do when i wrote the account of it which you have mislaid and which take briefly as follows  miss stapylton upon her return home was as good as her word and wrote down all she could recollect of the conversation and suffered it to have such an effect upon her as to turn the course of her reading and studies to weightier and more solid subjects and avoiding the gentleman she had began to favor gave way to her parents recommendation and is happily married to sir jonathan barnes  miss cope came to me a week after this with the leave of both her parents and tarried with me three days in which time she opened all her worthy heart to me and returned in such a disposition and with such resolutions that she never would see her peer again nor receive letters from him which she owned to me she had done clandestinely before and she is now the happy lady of sir michael beaumont who makes her the best of husbands and permits her to follow her charitable inclinations according to a scheme which she prevailed upon me to give her  miss l by the deans indulgent prudence and discretion has escaped her rake and upon the discovery of an intrigue he was carrying on with another conceived a just abhorrence of him and is since married to dr jenkins as you know with whom she lives very happily  miss sutton is not quite so well off as the three former though not altogether unhappy neither in her way she could not indeed conquer her love of dress and tinsel and so became the lady of col wilson and they are thus far easy in the marriage state that being seldom together in all probability they save a multitude of misunderstandings for the colonel loves gaming in which he is generally a winner and so passes his time mostly in town his lady has her pleasures neither laudable nor criminal ones which she pursues in the country and nowandthen a letter passes on both sides by the inscription and subscription of which they remind one another that they have been once in their lives at one church together  and what now my dear lady g have i to add to this tedious account for letter i can hardly call it but that i am with great affection  your true friend and servant p b   letter lxiv my dear lady g you desired me to send you a little specimen of my nursery tales and stories with which as miss fenwick told you on her return to lincolnshire i entertain my miss goodwin and my little boys but you make me too high a compliment when you tell me it is for your own instruction and example yet you know my dear lady g be your motives what they will i must obey you although were others to see it i might expose myself to the smiles and contempt of judges less prejudiced in my favor so i will begin without any further apology and as near as i can give you those very stories with which miss fenwick was so pleased and of which she has made so favorable a report  let me acquaint you then that my method is to give characters of persons i have known in one part or other of my life in feigned names whose conduct may serve for imitation or warning to my dear attentive miss and sometimes i give instances of good boys and naughty boys for the sake of my billy and my davers and they are continually coming about me dear madam a pretty story now cries miss and dear mamma tell me of good boys and of naughty boys cries billy  miss is a surprising child for her age and is very familiar with many of the best characters in the spectators and having a smattering of latin and more than a smattering of italian and being a perfect mistress of french is seldom at a loss for the derivation of even such words as are not of english original and so i shall give you a story in feigned names with which she is so delighted that she has wrote it down but i will first trespass on your patience with one of my childish tales  every day once or twice if i am not hindered i cause miss goodwin who plays and sings very prettily to give a tune or two to me and my billy and davers who as well as my pamela love and learn to touch the keys young as the latter is and she will have a sweet finger i can see that and a charming ear and her voice is music itself  oh the fond fond mother i know you will say on reading this  then madam we all proceed hand in hand together to the nursery to my charley and jemmy and in this happy retirement so much my delight in the absence of my best beloved imagine you see me seated surrounded with the joy and the hope of my future prospects as well as my present comforts  miss goodwin imagine you see on my right hand sitting on a velvet stool because she is eldest and a miss billy on my left in a little cane elbow chair because he is eldest and a good boy my davers and my sparklingeyd pamela with my charley between them on little silken cushions at my feet hand in hand their pleased eyes looking up to my more delighted ones and my sweetnaturd promising jemmy in my lap the nurses and the cradle just behind us and the nursery maids delightedly pursuing some useful needle work for the dear charmers of my heart  all as hush and as still as silence itself as the pretty creatures generally are when their little watchful eyes see my lips beginning to open for they take great notice already of my rule of two ears to see this vol p  0  one tongue insomuch that if billy or davers are either of them for breaking the mum as they call it they are immediately hush at any time if i put my finger to my lip or if miss points hers to her ears even to the breaking of a word in two as it were and yet all my boys are as lively as so many birds while my pamela is cheerful easy soft gentle always smiling but modest and harmless as a dove  i began with a story of two little boys and two little girls the children of a fine gentleman and a fine lady who loved them dearly that they were all so good and loved one another so well that every body who saw them admired them and talked of them far and near that they would part with any thing to one another loved the poor spoke kindly to the servants did every thing they were bid to do were not proud and knew no strife but who should learn their books best and be the prettiest scholar that the servants loved them and would do any thing they desired that they were not proud of fine clothes let not their heads run upon their playthings when they should mind their books said grace before they eat their prayers before they went tobed and as soon as they rose were always clean and neat would not tell a fib for the world and were above doing any thing that required one that god blessed them more and more and blessed their papa and mamma and their uncles and aunts and cousins for their sakes and there was a happy family my dear loves  no one idle all prettily employed the masters at their books the misses at their books too or their needles except at their playhours when they were never rude nor noisy nor mischievous nor quarrelsome and no such word was ever heard from their mouths as why may not i have this or that as well as billy or bobby  or why should sally have this or that any more than i  but it was as my mamma pleases my mamma knows best and a bow and a smile and no surliness or scouling brow to be seen if they were denied any thing for well did they know that their papa and mamma loved them so dearly that they would refuse them nothing that was for their good and they were sure when they were refused they asked for something that would have done them hurt had it been granted never were such good boys and girls as these and they grew up and the masters became fine scholars and fine gentlemen and every body honored them and the misses became fine ladies and fine housewives and this gentleman when they grew to be women sought to marry one of the misses and that gentleman the other and happy was he that could be admitted into their companies so that they had nothing to do but pick and choose the best gentlemen in the county while the greatest ladies for birth and the most remarkable for virtue which my dears is better than either birth or fortune thought themselves honored by the addresses of the two brothers and they married and made good papas and mammas and were so many blessings to the age in which they lived there my dear loves were happy sons and daughters for good masters seldom fail to make good gentlemen and good misses good ladies and god blesses them with as good children as they were to their parents and so the blessing goes round  who would not but be good  well but mamma we will all be good will not we master davers cries my billy yes brother billy then they kiss one another and if they have playthings or any thing they like exchange with each other to show the effect my lessons have upon them but what will become of the naughty boys tell us mamma about the naughty boys  why there was a poor poor widow woman who had three naughty sons and one naughty daughter and they would do nothing that their mamma bid them do were always quarreling scratching and fighting would not say their prayers would not learn their book so that the little boys used to laugh at them and point at them as they went along for blockheads and nobody loved them or took notice of them except to beat and thump them about for their naughty ways and their undutifulness to their poor mother who worked hard to maintain them as they grew up they grew worse and worse and more and more stupid and ignorant so that they impoverished their poor mother and at last broke her heart poor poor widow woman  and her neighbors joined together to bury the poor widow woman for these sad ungracious children made away with what little she had left while she was ill before her heart was quite broken and this helped to break it the sooner for had she lived she saw she must have wanted bread and had no comfort from such wicked children  poor poor widow woman said my billy with tears and my little dove shed tears too and davers was moved and miss wiped her fine eyes  but what became of the naughty boys and the naughty girl mamma  became of them why one son was forced to go to sea and there he was drowned another turned thief for he would not work and he came to an untimely end the third was idle and ignorant and nobody would employ him that knew how he had used his poor mother and so he was forced to go into a far country and beg his bread and the naughty girl having never loved work pined away in sloth and filthiness and at last broke her arm and died of a fever lamenting too late that she had been so wicked a daughter to so good a mother  and so there was a sad end of all the four ungracious children who never would mind what their poor mother said to them and god punished their naughtiness as you see  while the good children i mentioned before were the ornament and the glory of their family and the delight of every body that knew them  who would not be good was the inference and the repetition from billy with his hands clapped together poor poor widow woman  gave me much pleasure  so my childish story ended with a kiss of each pretty dear and their thanks for my story and then came on misss request for a womans story as she called it i dismissed my babies to their playin the apartment allotted for that purpose and taking misss hand she standing before me all attention began in a more womanly strain to her for she is very fond of being thought a woman and indeed is a prudent sensible dear comprehends any thing instantly and makes very pretty reflections upon what she hears or reads as you will observe in what follows  there is nothing my dear miss goodwin that young ladies should be so watchful over as their reputation it is a tender flower that the least frost will nip the least cold wind will blast and when once blasted it will never flourish again but wither to the very root but this i have told you so often that i am sure i need not repeat what i have said so to my story  there were four pretty ladies lived in one genteel neighborhood the daughters of four several families but all companions and visitors and yet all of very different inclinations coquetilla we will call one prudiana another profusiana the third and prudentia the fourth their several names denoting their respective qualities  coquetilla a was the only daughter of a worthy baronet by a lady very gay but rather indiscreet than unvirtuous who took not due care of her daughters education but let her be overrun with the love of fashions dress and equipage and when in london balls operas plays the park the ring the withdrawingroom took up her whole attention she admired nobody but herself fluttered about laughing at and despising a crowd of menfollowers whom she attracted by gay thoughtless freedoms of behavior too nearly treading on the skirts of immodesty yet made she not one worthy conquest exciting on the contrary in all sober minds that contempt upon herself which she so profusely would be thought to pour down upon the rest of the world after she had several years fluttered about the dangerous light like some silly fly she at last sindged the wings of her reputation for being despised by every worthy heart she became too easy and cheap a prey to a man the most unworthy of all her followers who had resolution and confidence enough to break through those few cobweb reserves in which she had incircled her precarious virtue and which were no longer of force to preserve her honor than till she met with a man more bold and more enterprising than herself and who was as designing as she was thoughtless and what then became of coquetilla  why she was forced to pass over sea to ireland where nobody knew her and to bury herself in a dull obscurity to go by another name and at last unable to support a life so unsuitable to the natural gaiety of her temper she pined herself into a consumption and died unpitied and unlamented among strangers and having not one friend but whom she bought with her money  poor lady coquetilla said miss what a sad thing it is to have a wrong education and how happy am i who have so good a lady to supply the place of a dear distant mamma  but be pleased madam to proceed to the next  prudiana my dear was the daughter of a gentleman who was a widower having while the young lady was an infant buried her mamma he was a good sort of man but had but one lesson to teach to prudiana and that was to avoid all manner of conversation with the men but never gave her the right turn of mind nor instilled into it that sense of her religious duties which would have been her best guard in all temptations for so as she kept out of the sight and conversation of the gentlemen and avoided the company of those ladies who more freely conversed with the other sex it was all her papa desired of her this gave her a haughty sullen and reserved turn made her stiff formal and affected she had sense enough to discover early the faults of coquetilla and in dislike of them fell the more easily into that contrary extreme which her recluse education and her papas cautions naturally led her so that pride reserve affectation and censoriousness made up the essentials of her character and she became more unamiable even than coquetilla and as the other was too accessible prudiana was quite unapproachable by gentlemen and unfit for any conversation but that of her servants being also deserted by those of her own sex by whom she might have improved on account of her censorious disposition and what was the consequence why this every worthy person of both sexes despising her and she being used to see nobody but servants at last throws herself upon one of that class in an evil hour she finds something that is taking to her low taste in the person of her papas valet a wretch so infinitely beneath her but a coxcomb of a servant that every body attributed to her the scandal of making the first advances for otherwise it was presumed he durst not have looked up to his masters daughter so here ended all her pride all her reserves came to this her censoriousness of others redoubled peoples contempts upon herself and made nobody pity her she was finally turned out of doors without a penny of fortune the fellow was forced to set up a barbers shop in a country town for all he knew was to shave and dress a peruque and her papa would never look upon her more so that prudiana became the outcast of her family and the scorn of all that knew her and was forced to mingle in conversation and company with the wretches of her husbands degree  poor miserable prudiana said miss  what a sad sad fall was hers  and all owing to the want of a proper education too  and to the loss of such a mamma as i have an aunt and so wise a papa as i have an uncle  how could her papa i wonder restrain her person as he did like a poor nun and make her unacquainted with the generous restraints of the mind  i am sure my dear good aunt it will be owing to you that i shall never be a coquetilla nor a prudiana neither your table is always surrounded with the best of company with worthy gentlemen as well as ladies and you instruct me to judge of both and of every new guest in such a manner as makes me esteem them all and censure nobody but yet to see faults in some to avoid and graces in others to imitate but in nobody but yourself and my uncle any thing so like perfection as shall attract ones admiration to ones own ruin  you are young yet my love and must always doubt your own strength and pray to god more and more as your years advance to give you more and more prudence and watchfulness over your conduct  but yet my dear you must think justly of yourself too for let the young gentlemen be ever so learned and discreet your education intitles you to think as well of yourself as of them for dont you see the ladies who are so kind to visit us that have not been abroad as you have been when they were young yet make as good figures in conversation say as good things as any of the gentlemen for my dear all that the gentlemen know more than the ladies except here and there such an one as your dear uncle with all their learned education is only that they have been disciplined perhaps into an observation of a few accuracies in speech that if they know no more rather distinguish the pedant than the gentleman such as the avoiding of a false concord as they call it and which you know how to do as well as the best not to put a was for a were an are for an is and to be able to speak in mood and tense and such like valuable parts of education so that my dear you can have no reason to look upon that sex in so high a light as to depreciate your own and yet you must not be proud nor conceited neither but make this one rule your guide  in your maiden state think yourself above the gentlemen and they will think you so too and address you with reverence and respect if they see it is not arrogant pride but a conscious merit a true dignity such as becomes virgin modesty and untainted purity of mind and manners like that of an angel among men for so young ladies should look upon themselves to be and will then be treated as such by the other sex  in your married state which is a kind of state of humiliation for a lady you must think yourself subordinate to your husband for so it has pleased god to make us you must have no will of your own in petty things and if you marry a gentleman of sense and honor such an one as your uncle he will look upon you as his equal and will exalt you the more for your abasing yourself  in short my dear he will act by you just as your dear uncle does by me and then what a happy creature will you be  so i shall madam to be sure i shall  but i know i shall be happy whenever i marry because i have such wise directors and such an example before me and if it please god i will never think of any man in pursuance of your constant advice to young ladies at the teatable who is not a man of sense and a virtuous gentleman but now dear madam for your next character there are two more yet to come that is my pleasure i wish there were ten  why the next was profusiana you remember my dear love profusiana took another course to her ruin she fell into some of coquetillas foibles but pursued them for another end and in another manner struck with the grandeur and magnificence of what weak people call the upper life she gives herself up to the circus to balls to operas masquerades and assemblees affects to shine at the head of all company at tunbridge at bath and every place of public resort plays high is always receiving and paying visits giving balls and making treats and entertainments and is so much above the conduct which mostly recommends a young lady to the esteem of the deserving of the other sex that no gentleman who prefers solid happiness can think of addressing her though she is a fine person and has many outward graces of behavior she becomes the favorite toast of the places she frequents is proud of that distinction gives the fashion and delights in the pride that she can make apes by imitation whenever she pleases but yet endeavoring to avoid being thought proud makes herself cheap and is the subject of the attempts of every coxcomb of eminence and with much ado preserves her virtue though hardly her character  what all this while is poor profusiana doing she would be glad perhaps of a suitable proposal and would it may be give up some of her gaieties and extravagancies for profusiana has wit and is not totally abandoned of reflection when she suffers herself to think but her conduct procures her not one solid friendship and she has not in a twelvemonth among a thousand professions of service one devoir that she can attend to or a friend that she can depend upon all the women she sees if she excels them hate her the gay part of the men with whom she accompanies most are all in a plot against her honor even the gentlemen whose conduct in the general is governed by principles of virtue come down to these public places to partake of the innocent freedoms allowed there and oftentimes give themselves airs of gallantry and never have it in their thoughts to commence a treaty of marriage with an acquaintance begun upon that gay spot what solid friendships and satisfactions then is profusiana excluded from  her name indeed is written in every public window and prostituted as i may call it at the pleasure of every profligate or sot who carries a diamond to ingrave it and that it may be with most vile and barbarous imputations and freedoms of words added by rakes who very probably never exchanged a syllable with her the wounded trees are perhaps taught also to wear the initials of her name linked not unlikely and widening as they grow with those of a scoundrel but all this while she makes not the least impression upon one noble heart and at last perhaps having run on to the end of an uninterrupted race of follies she is cheated into the arms of some vile fortunehunter who quickly lavishes away the remains of that fortune which her extravagance had left and then after the worst usage abandoning her with contempt she sinks into an obscurity that cuts short the thread of her life and leaves no remembrance but on the brittle glass and more faithful bark that ever she had a being  alas alas what a butterfly of a day said miss  an expression she remembered of lady towerss  was poor profusiana  what a sad thing to be so dazzled by worldly grandeur and to have so many admirers and not one real friend  very true my dear and how carefully ought a person of a gay and lively temper to watch over it and what a rock may public places be to a ladys reputation if she be not doubly vigilant in her conduct when she is exposed to the censures and observations of malignant crowds of people many of the worst of whom spare the least those who are most unlike themselves  but then madam said miss would profusiana venture to play at public places will ladies game madam i have heard you say that lords and sharpers but just out of liveries in gaming are upon a foot in every thing save that one has nothing to lose and the other much besides his reputation and will ladies so disgrace their characters and their sex as to pursue this pernicious diversion in public  yes my dear they will too often the mores the pity and dont you remember when we were at bath how i hurried you by some knots of genteel people and you asked what those were doing i told you whisperingly they were gameing and loath i was that my miss goodwin should stop to see some sights to which till she arrived at years of discretion it was not proper to familiarize her eye in some sort acting like the ancient romans who would not assign punishments to certain atrocious crimes because they were such friends to human nature as to suppose it incapable of committing them so i was not for having you while a little girl see those things which i thought when you grew older should be new and shocking to you but now you are so much a woman in discretion that i may tell you any thing  she kissed my hand and made me a fine courtesy  and told me that now she longed to hear of prudentias conduct her name madam said she promises better things than those of her three companions and so it had need for how sad is it to think that out of four ladies of distinction three of them should be naughty and of course unhappy  these two words of course my dear said i were very prettily put in let me kiss you for them since every one that is naughty first or last must be certainly unhappy  far otherwise than what i have related was it with the amiable prudentia like the industrious be she makes up her honeyhoard from every flower bitter as well as sweet for every character is of use to her by which she can improve her own she had the happiness of an aunt who loved her as i do you and of an uncle who doted on her as yours does for alas poor prudentia lost her papa and mamma almost in her infancy in one week but was so happy in her uncle and aunts care as not to miss them in her education and but just to remember their persons by reading by observation and by attention she daily added new advantages to those which her education gave her she saw and pitied the fluttering freedoms and dangerous flights of coquetilla the sullen pride the affectation and stiff reserves which prudiana assumed she penetrated and made it her study to avoid and the gay hazardous conduct extravagant temper and love of tinselld grandeur which were the blemishes of profusianas character she dreaded and shunned she fortifies herself with the excellent examples of the past and present ages and knows how to avoid the faults of the faulty and to imitate the graces of the most perfect she takes into her scheme of that future happiness which she hopes to make her own what are the true excellencies of her sex and endeavors to appropriate to herself the domestic virtues which shall one day make her the crown of some worthy gentlemans earthly happiness and which of course as you prettily said my dear will secure and heighten her own  that noble frankness of disposition that sweet and unaffected openness and simplicity all unconscious of art or design in herself and undreading it from others but yet her prudence ever wakeful and on its guard which shine in all her actions and behavior commend her to the esteem and reverence of all mankind as her humility and affability and a temper uncensorious and ever making the best for the absent person of either sex do to the love of every lady her name indeed is not prostituted on windows nor carved on the barks of trees in public places and walks but it smells sweet to every delighted nostril dwells on every praiseful tongue and is ingraved on every admiring heart she meets with no address but from men of honor and probity the fluttering coxcomb the inveigling parasite the insidious deceiver the mercenary fortunehunter spread no snares for a heart guarded by discretion and prudence as hers is they see that all her amiable virtues are the happy result of an uniform judgment and the effects of her own wisdom founded in an education to which she does the highest credit and at last after several worthy offers enough to perplex any ladys choice she blesses some one happy gentleman more distinguished than the rest for learning good sense and true politeness which is but another word for virtue and honor and shines to her last comfortable hour in all the duties of domestic life as an excellent wife mother mistress friend and christian and so confirms all the expectations of which her maiden life had given such strong and such edifying presages  then folding my dear miss in my arms and kissing her tears of pleasure standing in her pretty eyes who would not said i shun the examples of the coquetillas the prudianas and the profusianas of this world and choose to imitate the character of prudentia  the happy and the happymaking prudentia  o madam madam said the dear creature smothering me with her even clamorous kisses prudentia is you  is you indeed  it can be nobody else  o teach me good god to follow your example and i shall be a second prudentia  indeed i shall  god send you may my beloved miss and may he bless you more if possible than prudentia was blessed  and so my dear lady g you have some of my nursery tales with which relying on your kind allowance and friendship i conclude myself  your affectionate and faithful p b  conclusion although it will be seen and confessed notwithstanding the sheets which compose these two additional volumes might have been easily formed into three how difficult it was to reduce materials so ample within the compass which the editor had assigned them yet being unwilling to deserve a suspicion that the extent of this work was to be measured but by the patience of its readers he thinks proper to conclude in this place subjoining in order to elucidate the whole a brief note of the following facts  that mr b continued after the affair that took date at the masquerade and so happily concluded to be one of the best and most exemplary of men an honor to his country both in his public and private capacity having at the instances of some of his friends in very elevated stations accepted of an honorable employment abroad in the service of the state which he discharged in such a manner as might be expected from his qualifications and knowledge of the world and on his return after an absence of three years resisting all the temptations of ambition devoted himself to his privater duties and joined with his excellent lady in every pious wish of her heart adorning the married life with all the warmth of an elegant tenderness beloved by his tenants respected by his neighbors revered by his children and almost adored by the poor in every county where his estates gave him interest as well for his own bountiful temper as for the charities which he permitted to be dispensed with so liberal a hand by the representative of his heart his dear lady  that she made him the father of seven fine children five sons and two daughters all adorned and accomplished by nature to be the joy and delight of such parents being educated in every respect by the rules of their inimitable mother in that book which she mentions to have written for the revisal and correction of her consort the contents of which may be gathered from her remarks upon mr lockes treatise of education in her letters to mr b and in those to lady g  that miss goodwin at the age of eighteen was married to a young gentleman of fine parts and great sobriety and virtue and that both she and her spouse in every material part of their conduct and in their behavior to one another emulated the great and good examples set them by mr and mrs b  that lord davers dying two years before this marriage his lady went to reside at the hall in lincolnshire the place of her birth that she might enjoy the company and conversation of her excellent sister who for convenience of the chapel and advantage of room and situation had prevailed upon mr b to make that the chief place of his residence and there the noble lady lived long in the strictest friendship with the happy pair a resolved and an honorable relict of her affectionate lord  that the worthy mr andrews and the happy good woman his wife lived together in the calm conscious sweetness set forth in their letters for the space of twelve years at the kentish farm where the good old gentlewoman then died first full of comfort and years her dutiful daughter performing the last pious offices to so beloved and so loving a parent her husband surviving her about a year only  that lady g miss darnford that was after a happy marriage of several years died in childbed of her fourth child to the inexpressible concern of her affectionate consort and of her dear friend mrs b  that mr longman lived to a great age in the worthy family much esteemed by every one having trained up a diligent youth whom he had recommended to ease him in his business and who answering expectation succeeded him in it  that at last dying rich out of his great love and gratitude to the honorable family in whose service he had acquired most of his fortune and in disgust to his nearest relations who had perversely disobliged him he bequeathed to three of them one hundred pounds apiece and left all the rest to his honored principal mr b who as soon as he came to know it being at that time abroad directed his lady to call together the relations of the old gentleman and after touching them to the heart with a just and effectual reproof when she found them filled with due sense of their demerit which had been the cause of their suffering then to divide the whole which had been lest him among them according to their proximity of blood an action worthy of so generous and ennobled a spirit and which procured him the prayers and blessings not only of the benefited but of all who heard of it for it is easy to imagine how cheerfully and how gracefully his benevolent lady discharged a command so well suited to her natural generosity  advertisement there being reason to apprehend from the former attempts of some imitators who supposing the story of pamela a fiction have murdered that excellent lady and mistaken and misrepresented other supposed imaginary characters that persons may not be wanting who will impose new continuations upon the public  it is with a view to some designs of this nature that the editor who is sorry to find himself under a necessity of declaring disagreeable truths and who both hates and would avoid all occasion of offense or reflection gives this public assistance by way of prevention that all the copies of mrs bs observations and writings upon every subject hinted at in the preceding four volumes and in particular those relating to devotion education plays etc are now in one hand only and that if ever they shall be published which at present is a point undetermined it must not be till after a certain event as unwished as deplorable and then solely at the assignment of samuel richardson of salisburycourt fleetstreet the editor of these four volumes of pamela or virtue rewarded
