style  diffuse concise  feeble nervous  dry plain neat elegant flowery having treated at considerable length of the figures of speech of their origin of their nature and of the management of such of them as are important enough to require a particular discussion before finally dismissing this subject i think it incumbent on me to make some observations concerning the proper use of figurative language in general these indeed i have in part already anticipated but as great errors are often committed in this part of style especially by young writers it may be of use that i bring together under one view the most material directions on this head  i begin with repeating an observation formerly made that neither all the beauties nor even the chief beauties of composition depend upon tropes and figures some of the most sublime and most pathetic passages of the most admired authors both in prose and poetry are expressed in the most simple style without any figure at all instances of which i have before given on the other hand a composition may abound with these studied ornaments the language may be artful splendid and highly figured and yet the composition be on the whole frigid and unaffecting not to speak of sentiment and thought which constitute the real and lasting merit of any work if the style be stiff and affected if it be deficient in perspicuity or precision or in ease and neatness all the figures that can be employed will never render it agreeable they may dazzle a vulgar but will never please a judicious eye  in the second place figures in order to be beautiful must always rise naturally from the subject i have shown that all of them are the language either of imagination or of passion some of them suggested by imagination when it is awakened and sprightly such as metaphors and comparisons others by passion or more heated emotion such as personifications and apostrophes of course they are beautiful then only when they are prompted by fancy or by passion they must rise of their own accord they must flow from a mind warmed by the object which it seeks to describe we should never interrupt the course of thought to cast about for figures if they be fought after coolly and fastened on as designed ornaments they will have a miserable effect it is a very erroneous idea which many have of the ornaments of style as if they were things detached from the subject and that could be stuck to it like lace upon a coat this is indeed purpureus late qui splendeat unus aut alter assuitur pannus shreds of purple with broad luster shine sewed on your poem francis  ars poet and it is this false idea which has often brought attention to the beauties of writing into disrepute whereas the real and proper ornaments of style are wrought into the substance of it they flow in the same stream with the current of thought a writer of genius conceives his subject strongly his imagination is filled and impressed with it and pours itself forth in that figurative language which imagination naturally speaks he puts on no emotion which his subject does not raise in him he speaks as he feels but his style will be beautiful because his feelings are lively on occasions when fancy is languid or finds nothing to rouse it we should never attempt to hunt for figures we then work as it is said invita minerva supposing figures invented they will have the appearance of being forced and in this case they had much better be wanted  in the third place even when imagination prompts and the subject naturally gives rise to figures they must however not be employed too frequently in all beauty simplex munditiis is a capital quality nothing derogates more from the weight and dignity of any composition than too great attention to ornament when the ornaments cost labor that labor always appears though they should cost us none still the reader or hearer may be surfeited with them and when they come too thick they give the impression of a light and frothy genius that evaporates in show rather than brings forth what is solid the directions of the ancient critics on this head are full of good sense and deserve careful attention voluptatibus maximis says cicero de orat l iii fastidium finitimum est in rebus omnibus quo hoc minus in oratione miremur in qua vel ex poetis vel oratoribus possumus judicare concinnam ornatam festivam sine intermissione quamvis claris sit coloribus picta vel poesis vel oration non posse in delectatione esse diuturna quare been et praeclare quamvis nobis saepe dicatur belie et festive nimium saepe nolo in all human things disgust borders so nearly on the most lively pleasures that we need not be surprised to find this hold in eloquence from reading either poets or orators we may easily satisfy ourselves that neither a poem nor an oration which without intermission is showy and sparkling can please us long  wherefore though we may wish for the frequent praise of having expressed ourselves well and properly we should not covet repeated applause for being bright and splendid  to the same purpose are the excellent directions with which quinctilian concludes his discourse concerning figures l ix c   ego illud de iis figuris quae vere fiunt adjiciam breviter sicut ornant orationem opportunae positae ita ineptissimas esse cum immodice petuntur sunt qui neglecto rerum pondere et viribus sententiarum si vel inania verba in hos modos depravarunt summos se judicant artifices ideoque non desinunt eas nectere quas sine sententia sectare tam est ridiculum quam quaerere habitum gestumque sine corpore ne hae quidem quae rectae fiunt densandae sunt nimis sciendum imprimis quid quisque postulet locus quid persona quid tempus major enim pars harum figurarum posita est in delectatione ubi vero atrocitate invidia miseratione pugnandum est quis ferat verbis contrapositis et consimilibus and pariter cadentibus irascentem flentem rogantem cum in his rebus cura verborum deroget affectibus fidem et ubicunque ars ostentatur veritas abesse videatur i must add concerning those figures which are proper in themselves that as they beautify a composition when they are seasonably introduced so they deform it greatly if too frequently sought after there are some who neglecting strength of sentiment and weight of matter if they can only force their empty words into a figurative style imagine themselves great writers and therefore continually string together such ornaments which is just as ridiculous where there is no sentiment to support them as to contrive gestures and dresses for what wants a body even those figures which a subject admits must not come too thick we must begin with considering what the occasion the time and the person who speaks render proper for the object aimed at by the greater part of these figures is entertainment but when the subject becomes deeply serious and strong passions are to be moved who can bear the orator who in affected language and balanced phrases endeavors to express wrath commiseration or earnest entreaty on all such occasions a solicitous attention to words weaken passion and when so much art is shown there is suspected to be little sincerity  after these judicious and useful observations i have no more to add on this subject except this admonition  in the fourth place that without a genius for figurative language none should attempt it imagination is a power not to be acquired it must be derived from nature its redundancies we may prune its deviations we may correct its sphere we may enlarge but the faculty itself we cannot create and all efforts toward a metaphorical ornamented style if we are destitute of the proper genius for it will prove awkward and disgusting let us satisfy ourselves however by considering that without this talent or at least with a very small measure of it we may both write and speak to advantage good sense clear ideas perspicuity of language and proper arrangement of words and thoughts will always command attention these are indeed the foundations of all solid merit both in speaking and writing many subjects require nothing more and those which admit of ornament admit it only as a secondary requisite to study and to know our own genius well to follow nature to seek to improve but not to force it are directions which cannot be too often given to those who desire to excel in the liberal arts  when i entered on the consideration of style i observed that words being the copies of our ideas there must always be a very intimate connection between the manner in which every writer employs words and his manner of thinking and that from the peculiarity of thought and expression which belongs to him there is a certain character imprinted on his style which may be denominated his manner commonly expressed by such general terms as strong weak dry simple affected or the like these distinctions carry in general some reference to an authors manner of thinking but refer chiefly to his mode of expression they arise from the whole tenor of his language and comprehend the effect produced by all those parts of style which we have already considered the choice which he makes of single words his arrangement of these in sentences the degree of his precision and his embellishment by means of musical cadence figures or other arts of speech of such general characters of style therefore it remains now to speak as the result of those underparts of which i have hitherto treated  that different subjects require to be treated of in different sorts of style is a position so obvious that i shall not stay to illustrate it every one sees that treatises of philosophy for instance ought not to be composed in the same style with orations every one sees also that different parts of the same composition require a variation in the style and manner in a sermon for instance or any harangue the application or peroration admits more ornament and requires more warmth than the didactic part but what i mean at present to remark is that amidst this variety we still expect to find in the compositions of any one man some degree of uniformity or consistency with himself in manner we expect to find some predominant character of style impressed on all his writings which shall be suited to and shall mark his particular genius and turn of mind the orations in livy differ much in style as they ought to do from the rest of his history the same is the case with those in tacitus yet both in livys orations and in those of tacitus we are able clearly to trace the distinguishing manner of each historian the magnificent fullness of the one and the sententious conciseness of the other the lettres persanes and lesprit de loix are the works of the same author they required very different composition surely and accordingly they differ widely yet still we see the same hand wherever there is real and native genius it gives a determination to one kind of style rather than another where nothing of this appears where there is no marked nor peculiar character in the compositions of any author we are apt to infer not without reason that he is a vulgar and trivial author who writes from imitation and not from the impulse of original genius as the most celebrated painters are known by their hand so the best and most original writers are known and distinguished throughout all their works by their style and peculiar manner this will be found to hold almost without exception  the ancient critics attended to these general characters of style which we are now to consider dionysius of halicarnassus divides them into three kinds and calls them the austere the florid and the middle by the austere he means a style distinguished for strength and firmness with a neglect of smoothness and ornament for examples of which he gives pindar and aeschylus among the poets and thucydides among the prose writers by the florid he means as the name indicates a style ornamented flowing and sweet resting more upon numbers and grace than strength he instances hesiod sappho anacreon euripides and principally isocrates the middle kind is the just mean between these and comprehends the beauties of both in which class he places homer and sophocles among the poets in prose herodotus demosthenes plato and what seems strange aristotle this must be a very wide class indeed which comprehends plato and aristotle under one article as to style de compositione verborum cap     cicero and quinctilian make also a threefold division of style though with respect to different qualities of it in which they are followed by most of the modern writers on rhetoric the simplex tenue or subtle the grave or vehemens and the medium or temperatum genus dicendi but these divisions and the illustrations they give of them are so loose and general that they cannot advance us much in our ideas of style i shall endeavor to be a little more particular in what i have to say on this subject  one of the first and most obvious distinctions of the different kinds of style is what arises from an authors spreading out his thoughts more or less this distinction forms what are called the diffuse and the concise styles a concise writer compresses his thought into the fewest possible words he seeks to employ none but such as are most expressive he lops off as redundant every expression which does not add something material to the sense ornament he does not reject he may be lively and figured but his ornament is intended for the sake of force rather than grace he never gives you the same thought twice he places it in the light which appears to him the most striking but if you do not apprehend it well in that light you need not expect to find it in any other his sentences are arranged with compactness and strength rather than with cadence and harmony the utmost precision is studied in them and they are commonly designed to suggest more to the readers imagination than they directly express  a diffuse writer unfolds his thought fully he places it in a variety of lights and gives the reader every possible assistance for understanding it completely he is not very careful to express it at first in its full strength because he is to repeat the impression and what he wants in strength he proposes to supply by copiousness writers of this character generally love magnificence and amplification their periods naturally run out into some length and having room for ornament of every kind they admit it freely  each of these manners has its peculiar advantages and each becomes faulty when carried to the extreme the extreme of conciseness becomes abrupt and obscure it is apt also to lead into a style too pointed and bordering on the epigrammatic the extreme diffuseness becomes weak and languid and tires the reader however to one or other of these two manners a writer may lean according as his genius prompts him and under the general character of a concise or of a more open and diffuse style may possess much beauty in his composition  for illustrations of these general characters i can only refer to the writers who are examples of them it is not so much from detached passages such as i was wont formerly to quote for instances as from the current of an authors style that we are to collect the idea of a formed manner of writing the two most remarkable examples that i know of conciseness carried as far as propriety will allow perhaps in some cases farther are tacitus the historian and the president montesquieu in lesprit de loix aristotle too holds an eminent rank among didactic writers for his brevity perhaps no writer in the world was ever so frugal of his words as aristotle but this frugality of expression frequently darkens his meaning of a beautiful and magnificent diffuseness cicero is beyond doubt the most illustrious instance that can be given addison also and sir william temple come in some degree under this class  in judging when it is proper to lean to the concise and when to the diffuse manner we must be directed by the nature of the composition discourses that are to be spoken require a more copious style than books that are to be read when the whole meaning must be catched from the mouth of the speaker without the advantage which books afford of pausing at pleasure and reviewing what appears obscure great conciseness is always to be avoided we should never presume too much on the quickness of our hearers understanding but our style ought to be such that the bulk of men can go along with us easily and without effort a flowing copious style therefore is required in all public speakers guarding at the same time against such a degree of diffusion as renders them languid and tiresome which will always prove the case when they inculcate too much and present the same thought under too many different views  in written compositions a certain degree of conciseness possesses great advantages it is more lively keeps up attention makes a brisker and stronger impression and gratifies the mind by supplying more exercise to a readers own thought a sentiment which expressed diffusely will barely be admitted to be just expressed concisely will be admired as spirited description when we want to have it vivid and animated should be in a concise strain this is different from the common opinion most persons being ready to suppose that upon description a writer may dwell more safely than upon other things and that by a full and extended style it is rendered more rich and expressive i apprehend on the contrary that a diffuse manner generally weakens it any redundant words or circumstances encumber the fancy and make the object we present to it appear confused and indistinct accordingly the most masterly describers homer tacitus milton are almost always concise in their descriptions they show us more of an object at one glance than a feeble diffuse writer can show by turning it round and round in a variety of lights the strength and vivacity of description whether in prose or poetry depend much more upon the happy choice of one or two striking circumstances than upon the multiplication of them  addresses to the passions likewise ought to be in the concise rather than the diffuse manner in these it is dangerous to be diffuse because it is very difficult to support proper warmth for any length of time when we become prolix we are always in hazard of cooling the reader the heart too and the fancy run fast and if once we can put them in motion they supply many particulars to greater advantage than an author can display them the case is different when we address ourselves to the understanding as in all matters of reasoning explication and instruction there i would prefer a more free and diffuse manner when you are to strike the fancy or to move the heart be concise when you are to inform the understanding which moves more slowly and requires the assistance of a guide it is better to be full historical narration may be beautiful either in a concise or diffuse manner according to the writers genius livy and herodotus are diffuse thucydides and sallust are succinct yet all of them agreeable  i observed that a diffuse style inclines most to long periods and a concise writer it is certain will often employ short sentences it is not however to be inferred from this that long or short sentences are fully characteristical of the one or the other manner it is very possible for one to compose always in short sentences and to be withal extremely diffuse if a small measure of sentiment be spread through many of these sentences seneca is a remarkable example by the shortness and quaintness of his sentences he may appear at first view very concise yet he is far from being so he transfigures the same thought into many different forms he makes it pass for a new one only by giving it a new turn so also most of the french writers compose in short sentences though their style in general is not concise commonly less so than the bulk of english writers whose sentences are much longer a french author breaks down into two or three sentences that portion of thought which an english author crowds into one the direct effect of short sentences is to render the style brisk and lively but not always concise by the quick successive impulses which they make on the mind they keep it awake and give to composition more of a spirited character long periods like lord clarendons are grave and stately but like all grave things they are in hazard of becoming dull an intermixture of both long and short ones is requisite when we would support solemnity together with vivacity leaning more to the one or the other according as propriety requires that the solemn or the sprightly should be predominant in our composition but of long and short sentences i had occasion formerly to treat under the head of the construction of periods  the nervous and the feeble are generally held to be characters of style of the same import with the concise and the diffuse they do indeed very often coincide diffuse writers have for the most part some degree of feebleness and nervous writers will generally be inclined to a concise expression this however does not always hold and there are instances of writers who in the midst of a full and ample style have maintained a great degree of strength livy is an example and in the english language dr barrow barrows style has many faults it is unequal incorrect and redundant but withal for force and expressiveness uncommonly distinguished on every subject he multiplies words with an overflowing copiousness but it is always a torrent of strong ideas and significant expressions which he pours forth indeed the foundations of a nervous or a weak style are laid in an authors manner of thinking if he conceives an object strongly he will express it with energy but if he has only an indistinct view of his subject if his ideas be loose and wavering if his genius be such or at the time of his writing so carelessly exerted that he has no firm hold of the conception which he would communicate to us the marks of this will clearly appear in his style several unmeaning words and loose epithets will be found his expressions will be vague and general his arrangement indistinct and feeble we shall conceive somewhat of his meaning but our conception will be faint whereas a nervous writer whether he employs an extended or a concise style gives us always a strong impression of his meaning his mind is full of his subject and his words are all expressive every phrase and every figure which he uses tends to render the picture which he would set before us more lively and complete  i observed under the head of diffuse and concise style that an author might lean either to the one or to the other and yet be beautiful this is not the case with respect to the nervous and the feeble every author in every composition ought to study to express himself with some strength and in proportion as he approaches to the feeble he becomes a bad writer in all kinds of writing however the same degree of strength is not demanded but the more grave and weighty any composition is the more should a character of strength predominate in the style hence in history philosophy and solemn discourses it is expected most one of the most complete models of a nervous style is demosthenes in his orations  as every good quality in style has an extreme when pursued to which it becomes faulty this holds of the nervous style as well as others too great a study of strength to the neglect of the other qualities of style is found to betray writers into a harsh manner harshness arises from unusual words from forced inversions in the construction of a sentence and too much neglect of smoothness and ease this is reckoned the fault of some of our earliest classics in the english language such as sir walter raleigh sir francis bacon hooker chillingworth milton in his prose works harrington cudworth and other writers of considerable note in the days of queen elizabeth james i and charles i these writers had nerves and strength in a high degree and are to this day eminent for that quality in style but the language in their hands was exceedingly different from what it is now and was indeed entirely formed upon the idiom and construction of the latin in the arrangement of sentences hooker for instance begins the preface to his celebrated work of ecclesiastical polity with the following sentence though for no other cause yet for this that posterity may know we have not loosely through silence permitted things to pass away as in dream there shall be for mens information extant this much concerning the present state of the church of god established amongst us and their careful endeavors which would have upheld the same such a sentence now sounds harsh in our ears yet some advantages certainly attended this sort of style and whether we have gained or lost upon the whole by departing from it may bear a question by the freedom of arrangement which it permitted it rendered the language susceptible of more strength of more variety of collocation and more harmony of period but however this be such a style is now obsolete and no modern writer could adopt it without the censure of harshness and affectation the present form which the language has assumed has in some measure sacrificed the study of strength to that of perspicutiy and ease our arrangement of words has become less forcible perhaps but more plain and natural and this is now understood to be the genius of our language  the restoration of king charles ii seems to be the era of the formation of our present style lord clarendon was one of the first who laid aside those frequent inversions which prevailed among writers of the former age after him sir william temple polished the language still more but the author who by the number and reputation of his works formed it more than any one into its present state is dryden dryden began to write at the restoration and continued long an author both in poetry and prose he had made the language his study and though he wrote hastily and often incorrectly and his style is not free from faults yet there is a richness in his diction a copiousness ease and variety in his expression which has not been surpassed by any who have come after him dr johnson in his life of dryden gives the following character of his prose style his prefaces have not the formality of a settled style in which the first half of the sentence betrays the other the clauses are never balanced nor the periods modelled every word seems to drop by chance though it falls into its proper place nothing is cold or languid the whole is airy animated and vigorous what is little is gay what is great is splendid though all is easy nothing is feeble though all seems careless there is nothing harsh and though since his earlier works more than a century has passed they have nothing yet uncouth or obsolete  since his time considerable attention has been paid to purity and elegance of style but it is elegance rather than strength that forms the distinguishing quality of most of the good english writers some of them compose in a more manly and nervous manner than others but whether it be from the genius of our language or from whatever other cause it appears to me that we are far from the strength of several of the greek and roman authors  hitherto we have considered style under those characters that respect its expressiveness of an authors meaning let us now proceed to consider it in another view with respect to the degree of ornament employed to beautify it here the style of different authors seems to raise in the following gradation a dry a plain a neat an elegant a flowery manner of each of these in their order  first a dry manner this excludes all ornament of every kind content with being understood it has not the least aim to please either the fancy or the ear this is tolerable only in pure didactic writing and even there to make us bear it great weight and solidity of matter is requisite and entire perspicuity of language aristotle is the thorough example of a dry style never perhaps was there any author who adhered so rigidly to the strictness of a didactic manner throughout all his writings and conveyed so much instruction without the least approach to ornament with the most profound genius and extensive views he writes like a pure intelligence who addresses himself solely to the understanding without making any use of the channel of the imagination but this is a manner which deserves not to be imitated for although the goodness of the matter may compensate the dryness or harshness of the style yet is that dryness a considerable defect as it fatigues attention and conveys our sentiments with disadvantage to the reader or hearer  a plain style rises one degree above a dry one a writer of this character employs very little ornament of any kind and rests almost entirely upon his sense but if he is at no pains to engage us by the employment of figures musical arrangement or any other art of writing he studies however to avoid disgusting us like a dry and a harsh writer besides perspicuity he pursues propriety purity and precision in his language which form one degree and no inconsiderable one of beauty liveliness too and force may be consistent with a very plain style and therefore such an author if his sentiments be good may be abundantly agreeable the difference between a dry and plain writer is that the former is incapable of ornament and seems not to know what it is the latter seeks not after it he gives us his meaning in good language distinct and pure any further ornament he gives himself no trouble about either because he thinks it unnecessary to his subject or because his genius does not lead him to delight in it or because it leads him to despise it on this head of the general characters of style particularly the plain and the simple and the characters of those english authors who are classed under them in this and the following lecture several ideas have been taken from a manuscript treatise on rhetoric part of which was shown to me many years ago by the learned and ingenious author dr adam smith and which it is hoped will be given by him to the public   this last was the case with dean swift who may be placed at the head of those that have employed the plain style few writers have discovered more capacity he treats every subject which he handles whether serious or ludicrous in a masterly manner he knew almost beyond any man the purity the extent the precision of the english language and therefore to such as wish to attain a pure and correct style he is one of the most useful models but we must not look for much ornament and grace in his language his haughty and morose genius made him despise any embellishment of this kind as beneath his dignity he delivers his sentiments in a plain downright positive manner like one who is sure he is in the right and is very indifferent whether you be pleased or not his sentences are commonly negligently arranged distinctly enough as to the sense but without any regard to smoothness of sound often without much regard to compactness or elegance if a metaphor or any other figure chanced to render his satire more poignant he would perhaps vouchsafe to adopt it when it came in his way but if it tended only to embellish and illustrate he would rather throw it aside hence in his serious pieces his style often borders upon the dry and unpleasing in his humourous ones the plainness of his manner gives his wit a singular edge and sets it off to the highest advantage there is no froth nor affectation in it it flows without any studied preparation and while he hardly appears to smile himself he makes his reader laugh heartily to a writer of such a genius as dean swift the plain style was most admirably fitted among our philosophical writers mr lock comes under this class perspicuous and pure but almost without any ornament whatever in works which admit or require ever so much ornament there are parts where the plain manner ought to predominate but we must remember that when this is the character which a writer affects throughout his whole composition great weight of matter and great force of sentiment are required in order to keep up the readers attention and prevent him from tiring of the author  what is called a neat style comes next in order and here we are got into the region of ornament but that ornament not of the highest or most sparkling kind a writer of this character shows that he does not despise the beauty of language it is an object of his attention but his attention is shown in the choice of his words and in a graceful collocation of them rather than in any high efforts of imagination or eloquence his sentences are always clean and free from the encumbrance of superfluous words of a moderate length rather inclining to brevity than a swelling structure closing with propriety without any tails or adjections dragging after the proper close his cadence is varied but not of the studied musical kind his figures if he uses any are short and correct rather than bold and glowing such a style as this may be attained by a writer who has no great powers of fancy or genius by industry merely and careful attention to the rules of writing and it is a style always agreeable it imprints a character of moderate elevation on our composition and carries a decent degree of ornament which is not unsuitable to any subject whatever a familiar letter or a law paper on the driest subject may be written with neatness and a sermon or a philosophical treatise in a neat style will be read with pleasure  an elegant style is a character expressing a higher degree of ornament than a neat one and indeed is the term usually applied to style when possessing all the virtues of ornament without any of its excesses or defects from what has been formerly delivered it will easily be understood that complete elegance implies great perspicuity and propriety purity in the choice of words and care and dexterity in their harmonious and happy arrangement it implies farther the grace and beauty of imagination spread over style as far as the subject admits it and all the illustration which figurative language adds when properly employed in a word an elegant writer is one who pleases the fancy and the ear while he informs the understanding and who gives us his ideas clothed with all the beauty of expression but not overcharged with any of its misplaced finery in this class therefore we place only the first rate writers in the language such as addison dryden pope temple bolingbroke atterbury and a few more writers who differ widely from one another in many of the attributes of style but whom we now class together under the denomination of elegant as in the scale of ornament possessing nearly the same place  when the ornaments applied to style are too rich and gaudy in proportion to the subject when they return upon us too fast and strike us either with a dazzling luster or a false brilliancy this forms what is called a florid style a term commonly used to signify the excess of ornament in a young composer this is very pardonable perhaps it is even a promising symptom in young people that their style should incline to the florid and luxuriant volo se efferat in adolescente faecunditas says quinctilian multum inde decoquent anni multum ratio limabit aliquid velut usu ipso deteretur sit modo unde excidi poffit quid et exculpi  audeat haec aetas plura et inveniat et inventis gaudeat sint licet illa non satis interim sicca et severa facile remedium est ubertatis sterilia nullo labor vincuntur in youth i wish to see luxuriancy of fancy appear much of it will be diminished by years much will be corrected by ripening judgment some of it by the mere practice of composition will be worn away let there be only sufficient matter at first that can hear some pruning and lopping off at this time of life let genius be bold and inventive and pride itself in its efforts though these should not as yet be correct luxuriancy can easily be cured but for barrenness there is no remedy  but although the florid style may be allowed to youth in their first essays it must not receive the same indulgence from writers of maturer years it is to be expected that judgment as it ripens should chasten imagination and reject as juvenile all such ornaments as are redundant unsuitable to the subject or not conducive to illustrate it nothing can be more contemptible than that tinsel splendour of language which some writers perpetually affect it were well if this could be ascribed to the real overflowing of a rich imagination we should then have something to amuse us at least if we found little to instruct us but the worst is that with those frothy writers it is a luxuriancy of words not of fancy we see a labored attempt to rise to a splendor of composition of which they have formed to themselves some loose idea but having no strength of genius for attaining it they endeavor to supply the defect by poetical words by cold exclamations by common place figures and every thing that has the appearance of pomp and magnificence it has escaped these writers that sobriety in ornament is one great secret for rendering it pleasing and that without a foundation of good sense and solid thought the most florid style is but a childish imposition on the public the public however are but too apt to be so imposed on at least the mob of readers who are very ready to be caught at first with whatever is dazzling and gaudy  i cannot help thinking that it reflects more honor on the religious turn and good dispositions of the present age than on the public taste that mr harveys meditations have had so great a currency the pious and benevolent heart which is always displayed in them and the lively fancy which on some occasions appears justly merited applause but the perpetual glitter of expression the swollen imagery and strained description which abound in them are ornaments of a false kind i would therefore advise students of oratory to imitate mr harveys piety rather than his style and in all compositions of a serious kind to turn their attention as mr pope says from sounds to things from fancy to the heart admonitions of this kind i have already had occasion to give and may hereafter repeat them as i conceive nothing more incumbent on me in this course of lectures than to take every opportunity of cautioning my readers against the affected and frivolous use of ornament and instead of that slight and superficial taste in writing which i apprehend to be at present too fashionable to introduce as far as my endeavors can avail a taste for more solid thought and more manly simplicity in style  lecture xix general characters of style  simple affected vehement  directions for forming a proper style having entered in the last lecture on the consideration of the general characters of style i treated of the concise and diffuse the nervous and feeble manner i considered style also with relation to the different degrees of ornament employed to beautify it in which view the manner of different authors rises according to the following gradation dry plain neat elegant flowery  i am next to treat of style under another character one of great importance in writing and which requires to be accurately examined that of simplicity or a natural style as distinguished from affectation simplicity applied to writing is a term very frequently used but like many other critical terms often used loosely and without precision this has been owing chiefly to the different meanings given to the word simplicity which therefore it will be necessary here to distinguish and to show in what sense it is a proper attribute of style we may remark four different acceptations in which it is taken  the first is simplicity of composition as opposed to too great a variety of parts horaces precept refers to this denique sit quod vis simplex duntaxat et unum then learn the wandering humor to control and keep one equal renor through the whole francis    this is the simplicity of plan in a tragedy as distinguished from double plots and crowded incidents the simplicity of the iliad or aeneid in opposition to the digressions of lucan and the scattered tales of ariosto the simplicity of grecian architecture in opposition to the irregular variety of the gothic in this sense simplicity is the same with unity  the second sense is simplicity of thought as opposed to refinement simple thoughts are what arise naturally what the occasion or the subject suggest unsought and what when once suggested are easily apprehended by all refinement in writing expresses a less natural and obvious train of thought and which it required a peculiar turn of genius to pursue within certain bounds very beautiful but when carried too far approaching to intricacy and hurting us by the appearance of being recherche or far sought thus we would naturally say that mr parnell is a poet of far greater simplicity in his turn of thought than mr cowley ciceros thoughts on moral subjects are natural senecas too refined and labored in these two senses of simplicity when it is opposed either to variety of parts or to refinement of thought it has no proper relation to style  there is a third sense of simplicity in which it has respect to style and stands opposed to too much ornament or pomp of language as when we say mr lock is a simple mr harvey a florid writer and it is in this sense that the  simplex the  tenue or  subtle genus dicendi is understood by cicero and quinctilian the simple style in this sense coincides with the plain or the neat style which i before mentioned and therefore requires no farther illustration  but there is a fourth sense of simplicity also respecting style but not respecting the degree of ornament employed so much as the easy and natural manner in which our language expresses our thoughts this is quite different from the former sense of the word just now mentioned in which simplicity was equivalent to plainness whereas in this sense it is compatible with the highest ornament homer for instance possesses this simplicity in the greatest perfection and yet no writer has more ornament and beauty this simplicity which is what we are now to consider stands opposed not to ornament but to affectation of ornament or appearance of labor about our style and it is a distinguishing excellency in writing  a writer of simplicity expresses himself in such a manner that every one thinks he could have written in the same way horace describes it  ut sibi quivis speret idem sudet multum frustraque laboret ausus idem from wellknown tales such fictions would i raise as all might hope to imitate with ease yet while they strive the same success to gain should find their labors and their hopes in vain francis  there are no marks of art in his expression it seems the very language of nature you see in the style not the writer and his labor but the man in his own natural character he may be rich in his expression he may be full of figures and of fancy but these flow from him without effort and he appears to write in this manner not because he has studied it but because it is the manner of expression most natural to him a certain degree of negligence also is not inconsistent with this character of style and even not ungraceful in it for too minute an attention to words is foreign to it habeat ille says cicero orat no    molle quiddam et quod indicet non ingratam negligentiam hominis de re magis quam de verbo laborantis let this style have a certain softness and ease which shall characterise a negligence not unpleasing in an author who appears to be more solicitous about the thought than the expression  this is the great advantage of simplicity of style that like simplicity of manners it shows us a mans sentiments and turn of mind laid open without disguise more studied and artificial manners of writing however beautiful have always this disadvantage that they exhibit an author in form like a man at court where the splendor of dress and the ceremonial of behavior conceal those peculiarities which distinguish one man from another but reading an author of simplicity is like conversing with a person of distinction at home and with ease where we find natural manners and a marked character  the highest degree of this simplicity is expressed by a french term to which we have none that fully answers in our language naivete it is not easy to give a precise idea of the import of this word it always expresses a discovery of character i believe the best account of it is given by a french critic m marmontel who explains it thus that sort of amiable ingenuity or undisguised openness which seems to give us some degree of superiority over the person who shows it a certain infantine simplicity which we love in our hearts but which displays some features of the character that we think we could have art enough to hide and which therefore always leads us to smile at the person who discovers this character la fontaine in his fables is given as the great example of such naivete this however is to be understood as descriptive of a particucular species only of simplicity  with respect to simplicity in general we may remark that the ancient original writers are always the most eminent for it this happens from a plain reason that they wrote from the dictates of natural genius and were not formed upon the labors and writings of others which is always in hazard of producing affectation hence among the greek writers we have more models of a beautiful simplicity than among the roman homer hesiod anacreon theocritus herodotus and xenophon are all distinguished for it among the romans also we have some writers of this character particularly terence lucretius phoedrus and julius caesar the following passage of terences andria is a beautiful instance of simplicity of manner in description funus interim procedit sequimur ad sepulchrum venimus in ignem imposita est fletur interea haec soror quam dixi ad flammam accessit imprudentius satis cum periculo ibi tum exanimatus pamphilus been dissimulatum amorem and celatum indicat occurrit praeceps mulierem ab igne retrahit mea glycerium inquit quid agis cur te is perditum tum illa ut consuetum facile amorem cerneres rejecit se in eum flens quam familiariter meanwhile the funeral proceeds we follow come to the sepulcher the bodys placed upon the pile lamented whereupon this sister i was speaking of all wild ran to the flames with peril of her life there there the frighted pamphilus betrays his well dissembled and long hidden love runs up and takes her round the waist and cries oh my glycerium what is it you do why why endeavor to destroy yourself then she in such a manner that you thence might easily perceive their long long love threw herself back into his arms and wept oh how familiarly colman  act i sc   all the words here are remarkably happy and elegant and convey a most lively picture of the scene described while at the same time the style appears wholly artless and unlaboured let us next consider some english writers who come under this class  simplicity is the great beauty of archbishop tillotsons manner tillotson has long been admired as an eloquent writer and a model for preaching but his eloquence if we can call it such has been often misunderstood for if we include in the idea of eloquence vehemence and strength picturesque description glowing figures or correct arrangement of sentences in all these parts of oratory the archbishop is exceedingly deficient his style is always pure indeed and perspicuous but careless and remiss too often feeble and languid little beauty in the construction of his sentences which are frequently suffered to drag unharmoniousy seldom any attempt toward strength or sublimity but notwithstanding these defects such a constant vein of good sense and piety runs through his works such an earnest and serious manner and so much useful instruction conveyed in a style so pure natural and unaffected as will justly recommend him to high regard as long as the english language remains not indeed as a model of the highest eloquence but as a simple and amiable writer whose manner is strongly expressive of great goodness and worth i observed before that simplicity of manner may be consistent with some degree of negligence in style and it is only the beauty of that simplicity which makes the negligence of such writers seem graceful but as appears in the archbishop negligence may sometimes be carried so far as to impair the beauty of simplicity and make it border on a flat and languid manner  sir william temple is another remarkable writer in the style of simplicity in point of ornament and correctness he rises a degree above tillotson though for correctness he is not in the highest rank all is easy and flowing in him he is exceedingly harmonious smoothness and what may be called amaenity are the distinguishing characters of his manner relaxing sometimes as such a manner will naturally do into a prolix and remiss style no writer whatever has stamped upon his style a more lively impression of his own character in reading his works we seem engaged in conversation with him we become thoroughly acquainted with him not merely as an author but as a man and contract a friendship for him he may be classed as standing in the middle between a negligent simplicity and the highest degree of ornament which this character of style admits  of the latter of these the highest most correct and ornamented degree of the simple manner mr addison is beyond doubt in the english language the most perfect example and therefore though not without some faults he is on the whole the safest model for imitation and the freest from considerable defects which the language affords perspicuous and pure he is in the highest degree his precision indeed not very great yet nearly as great as the subjects which he treats of require the construction of his sentences easy agreeable and commonly very musical carrying a character of smoothness more than of strength in figurative language he is rich particularly in similies and metaphors which are so employed as to render his style splendid without being gaudy there is not the least affectation in his manner we see no marks of labor nothing forced or constrained but great elegance joined with great ease and simplicity he is in particular distinguished by a character of modesty and of politeness which appears in all his writings no author has a more popular and insinuating manner and the great regard which he every where shows for virtue and religion recommends him highly if he fails in any thing it is in want of strength and precision which renders his manner though perfectly suited to such essays as he writes in the spectator not altogether a proper model for any of the higher and more elaborate kinds of composition though the public have ever done much justice to his merit yet the nature of his merit has not always been seen in its true light for though his poetry be elegant he certainly bears a higher rank among the prose writers than he is entitled to among the poets and in prose his humor is of a much higher and more original strain than his philosophy the character of sir roger de coverley discovers more genius than the critique on milton  such authors as those whose characters i have been giving one never tires of reading there is nothing in their manner that strains or fatigues our thoughts we are pleased without being dazzled by their luster so powerful is the charm of simplicity in an author of real genius that it attones for many defects and reconciles us to many a careless expression hence in all the most excellent authors both in prose and verse the simple and natural manner may be always remarked although other beauties being predominant this form not their peculiar and distinguishing character thus milton is simple in the midst of all his grandeur and demosthenes in the midst of all his vehemence to grave and solemn writings simplicity of manner adds the more venerable air accordingly this has often been remarked as the prevailing character throughout all the sacred scriptures and indeed no other character of style was so much suited to the dignity of inspiration  of authors who notwithstanding many excellencies have rendered their style much less beautiful by want of simplicity i cannot give a more remarkable example than lord shaftsbury this is an author on whom i have made observations several times before and shall now take leave of him with giving his general character under this head considerable merit doubtless he has his works might be read with profit for the moral philosophy which they contain had he not filled them with so many oblique and invidious insinuations against the christian religion thrown out too with so much spleen and satire as do no honor to his memory either as an author or a man his language has many beauties it is firm and supported in an uncommon degree it is rich and musical no english author as i formerly showed has attended so much to the regular construction of his sentences both with respect to propriety and with respect to cadence all this gives so much elegance and pomp to his language that there is no wonder it should have been sometimes highly admired it is greatly hurt however by perpetual stiffness and affectation this is its capital fault his lordship can express nothing with simplicity he seems to have considered it as vulgar and beneath the dignity of a man of quality to speak like other men hence he is ever in buskins full of circumlocutions and artificial elegance in every sentence we see the marks of labor and art nothing of that ease which expresses a sentiment coming natural and warm from the heart of figures and ornament of every kind he is exceedingly fond sometimes happy in them but his fondness for them is too visible and having once laid hold of some metaphor or allusion that pleased him he knows not how to part with it what is most wonderful he was a professed admirer of simplicity is always extolling it in the ancients and censuring the moderns for the want of it though he departs from it himself as far as any one modern whatever lord shaftsbury possessed delicacy and refinement of taste to a degree that we may call excessive and sickly but he had little warmth of passion few strong or vigorous feelings and the coldness of his character led him to that artificial and stately manner which appears in his writings he was fonder of nothing than of wit and raillery but he is far from being happy in it he attempts it often but always aukwardly he is stiff even in his pleasantry and laughs in form like an author and not like a man it may perhaps be not unworthy of being mentioned that the first edition of his enquiry into virtue was published surreptitiously i believe in a separate form in the year      and is sometimes to be met with by comparing which with the corrected edition of the same treatise as it now stands among his works we see one of the most curious and useful examples that i know of what is called limae labor the art of polishing language breaking long sentences and working up an imperfect draught into a highly finished performance   from the account which i have given of lord shaftsburys manner it may easily be imagined that he would mislead many who blindly admired him nothing is more dangerous to the tribe of imitators than an author who with many imposing beauties has also some very considerable blemishes this is fully exemplified in mr blackwall of aberdeen the author of the life of homer the letters on mythology and the court of augustus a writer of considerable learning and of ingenuity also but infected with an extravagant love of an artificial style and of that parade of language which distinguishes the shaftsburean manner  having now said so much to recommend simplicity or the easy and natural manner of writing and having pointed out the defects of an opposite manner in order to prevent mistakes on this subject it is necessary for me to observe that it is very possible for an author to write simply and yet not beautifully one may be free from affectation and not have merit the beautiful simplicity supposes an author to possess real genius to write with solidity purity and liveliness of imagination in this case the simplicity or unaffectedness of his manner is the crowning ornament it heightens every other beauty it is the dress of nature without which all beauties are imperfect but if mere unaffectedness were sufficient to constitute the beauty of style weak trifling and dull writers might often lay claim to this beauty and accordingly we frequently meet with pretended critics who extol the dullest writers on account of what they call the chaste simplicity of their manner which in truth is no other than the absence of every ornament through the mere want of genius and imagination we must distinguish therefore between that simplicity which accompanies true genius and which is perfectly compatible with every proper ornament of style and that which is no other than a careless and slovenly manner indeed the distinction is easily made from the effect produced the one never fails to interest the reader the other is insipid and tiresome  i proceed to mention one other manner or character of style different from any that i have yet spoken of which may be distinguished by the name of the vehement this always implies strength and is not by any means inconsistent with simplicity but in its predominant character is distinguishable from either the strong or the simple manner it has a peculiar ardour it is a glowing style the language of a man whose imagination and passions are heated and strongly affected by what he writes who is therefore negligent of lesser graces but pours himself forth with the rapidity and fullness of a torrent it belongs to the higher kinds of oratory and indeed is rather expected from a man who is speaking than from one who is writing in his closet the orations of demosthenes furnish the full and perfect example of this species of style  among english writers the one who has most of this character though mixed indeed with several defects is lord bolingbroke bolingbroke was formed by nature to be a factious leader the demagogue of a popular assembly accordingly the style that runs through all his political writings is that of one declaiming with heat rather than writing with deliberation he abounds in rhetorical figures and pours himself forth with great impetuosity he is copious to a fault places the same thought before us in many different views but generally with life and ardour he is bold rather than correct a torrent that flows strong but often muddy his sentences are varied as to length and shortness inclining however most to long periods sometimes including parentheses and frequently crowding and heaping a multitude of things upon one another as naturally happens in the warmth of speaking in the choice of his words there is great felicity and precision in exact construction of sentences he is much inferior to lord shaftsbury but greatly superior to him in life and ease upon the whole his merit as a writer would have been very considerable if his matter had equalled his style but whilst we find many things to commend in the latter in the former as i before remarked we can hardly find any thing to commend in his reasonings for most part he is flimsy and false in his political writings factions in what he calls his philosophical ones irreligious and sophistical in the highest degree  i shall insist no longer on the different manners of writers or the general characters of style some other besides those which i have mentioned might be pointed out but i am sensible that it is very difficult to separate such general considerations of the style of authors from their peculiar turn of sentiment which it is not my business at present to criticize conceited writers for instance discover their spirit so much in their composition that it imprints on their style a character of pertness though i confess it is difficult to say whether this can be classed among the attributes of style or rather is to be ascribed entirely to the thought in whatever class we rank it all appearances of it ought to be avoided with care as a most disgusting blemish in writing under those general heads which i have considered i have taken an opportunity of giving the character of many of the eminent classics in the english language  from what i have said on this subject it may be inferred that to determine among all those different manners of writing what is precisely the best is neither easy nor necessary style is a field that admits of great latitude its qualities in different authors may be very different and yet in them all beautiful room must be left here for genius for that particular determination which every one receives from nature to one manner of expression more than another some general qualities indeed there are of such importance as should always in every kind of composition be kept in view and some defects we should always study to avoid an ostentatious a feeble a harsh or an obscure style for instance are always faults and perspicuity strength neatness and simplicity are beauties to be always aimed at but as to the mixture of all or the degree of predominancy of any one of these good qualities for forming our peculiar distinguishing manner no precise rules can be given nor will i venture to point out any one model as absolutely perfect  it will be more to the purpose that i conclude these dissertations upon style with a few directions concerning the proper method of attaining a good style in general leaving the particular character of that style to be either formed by the subject on which we write or prompted by the bent of genius  the first direction which i give for this purpose is to study clear ideas on the subject concerning which we are to write or speak this is a direction which may at first appear to have small relation to style its relation to it however is extremely close the foundation of all good style is good sense accompanied with a lively imagination the style and thoughts of a writer are so intimately connected that as i have several times hinted it is frequently hard to distinguish them wherever the impressions of things upon our minds are faint and indistinct or perplexed and confused our style in treating of such things will infallibly be so too whereas what we conceive clearly and feel strongly we will naturally express with clearness and with strength this then we may be assured is a capital rule as to style to think closely of the subject till we have attained a full and distinct view of the matter which we are to clothe in words till we become warm and interested in it then and not till then shall we find expression begin to flow generally speaking the best and most proper expressions are those which a clear view of the subject suggests without much labor or enquiry after them this is quinctilians observation lib viii c   plerumque optima verba rebus cohaerent et cernuntur suo lumine at nos quaerimus illa tanquam lateant scque subducant ita nunquam putamus verba essa circa id de quo dicendum est fed ex aliis locis petimus et inventis vim afferimus the most proper words for the most part adhere to the thoughts which are to be expressed by them and may be discovered as by their own light but we hunt after them as if they were hidden and only to be found in a corner hence instead of conceiving the words to lie near the subject we go in quest of them to some other quarter and endeavor to give force to the expressions we have found out   in the second place in order to form a good style the frequent practice of composing is indispensibly necessary many rules concerning style i have delivered but no rules will answer the end without exercise and habit at the same time it is not every sort of composing that will improve style this is so far from being the case that by frequent careless and hasty composition we shall acquire certainly a very bad style we shall have more trouble afterward in unlearning faults and correcting negligences than if we had not been accustomed to composition at all in the beginning therefore we ought to write slowly and with much care let the facility and speed of writing be the fruit of longer practice moram et solicitudinem says quinctilian with the greatest reason l x c   initiis impero nam primum hoc constituendum ac obtinendum est ut quam optime scribamus celeritatem dabit consuetudo paulatim res facilius se ostendent verba respondebunt compositio prosequetur cuncta denique ut in famili been instituta in officio erunt summa haec est rei cito scribendo non sit ut been scribatur been scribendo sit ut cito i enjoin that such as are beginning the practice of composition write slowly and with anxious deliberation their great object at first should be to write as well as possible practice will enable them to write speedily by degrees matter will offer itself more readily words will be at hand composition will flow every thing as in the arrangement of a wellordered family will present itself in its proper place the sum of the whole is this by hasty composition we shall never acquire the art of composing well by writing well we shall come to write speedily   we must observe however that there may be an extreme in too great and anxious a care about words we must not retard the course of thought nor cool the heat of imagination by pausing too long on every word we employ there is on certain occasions a glow of composition which should be kept up if we hope to express ourselves happily though at the expense of allowing some inadvertencies to pass a more severe examination of these must be left to be the work of correction for if the practice of composition be useful the laborious work of correcting is no less so is indeed absolutely necessary to our reaping any benefit from the habit of composition what we have written should be laid by for some little time till the ardour of composition be past till the fondness for the expressions we have used be worn off and the expressions themselves be forgotten and then reviewing our work with a cool and critical eye as if it were the performance of another we shall discern many imperfections which at first escaped us then is the season for pruning redundancies for weighing the arrangement of sentences for attending to the juncture and connecting particles and bringing style into a regular correct and supported form this  limae labor must be submitted to by all who would communicate their thoughts with proper advantage to others and some practice in it will soon sharpen their eye to the most necessary objects of attention and render it a much more easy and practicable work than might atfirst be imagined  in the third place with respect to the assistance that is to be gained from the writings of others it is obvious that we ought to render ourselves well acquainted with the style of the best authors this is requisite both in order to form a just taste in style and to supply us with a full stock of words on every subject in reading authors with a view to style attention should be given to the peculiarities of their different manners and in this and former lectures i have endeavored to suggest several things that may be useful in this view i know no exercise that will be found more useful for acquiring a proper style than to translate some passage from an eminent english author into our own words what i mean is to take for instance some page of one of mr addisons spectators and read it carefully over two or three times till we have got a firm hold of the thoughts contained in it then to lay aside the book to attempt to write out the passage from memory in the best way we can and having done so next to open the book and compare what we have written with the style of the author such an exercise will by comparison show us where the defects of our style lie will lead us to the proper attentions for rectifying them and among the different ways in which the same thought may be expressed will make us perceive that which is the most beautiful but  in the fourth place i must caution at the same time against a servile imitation of any one author whatever this is always dangerous it hampers genius it is likely to produce a stiff manner and those who are given to close imitation generally imitate an authors faults as well as his beauties no man will ever become a good writer or speaker who has not some degree of confidence to follow his own genius we ought to beware in particular of adopting any authors noted phrases or transcribing passages from him such a habit will prove fatal to all genuine composition infinitely better it is to have something that is our own though of moderate beauty than to affect to shine in borrowed ornaments which will at last betray the utter poverty of our genius on these heads of composing correcting reading and imitating i advise every student of oratory to consult what quinctilian has delivered in the xth book of his institutions where he will find a variety of excellent observations and directions that well deserve attention  in the fifth place it is an obvious but material rule with respect to style that we always study to adapt it to the subject and also to the capacity of our hearers if we are to speak in public nothing merits the name of eloquent or beautiful which is not suited to the occasion and to the persons to whom it is addressed it is to the last degree awkward and absurd to attempt a poetical florid style on occasions when it should be our business only to argue and reason or to speak with elaborate pomp of expression before persons who comprehend nothing of it and who can only stare at our unseasonable magnificence these are defects not so much in point of style as what is much worse in point of common sense when we begin to write or speak we ought previously to fix in our minds a clear conception of the end to be aimed at to keep this steadily in our view and to suit our style to it if we do not sacrifice to this great object every illtimed ornament that may occur to our fancy we are unpardonable and though children and fools may admire men of sense will laugh at us and our style  in the last place i cannot conclude the subject without this admonition that in any case and on any occasion attention to style must not engross us so much as to detract from a higher degree of attention to the thoughts curam verborum says the great roman critic rerum volo esse solicitudinem to your expression be attentive but about your matter be solicitous  a direction the more necessary that the present taste of the age in writing seems to lean more to style than to thought it is much easier to dress up trivial and common sentiments with some beauty of expression than to afford a fund of vigorous ingenious and useful thoughts the latter requires true genius the former may be attained by industry with the help of very superficial parts hence we find so many writers frivolously rich in style but wretchedly poor in sentiment the public ear is now so much accustomed to a correct and ornamented style that no writer can with safety neglect the study of it but he is a contemptible one who does not look to something beyond it who does not lay the chief stress upon his matter and employ such ornaments of style to recommend it as are manly not foppish majore animo says the writer whom i have so often quoted aggredienda est eloquentia quae si toto corpore valet ungues polire et capillum componere non existimabit ad curam suam pertinere ornatus et virilis et fortis et sanctus sit nec effeminatam levitatem et fuco ementitum titum colorem amet sanguine et viribus niteat a higher spirit ought to animate those who study eloquence they ought to consult the health and soundness of the whole body rather than bend their attention to such trifling objects as paring the nails and dressing the hair let ornament be manly and chaste without effeminate gaiety or artificial coloring let it shine with the glow of health and strength   lecture xx critical examination of the style of mr addison in no     of the spectator i have insisted fully on the subject of language and style both because it is in itself of great importance and because it is more capable of being ascertained by precise rule than several other parts of composition a critical analysis of the style of some good author will tend further to illustrate the subject as it will suggest observations which i have not had occasion to make and will show in the most practical light the use of those which i have made  mr addison is the author whom i have chosen for this purpose the spectator of which his papers are the chief ornament is a book which is in the hands of every one and which cannot be praised too highly the good sense and good writing the useful morality and the admirable vein of humor which abound in it render it one of those standard books which have done the greatest honor to the english nation i have formerly given the general character of mr addisons style and manner as natural and unaffected easy and polite and full of those graces which a flowery imagination diffuses over writing at the same time though one of the most beautiful writers in the language he is not the most correct a circumstance which renders his composition the more proper to be the subject of our present criticism the free and flowing manner of this amiable writer sometimes led him into inaccuracies which the more studied circumspection and care of far inferior writers have taught them to avoid remarking his beauties therefore which i shall have frequent occasion to do as i proceed i must also point out his negligences and defects without a free impartial discussion of both the faults and beauties which occur in his composition it is evident this piece of criticism would be of no service and from the freedom which i use in criticizing mr addisons style none can imagine that i mean to depreciate his writings after having repeatedly declared the high opinion which i entertain of them the beauties of this author are so many and the general character of his style is so elegant and estimable that the minute imperfections i shall have occasion to point out are but like those spots in the sun which may be discovered by the assistance of art but which have no effect in obscuring its luster it is indeed my judgment that what quinctilian applies to cicero illese profecisse sciat cui cicero valde placebit may with justice be applied to mr addison that to be highly pleased with his manner of writing is the criterion of ones having acquired a good taste in english style the paper on which we are now to enter is no     the first of his celebrated essays on the pleasures of the imagination in the sixth volume of the spectator it begins thus  our sight is the most perfect and most delightful of all our senses  this is an excellent introductory sentence it is clear precise and simple the author lays down in a few plain words the proposition which he is going to illustrate throughout the rest of the paragraph in this manner we should always set out a first sentence should seldom be a long and never an intricate one  he might have said our sight is the most perfect and the most delightful  but he has judged better in omitting to repeat the article the for the repetition of it is proper chiefly when we intend to point out the objects of which we speak as distinguished from or contrasted with each other and when we want that the readers attention should rest on that distinction for instance had mr addison intended to say that our sight is at once the most delightful and the most useful of all our senses the article might then have been repeated with propriety as a clear and strong distinction would have been conveyed but as between perfect and delightful there is less contrast there was no occasion for such repetition it would have had no other effect but to add a word unnecessarily to the sentence he proceeds  it fills the mind with the largest variety of ideas converses with its objects at the greatest distance and continues the longest in action without being tired or satiated with its proper enjoyments  this sentence deserves attention as remarkably harmonious and well constructed it possesses indeed almost all the properties of a perfect sentence it is entirely perspicuous it is loaded with no superfluous or unnecessary words for tired or satiated toward the end of the sentence are not used for synonymous terms they convey distinct ideas and refer to different members of the period that this sense continues the longest in action without being tired that is without being fatigued with its action and also without being satiated with its proper enjoyments that quality of a good sentence which i termed its unity is here perfectly preserved it is our sight of which he speaks this is the object carried through the sentence and presented to us in every member of it by those verbs fills converses continues to each of which it is clearly the nominative those capital words are disposed of in the most proper places and that uniformity is maintained in the construction of the sentence which suits the unity of the object  observe too the music of the period consisting of three members each of which agreeably to a rule i formerly mentioned grows and rises above the other in sound till the sentence is conducted at last to one of the most melodious closes which our language admits without being tired or satiated with its proper enjoyments enjoyments is a word of length and dignity exceedingly proper for a close which is designed to be a musical one the harmony is the more happy that this disposition of the members of the period which suits the sound so well is no less just and proper with respect to the sense it follows the order of nature first we have the variety of objects mentioned which sight furnishes to the mind next we have the action of sight on those objects and lastly we have time and continuance of its action no order could be more natural or happy  this sentence has still another beauty it is figurative without being too much so for the subject a metaphor runs through it the sense of sight is in some degree personified we are told of its conversing with its objects and of its not being tired or satiated with its enjoyments all which expressions are plain allusions to the actions and feelings of men this is that slight sort of personification which without any appearance of boldness and without elevating the fancy much above its ordinary state renders discourse picturesque and leads us to conceive the authors meaning more distinctly by clothing abstract ideas in some degree with sensible colors mr addison abounds with this beauty of style beyond most authors and the sentence which we have been considering is very expressive of his manner of writing there is no blemish in it whatever unless that a strict critic might perhaps object that the epithet large which he applies to variety  the largest variety of ideas is an epithet more commonly applied to extent than to number it is plain that he here employed it to avoid the repetition of the word great which occurs immediately afterward  the sense of feeling can indeed give us a notion of extension shape and all other ideas that enter at the eye except colors but at the same time it is very much straitened and confined in its operations to the number bulk and distance of its particular objects  this sentence is by no means so happy as the former it is indeed neither clear nor elegant extension and shape can with no propriety be called ideas they are properties of matter neither is it accurate even according to mr lockes philosophy with which our author seems here to have puzzled himself to speak of any sense giving us a notion of ideas our senses give us the ideas themselves the meaning would have been much more clear if the author had expressed himself thus the sense of feeling can indeed give us the idea of extension figure and all the other properties of matter which are perceived by the eye except colors  the latter part of the sentence is still more embarrassed for what meaning can we make of sense of feeling being confined in its operations to the number bulk and distance of its particular objects surely every sense is confined as much as the sense of feeling to the number bulk and distance of its own objects sight and feeling are in this respect perfectly on a level neither of them can extend beyond their own objects the turn of expression is so inaccurate here that one would be apt to suspect two words to have been omitted in the printing which were originally in mr addisons manuscript because the insertion would render the sense much more intelligible and clear these two words are with regard  it is very much straitened and confined in its operations with regard to the number bulk and distance of its particular objects the meaning then would be that feeling is more limited than sight in this respect that it is confined to a narrower circle to a smaller number of objects  the epithet particular applied to objects in the conclusion of the sentence is redundant and conveys no meaning whatever mr addison seems to have used it in place of peculiar as indeed he does often in other passages of his writings but particular and peculiar though they are too often confounded are words of different import from each other particular stands opposed to general peculiar stands opposed to what is possessed in common with others particular expresses what in the logical style is called species peculiar what is called differentia  its peculiar objects would have signified in this place the objects of the sense of feeling as distinguished from the objects of any other sense and would have had more meaning than its particular objects though in truth neither the one nor the other epithet was requisite it was sufficient to have said simply its objects  our sight seems designed to supply all these defects and may be considered as a more delicate and diffusive kind of touch that spreads itself over an infinite multitude of bodies comprehends the largest figures and brings into our reach some of the most remote parts of the universe  here again the authors style returns upon us in all its beauty this is a sentence distinct graceful well arranged and highly musical in the latter part of it it is constructed with three members which are formed much in the same manner with those of the second sentence on which i bestowed so much praise the construction is so similar that if it had followed immediately after it we should have been sensible of a faulty monotony but the interposition of another sentence between them prevents this effect  it is this sense which furnishes the imagination with its ideas so that by the pleasures of the imagination or fancy which i shall use promiscuously i here mean such as arise from visible objects either when we have them actually in our view or when we call up their ideas into our minds by paintings statues descriptions or any the like occasion  in place of it is this sense which furnishes  the author might have said more shortly this sense furnishes but the mode of expression which he has used is here more proper this sort of full and ample assertion it is this which is fit to be used when a proposition of importance is laid down to which we seek to call the readers attention it is like pointing with the hand at the object of which we speak the parenthesis in the middle of the sentence which i shall use promiscuously is not clear he ought to have said terms which i shall use promiscuously as the verb use relates not to the pleasures of the imagination but to the terms of fancy and imagination which he was to employ as synonymous any the like occasion  to call a painting or a statue an occasion is not a happy expression nor is it very proper to speak of calling up ideas by occasions the common phrase any such means would have been more natural  we cannot indeed have a single image in the fancy that did not make its first entrance through the sight but we have the power of retaining altering and compounding those images which we have once received into all the varieties of picture and vision that are most agreeable to the imagination for by this faculty a man in a dungeon is capable of entertaining himself with senses and landscapes more beautiful than any that can be found in the whole compass of nature  it may be of use to remark that in one member of this sentence there is an inaccuracy in syntax it is very proper to say altering and compounding those images which we have once received into all varieties of picture and vision but we can with no propriety say retaining them into all the varieties and yet according to the manner in which the words are ranged this construction is unavoidable for retaining altering and compounding are participles each of which equally refers to and governs the subsequent noun those images and that noun again is necessarily connected with the following preposition into this instance shows the importance of carefully attending to the rules of grammar and syntax when so pure a writer as mr addison could through inadvertence be guilty of such an error the construction might easily have been rectified by disjoining the participle retaining from the other two participles in this way we have the power of retaining those images which we have once received and of altering and compounding them into all the varieties of picture and vision or better perhaps thus we have the power of retaining altering and compounding those images which we have once received and of forming them into all the varieties of picture and vision  the latter part of the sentence is clear and elegant  there are few words in the english language which are employed in a more loose and uncircumscribed sense than those of the fancy and the imagination  there are few words  which are employed  it had been better if our author here had said more simply  few words in the english language are employed  mr addison whose style is of the free and full rather than the nervous kind deals on all occasions in this extended sort of phraseology but it is proper only when some assertion of consequence is advanced and which can bear an emphasis such as that in the first sentence of the former paragraph on other occasions these little words it is and there are ought to be avoided as redundant and enfeebling  those of the fancy and the imagination the article ought to have been omitted here as he does not mean the powers of the fancy and the imagination but the words only the article certainly had no proper place neither indeed was there any occasion for other two words those of better if the sentence had run thus few words in the english language are employed in a more loose and uncircumscribed sense than fancy and imagination  i therefore thought it necessary to fix and determine the notion of these two words as i intend to make use of them in the thread of my following speculations that the reader may conceive rightly what is the subject which i proceed upon  though fix and determine may appear synonymous words yet a difference between them may be remarked and they may be viewed as applied here with peculiar delicacy the author had just said that the words of which he is speaking were loose and uncircumscribed fix relates to the first of these determine to the last we fix what is loose that is we confine the word to its proper place that it may not fluctuate in our imagination and pass from one idea to another and we determine what is uncircumscribed that is we ascertain its termini or limits we draw the circle round it that we may see its boundaries for we cannot conceive the meaning of a word nor indeed of any other thing clearly till we see its limits and know how far it extends these two words therefore have grace and beauty as they are here applied though a writer more frugal of words than mr addison would have preferred the single word ascertain which conveys without any metaphor the import of them both  the notion of these words is somewhat of a harsh phrase at least not so commonly used as the meaning of these words  as i intend to make use of them in the thread of my speculations this is plainly faulty a sort of metaphor is improperly mixed with words in the literal sense he might very well have said as i intend to make use of them in my following speculations  this was plain language but if he chose to borrow an allusion from thread that allusion ought to have been supported for there is no consistency in making use of them in the thread of speculations and indeed in expressing any thing so simple and familiar as this is plain language is always to be preferred to metaphorical  the subject which i proceed upon is an ungraceful close of a sentence better the subject upon which i proceed  i must therefore desire him to remember that by the pleasures of the imagination i mean only such pleasures as arise orginally from sight and that i divide these pleasures into two kinds  as the last sentence began with  i therefore thought it necessary to fix it is careless to begin this sentence in a manner so very similar i must therefore desire him to remember especially as the small variation of using on this account or for this reason in place of therefore would have amended the style  when he says  i mean only such pleasures  it may be remarked that the adverb only is not in its proper place it is not intended here to qualify the verb mean but such pleasures and therefore should have been placed in as close connection as possible with the word which it limits or qualifies the style becomes more clear and neat when the words are arranged thus by the pleasures of the imagination i mean such pleasures only as arise from sight  my design being first of all to discourse of those primary pleasures of the imagination which entirely proceed from such objects as are before our eyes and in the next place to speak of those secondary pleasures of the imagination which flow from the ideas of visible objects when the objects are not actually before the eye but are called up into our memories or formed into agreeable visions of things that are either absent or fictitious  it is a great rule in laying down the division of a subject to study neatness and brevity as much as possible the divisions are then more distinctly apprehended and more easily remembered this sentence is not perfectly happy in that respect it is somewhat clogged by a tedious phraseology my design being first of all to discourse  in the next place to speak of  such objects as are before our eyes  things that are either absent or fictitious several words might have been spared here and the style made more neat and compact  the pleasures of the imagination taken in their full extent are not so gross as those of sense nor so refined as those of the understanding  this sentence is distinct and elegant  the last are indeed more preferable because they are founded on some new knowledge or improvement in the mind of man yet it must be confessed that those of the imagination are as great and as transporting as the other  in the beginning of this sentence the phrase more preferable is such a plain inaccuracy that one wonders how mr addison should have fallen into it seeing preferable of itself expresses the comparative degree and is the same with more eligible or more excellent  i must observe farther that the proposition contained in the last member of this sentence is neither clear nor neatly expressed  it must be confessed that those of the imagination are as great and as transporting as the other  in the former sentence he had compared three things together the pleasures of the imagination those of sense and those of the understanding in the beginning of this sentence he had called the pleasures of the understanding the last and he ends the sentence with observing that those of the imagination are as great and transporting as the other now besides that the other makes not a proper contrast with the last he leaves it ambiguous whether by the other he meant the pleasures of the understanding or the pleasures of sense for it may refer to either by the construction though undoubtedly he intended that it should refer to the pleasures of the understanding only the proposition reduced to perspicuous language runs thus yet it must be confessed that the pleasures of the imagination when compared with those of the understanding are no less great and transporting  a beautiful prospect delights the soul as much as a demonstration and a description in homer has charmed more readers than a chapter in aristotle  this is a good illustration of what he had been asserting and is expressed with that happy and elegant turn for which our author is very remarkable  besides the pleasures of the imagination have this advantage above those of the understanding that they are more obvious and more easy to be acquired  this is also an unexceptionable sentence  it is but opening the eye and the scene enters  this sentence is lively and picturesque by the gaiety and briskness which it gives the style it shows the advantage of intermixing such a short sentence as this amidst a run of longer ones which never fails to have a happy effect i must remark however a small inaccuracy a scene cannot be said to enter an actor enters but a scene appears or presents itself  the colors paint themselves on the fancy with very little attention of thought or application of mind in the beholder  this is still beautiful illustration carried on with that agreeable floweriness of fancy and style which is so well suited to those pleasures of the imagination of which the author is treating  we are struck we know not how with the symmetry of any thing we see and immediately assent to the beauty of an object without enquiring into the particular causes and occasions of it  there is a falling off here from the elegance of the former sentences we assent to the truth of a proposition but cannot so well be said to assent to the beauty of an object acknowledge would have expressed the sense with more propriety the close of the sentence too is heavy and ungraceful  the particular causes and occasions of it  both particular and occasions are words quite superfluous and the pronoun it is in some measure ambiguous whether it refers to beauty or to object it would have been some amendment to the style to have run thus we immediately acknowledge the beauty of an object without enquiring into the cause of that beauty  a man of a polite imagination is let into a great many pleasures that the vulgar are not capable of receiving  polite is a term more commonly applied to manners or behavior than to the mind or imagination there is nothing farther to be observed on this sentence unless the use of that for a relative pronoun instead of which an usage which is too frequent with mr addison which is a much more definite word than that being never employed in any other way than as a relative whereas that is a word of many senses sometimes a demonstrative pronoun often a conjunction in some cases we are indeed obliged to use that for a relative in order to avoid the ungraceful repetition of which in the same sentence but when we are laid under no necessity of this kind which is always the preferable word and certainly was so in this sentence  pleasures which the vulgar are not capable of receiving is much better than pleasures that the vulgar etc  he can converse with a picture and find an agreeable companion in a statue he meets with a secret refreshment in a description and often feels a greater satisfaction in the prospect of fields and meadows than another does in the possession it gives him indeed a kind of property in every thing he sees and makes the most rude uncultivated parts of nature administer to his pleasures so that he looks upon the world as it were in another light and discovers in it a multitude of charms that conceal themselves from the generality of mankind  all this is very beautiful the illustration is happy and the style runs with the greatest ease and harmony we see no labor no stiffness or affectation but an author writing from the native flow of a gay and pleasing imagination this predominant character of mr addisons manner far more than compensates all those little negligences which we are now remarking two of these occur in this paragraph the first in the sentence which begins with it gives him indeed a kind of property  to this it there is no proper antecedent in the whole paragraph in order to gather the meaning we must look back as far as to the third sentence before the first of the paragraph which begins with a man of a polite imagination this phrase polite imagination is the only antecedent to which this it can refer and even that is an improper antecedent as it stands in the genitive case as the qualification only of a man  the other instance of negligence is toward the end of the paragraph  so that he looks upon the world as it were in another light  by another light mr addison means a light different from that in which other men view the world but though this expression clearly conveyed this meaning to himself when writing it conveys it very indistinctly to others and is an instance of that sort of inaccuracy into which in the warmth of composition every writer of a lively imagination is apt to fall and which can only be remedied by a cool subsequent review  as it were  is upon most occasions no more than an ungraceful palliative and here there was not the least occasion for it as he was not about to say any thing which required a softening of this kind to say the truth this last sentence so that he looks upon the world and what follows had better been wanting altogether it is no more than an unnecessary recapitulation of what had gone before a feeble adjection to the lively picture he had given of the pleasures of the imagination the paragraph would have ended with more spirit at the words immediately preceding the uncultivated parts of nature administer to his pleasures  there are indeed but very few who know how to be idle and innocent or have a relish of any pleasures that are not criminal every diversion they take is at the expense of some one virtue or another and their very first step out of business is into vice or folly  nothing can be more elegant or more finely turned than this sentence it is neat clear and musical we could hardly alter one word or disarrange one member without spoiling it few sentences are to be found more finished or more happy  a man should endeavor therefore to make the sphere of his innocent pleasures as wide as possible that he may retire into them with safety and find in them such a satisfaction as a wise man would not blush to take  this also is a good sentence and gives occasion to no material remark  of this nature are those of the imagination which do not require such a bent of thought as is necessary to our more serious employments nor at the same time suffer the mind to sink into that indolence and remissness which are apt to accompany our more sensual delights but like a gentle exercise to the faculties awaken them from sloth and idleness without putting them upon any labor or difficulty  the beginning of this sentence is not correct and affords an instance of a period too loosely connected with the preceding one of this nature says he are those of the imagination we might ask of what nature for it had not been the scope of the preceding sentence to describe the nature of any set of pleasures he had said that it was every mans duty to make the sphere of his innocent pleasures as wide as possible in order that within that sphere he might find a safe retreat and a laudable satisfaction the transition is loosely made by beginning the next sentence with saying of this nature are those of the imagination it had been better if keeping in view the governing object of the preceding sentence he had said this advantage we gain or this satisfaction we enjoy by means of the pleasures of imagination the rest of the sentence is abundantly correct  we might here add that the pleasures of the fancy are more conducive to health than those of the understanding which are worked out by dint of thinking and attended with too violent a labor of the brain  on this sentence nothing occurs deserving of remark except that worked out by dint of thinking is a phrase which borders too much on vulgar and colloquial language to be proper for being employed in a polished composition  delightful scenes whether in nature painting or poetry have a kindly influence on the body as well as the mind and not only serve to clear and brighten the imagination but are able to disperse grief and melancholy and to set the animal spirits in pleasing and agreeable motions for this reason sir francis bacon in his essay upon health has not thought it improper to prescribe to his reader a poem or a prospect where he particularly dissuades him from knotty and subtle disquisitions and advises him to pursue studies that fill the mind with splendid and illustrious objects as histories fables and contemplations of nature  in the latter of these two sentences a member of the period is altogether out of its place which gives the whole sentence a harsh and disjointed cast and serves to illustrate the rules i formerly gave concerning arrangement the wrongplaced member which i point at is this where he particularly dissuades him from knotty and subtle disquisitions  these words should undoubtedly have been placed not where they stand but thus sir francis bacon in his essay upon health where he particularly dissuades the reader from knotty and subtle speculations has not thought it improper to prescribe to him etc this arrangement reduces every thing into its proper order  i have in this paper by way of introduction settled the notion of those pleasures of the imagination which are the subject of my present undertaking and endeavored by several considerations to recommend to my readers the pursuit of those pleasures i shall in my next paper examine the several sources from whence these pleasures are derived  these two concluding sentences afford examples of the proper collocation of circumstances in a period i formerly showed that it is often a matter of difficulty to dispose of them in such a manner as that they shall not embarrass the principal subject of the sentence in the sentences before us several of these incidental circumstances necessarily come in  by way of introduction  by several considerations  in this paper  in the next paper all which are with great propriety managed by our author it will be found upon trial that there were no other parts of the sentence in which they could have been placed to equal advantage had he said for instance i have settled the notion rather the meaning  of those pleasures of the imagination which are the subject of my present undertaking by way of introduction in this paper and endeavored to recommend the pursuit of those pleasures to my readers by several considerations we must be sensible that the sentence thus clogged with circumstances in the wrong place would neither have been so neat nor so clear as it is by the present construction  lecture xxi critical examination of the style in no     of the spectator the observations which have occurred in reviewing that paper of mr addisons which was the subject of the last lecture sufficiently show that in the writings of an author of the most happy genius and distinguished talents inaccuracies may sometimes be found though such inaccuracies may be overbalanced by so many beauties as render style highly pleasing and agreeable upon the whole yet it must be desirable to every writer to avoid as far as he can inaccuracy of any kind as the subject therefore is of importance i have thought it might be useful to carry on this criticism throughout two or three subsequent papers of the spectator at the same time i must intimate that the lectures on these papers are solely intended for such as are applying themselves to the study of english style i pretend not to give instruction to those who are already well acquainted with the powers of language to them my remarks may prove unedifying to some they may seem tedious and minute but to such as have not yet made all the proficiency which they desire in elegance of style strict attention to the composition and structure of sentences cannot fail to prove of considerable benefit and though my remarks on mr addison should in any instance be thought illfounded they will at least serve the purpose of leading them into the train of making proper remarks for themselves if there be readers who think any farther apology requisite for my adventuring to criticize the sentences of so eminent an author as mr addison i must take notice that i was naturally led to it by the circumstances of that part of the kingdom where these lectures were read where the ordinary spoken language often differs much from what is used by good english authors hence it occurred to me as a proper method of correcting any peculiarities of dialect to direct students of eloquence to analize and examine with particular attention the structure of mr addisons sentences those papers of the spectator which are the subject of the following lectures were accordingly given out in exercise to students to be thus examined and analized and several of the observations which follow both on the beauties and blemishes of this author were suggested by the observations given to me in consequence of the exercise prescribed  i proceed therefore to the examination of the subsequent paper no      i shall first consider those pleasures of the imagination which arise from the actual view and survey of outward objects and these i think all proceed from the sight of what is great uncommon or beautiful  this sentence gives occasion for no material remark it is simple and distinct the two words which he here uses view and survey are not altogether synonymous as the former may be supposed to import mere inspection the latter more deliberate examination yet they lie so near to one another in meaning that in the present case any one of them perhaps would have been sufficient the epithet actual is introduced in order to mark more strongly the distinction between what our author calls the primary pleasures of imagination which arise from immediate view and the secondary which arise from remembrance or description  there may indeed be something so terrible or offensive that the horror or loathsomeness of an object may overbear the pleasure which results from its novelty greatness or beauty but still there will be such a mixture of delight in the very disgust it gives us as any of these three qualifications are most conspicuous and prevailing  this sentence must be acknowledged to be an unfortunate one the sense is obscure and embarrassed and the expression loose and irregular the beginning of it is perplexed by the wrong position of the words something and object the natural arrangement would have been there may indeed be something in an object so terrible or offensive that the horror or loathsomeness of it may overbear  these two epithets horror or loathsomeness are awkwardly joined together loathsomeness is indeed a quality which may be ascribed to an object but horror is not it is a feeling excited in the mind the language would have been much more correct had our author said there may indeed be something in an object so terrible or offensive that the horror or disgust which it excites may overbear  the first two epithets terrible or offensive would then have expressed the qualities of an object the latter horror or disgust the corresponding sentiments which these qualities produce in us loathsomeness was the most unhappy word he could have chosen for to be loathsome is to be odious and seems totally to exclude any mixture of delight which he afterward supposes may be found in the object  in the latter part of the sentence there are several inaccuracies when he says there will be such a mixture of delight in the very disgust it gives us as any of these three qualifications are most conspicuous the construction is defective and seems hardly grammatical he meant assuredly to say such a mixture of delight as is proportioned to the degree in which any of these three qualifications are most conspicuous  we know that there may be a mixture of pleasant and of disagreeable feelings excited by the same object yet it appears inaccurate to say that there is any delight in the very disgust  the plural verb are is improperly joined to any of these three qualifications for as any is here used distributively and means any one of these three qualifications the corresponding verb ought to have been singular the order in which the two last words are placed should have been reversed and made to stand prevailing and conspicuous they are conspicuous because they prevail  by greatness i do not only mean the bulk of any single object but the largeness of a whole view considered as one entire piece  in a former lecture when treating of the structure of sentences i quoted this sentence as an instance of the careless manner in which adverbs are sometimes interjected in the midst of a period only as it is here placed appears to be a limitation of the following verb mean the question might be put what more does he than only mean as the author undoubtedly intended it to refer to the bulk of a single object it would have been placed with more propriety after these words  i do not mean the bulk of any single object only but the largeness of a whole view  as the following phrase considered as one entire piece seems to be somewhat deficient both in dignity and propriety perhaps this adjection might have been altogether omitted and the sentence have closed with fully as much advantage at the word view  such are the prospects of an open champaign country a vast uncultivated desert of huge heaps of mountains high rocks and precipices or a wide expanse of waters where we are not struck with the novelty or beauty of the sight but with that rude kind of magnificence which appears in many of these stupendous works of nature  this sentence in the main is beautiful the objects presented are all of them noble selected with judgment arranged with propriety and accompanied with proper epithets we must however observe that the sentence is too loosely and not very gramatically connected with the preceding one he says  such are the prospects  such signifies of that nature or quality which necessarily presupposes some adjective or word descriptive of a quality going before to which it refers but in the foregoing sentence there is no such adjective he had spoken of greatness in the abstract only and therefore such has no distinct antecedent to which we can refer it the sentence would have been introduced with more grammatical propriety by saying to this class belong or under this head are ranged the prospects etc  the of which is prefixed to huge heaps of mountains is misplaced and has perhaps been an error in the printing as either all the particulars here enumerated should have had this mark of the genitive or it should have been prefixed to none but the first  when in the close of the sentence the author speaks of that rude magnificence which appears in many of these stupendous works of nature he had better have omitted the word many which seems to except some of them whereas in his general proposition he undoubtedly meant to include all the stupendous works he had enumerated and there is no question that in all of them a rude magnificence appears  our imagination loves to be filled with an object or to grasp at any thing that is too big for its capacity we are flung into a pleasing astonishment at such unbounded views and feel a delightful stillness and amazement in the soul at the apprehension of them  the language here is elegant and several of the expressions remarkably happy there is nothing which requires any animadversion except the close at the apprehension of them not only is this a languid enfeebling conclusion of a sentence otherwise beautiful but the apprehension of views is a phrase destitute of all propriety and indeed scarcely intelligible had this adjection been entirely omitted and the sentence been allowed to close with stillness and amazement in the soul it would have been a great improvement nothing is frequently more hurtful to the grace or vivacity of a period than superfluous dragging words at the conclusion  the mind of man naturally hates every thing that looks like a restraint upon it and is apt to fancy itself under a sort of confinement when the sight is pent up in a narrow compass and shortened on every side by the neighborhood of walls or mountains on the contrary a spacious horizon is an image of liberty where the eye has room to range abroad to expatiate at large on the immensity of its views and to lose itself amidst the variety of objects that offer themselves to its observation such wide and undetermined prospects are as pleasing to the fancy as the speculations of eternity or infinitude are to the understanding  our authors style appears here in all that native beauty which cannot be too much praised the numbers flow smoothly and with a graceful harmony the words which he has chosen carry a certain amplitude and fullness well suited to the nature of the subject and the members of the periods rise in a gradation accommodated to the rise of the thought the eye first ranges abroad then expatiates at large on the immensity of its views and at last loses itself amidst the variety of objects that offer themselves to its observation the fancy is elegantly contrasted with the understanding prospects with speculations and wide and undetermined prospect with speculations of eternity and infinitude  but if there be a beauty or uncommonness joined with this grandeur as in a troubled ocean a heaven adorned with stars and meteors or a spacious landscape cut out into rivers woods rocks and meadows the pleasure still grows upon us as it arises from more than a single principle  the article prefixed to beauty in the beginning of this sentence might have been omitted and the style have run perhaps to more advantage thus but if beauty or uncommonness be joined to this grandeur  a landscape cut out into rivers woods etc seems unseasonably to imply an artificial formation and had better have been expressed by diversified with rivers woods etc  every thing that is new or uncommon raises a pleasure in the imagination because it fills the soul with an agreeable surprise gratifies its curiosity and gives it an idea of which it was not before possessed we are indeed so often conversant with one set of objects and tired out with so many repeated shows of the same things that whatever is new or uncommon contributes a little to vary human life and to divert our minds for a while with the strangeness of its appearance it serves us for a kind of refreshment and takes off from that satiety we are apt to complain of in our usual and ordinary entertainments  the style in these sentences flows in an easy and agreeable manner a severe critic might point out some expressions that would bear being retrenched but this would alter the genius and character of mr addisons style we must always remember that good composition admits of being carried on under many different forms style must not be reduced to one precise standard one writer may be as agreeable by a pleasing diffuseness when the subject bears and his genius prompts it as another by a concise and forcible manner it is fit however to observe that in the beginning of those sentences which we have at present before us the phrase raises a pleasure in the imagination is unquestionably too flat and feeble and might easily be amended by saying affords pleasure to the imagination and toward the end there are two ofs which grate harshly on the ear in that phrase takes off from that satiety we are apt to complain of where the correction is as easily made as in the other case by substituting diminishes that satiety of which we are apt to complain such instances show the advantage of frequent reviews of what we have written in order to give proper correctness and polish to our language  it is this which bestows charms on a monster and makes even the imperfections of nature please us it is this that recommends variety where the mind is every instant called off to something new and the attention not suffered to dwell too long and waste itself on any particular object it is this likewise that improves what is great or beautiful and makes it afford the mind a double entertainment  still the style proceeds with perspicuity grace and harmony the full and ample assertion with which each of these sentences is introduced frequent on many occasions with our author is here proper and seasonable as it was his intention to magnify as much as possible the effects of novelty and variety and to draw our attention to them his frequent use of that instead of which is another peculiarity of his style but on this occasion in particular cannot be much commended as it is this which seems in every view to be better than it is this that three times repeated i must likewise take notice that the antecedent to it is this when critically considered is not altogether proper it refers as we discover by the sense to whatever is new or uncommon but as it is not good language to say whatever is new bestows charms on a monster one cannot avoid thinking that our author had done better to have begun the first of these three sentences with saying it is novelty which bestows charms on a monster etc  groves fields and meadows are at any season of the year pleasant to look upon but never so much as in the opening of the spring when they are all new and fresh with their first gloss upon them and not yet too much accustomed and familiar to the eye  in this expression never so much as in the opening of the spring there appears to be a small error in grammar for when the construction is filled up it must be read never so much pleasant had he to avoid this said never so much so the grammatical error would have been prevented but the language would have been awkward better to have said but never so agreeable as in the opening of the spring we readily say the eye is accustomed to objects but to say as our author has done at the close of the sentence that objects are accustomed to the eye can scarcely be allowed in a prose composition  for this reason there is nothing that more enlivens a prospect than rivers jetteaus or falls of water where the scene is perpetually shifting and entertaining the sight every moment with something that is new we are quickly tired with looking at hills and valleys where every thing continues fixed and settled in the same place and posture but find our thoughts a little agitated and relieved at the sight of such objects as are ever in motion and sliding away from beneath the eye of the beholder  the first of these sentences is connected in too loose a manner with that which immediately preceded it when he says for this reason there is nothing that more enlivens etc we are entitled to look for the reason in what he had just before said but there we find no reason for what he is now going to assert except that groves and meadows are most pleasant in the spring we know that he has been speaking of the pleasure produced by novelty and variety and our minds naturally recur to this as the reason here alluded to but his language does not properly express it it is indeed one of the defects of this amiable writer that his sentences are often too negligently connected with one another his meaning upon the whole we gather with ease from the tenor of his discourse yet this negligence prevents his sense from striking us with that force and evidence which a more accurate juncture of parts would have produced bating this inaccuracy these two sentences especially the latter are remarkably elegant and beautiful the close in particular is uncommonly fine and carries as much expressive harmony as the language can admit it seems to paint what he is describing at once to the eye and the ear  such objects as are ever in motion and sliding away from beneath the eye of the beholder  indeed notwithstanding those small errors which the strictness of critical examination obliges me to point out it may be safely pronounced that the two paragraphs which we have now considered in this paper the one concerning greatness and the other concerning novelty are extremely worthy of mr addison and exhibit a style which they who can successfully imitate may esteem themselves happy  but there is nothing that makes its way more directly to the soul than beauty which immediately diffuses a secret satisfaction and complacency through the imagination and gives a finishing to any thing that is great or uncommon the very first discovery of it strikes the mind with an inward joy and spreads a cheerfulness and delight through all its faculties  some degree of verbosity may be here discovered and phrases repeated which are little more than the echo of one another such as  diffusing satisfaction and complacency through the imagination  striking the mind with inward joy  spreading cheerfulness and delight through all its faculties at the same time i readily admit that this full and flowing style even though it carry some redundancy is not unsuitable to the gaiety of the subject on which the author is entering and is more allowable here than it would have been on some other occasions  there is not perhaps any real beauty or deformity more in one piece of matter than another because we might have been so made that whatever now appears loathsome to us might have shown itself agreeable but we find by experience that there are several modifications of matter which the mind without any previous consideration pronounces at first sight beautiful or deformed  in this sentence there is nothing remarkable in any view to draw our attention we may observe only that the word more toward the beginning is not in its proper place and that the preposition in is wanting before another the phrase ought to have stood thus  beauty or deformity in one piece of matter more than in another  thus we see that every different species of sensible creatures has its different notions of beauty and that each of them is most affected with the beauties of its own kind this is no where more remarkable than in birds of the same shape and proportion when we often see the male determined in his courtship by the single grain or tincture of a feather and never discovering any charms but in the color of its species  neither is there here any particular elegance or felicity of language  different sense of beauty would have been a more proper expression to have been applied to irrational creatures than as it stands different notions of beauty in the close of the second sentence when the author says color of its species he is guilty of a considerable inaccuracy in changing the gender as he had said in the same sentence that the male was determined in his courtship  there is a second kind of beauty that we find in the several products of art and nature which does not work in the imagination with that warmth and violence as the beauty that appears in our proper species but is apt however to raise in us a secret delight and a kind of fondness for the places or objects in which we discover it  still i am sorry to say we find little to praise as in his enunciation of the subject when beginning the former paragraph he appeared to have been treating of beauty in general in distinction from greatness or novelty this second kind of beauty of which he here speaks comes upon us in a sort of surprise and it is only by degrees we learn that formerly he had no more in view than the beauty which the different species of sensible creatures find in one another this second kind of beauty he says we find in the several products of art and nature he undoubtedly means not in all but in several of the products of art and nature and ought so to have expressed himself and in the place of products to have used also the more proper word productions when he adds that this kind of beauty does not work in the imagination with that warmth and violence as the beauty that appears in our proper species the language would certainly have been more pure and elegant if he had said that it does not work upon the imagination with such warmth and violence as the beauty that appears in our own species  this consists either in the gaiety or variety of colors in the symmetry and proportion of parts in the arrangement and disposition of bodies or in a just mixture and concurrence of all together among these several kinds of beauty the eye takes most delight in colors  to the language here i see no objection that can be made  we no where meet with a more glorious or pleasing show in nature than what appears in the heavens at the rising and setting of the sun which is wholly made up of those different stas of light that show themselves in clouds of a different situation  the chief ground of criticism on this sentence is the disjointed situation of the relative which grammatically it refers to the rising and setting of the sun but the author meant that it should refer to the show which appears in the heavens at that time it is too common among authors when they are writing without much care to make such particles as this and which refer not to any particular antecedent word but to the tenor of some phrase or perhaps the scope of some whole sentence which has gone before this practice saves them trouble in marshaling their words and arranging a period but though it may leave their meaning intelligible yet it renders that meaning much less perspicuous determined and precise than it might otherwise have been the error i have pointed out might have been avoided by a small alternation in the construction of the sentence after some such manner as this we no where meet with a more glorious and pleasing show in nature than what is formed in the heavens at the rising and setting of the sun by the different stains of light which show themselves in clouds of different situations our author writes in clouds of a different situation by which he means clouds that differ in situation from each other but as this is neither the obvious nor grammatical meaning of his words it was necessary to change the expression as i have done into the plural number  for this reason we find the poets who are always addressing themselves to the imagination borrowing more of their epithets from colors than from any other topic  on this sentence nothing occurs except a remark similar to what was made besore of loose connection with the sentence which precedes for though he begins with saying for this reason the foregoing sentence which was employed about the clouds and the sun gives no reason for the general proposition he now lays down the reason to which he refers was given two sentences before when he observed that the eye takes more delight in colors than in any other beauty and it was with that sentence that the present one should have stood immediately connected  as the fancy delights in every thing that is great strange or beautiful and is still more pleased the more it finds of these perfections in the same object so it is capable of receiving a new satisfaction by the assistance of another sense  another sense here means grammatically another sense than fancy for there is no other thing in the period to which this expression another sense can at all be opposed he had not for some time made mention of any sense whatever he forgot to add what was undoubtedly in his thoughts another sense than that of sight  thus any continued sound as the music of birds or a fall of water awakens every moment the mind of the beholder and makes him more attentive to the several beauties of the place which lie before him thus if there arises a fragrancy of smells or perfumes they heighten the pleasures of the imagination and make even the colors and verdure of the landscape appear more agreeable for the ideas of both senses recommend each other and are pleasanter together than when they enter the mind separately as the different colors of a picture when they are welldisposed set off one another and receive an additional beauty from the advantage of their situation  whether mr addisons theory here be just or not may be questioned a continued sound such as that of a fall of water is so far from awakening every moment the mind of the beholder that nothing is more likely to lull him asleep it may indeed please the imagination and heighten the beauties of the scene but it produces this effect by a soothing not by an awakening influence with regard to the style nothing appears exceptionable the flow both of language and of ideas is very agreeable the author continues to the end the same pleasing train of thought which had run through the rest of the paper and leaves us agreeably employed in comparing together different degrees of beauty  lecture xxii critical examination of the style in no     of the spectator though in yesterdays paper we considered how every thing that is great new or beautiful is apt to affect the imagination with pleasure we must own that it is impossible for us to assign the necessary cause of this pleasure because we know neither the nature of an idea nor the substance of a human soul which might help us to discover the conformity or disagreeableness of the one to the other and therefore for want of such a light all that we can do in speculations of this kind is to reflect on those operations of the soul that are most agreeable and to range under their proper heads what is pleasing or displeasing to the mind without being able to trace out the several necessary and efficient causes from whence the pleasure or displeasure arises  this sentence considered as an introductory one must be acknowledged to be very faulty an introductory sentence should never contain any thing that can in any degree fatigue or puzzle the reader when an author is entering on a new branch of his subject informing us of what he has done and what he purposes farther to do we naturally expect that he should express himself in the simplest and most perspicuous manner possible but the sentence now before us is crowded and indistinct containing three separate propositions which as i shall afterward show required separate sentences to have unfolded them mr addisons chief excellency as a writer lay in describing and painting there he is great but in methodising and reasoning he is not so eminent as besides the general fault of prolixity and indistinctness this sentence contains several inaccuracies i will be obliged to enter into a minute discussion of its structure and parts a discussion which to many readers will appear tedious and which therefore they will naturally pass over but which to those who are studying composition i hope may prove of some benefit  though in yesterdays paper we considered  the import of though is notwithstanding that when it appears in the beginning of a sentence its relative generally is yet and it is employed to warn us after we have been informed of some truth that we are not to infer from it some other thing which we might perhaps have expected to follow though virtue be the only road to happiness yet it does not permit the unlimited gratification of our desires now it is plain that there was no such opposition between the subject of yesterdays paper and what the author is now going to say between his asserting a fact and his not being able to assign the cause of that fact as rendered the use of this adversative particle though either necessary or proper in the introduction  we considered how every thing that is great new or beautiful is apt to affect the imagination with pleasure  the adverb how signifies either the means by which or the manner in which something is done but in truth neither one nor other of these had been considered by our author he had illustrated the fact alone that they do affect the imagination with pleasure and with respect to the quomodo or the how he is so far from having considered it that he is just now going to show that it cannot be explained and that we must rest contented with the knowledge of the fact alone and of its purpose or final cause  we must own that it is impossible for us to assign the necessary cause he means what is more commonly called the efficient cause of this pleasure because we know neither the nature of an idea nor the substance of a human soul  the substance of a human soul is certainly a very uncouth expression and there appears no reason why he should have varied from the word nature which would have equally applied to idea and to soul  which might help us our author proceeds to discover the conformity or disagreeableness of the one to the other  the which at the beginning of this member of the period is surely ungrammatical as it is a relative without any antecedent in all the sentence it refers by the construction to the nature of an idea or the substance of a human soul but this is by no means the reference which the author intended his meaning is that our knowing the nature of an idea and the substance of a human soul might help us to discover the conformity or disagreeableness of the one to the other and therefore the syntax absolutely required the word knowledge to have been inserted as the antecedent to which i have before remarked and the remark deserves to be repeated that nothing is a more certain sign of careless composition than to make such relatives as which not refer to any precise expression but carry a loose and vague relation to the general strain of what had gone before when our sentences run into this form we may be assured there is something in the construction of them that requires alteration the phrase of discovering the conformity or disagreeableness of the one to the other is likewise exceptionable for disagreeableness neither forms a proper contrast to the other word conformity nor expresses what the author meant here as far as any meaning can be gathered from his words that is a certain unsuitableness or want of conformity to the nature of the soul to say the truth this member of the sentence had much better have been omitted altogether the conformity or disagreeableness of an idea to the substance of a human soul is a phrase which conveys to the mind no distinct nor intelligent conception whatever the author had before given a sufficient reason for his not assigning the efficient cause of those pleasures of the imagination because we neither know the nature of our own ideas nor of the soul and this farther discussion about the conformity or disagreeableness of the nature of the one to the substance of the other affords no clear nor useful illustration  and therefore the sentence goes on for want of such a light all that we can do in speculations of this kind is to reflect on those operations of the soul that are most agreeable and to range under their proper heads what is pleasing or displeasing to the mind  the two expressions in the beginning of this member therefore and for want of such a light evidently refer to the same thing and are quite synonymous one or other of them therefore had better have been omitted instead of to range under their proper heads the language would have been smoother if their had been left out  without being able to trace out the several necessary and efficient causes from whence the pleasure or displeasure arises the expression from whence though seemingly justified by very frequent usage is taxed by dr johnson as a vicious mode of speech seeing whence alone has all the power of from whence which therefore appears an unnecessary reduplication i am inclined to think that the whole of this last member of the sentence had better have been dropped the period might have closed with full propriety at the words pleasing or displeasing to the mind all that follows suggests no idea that had not been fully conveyed in the preceding part of the sentence it is a mere expletive adjection which might be omitted not only without injury to the meaning but to the great relief of a sentence already laboring under the multitude of words  having now finished the analysis of this long sentence i am inclined to be of opinion that if on any occasion we can adventure to alter mr addisons style it may be done to advantage here by breaking down this period in the following manner in yesterdays paper we have shown that every thing which is great new or beautiful is apt to affect the imagination with pleasure we must own that it is impossible for us to assign the efficient cause of this pleasure because we know not the nature either of an idea or of the human soul all that we can do therefore in speculations of this kind is to reflect on the operations of the soul which are most agreeable and to range under proper heads what is pleasing or displeasing to the mind  we proceed now to the examination of the following sentences  final causes lie more bare and open to our observation as there are often a great variety that belong to the same effect and these though they are not altogether so satisfactory are generally more useful than the other as they give us greater occasion of admiring the goodness and wisdom of the first contriver  though some difference might be traced between the sense of bare and open yet as they are here employed they are so nearly synonymous that one of them was sufficient it would have been enough to have said final causes lie more open to observation  one can scarcely help observing here that the obviousness of final causes does not proceed as mr addison supposes from a variety of them concurring in the same effect which is often not the case but from our being able to ascertain more clearly from our own experience the congruity of a final cause with the circumstances of our condition whereas the constituent parts of subjects whence efficient causes proceed lie for most part beyond the reach of our faculties but as this remark respects the thought more than the style it is sufficient for us to observe that when he says a great variety that belong to the same effect the expression strictly considered is not altogether proper the accessory is properly said to belong to the principal not the principal to the accessory now an effect is considered as the accessory or consequence of its cause and therefore though we might well say a variety of effects belong to the same cause it seems not so proper to say that a variety of causes belong to the same effect  one of the final causes of our delight in any thing that is great may be this the supreme author of our being has so formed the soul of man that nothing but himself can be its last adequate and proper happiness because therefore a great part of our happiness must arise from the contemplation of his being that he might give our souls a just relish of such a contemplation he has made them naturally delight in the apprehension of what is great or unlimited  the concurrence of two conjunctions because therefore forms rather a harsh and unpleasing beginning of the last of these sentences and in the close one would think that the author might have devised a happier word than apprehension to be applied to what is unlimited but that i may not be thought hypercritical i shall make no farther observation on these sentences  our admiration which is a very pleasing motion of the mind immediately rises at the consideration of any object that takes up a good deal of room in the fancy and by consequence will improve into the highest pitch of astonishment and devotion when we contemplate his nature that is neither circumscribed by time nor place nor to be comprehended by the largest capacity of a created being  here our authors style rises beautifully along with the thought however inaccurate he may sometimes be when coolly philosophising yet whenever his fancy is awakened by description or his mind as here warmed with some glowing sentiment he presently becomes great and discovers in his language the hand of a master every one must observe with what felicity this period is constructed the words are long and majestic the members rise one above another and conduct the sentence at last to that full and harmonious close which leaves upon the mind such an impression as the author intended to leave of something uncommonly great awful and magnificent  he has annexed a secret pleasure to the idea of any thing that is new or uncommon that he might encourage us in the pursuit of knowledge and engage us to search into the wonders of creation for every new idea brings such a pleasure along with it as rewards the pains we have taken in its acquisition and consequently serves as a motive to put us upon fresh discoveries  the language in this sentence is clear and precise only we cannot but observe in this and the two following sentences which are constructed in the same manner a strong proof of mr addisons unreasonable partiality to the particle that in preference to which  annexed a secret pleasure to the idea of any thing that is new or uncommon that he might encourage us  here the first that stands for a relative pronoun and the next that at the distance only of four words is a conjunction this confusion of sounds serves to embarrass style much better sure to have said the idea of any thing which is new or uncommon that he might encourage  the expression with which the sentence concludes  a motive to put us upon fresh discoveries  is flat and in some degree improper he should have said put us upon making fresh discoveris  or rather serves as a motive inciting us to make fresh discoveries  he has made every thing that is beautiful in our own species pleasant that all creatures might be tempted to multiply their kind and fill the world with inhabitants for it is very remarkable that wherever nature is crossed in the production of a monster the result of any unnatural mixture the breed is incapable of propagating its likeness and of founding a new order of creatures so that unless all animals were allured by the beauty of their own species generation would be at an end and the earth unpeopled  here we must however reluctantly return to the employment of censure for this is among the worst sentences our author ever wrote and contains a variety of blemishes taken as a whole it is extremely deficient in unity instead of a complete proposition it contains a sort of chain of reasoning the links of which are so ill put together that it is with difficulty we can trace the connection and unless we take the trouble of perusing it several times it will leave nothing on the mind but an indistinct and obscure impression  besides this general fault respecting the meaning it contains some great inaccuracies in language first gods having made every thing which is beautiful in our own species that is in the human species pleasant is certainly no motive for all creatures for beasts and birds and fishes to multiply their kind what the author meant to say though he has expressed himself in so erroneous a manner undoubtedly was in all the different orders of creatures he has made every thing which is beautiful in their own species pleasant that all creatures might be tempted to multiply their kind the second member of the sentence is still worse for it is very remarkable that wherever nature is crossed in the production of a monster etc the reason which he here gives for the preceding assertion intimated by the casual particle for is far from being obvious the connection of thought is not readily apparent and would have required an intermediate step to render it distinct but what does he mean by nature being crossed in the production of a monster one might understand him to mean disappointed in its intention of producing a monster as when we say one is crossed in his pursuits we mean that he is disappointed in accomplishing the end which he intended had he said crossed by the production of a monster the sense would have been more intelligible but the proper rectification of the expression would be to insert the adverb as before the preposition in after this manner  wherever nature is crossed as in the production of a monster  the insertion of this particle as throws so much light on the construction of this member of the sentence that i am very much inclined to believe it had stood thus originally in our authors manuscript and that the present reading is a typographical error which having crept into the first edition of the spectator ran through all the subsequent ones  in the last place he has made every thing that is beautiful in all other objects pleasant or rather has made so many objects appear beautiful that he might render the whole creation more gay and delightful he has given almost every thing about us the power of raising an agreeable idea in the imagination so that it is impossible for us to behold his works with coldness or indifference and to survey so many beauties without a secret satisfaction and complacency  the idea here is so just and the language so clear flowing and agreeable that to remark any diffuseness which may be attributed to these sentences would be justly esteemed hypercritical  things would make but a poor appearance to the eye if we saw them only in their proper figures and motions and what reason can we assign for their exciting in us many of those ideas which are different from any thing that exists in the objects themselves for such are light and colors were it not to add supernumerary ornaments to the universe and make it more agreeable to the imagination  our author is now entering on a theory which he is about to illustrare if not with much philosophical accuracy yet with great beauty of fancy and glow of expression a strong instance of his want of accuracy appears in the manner in which he opens the subject for what meaning is there in things exciting in us many of those ideas which are different from any thing that exists in the objects no one sure ever imagined that our ideas exist in the objects ideas it is agreed on all hands can exist no where but in the mind what mr lockes philosophy teaches and what our author should have said is exciting in us many ideas of qualities which are different from any thing that exists in the objects the ungraceful parenthesis which follows for such are light and colors had far better have been avoided and incorporated with the rest of the sentence in this manner  exciting in us many ideas of qualities such as light and colors which are different from any thing that exists in the objects  we are every where entertained with pleasing shows and apparitions we discover imaginary glories in the heavens and in the earth and see some of this visionary beauty poured out upon the whole creation but what a rough unsightly sketch of nature should we be entertained with did all her coloring disappear and the several distinctions of light and shade vanish in short our souls are delightfully lost and bewildered in a pleasing delusion and we walk about like the enchanted hero of a romance who sees beautiful castles woods and meadows and at the same time hears the warbling of birds and the purling of streams but upon the finishing of some secret spell the fantastic scene breaks up and the disconsolate knight finds himself on a barren heath or in a solitary desert  after having been obliged to point out several inaccuracies i return with much more pleasure to the display of beauties for which we have now full scope for these two sentences are such as do the highest honor to mr addisons talents as a writer warmed with the idea he had laid hold of his delicate sensibility to the beauty of nature is finely displayed in the illustration of it the style is flowing and full without being too diffuse it is flowery but not gaudy elevated but not ostentatious  amidst this blaze of beauties it is necessary for us to remark one or two inaccuracies when it is said toward the close of the first of those sentences what a rough unsightly sketch of nature should we be entertained with the preposition with should have been placed at the beginning rather than at the end of this member and the word entertained is both improperly applied here and carelessly repeated from the former part of the sentence it was there employed according to its more common use as relating to agreeable objects we are every where entertained with pleasing shows here it would have been more proper to have changed the phrase and said with what a rough unsightly sketch of nature should we be presented  at the close of the second sentence where it is said the fantastic scene breaks up the expression is lively but not altogether justifiable an assembly breaks up a scene closes or disappears  bating these two slight inaccuracies the style here is not only correct but perfectly elegant the most striking beauty of the passage arises from the happy simile which the author employs and the fine illustration which it gives to the thought the enchanted hero the beautiful castles the fantastic scene the secret spell the disconsolate knight are terms chosen with the utmost felicity and strongly recall all those romantic ideas with which he intended to amuse our imagination few authors are more successful in their imagery than mr addison and few passages in his whrks or in those of any author are more beautiful and picturesque than that on which we have been commenting  it is not improbable that something like this may be the state of the soul after its first separation in respect of the images it will receive from matter though indeed the ideas of colors are so pleasing and beautiful in the imagination that it is possible the soul will not be deprived of them but perhaps find them excited by some other occasional cause as they are at present by the different impressions of the subtle matter on the organ of sight  as all human things after having attained the summit begin to decline we must acknowledge that in this sentence there is a sensible falling off from the beauty of what went before it is broken and deficient in unity its parts are not sufficiently compacted it contains besides some faulty expressions when it is said something like this may be the state of the soul to the pronoun this there is no determined antecedent it refers to the general import of the preceding description which as i have several times remarked always renders style clumsy and inelegant if not obscure  the state of the soul after its first separation appears to be an incomplete phrase and first seems an useless and even an improper word more distinct if he had said  state of the soul immediately on its separation from the body  the adverb perhaps is redundant after having just before said it is possible  i have here supposed that my reader is acquainted with that great modern discovery which is at present universally acknowledged by all the enquirers into natural philosophy namely that light and colors as apprehended by the imagination are only ideas in the mind and not qualities that have any existence in matter as this is a truth which has been proved incontestibly by many modern philosophers and is indeed one of the finest speculations in that science if the english reader would see the notion explained at large he may find it in the eight chapter of the second book of mr lockes essay on the human understanding  in these two concluding sentences the author hastening to finish appears to write rather carelessly in the first of them a manifest tautology occurs when he speaks of what is universally acknowledged by all enquirers in the second when he calls a truth which has been incontestibly proved first a speculation and afterward a notion the language surely is not very accurate when he adds one of the finest speculations in that science it does not at first appear what science he means one would imagine he meant to refer to modern philosophers for natural philosophy to which doubtless he refers stands at much too great a distance to be the proper or obvious antecedent to the pronoun that the circumstance toward the close if the english reader would see the notion explained at large he may find it is properly taken notice of by the author of the elements of criticism as wrong arranged and is rectified thus the english reader if he would see the notion explained at large may find it etc  in concluding the examination of this paper we may observe that though not a very long one it exhibits a striking view both of the beauties and the defects of mr addisons style it contains some of the best and some of the worst sentences that are to be found in his works but upon the whole it is an agreeable and elegant essay  lecture xxiii critical examination of the style in no     of the spectator if we consider the works of nature and art as they are qualified to entertain the imagination we shall find the last very defective in comparison of the former for though they may sometimes appear as beautiful or strange they can have nothing in them of that vastness and immensity which afford so great an entertainment to the mind of the beholder  i had occasion formerly to observe that an introductory sentence should always be short and simple and contain no more matter than is necessary for opening the subject this sentence leads to a repetition of this observation as it contains both an assertion and the proof of that assertion two things which for the most part but especially at first setting out are with more advantage kept separate it would certainly have been better if this sentence had contained only the assertion ending with the word former and if a new one had then begun entering on the proofs of natures superiority over art which is the subject continued to the end of the paragraph the proper division of the period i shall point out after having first made a few observations which occur on different parts of it  if we consider the works  perhaps it might have been preferable if our author had begun with saying when we consider the works  discourse ought always to begin when it is possible with a clear proposition the if which is here employed converts the sentence into a supposition which is always in some degree entangling and proper to be used only when the course of reasoning renders it necessary as this observation however may perhaps be considered as overrefined and as the sense would have remained the same in either form of expression i do not mean to charge our author with any error on this account we cannot absolve him from inaccuracy in what immediately follows  the works of nature and art it is the scope of the author throughout this whole paper to compare nature and art together and to oppose them in several views to each other certainly therefore in the beginning he ought to have kept them as distinct as possible by interposing the preposition and saying the works of nature and of art as the words stand at present they would lead us to think that he is going to treat of these works not as contrasted but as connected as united in forming one whole when i speak of body and soul as united in the human nature i would interpose neither article nor preposition between them man is compounded of soul and body but the case is altered if i mean to distinguish them from each other then i represent them as separate and say i am to treat of the interests of the soul and of the body  though they may sometimes appear as beautiful or strange  i cannot help considering this as a loose member of the period it does not clearly appear at first what the antecedent is to they in reading onwards we see the works of art to be meant but from the structure of the sentence they might be understood to refer to the former as well as to the last in what follows there is a greater ambiguity  may sometimes appear as beautiful or strange it is very doubtful in what sense we are to understand as in this passage for according as it is accented in reading it may signify that they appear equally beautiful or strange to wit with the works of nature and then it has the force of the latin tam or it may signify no more than that they appear in the light of beautiful and strange and then it has the force of the latin tanquam without importing any comparison an expression so ambiguous is always faulty and it is doubly so here because if the author intended the former sense and meant as seems most probable to employ as for a mark of comparison it was necessary to have mentioned both the compared objects whereas only one member of the comparison is here mentioned viz the works of art and if he intended the latter sense as was in that case superfluous and encumbering and he had better have said simply appear beautiful or strange  the epithet strange which mr addison applies to the works of art cannot be praised strange works appears not by any means a happy expression to signify what he here intends which is new or uncommon  the sentence concludes with much harmony and dignity  they can have nothing in them of that vastness and immensity which afford so great an entertainment to the mind of the beholder there is here a fullness and grandeur of expression well suited to the subject though perhaps entertainment is not quite the proper word for expressing the effect which vastness and immensity have upon the mind reviewing the observations that have been made on this period it might i think with advantage be resolved into two sentences somewhat after this manner when we consider the works of nature and of art as they are qualified to entertain the imagination we shall find the latter very defective in comparison of the former the works of art may sometimes appear no less beautiful or uncommon than those of nature but they can have nothing of that vastness and immensity which so highly transport the mind of the beholder  the one proceeds our author in the next sentence may be as polite and delicate as the other but can never show herself so august and magnificent in the design  the one and the other in the first part of this sentence must unquestionably refer to the works of nature and of art for of these he had been speaking immediately before and with reference to the plural word works had employed the plural pronoun they but in the course of the sentence he drops this construction and passes very incongruously to the personification of art  can never show herself  to render his style consistent art and not the works of art should have been made the nominative in this sentence  art may be as polite and delicate as nature but can never show herself  polite is a term oftener applied to persons and to manners than to things and is employed to signify their being highly civilized polished or refined was the idea which the author had in view though the general turn of this sentence be elegant yet in order to render it perfect i must observe that the concluding words in the design should either have been altogether omitted or something should have been properly opposed to them in the preceding member of the period thus art may in the execution be as polished and delicate as nature but in the design can never show herself so august and magnificent  there is something more bold and masterly in the rough careless strokes of nature than in the nice touches and embellishments of art  this sentence is perfectly happy and elegant and carries in all the expressions that curiosa felicitas for which mr addison is so often remarkable bold and masterly are words applied with the utmost propriety the strokes of nature are finely oposed to the touches of art and the rough strokes to the nice touches the former painting the freedom and ease of nature and the other the diminutive exactness of art while both are introduced before us as different performers and their respective merits in execution very justly contrasted with each other  the beauties of the most stately garden or palace lie in a narrow compass the imagination immediately runs them over and requires something else to gratify her but in the wide fields of nature the sight wanders up and down with confinement and is fed with an infinite variety of images without any certain stint or number  this sentence is not altogether so correct and elegant as the former it carries however in the main the character of our authors style not strictly accurate but agreeable easy and unaffected enlivened too with a slight personification of the imagination which gives a gaiety to the period perhaps it had been better if this personification of the imagination with which the sentence is introduced had been continued throughout and not changed unnecessarily and even improperly into sight in the second member which is contrary both to unity and elegance it might have stood thus  the imagination immediately runs them over and requires something else to gratify her but in the wide fields of nature she wanders up and down without confinement  the epithet stately which the author uses in the beginning of the sentence applies with more propriety to palaces than to gardens the close of the sentence without any certain stint or number may be objected to as both superfluous and ungraceful it might perhaps have terminated better in this manner  she is fed with an infinite variety of images and wanders up and down without confinement  for this reason we always find the poet in love with a country life where nature appears in the greatest perfection and furnishes out all those scenes that are most apt to delight the imagination  there is nothing in this sentence to attract particular attention one would think it was rather the country than a country life on which the remark here made should rest a country life may be productive of simplicity of manners and of other virtues but it is to the country itself that the properties here mentioned belong of displaying the beauties of nature and furnishing those scenes which delight the imagination  but though there are several of these wild scenes that are more delightful than any artificial shows yet we find the works of nature still more pleasant the more they resemble those of art for in this case our pleasure rises from a double principle from the agreeableness of the objects to the eye and from their similitude to other objects we are pleased as well with comparing their beauties as with surveying them and can represent them to our minds either as copies or as originals hence it is that we take delight in a prospect which is well laid out and diversified with fields and meadows woods and rivers in those accidental landscapes of trees clouds and cities that are sometimes found in the veins of marble in the curious fretwork of rocks and grottos and in a word in any thing that has such a degree of variety and regularity as may seem the effect of design in what we call the works of chance  the style in the two sentences which compose this paragraph is smooth and perspicuous it lies open in some places to criticism but lest the reader should tire of what he may consider as petty remarks i shall pass over any which these sentences suggest the rather too as the idea which they present to us of natures resembling art of arts being considered as an original and nature as a copy seems not very distinct nor well brought out nor indeed very material to our authors purpose  if the products of nature rise in value according as they more or less resemble those of art we may be sure that artificial works receive a greater advantage from the resemblance of such as are natural because here the similitude is not only pleasant but the pattern more perfect  it is necessary to our present design to point out two considerable inaccuracies which occur in this sentence if the products he had better have said the productions of nature rise in value according as they more or less resemble those of art  does he mean that these productions rise in value both according as they more resemble and as they less resemble those of art his meaning undoubtedly is that they rise in value only according as they more resemble them and therefore either these words or less must be struck out or the sentence must run thus  productions of nature rise or sink in value according as they more or less resemble  the present construction of the sentence has plainly been owing to hasty and careless writing  the other inaccuracy is toward the end of the sentence and serves to illustrate a rule which i formerly gave concerning the position of adverbs the author says  because here the similitude is not only pleasant but the pattern more perfect here by the position of the adverb only we are led to imagine that he is going to give some other property of the similitude that it is not only pleasant as he says but more than pleasant it is useful or on some account or other valuable whereas he is going to oppose another thing to the similitude itself and not to this property of its being pleasant and therefore the right collocation beyond doubt was because here not only the similitude is pleasant but the pattern more perfect the contrast lying not between pleasant and more perfect but between similitude and pattern  much of the clearness and neatness of style depends on such attentions as these  the prettiest landscape i ever saw was one drawn on the walls of a dark room which stood opposite on one side to a navigable river and on the other to a park the experiment is very common in optics  in the description of the landscape which follows mr addison is abundantly happy but in this introduction to it he is obscure and indistinct one who had not seen the experiment of the camera obscura could comprehend nothing of what he meant and even after we understand what he points at we are at some loss whether to understand his description as of one continued landscape or of two different ones produced by the projection of two camera obscuras on opposite walls the scene which i am inclined to think mr addison here refers to is greenwich park with the prospect of the thames as seen by a camera obscura which is placed in a small room in the upper story of the observatory where i remember to have seen many years ago the whole scene here described corresponding so much to mr addisons account of it in this passage that at the time it recalled it to my memory as the observatory stands in the middle of the park it overlooks from one side both the river and the park and the objects afterward mentioned the ships the trees and the deer are presented in one view without needing any assistance from opposite walls put into plainer language the sentence might run thus the prettiest landscape i ever saw was one formed by a camera obscura a common optical instrument on the wall of a dark room which overlooked a navigable river and a park  here you might discover the waves and fluctuations of the water in strong and proper colors with the picture of a ship entering at one end and sailing by degrees through the whole piece on another there appeared the green shadows of trees waving to and fro with the wind and herds of deer among them in miniature leaping about upon the wall  bating one or two small inaccuracies this is beautiful and lively painting the principal inaccuracy lies in the connection of the two sentences here and on another i suppose the author meant on one side and on another side as it stands another is ungrammatical having nothing to which it refers but the fluctuations of the water the ship entering and sailing on by degrees the trees waving in the wind and the herds of deer among them leaping about is all very elegant and gives a beautiful conception of the scene meant to be described  i must confess the novelty of such a sight may be one occasion of its pleasantness to the imagination but certainly the chief reason is its nearer resemblance to nature as it does not only like other pictures give the color and figure but the motions of the things it represents  in this sentence there is nothing remarkable either to be praised or blamed in the conclusion instead of the things it represents the regularity of correct style requires the things which it represents in the beginning as one occasion and the chief reason are opposed to one another i should think it better to have repeated the same word  one reason of its pleasantness to the imagination but certainly the chief reason is etc  we have before observed that there is generally in nature something more grand and august than what we meet with in the curiosities of art when therefore we see this imitated in any measure it gives us a nobler and more exalted kind of pleasure than what we receive from the nicer and more accurate productions of art  it would have been better to have avoided terminating these two sentences in a manner so similar to each other curiosities of art  productions of art  on this account our english gardens are not so entertaining to the fancy as those in france and italy where we see a large extent of ground covered over with an agreeable mixture of garden and forest which represens every where an artificial rudeness much more charming than that neatness and elegance which we meet with in those of our own country  the expression represent every where an artificial rudeness is so inaccurate that i am inclined to think what stood in mr addisons manuscript must have been  present every where  for the mixture of garden and forest does not represent but actually exhibits or presents artificial rudeness that mixture represents indeed natural rudeness that is is designed to imitate it but it in reality is and presents artificial rudeness  it might indeed be of ill consequence to the public as well as unprofitable to private persons to alienate so much ground from pasturage and the plough in many parts of a country that is so well peopled and cultivated to a far greater advantage but why may not a whole estate be thrown into a kind of garden by frequent plantations that may turn as much to the profit as the pleasure of the owner a marsh overgrown with willows or a mountain shaded with oaks are not only more beautiful but more beneficial than when they lie bare and unadorned fields of corn make a pleasant prospect and if the walks were a little taken care of that lie between them and the natural embroidery of the meadows were helped and improved by some small additions of art and the several rows of hedges were set off by trees and flowers that the soil was capable of receiving a man might make a pretty landscape of his own possessions  the ideas here are just and the style is easy and perspicuous though in some places bordering on the careless in that passage for instance if the walks were a little taken care of that lie between them  one member is clearly out of its place and the turn of the phrase a little taken care of is vulgar and colloquial much better if it had run thus  if a little care were bestowed on the walks that lie between them  writers who have given us an account of china tell us the inhabitants of that country laugh at the plantations of our europeans which are laid out by the rule and the line because they say any one may place trees in equal rows and uniform figures they choose rather to show a genius in works of this nature and therefore always conceal the art by which they direct themselves they have a word it seems in their language by which they express the particular beauty of a plantation that thus strikes the imagination at first sight without discovering what it is that has so agreeable an effect  these sentences furnish occasion for no remark except that in the last of them particular is improperly used instead of peculiar  the peculiar beauty of a plantation that thus strikes the imagination was the phrase to have conveyed the idea which the author meant namely the beauty which distinguishes it from plantations of another kind  our british gardeners on the contrary instead of humouring nature love to deviate from it as much as possible our trees rise incones globes and pyramids we see the marks of the scissars on every plant and bush  these sentences are lively and elegant they make an agreeable diversity from the strain of those which went before and are marked with the hand of mr addison i have to remark only that in the phrase instead of humouring nature love to deviate from it  humouring and deviating are terms not properly opposed to each other a sort of personification of nature is begun in the first of them which is not supported in the second  to humouring was to have been opposed thwarting  or if deviating was kept following or going along with nature was to have been used  i do not know whether i am singular in my opinion but for my own part i would rather look upon a tree in all its luxuriancy and diffusion of boughs and branches than when it is thus cut and trimmed into a mathematical figure and cannot but fancy that an orchard in flower looks infinitely more delightful than all the little labyrinths of the most finished parterre  this sentence is extremely harmonious and every way beautiful it carries all the characteristics of our authors natural graceful and flowing language  a tree in all its luxuriancy and diffusion of boughs and branches is a remarkably happy expression the author seems to become luxuriant in describing an object which is so and thereby renders the sound a perfect echo to the sense  but as our great modellers of gardens have their magazines of plants to dispose of it is very natural in them to tear up all the beautiful plantations of fruit trees and contrive a plan that may most turn to their profit in taking off their evergreens and the like moveable plants with which their shops are plentifully stocked  an author should always study to conclude when it is in his power with grace and dignity it is somewhat unfortunate that this paper did not end as it might very well have done with the former beautiful period the impression left on the mind by the beauties of nature with which he had been entertaining us would then have been more agreeable but in this sentence there is a great falling off and we return with pain from those pleasing objects to the insignificant contents of a nurserymans shop  lecture xxiv critical examination of the style in a passage of dean swifts writings my design in the four preceding lectures was not merely to appretiate the merit of mr addisons style by pointing out the faults and the beauties that are mingled in the writings of that great author they were not composed with any view to gain the reputation of a critic but intended for the assistance of such as are desirous of studying the most proper and elegant construction of sentences in the english language to such it is hoped they may be of advantage as the proper application of rules respecting the style will always be best learned by means of the illustration which examples afford i conceived that examples taken from the writings of an author so justly esteemed would on that account not only be more attended to but would also produce this good effect of familiarising those who study composition with the style of a writer from whom they may upon the whole derive great benefit with the same view i shall in this lecture give one critical exercise more of the same kind upon the style of an author of a different character dean swift repeating the intimation i gave formerly that such as stand in need of no assistance of this kind and who therefore will naturally consider such minute discussions concerning the propriety of words and structure of sentences as beneath their attention had best pass over what will seem to them a tedious part of the work  i formerly gave the general character of dean swifts style he is esteemed one of our most correct writers his style is of the the plain and simple kind free of all affectation and all superfluity perspicuous manly and pure these are its advantages but we are not to look for much ornament and grace in it i am glad to find that in my judgment concerning this authors composition i have coincided with the opinion of a very able critic this easy and safe conveyance of meaning it was swifts desire to attain and for having attained he certainly deserves praise though perhaps not the highest praise for purposes merely didactic when something is to be told that was not known before it is in the highest degree proper but against that inattention by which known truths are suffered to be neglected it makes no provision it instructs but does not persuade johnsons lives of the poets in swift  on the contrary dean swift seems to have slighted and despised the ornaments of language rather than to have studied them his arrangement is often loose and negligent in elegant musical and figurative language he is much inferior to mr addison his manner of writing carries in it the character of one who rests altogether upon his sense and aims at no more than giving his meaning in a clear and concise manner  that part of his writings which i shall now examine is the beginning of his treatise entitled a proposal for correcting improving and ascertaining the english tongue in a letter addressed to the earl of oxford then lord high treasurer i was led by the nature of the subject to choose this treatise but in justice to the dean i must observe that after having examined it i do not esteem it one of his most correct productions but am apt to think it has been more hastily composed than some other of them it bears the title and form of a letter but it is however in truth a treatise designed for the public and therefore in examining it we cannot proceed upon the indulgence due to an epistolary correspondence when a man addresses himself to a friend only it is sufficient if he makes himself fully understood by him but when an author writes for the public whether he assume the form of an epistle or not we are always entitled to expect that he shall express himself with accuracy and care our author begins thus  what i had the honor of mentioning to your lordship sometime ago in conversation was not a new thought just then started by accident or occasion but the result of long reflection and i have been confirmed in my sentiments by the opinion of some very judicious persons with whom i consulted  the disposition of circumstances in a sentence such as serve to limit or to qualify some assertion or to denote time and place i formerly showed to be a matter of nicety and i observed that it ought to be always held a rule not to crowd such circumstances together but rather to intermix them with more capital words in such different parts of the sentence as can admit them naturally here are two circumstances of this kind placed together which had better have been separated some time ago in conversation  better thus  what i had the honor sometime ago of mentioning to your lordship in conversation  was not a new thought proceeds our author started by accident or occasion the different meaning of these two words may not at first occur they have however a distinct meaning and are properly used for it is one very laudable property of our authors style that it is seldom incumbered with superfluous synonymous words started by accident is fortuitously or at random started by occasion is by some incident which at that time gave birth to it his meaning is that it was not a new thought which either casually sprung up in his mind or was suggested to him for the first time by the train of the discourse but as he adds was the result of long reflection  he proceeds  they all agreed that nothing would be of greater use toward the improvement of knowledge and politeness than some effectual method for correcting enlarging and ascertaining our language and they think it a work very possible to be compassed under the protection of a prince the countenance and encouragement of a ministry and the care of proper persons chosen for such an undertaking  this is an excellent sentence clear and elegant the words are all simple well chosen and expressive and are arranged in the most proper order it is a harmonious period too which is a beauty not frequent in our author the last part of it consists of three members which gradually rise and swell above one another without any affected or unsuitable pomp  under the protection of a prince the countenance and encouragement of a ministry and the care of proper persons chosen for such an undertaking we may remark in the beginning of the sentence the proper use of the preposition toward  greater use toward the improvement of knowledge and politeness  importing the pointing or tendency of any thing to a certain end which could not have been so well expressed by the preposition for commonly employed in place of toward by authors who are less attentive than dean swift was to the force of words  one fault might perhaps be found both with this and the former sentence considered as introductory ones we expect that an introduction is to unfold clearly and directly the subject that is to be treated of in the first sentence our author had told us of a thought he mentioned to his lordship in conversation which had been the result of long reflection and concerning which he had consulted judicious persons but what that thought was we are never told directly we gather it indeed from the second sentence wherein he informs us in what these judicious persons agreed namely that some method for improving the language was both useful and practicable but this indirect method of opening the subject would have been very faulty in a regular treatise though the ease of the epistolary form which our author here assumes in addressing his patron may excuse it in the present case  i was glad to find your lordships answer in so different a style from what has commonly been made use of on the like occasions for some years past that all such thoughts must be deferred to a time of peace a topic which some have carried so far that they would not have us by any means think of preserving our civil and religious constitution because we are engaged in a war abroad  this sentence also is clear and elegant only there is one inaccuracy when he speaks of his lordships answer being in so different a style from what had formerly been used his answer to what or to whom for from any thing going before it does not appear that any application or address had been made to his lordship by those persons whose opinion was mentioned in the preceding sentence and to whom the answer here spoken of naturally refers there is a little indistinctness as i before observed in our authors manner of introducing his subject here  we may observe too that the phrase  glad to find your answer in so different a style  though abundantly suited to the language of conversation or of a familiar letter yet in regular composition requires an additional word  glad to find your answer run in so different a style  it will be among the distinguishing marks of your ministry my lord that you have a genius above all such regards and that no reasonable proposal for the honor the advantage or ornament of your country however foreign to your immediate office was ever neglected by you  the phrase  a genius above all such regards both seems somewhat harsh and does not clearly express what the author means namely the confined views of those who neglected every thing that belonged to the arts of peace in the time of war  bting this expression there is nothing that can be subject to the least reprehension in this sentence nor in all that follows to the end of the paragraph  i confess the merit of this candor and condescension is very much lessened because your lordship hardly leaves us room to offer our good wishes removing all our difficulties and supplying our wants faster than the most visionary projector can adjust his schemes and therefore my lord the design of this paper is not so much to offer you ways and means as to complain of a grievance the redressing of which is to be your own work as much as that of paying the nations debts or opening a trade into the south sea and though not of such immediate benefit as either of these or any other of your glorious actions yet perhaps in future ages not less to your honor  the compliments which the dean here pays to his patron are very high and strained and show that with all his surliness he was as capable on some occasions of making his court to a great man by flattery as other writers however with respect to the style which is the sole object of our present consideration every thing here as far as appears to me is faultless in these sentences and indeed throughout this paragraph in general which we have now ended our authors style appears to great advantage we see that ease and simplicity that correctness and distinctness which particularly characterise it it is very remarkable how few latinised words dean swift employs no writer in our language is so purely english as he is or borrows so little assistance from words of foreign derivation from none can we take a better model of the choice and proper significancy of words it is remarkable in the sentences we have now before us how plain all the expressions are and yet at the same time how significant and in the midst of that high strain of compliment into which he rises how little there is of pomp or glare of expression how very few writers can preserve this manly temperance of style or would think a compliment of this nature supported with sufficient dignity unless they had embellished it with some of those high sounding words whose chief effect is no other than to give their language a stiff and forced appearance  my lord i do here in the name of all the learned and polite persons of the nation complain to your lordship as first minister that our language is extremely imperfect that its daily improvements are by no means in proportion to its daily corruptions that the pretenders to polish and refine it have chiefly multiplied abuses and absurdities and that in many instances it offends against every part of grammar  the turn of this sentence is extremely elegant he had spoken before of a grievance for which he sought redress and he carries on the allusion by entering here directly on his subject in the style of a public representation presented to the minister of state one imperfection however there is in this sentence which luckily for our purpose serves to illustrate a rule before given concerning the position of adverbs so as to avoid ambiguity it is in the middle of the sentence  that the pretenders to polish and refine it have chiefly multiplied abuses and absurdities  now concerning the import of this adverb chiefly i ask whether it signifies that these pretenders to polish the language have been the chief persons who have multiplied its abuses in distinction from others or that the chief thing which these pretenders have done is to multiply the abuses of our language in opposition to their doing any thing to refine it these two meanings are really different and yet by the position which the word chiefly has in the sentence we are left at a loss in which to understand it the construction would lead us rather to the latter sense that the chief thing which these pretenders have done is to multiply the abuses of our language but it is more than probable that the former sense was what the dean intended as it carries more of his usual satirical edge that the pretended refiners of our language were in fact its chief corruptors on which supposition his words ought to have run thus that the pretenders to polish and refine it have been the chief persons to multiply its abuses and absurdities which would have rendered the sense perfectly clear  perhaps too there might be ground for observing farther upon this sentence that as language is the object with which it sets out that our language is extremely imperfect and then follows an enumeration concerning language in three particulars it had been better if language had been kept the ruling word or the nominative to every verb without changing the scene by making pretenders the ruling word as is done in the second member of the enumeration and then in the third returning again to the former word language  that the pretenders to polish  and that in many instances it offends  i am persuaded that the structure of the sentence would have been more neat and happy and its unity more complete if the members of it had been arranged thus that our language is extremely imperfect that its daily improvements are by no means in proportion to its daily corruptions that in many instances it offends against every part of grammar and that the pretenders to polish and refine it have been the chief persons to multiply its abuses and absurdities  this degree of attention seemed proper to be bestowed on such a sentence as this in order to show how it might have been conducted after the most perfect manner our author after having said  lest your lordship should think my censure too severe i shall take leave to be more particular proceeds in the following paragraph  i believe your lordship will agree with me in the reason why our language is less refined than those of italy spain or france  i am sorry to say that now we shall have less to commend in our author for the whole of this paragraph on which we are entering is in truth perplexed and inaccurate even in this short sentence we may discern an inaccuracy  why our language is less refined than those of italy spain and france putting the pronoun those in the plural when the antecedent substantive tow hich it refers is in the singular our language instances of this kind may sometimes be found in english authors but they sound harsh to the ear and are certainly contrary to the purity of grammar by a very little attention this inaccuracy could have been remedied and the sentence have been made to run much better in this way why our language is less refined than the italian spanish or french  it is plain that the latin tongue in its purity was never in this island toward the conquest of which few or no attempts were made till the time of claudius neither was that language ever so vulgar in britain as it is known to have been in gaul and spain  to say that the latin tongue in its purity was never in this island is very careless style it ought to have been was never spoken in this island in the progress of the sentence he means to give a reason why the latin was never spoken in its purity amongst us because our island was not conquered by the romans till after the purity of their tongue began to decline but this reason ought to have been brought out more clearly this might easily have been done and the relation of the several parts of the sentence to each other much better pointed out by means of a small variation thus it is plain that the latin tongue in its purity was never spoken in this island as few or no attempts toward the conquest of it were made till the time of claudius he adds neither was the language ever so vulgar in britain  vulgar was one of the worst words he could have chosen for expressing what he means here namely that the latin tongue was at no time so general or so much in common use in britain as it is known to have been in gaul and spain  vulgar when applied to language commonly signifies impure or debased language such as is spoken by the low people which is quite opposite to the authors sense here for in place of meaning to say that the latin spoken in britain was not so debased as what was spoken in gaul and spain he means just the contrary and had been telling us that we never were acquainted with the latin at all till its purity began to be corrupted  further we find that the roman legions here were at length all recalled to help their country against the goths and other barbarous invaders  the chief scope of this sentence is to give a reason why the latin tongue did not strike any deep root in this island on account of the short continuance of the romans in it he goes on  meantime the britons left to shift for themselves and daily harassed by cruel inroads from the picts were forced to call in the saxons for their defense who consequently reduced the greatest part of the island to their own power drove the britons into the most remote and mountainous parts and the rest of the country in customs religion and language became wholly saxon  this is a very exceptionable sentence frst the phrase left to shift for themselves is rather a low phrase and too much in the familiar style to be proper in a grave treatise next as the sentence advances  forced to call in the saxons for their defense who consequently reduced the greatest part of the island to their own power  what is the meaning of consequently here if it means afterward or in progress of time this certianly is not a sense in which consequently is often taken and therefore the expression is chargeable with obscurity the adverb consequently in its most common acceptance denotes one thing following from another as an effect from a cause if he uses it in this sense and means that the britons being subdued by the saxons was a necessary consequence of their having called in the these saxons to their assistane this consequence is drawn too abruptly and needed more explanation for though it has often happened that nations have been subdued by their own auxiliaries yet this is not a consequence of such a nature that it can be assumed as seems here to be done for a first and selfevident principle  but further what shall we say to this phrase reduced the greatest part of the island to their own power we say reduce to rule reduce to practice  we can say that one nation reduces another to subjection  but when dominion or power is used we always as far as i know say reduce under their power reduce to their power is so harsh and uncommon an expression that though dean swifts authority in language be very great yet in the use of this phrase i am of opinion that it would not be safe to follow his example  besides these particular inaccuracies this sentence is chargeable with want of unity in the composition of the whole the persons and the scene are too often changed upon us  first the britons are mentioned who are harrassed by inroads from the picts next the saxons appear who subdue the greatest part of the island and drive the britons into the mountains and lastly the rest of the country is introduced and a description given of the change made upon it all this forms a groupe of various objects presented in such quick succession that the mind finds it difficult to comprehend them under one view accordingly it is quoted in the elements of criticism as an instance of a sentence rendered faulty by the breach of unity  this i take to be the reason why there are more latin words remaining in the british than the old saxon which excepting some few variations in the orthography is the same in most original words with our present english as well as with the german and other northern dialects  this sentence is faulty somewhat in the same manner with the last it is loose in the connection of its parts and besides this it is also too loosely connected with the preceding sentence what he had there said concerning the saxons expelling the britons and changing the customs the religion and the language of the country is a clear and good reason for our present language being saxon rather than british this is the inference which we would naturally expect him to draw from the premises just before laid down but when he tells us that this is the reason why there are more latin words remaining in the british tongue than in the old saxon we are presently at a stand no reason for this inference appears if it can be gathered at all from the foreign deduction it is gathered only imperfectly for as he had told us that the britons had some conection with the romans he should have also told us in order to make out his inference that the saxons never had any the truth is the whole of this paragraph concerning the influence of the latin tongue upon ours is careless perplexed and obscure his argument required to have been more fully unfolded in order to make it be distinctly apprehended and to give it its due force in the next paragraph he proceeds to discourse concerning the influence of the french tongue upon our language the style becomes more clear though not remarkable for great beauty or elegance  edward the confessor having lived long in france appears to be the first who introduced any mixture of the french tongue with the saxon the court affecting what the prince was fond of and others taking it up for a fashion as it is now with us william the conqueror proceeded much further bringing over with him vast numbers of that nation scattering them in every monastery giving them great quantities of land directing all pleadings to be in that language and endeavoring to make it universal in the kingdom  on these two sentences i have nothing of moment to observe the sense is brought out clearly and in simple unaffected language  this at least is the opinion generally received but your lordship has fully convinced me that the french tongue made yet a greater progress here under harry the second who had large territories on that continent both from his father and his wife made frequent journeys and expeditions thither and was always attended with a number of his countrymen retainers at court  in the beginning of this sentence our author states an opposition between an opi nion generally received and that of his lordship and in compliment to his patron he tells us that his lordship had convinced him of somewhat that differed from the general opinion thus one must naturally understand his words this at least is the opinion generally received but your lordship has fully convinced me  now here there must be an inaccuracy of expression for on examining what went before there appears no sort of opposition betwixt the generally received opinion and that of the authors patron the general opinion was that william the conqueror had proceeded much farther than edward the confessor in propagating the french language and had endeavored to make it universal lord oxfords opinion was that the french tongue had gone on to make a yet greater progress under harry the second than it had done under his predecessor william which two opinions are as entirely consistent with one another as any can be and therefore the opposition here affected to be stated between them by the adversative particle but was improper and groundless  for some centuries after there was a constant intercourse between france and england by the dominions we possessed there and the conquests we made so that our language between two and three hundred years ago seems to have had a greater mixture with french than at present many words having been afterward rejected and same since the days of spenser although we have still retained not a few which have been long antiquated in france  this is a sentence too long and intricate and liable to the same objection that was made to a former one of the want of unity it consists of four members each divided from the subsequent by a semicolon in going along we naturally expect the sentence is to end at the second of these or at farthest at the third when to our surprise a new member pops out upon us and fatigues our attention in joining all the parts together such a structure of a sentence is always the mark of careless writing in the first member of the sentence a constant intercourse between france and england by the dominions we possessed there and the conquests we made the construction is not sufficiently filled up in place of intercourse by the dominions we possessed it should have been  by reason of the dominions we possessed  or  occasioned by the dominions we possessed  and in place of  the dominions we possessed there and the conquests we made the regular style is  the dominions which we possessed there and the conquests which we made the relative pronoun which is indeed in phrases of this kind sometimes omitted but when it is omitted the style becomes elliptic and though in conversation or in the very light and easy kinds of writing such elliptic style may not be improper yet in grave and regular writing it is better to fill up the construction and insert the relative pronoun  after having said  i could produce several instances of both kinds if it were of any use or entertainment  our author begins the next paragraph thus  to examine into the several circumstances by which the language of a country may be altered would force me to enter into a wide field  there is nothing remarkable in this sentence unless that here occurs the first instance of a metaphor since the beginning of this treatise entering into a wide field being put for beginning an extensive subject few writers deal less in figurative language than swift i before observed that he appears to despise ornaments of this kind and though this renders his style somewhat dry on serious subjects yet his plainness and simplicity i must not forbear to remind my readers is far preferable to an estentatious and affected parade of ornament  i shall only observe that the latin the french and the english seem to have undergone the same fortune the first from the days of romulus to those of julius caesar suffered perpetual changes and by what we meet in those authors who occasionally speak on that subject as well as from certain fragments of old laws it is manifest that the latin three hundred years before tully was as unintelligible in his time as the french and english of the same period are now and these two have changed as much since william the conqueror which is but little less than  00 years as the latin appears to have done in the like term  the dean plainly appears to be writing negligently here this sentence is one of that involved and intricate kind of which some instances have occured before but none worse than this it requires a very distinct head to comprehend the whole meaning of the period at first reading in one part of it we find extreme carelessness of expression he says it is manifest that the latin  00 years before tully was as unintelligible in his time as the english and french of the same period are now by the english and french of the same period must naturally be understood the english and french that were spoken three hundred years before tully this is the only grammatical meaning his words will bear and yet assuredly what he means and what it would have been easy for him to have expressed with more precision is the english and french that were spoken  00 years ago or at a period equally distant from our age as the old latin which he had mentioned was from the age of tully but when an author writes hastily and does not review with proper care what he has written many such inaccuracies will be apt to creep into his style  whether our language or the french will decline as fast as the roman did is a question that would perhaps admit more debate than it is worth there were many reasons for the corruptions of the last as the change of their government to a tyranny which ruined the study of eloquence there being no further use or encouragement for popular orators their giving not only the freedom of the city but capacity for employments to several towns in gaul spain and germany and other distant parts as far asia which brought a great number of foreign pretenders to rome the slavish disposition of the senate and people by which the wit and eloquence of the age were wholly turned into panegyric the most barren of all subjects the great corruption of manners and introduction of foreign luxury with foreign terms to express it with several others that might be assigned not to mention the invasion from the goths and vandals which are too obvious to insist on  in the enumeration here made of the causes contributing toward the corruption of the roman language there are many inaccuracies  the change of their government to a tyranny  of whose government he had indeed been speaking of the roman language and therefore we guess at his meaning but the style is ungrammatical for he had not mentioned the romans themselves and therefore when he says their government there is no antecedent in the sentence to which the pronoun their can refer with any propriety  giving the capacity for employments to several towns in gaul is a questionable expression for though towns are sometimes put for the people who inhabit them yet to give a town the capacity for employments sounds harsh and uncouth  the wit and eloquence of the age wholly turned into panegyric is a phrase which does not well express the meaning neither wit nor eloquence can be turned into panegyric but they may be turned toward panegyric or employed in panegyric which was the sense the author had in view  the conclusion of the enumeration is visibly incorrect  the great corruption of manners and introduction of foreign luxury with foreign terms to express it with several others that might be assigned  he means with several other reasons the word reasons had indeed been mentioned before but as it stands at the distance of thirteen lines backward the repetition of it here became indispensable in order to avoid ambiguity not to mention he adds the invasions front the goths and vandals which are too obvious to insist on one would imagine him to mean that the invasions from the goths and vandals are historical facts too well known and obvious to be insisted on but he means quite a different thing though he has not taken the proper  of expressing it through his haste  finish the paragraph namely  invasions from the goths and vandals were causes of the corruption of the roman language too obvious to be insisted on  i shall not pursue this criticism any further i have been obliged to point out many inaccuracies in the passage which we have considered but in order that my observations may not be constructed as meant to depreciate the style or the writings of dean swift below their just value there are two remarks which i judge it necessary to make before concluding this lecture one is that it were unfair to estimate an authors style on the whole by some passage in his writings which chances to be composed in a careless manner this is the case with respect to this treatise which has much the appearance of a hasty production though as i before observed it was by no means on that account that i pitched upon it for the subject of this exercise but after having examined it i am sensible that in many other of his writings the dean is more accurate  my other observation which applies equally to dean swift and mr addison is that there may be writers much freer of such inaccuracies as i have had occasion to point out in these two whose style however upon the whole may not have half their merit refinement in language has of late years begun to be much attended to in several modern productions of very small value i should find it difficult to point out many errors in language the words might probably be all proper words correctly and clearly arranged and the turn of the sentence sonorous and musical whilst yet the style upon the whole might deserve no praise the fault often lies in what may be called the general cast or complexion of the style which a person of a good taste discerns to be vicious to be feeble for instance and diffuse flimsy or affected petulant or ostentatious though the faults cannot be so easily pointed out and particularised as when they lie in some erroneous or negligent construction of a sentence whereas such writers as addison and swift carry always those general characters of good style which in the midst of their occasional negligences every person of good taste must discern and approve we see their faults overbalanced by higher beauties we see a writer of sense and reflection expressing his sentiments without affectation attentive to thoughts as well as to words and in the main current of his language elegant and beautiful and therefore the only proper use to be made of the blemishes which occur in the writings of such authors is to point out to those who apply themselves to the study of composition some of the rules which they ought to observe for avoiding such errors and to render them sensible of the necessity of strict attention to language and to style let them imitate the ease and simplicity of those great authors let them study to be always natural and as far as they can always correct in their expressions let them endeavor to be at some times lively and striking but carefully avoid being at any time ostentatious and affected  lecture xxv eloquence or public speaking  history of eloquence  grecian eloquence  demosthenes having finished that part of the course which relates to language and style we are now to ascend a step higher and to examine the subjects upon which style is employed i begin with what is properly called eloquence or public speaking in treating of this i am to consider the different kinds and subjects of public speaking the manner suited to each the proper distribution and management of all the parts of a discourse and the proper pronunciation or delivery of it but before entering on any of these heads it may be proper to take a view of the nature of eloquence in general and of the state in which it has subsisted in different ages and countries this will lead into some detail but i hope an useful one as in every art it is of great consequence to have a just idea of the perfection of the art of the end at which it aims and of the progress which it has made among mankind  of eloquence in particular it is the more necessary to ascertain the proper notion because there is not any thing concerning which false notions have been more prevalent hence it has been so often and is still at this day in disrepute with many when you speak to a plain man of eloquence or in praise of it he is apt to hear you with very little attention he conceives eloquence to signify a certain trick of speech the art of varnishing weak arguments plausibly or of speaking so as to please and tickle the ear give me good sense says he and keep your eloquence for boys he is in the right if eloquence were what he conceives it to be it would be then a very contemptible art indeed below the study of any wise or good man but nothing can be more remote from truth to be truly eloquent is to speak to the purpose for the best definition which i think can be given of eloquence is the art of speaking in such a manner as to attain the end for which we speak whenever a man speaks or writes he is supposed as a rational being to have some end in view either to inform or to amuse or to persuade or in some way or other to act upon his fellow creatures he who speaks or writes in such a manner as to adapt all his words most effectually to that end is the most eloquent man whatever then the subject be there is room for eloquence in history or even in philosophy as well as in orations the definition which i have given of eloquence comprehends all the different kinds of it whether calculated to instruct to persuade or to please but as the most important subject of discourse is action or conduct the power of eloquence chiefly appears when it is employed to influence conduct and persuade to action as it is principally with reference to this end that it becomes the object of art eloquence may under this view of it be defined the art of persuasion  this being once established certain consequences immediately follow which point out the fundamental maxims of the art it follows clearly that in order to persuade the most essential requisites are solid argument clear method a character of probity appearing in the speaker joined with such graces of style and utterance as shall draw our attention to what he says good sense is the foundation of all no man can be truly eloquent without it for fools can persuade none but fools in order to persuade a man of sense you must first convince him which is only to be done by satisfying his understanding of the reasonableness of what you propose to him  this leads me to observe that convincing and persuading though they are sometimes confounded import notwithstanding different things which it is necessary for us at present to distinguish from each other conviction affects the understanding only persuasion the will and the practice it is the business of the philosopher to convince me of truth it is the business of the orator to persuade me to act agreeably to it by engaging my affections on its side conviction and persuasion do not always go together they ought indeed to go together and would do so if our inclination regularly followed the dictates of our understanding but as our nature is constituted i may be convinced that virtue justice or public spirit are laudable while at the same time i am not persuaded to act according to them the inclination may revolt though the understanding be satisfied the passions may prevail against the judgment conviction is however always one avenue to the inclination or heart and it is that which an orator must first bend his strength to gain for no persuasion is likely to be stable which is not founded on conviction but in order to persuade the orator must go farther than merely producing conviction he must consider man as a creature moved by many different springs and must act upon them all he must address himself to the passions he must paint to the fancy and touch the heart and hence besides solid argument and clear method all the conciliating and interesting arts both of composition and pronunciation enter into the idea of eloquence  an objection may perhaps hence be formed against eloquence as an art which may be employed for persuading to ill as well as to good there is no doubt that it may and so reasoning may also be and too often is employed for leading men into error but who would think of forming an argument from this against the cultivation of our reasoning powers reason eloquence and every art which ever has been studied among mankind may be abused and may prove dangerous in the hands of bad men but it were perfectly childish to contend that upon this account they ought to be abrogated give truth and virtue the same arms which you give vice and falsehood and the former are likely to prevail eloquence is no invention of the schools nature teaches every man to be eloquent when he is much in earnest place him in some critical situation let him have some great interest at stake and you will see him lay hold of the most effectual means of persuasion the art of oratory proposes nothing more than to follow out that track which nature has first pointed out to men and the more exactly that this track is pursued the more that eloquence is properly studied the more shall we be guarded against the abuse which bad men make of it and enabled the better to distinguish between true eloquence and the tricks of sophistry  we may distinguish three kinds or degrees of eloquence the first and lowest is that which aims only at pleasing the hearers such generally is the eloquence of panegyricks inaugural orations addresses to great men and other harangues of this sort this ornamental sort of eomposition is not altogether to be rejected it may innocently amuse and entertain the mind and it may be mixed at the same time with very useful sentiments but it must be confessed that where the speaker has no farther aim than merely to shine and to please there is great danger of art being strained into ostentation and of the composition becoming tiresome and languid  a second and a higher degree of loquence is when the speaker aims not merely to please but also to inform to instruct to convince when his art is exerted in removing prejudiees against himself and his cause in choosing the most proper arguments stating them with the greatest force arranging them in the best order expressing and delivering them with propriety and beauty and thereby disposing us to pass that judgment or embrace that side of the cause to which he seeks to bring us within this compass chiefly is employed the eloquence of the bar  but there is a third and still higher degree of eloquence wherein a greater power is exerted over the human mind by which we are not only convinced but are interested agitated and carried along with the speaker our passions are made to rise together with his we enter into all his emotions we love we detest we resent according as he inspires us and are prompted to resolve or to act with vigor and warmth debate in popular assemblies opens the most illustrious field to this species of eloquence and the pulpit also admits it  i am here to observe and the observation is of consequence that the high eloquence which i have last mentioned is always the offspring of passion by passion i mean that state of the mind in which it is agitated and fired by some object it has in view a man may convince and even persuade others to act by mere reason and argument but that degree of eloquence which gains the admiration of mankind and properly denominates one an orator is never found without warmth or passion passion when in such a degree as to rouse and kindle the mind without throwing it out of the possession of itself is universally found to exalt all the human powers it renders the mind infinitely more enlightened more penetrating more vigorous and masterly than it is in its calm moments a man actuated by a strong passion becomes much greater than he is at other times he is conscious of more strength and force he utters greater sentiments conceives higher designs and executes them with a boldness and a felicity of which on other occasions he could not think himself capable but chiefly with respect to persuasion is the power of passion felt almost every man in passion is eloquent then he is at no loss for words and arguments he transmits to others by a sort of contagious sympathy the warm sentiments which he feels his looks and gestures are all persuasive and nature here shows herself infinitely more powerful than all art this is the foundation of that just and noted rule si vis me flere dolendum est primum ipsi tibi  this principle being once admitted that all high eloquence flows from passion several consequences follow which deserve to be attended to and the mention of which will serve to confirm the principle itself for hence the universally acknowledged effect of enthusiasm or warmth of any kind in public speakers for affecting their audience hence all labored declamation and affected ornaments of style which show the mind to be cool and unmoved are so inconsistent with persuasive eloquence hence all studied prettinessess in gesture or pronunciation detract so greatly from the weight of a speaker hence a discourse that is read moves us less than one that is spoken as having less the appearance of coming warm from the heart hence to call a man cold is the same thing as to say that he is not eloquent hence a skeptical man who is always in suspense and feels nothing strongly or a cunning mercenary man who is suspected rather to assume the appearance of passion than to feel it have so little power over men in public speaking hence in fine the necessity of being and being believed to be disinterested and in earnest in order to persuade  these are some of the capital ideas which have occured to me concerning eloquence in general and with which i have thought proper to begin as the foundation of much of what i am afterward to suggest from what i have already said it is evident that eloquence is a high talent and of great importance in society and that it requires both natural genius and much improvement from art viewed as the art of persuasion it requires in its lowest state soundness of understanding and considerable acquaintance with human nature and in its higher degrees it requires moreover strong sensibility of mind a warm and lively imagination joined with correctness of judgment and an extensive command of the power of language to which must also be added the graces of pronunciation and delivery  let us next proceed to consider in what state eloquence has subsisted in different ages and nations  it is an observation made by several writers that eloquence is to be looked for only in free states longinus in particular at the end of his treatise on the sublime when assigning the reason why so little sublimity of genius appeared in the age wherein he lived illustrates this observation with a great deal of beauty liberty he remarks is the nurse of true genius it animates the spirit and invigorates the hopes of men excites honorable emulation and a desire of excelling in every art all other qualifications he says you may find among those who are deprived of liberty but never did a slave become an orator he can only be a pompous flatterer now though this reasoning be in the main true it must however be understood with some limitations for under arbitrary governments if they be of the civilized kind and give encouragement to the arts ornamental eloquence may flourish remarkably witness france at this day where ever since the reign of louis xiv more of what may justly be called eloquence within a certain sphere is to be found than perhaps in any other nation of europe though freedom be enjoyed by some of them in a much greater degree their sermons and orations pronounced on public occasions are not only polite and elegant harangues but several of them are uncommonly spirited animated with bold figures and rise to a degree of the sublime their eloquence however in general must be confessed to be of the flowery rather than the vigorous kind calculated more to please and soothe than to convince and persuade high manly and forcible eloquence is indeed to be looked for only or chiefly in the regions of freedom under arbitrary governments besides the general turn of softness and effeminacy which such governments may be justly supposed to give to the spirit of a nation the art of speaking cannot be such an instrument of ambition business and power as it is in more democratical states it is confifed within a narrower range it can be exerted only in the pulpit or at the bar but is excluded from those great scenes of public business where the spirits of men have the freest play where important affairs are transacted and persuasion of course is more seriously studied wherever man can acquire most power over man by means or reason and discourse which certainly is under a free state of government there we may naturally expect that true eloquence will be best understood and carried to the greatest height  hence in tracing the rise of oratory we need not attempt to go far back into the early ages of the world or search for it among the monuments of eastern or egyptian antiquity in those ages there was indeed an eloquence of a certain kind but it approached nearer to poetry than to what we properly call oratory there is reason to believe as i formerly showed that the language of the first ages was passionate and metaphorical owing partly to the scanty stock of words of which speech then consisted and partly to the tincture which language naturally takes from the savage and uncultivated state of men agitated by unrestrained passions and struck by events which to them are strange and surprising in this state rapture and enthusiasm the parents of poetry had an ample field but while the intercourse of men was as yet unfrequent and force and strength were the chief means employed in deciding controversies the arts of oratory and persuasion of reasoning and debate could be but little known the first empires that arose the assyrian and egyptian were of the despotic kind the whole power was in the hands of one or at most of a few the multitude were accustomed to a blind reverence they were led not persuaded and none of those refinements of society which make public speaking an object of importance were as yet introduced  it is not till the rise of the grecian republics that we find any remarkable appearances of eloquence as the art of persuasion and these gave it such a field as it never had before and perhaps has never had again since that time and therefore as the grecian eloquence has ever been the object of admiration to those who have studied the powers of speech it is necessary that we fix our attention for a little on this period  greece was divided into a multitude of petty states these were governed at first by kings who were called tyrants and who being in succession expelled from all these states there sprung up a great number of democratical governments sounded nearly on the same plan animated by the same high spirit of freedom mutually jealous and rivals of each other we may compute the flourishing period of those grecian states to have lasted from the battle of marathon till the time of alexander the great who subdued the liberties of greece a period which comprehends about   0 years and within which are to be found most of their celebrated poets and philosophers but chiefly their orators for though poetry and philosophy were not extinct among them after that period yet eloquence hardly made any figure  of these grecian republics the most noted by far for eloquence and indeed for arts of every kind was that of athens the athenians were an ingenious quick sprightly people practiced in business and sharpened by frequent and sudden revolutions which happened in their government the genius of their government was entirely democratical their legislature consisted of the whole body of the people they had indeed a senate of five hundred but in the general convention of the citizens was placed the last resort and affairs were conducted there altogether by reasoning speaking and a skilful application to the passions and interests of a popular assembly there laws were made peace and war decreed and thence the magistrates were chosen for the highest honors of the state were alike open to all nor was the meanest tradesman excluded from a seat in their supreme courts in such a state eloquence it is obvious would be much studied as the surest means of rising to influence and power and what sort of eloquence not that which was brilliant merely and showy but that which was found upon trial to be most effectual for convincing interesting and persuading the hearers for there public speaking was not a mere competition for empty applause but a serious contention for that public leading which was the great object both of the men of ambition and the men of virtue  among a nation so enlightened and acute and where the highest attention was paid to every thing elegant in the arts we may naturally expect to find the public taste refined and judicious accordingly it was improved to such a degree that the attic taste and attic manner have passed into a proverb it is true that ambitious demagogues and corrupt orators did sometimes dazzle and mislead the people by a showy but false eloquence for the athenians with all their acuteness were factious and giddy and great admirers of every novelty but when some important interest drew their attention when any great danger roused them and put their judgment to a serious trial they commonly distinguished very justly between genuine and spurious eloquence and hence demosthenes triumphed over all his opponents because he spoke always to the purpose affected no insignificant parade of words used weighty arguments and showed them clearly where their interest lay in critical conjunctures of the state when the public was alarmed with some pressing danger when the people were assembled and proclamation was made by the crier for any one to rise and deliver his opinion upon the present situation of affairs empty declamation and sophistical reasoning would not only have been hissed but resented and punished by an assembly so intelligent and accustomed to business their greatest orators trembled on such occasions when they rose to address the people as they knew they were to be held answerable for the issue of the counsel which they gave the most liberal endowments of the greatest princes never could found such a school for true oratory as was formed by the nature of the athenian republic eloquence there sprung native and vigorous from amidst the contentions of faction and freedom of public business and of active life and not from that retirement and speculation which we are apt sometimes to fancy more favorable to eloquence than they are found to be  pysistratus who was cotemporary with solon and subverted his plan of government is mentioned by plutarch as the first who distinguished himself among the athenians by application to the arts of speech his ability in these arts he employed for raising himself to the sovereign power which however when he had attained he exercised with moderation of the orators who flourished between his time and the peloponnesian war no particular mention is made in history pericles who died about the beginning of that war was properly the first who carried eloquence to a great height to such a height indeed that it does not appear he was ever afterward surpassed he was more than an orator he was also a statesman and a general expert in business and of consummate address for forty years he governed athens with absolute sway and historians ascribe his influence not more to his political talents than to his eloquence which was of that forcible and vehement kind that bore every thing before it and triumphed over the passions and affections of the people hence he had the surname of olympias given him and it was said that like jupiter he thundered when he spoke though his ambition be liable to censure yet great virtues certainly he had and it was the confidence which the people reposed in his integrity that gave such power to his eloquence a circumstance without which the influence of public speaking in a popular state can seldom go far he appears to have been generous magnanimous and public spirited he raised no fortune to himself he expended indeed great sums of the public money but chiefly on public works and at his death is said to have valued himself principally on having never obliged any citizen to wear mourning on his account during his long administration it is a remarkable particular recorded of pericles by suidas that he was the first athenian who composed and put into writing a discourse designed for the public  posterior to pericles in the course of the peloponnesian war arose cleon alcibiades critias and theramenes eminent citizens of athens who were all distinguished for their eloquence they were not orators by profession they were not formed by schools but by a much more powerful education that of business and debate where man sharpened man and civil affairs carried on by public speaking called forth every exertion of the mind the manner or style of oratory which then prevailed we learn from the orations in the history of thucydides who also flourished in the same age it was manly vehement and concise even to some degree of obscurity grandes erant verbis says cicero crebri sententiis compressione rerum breves et ob eam ipsam causam interdum subobscuri they were magnificent in their expressions they abounded in thought they compressed their matter into few words and by their brevity were sometimes obscure  a manner very different from what in modern times we would conceive to be the style of popular oratory and which tends to give a high idea of the acuteness of thsoe audiences to which they spoke  the power of eloquence having after the days of pericles become an object of greater consequence than ever this gave birth to a set of men till then unknown called rhetoricians and sometimes sophists who arose in multitudes during the peloponnesian war such as protagoras prodicas thrasymus and one who was more eminent than all the rest gorgias of leontium these sophists joined to their art of rhetoric a subtle logic and were generally a sort of metaphysical skeptics gorgias however was a professed master of eloquence only his reputation was prodigious he was highly venerated in leontium of sicily his native city and money was coined with his name upon it in the latter part of his life he established himself at athens and lived till he had attained the age of  0  years hermogenes de ideis l ii cap   has preserved a fragment of his from which we see his style and manner it is extremely quaint and artificial full of antithesis and pointed expression and shows how far the grecian subtilty had already carried the study of language these rhetoricians did not content themselves with delivering general instructions concerning eloquence to their pupils and endeavoring to form their taste but they professed the art of giving them receipts for making all sorts of orations and of teaching them how to speak for and against every cause whatever upon this plan they were the first who treated of common places and the artificial invention of arguments and topics for every subject in the hands of such men we may easily believe that oratory would degenerate from the masculine strain it had hitherto held and become a trifling and sophistical art and we may justly deem them the first corrupters of true eloquence to them the great socrates opposed himself by a profound but simple reasoning peculiar to himself he exploded their sophistry and endeavored to recall mens attention from that abuse of reasoning and discourse which began to be in vogue to natural language and sound and useful thought  in the same age though somewhat later than the philosopher abovementioned flourished isocrates whose writings are still extant he was a professed rhetorician and by teaching eloquence he acquired both a great fortune and higher fame than any of his rivals in that profession no contemptible orator he was his orations are full of morality and good sentiments they are flowing and smooth but too destitute of vigor he never engaged in public affairs nor pleaded causes and accordingly his orations are calculated only for the shade pompae cicero allows magis quam pugnae aptior ad voluptatem aurium accommodatus potius quam ad judiciorum certamen more fitted for show than for debate better calculated for the amusement of an audience than for judicial contests  the style of gorgias of leontium was formed into short sentences composed generally of two members balanced against each other the style of isocrates on the contrary is swelling and full and he is said to be the first who introduced the method of composing in regular periods which had a studied music and harmonious cadence a manner which he has carried to a vicious excess what shall we think of an orator who employed ten years in composing one discourse still extant entitled the panegyric how much frivolous care must have been bestowed on all the minute elegance of words and sentences dionysius of halicarnassus has given us upon the orations of isocrates as also upon those of some other greek orators a full and regular treatise which is in my opinion one of the most judicious pieces of ancient criticism extant and very worthy of being consulted he commends the splendour of isocratess style and the morality of his sentiments but severely censures his affectation and the uniform regular cadence of all his sentences he holds him to be a florid declaimer not a natural persuasive speaker cicero in his critical works though he admits his failings yet discovers a propensity to be very favorable to that plena ac numerosa oration that swelling and musical style which isocrates introduced and with the love of which cicero himself was perhaps somewhat infected in one of his treatise orat ad m brut he informs us that his friend brutus and he differed in this particular and that brutus found fault with his partiality to isocrates the manner of isocrates generally catches young people when they begin to attend to composition and it is very natural that it should do so it gives them an idea of that regularity cadence and magnificence of style which fills the ear but when they come to write or speak for the world they will find this ostentatious manner unfit either for carrying on business or commanding attention it is said that the high reputation of isocrates prompted aristotle who was nearly his cotemporary or lived but a little after him to write his institutions of rhetoric which are indeed formed upon a plan of eloquence very different from that of isocrates and the rhetoricians of that time he seems to have had it in view to direct the attention of orators much more toward convincing and affecting their hearers than toward the musical cadence of periods  is aeus and lysias some of whose orations are preserved belong also to this period lysias was somewhat earlier than isocrates and is the modle of that manner which the ancients call the tenuis vel subtilis he has none of isocratess pomp he is every where pure and attic in the highest degree simple and unaffected but wants force and is sometimes frigid in his compositions in the judicious comparison which dionysius of halicarnassus makes of the merits of lysias and isocrates he ascribes to lysias as the distinguishing character of his manner a certain grace or elegance arising from simplicity  the style of lysias has gracefulness for its nature that of isocrates seeks to have it in the art of narration as distinct probable and persuasive he holds lysias to be superior to all orators at the same time he admits that his composition is more adapted to private litigation than to great subjects he convinces but he does not elevate nor animate the magnificence and splendour of isocrates is more suited to great occasions he is more agreeable than lysias and in dignity of sentiment far excels him with regard to the affectation which is visible in isocrates manner he concludes what he says of it with the following excellent observations which should never be forgotten by any who aspire to be true orators  judic de isocrate     his studied circumflexion of periods and juvenile affectation of the flowers of speech i do not approve the thought is frequently made subservient to the music of the sentence and elegance is preferred to reason whereas in every discourse where business and affairs are concerned nature ought to be followed and nature certainly dictates that the expression should be an object subordinate to the sense not the sense to the expression when one rises to give public counsel concerning war and peace or takes the charge of a private man who is standing at the bar to be tried for his life those studied decorations those theatrical graces and juvenile flowers are out of place instead of being of service they are detrimental to the cause we espouse when the contest is of a serious kind ornaments which at another time would have beauty then lose their effect and prove hostile to the affections which we wish to raise in our hearers  isaeus is chiefly remarkable for being the master of the great demosthenes in whom it must be acknowledged eloquence shone forth with higher splendour than perhaps in any that ever bore the name of an orator and whose manner and character therefore must deserve our particular attention  i shall not spend any time upon the circumstances of demostheness life they are well known the strong ambition which he discovered to excel in the art of speaking the unsuccessfulness of his first attempts his unwearied perseverance in surmounting all the disadvantages that arose from his person and address his shutting himself up in a cave that he might study with less distraction his declaiming by the seashore that he might accustom himself to the noise of a tumultuous assembly and with pebbles in his mouth that he might correct a defect in his speech his practicing at home with a naked sword hanging over his shoulder that he might check an ungraceful motion to which he was subject all those circumstances which we learn from plutarch are very encouraging to such as study eloquence as they show how far art and application may avail for acquiring an excellence which nature seemed unwilling to grant us  despising the affected and florid manner which the rhetoricians of that age followed demosthenes returned to the forcible and manly eloquence of pericles and strength and vehemence form the principle characteristics of his style never had orator a finer field than domesthenes in his olynthiacs and philippics which are his capital orations and no doubt to the nobleness of the subject and to that integrity and public spirit which eminently breathe in them they are indebted for much of their merit the subject is to rouse the indignation of his countrymen against philip of macedon the public enemy of the liberties of greece and to guard them against the insidious measures by which that crafty prince endeavored to lay them asleep to danger in the prosecution of this end we see him taking every proper method to animate a people renowned for justice humanity and valor but in many instances become corrupt and degenerate he boldly taxes them with their venality their indolence and indifference to the public cause while at the same time with all the art of an orator he recals the glory of their ancestors to their thoughts shows them that they are still a flourishing and a powerful people the natural protectors of the liberty of greece and who wanted only the inclination to exert themselves in order to make philip tremble with his cotemporary orators who were in philips interest and who persuaded the people to peace he keeps no measures but plainly reproaches them as the betrayers of their country he not only prompts to vigorous conduct but he lays down the plan of that conduct he enters into particulars and points out with great exactness the measures of execution this is the strain of these orations they are strongly animated and full of the impetuosity and fire of public spirit they proceed in a continued train of inductions consequences and demonstrations founded on sound reason the figures which he uses are never sought after but always rise from the subject he employs them sparingly indeed for splendour and ornament are not the distinctions of this orators composition it is an energy of thought peculiar to himself which forms his character and sets him above all others he appears to attend much more to things than to words we forget the orator and think of the business he warms the mind and impels to action he has no parade and ostentation no methods of insinuation no labored introductions but is like a man full of his subject who after preparing his audience by a sentence or two for hearing plain truths enters directly on business  demosthenes appears to great advantage when contrasted with aeschines in the celebrated oration pro corona aeschines was his rival in business and personal enemy and one of the most distinguished orators of that age but when we read the two orations aeschines is feeble in comparison of domosthenes and makes much less impression on the mind his reasonings concerning the law that was in question are indeed very subtle but his invective against demosthenes is general and ill supported whereas demosthenes is a torrent that nothing can resist he bears down his antagonist with violence he draws his character in the strongest colors and the particular merit of that oration is that all the descriptions in it are highly picturesque there runs through it a strain of magnanimity and high honor the orator speaks with that strength and conscious dignity which great actions and public spirit alone inspire both orators use great liberties with one another and in general that unrestrained license which ancient manners permitted even to the length of abusive names and downright scurrility as appears both here and in ciceros philippics hurts and offends a modern ear what those ancient orators gained by such a manner in point of freedom and boldness is more than compensated by want of dignity which seems to give an advantage in this respect to the greater decency of modern speaking  the style of demosthenes is strong and concise though sometimes it must not be dissembled harsh and abrupt his words are very expressive his arrangement is firm and manly and though far from being unmusical yet it seems difficult to find in him that studied but concealed number and rythmus which some of the ancient critics are fond of attributing to him negligent of those lesser graces one would rather conceive him to have aimed at that sublime which lies in sentiment his action and pronunciation are recorded to have been uncommonly vehement and ardent which from the manner of his composition we are naturally led to believe the character which one forms of him from reading his works is of the austere rather than the gentle kind he is on every occasion grave serious passionate takes every thing on a high tone never lets himself down nor attempts any thing like pleasantry if any fault can be found to his admirable eloquence it is that he sometimes borders on the hard and dry he may be thought to want smoothness and grace which dionysius of halicarnassus attributes to his imitating too closely the manner of thucydides who was his great model for style and whose history he is said to have written eight times over with his own hand but these defects are far more than compensated by that admirable and masterly force of masculine eloquence which as it overpowered all who heard it cannot at this day be read without emotion  after the days of demosthenes greece lost her liberty eloquence of course languished and relapsed again into the feeble manner introduced by the rhetoricians and sophists demetrius phalerius who lived in the next age to demosthenes attained indeed some character but he is represented to us as a flowery rather than a persuasive speaker who aimed at grace rather than substance delectabat athenienses says cicero magis quam inflammabat he amused the athenians rather than warmed them and after his time we hear of no more grecian orators of any note  lecture xxvi history of eloquence continued  roman eloquence  cicero  modern eloquence having treated of the rise of eloquence and of its state among the greeks we now proceed to consider its progress among the romans where we shall find one model at least of eloquence in its most splendid and illustrious form the romans were long a martial nation altogether rude and unskilled in arts of any kind arts were of late introduction among them they were not known till after the conquest of greece and the romans always acknowledged the grecians as their masters in every part of learning graecia capta ferum victorem cepit and arts intulit agresti latio when conquered greece brought in her captive arts she triumphed over her savage conquerors hearts taught our rough verse its numbers to refine and our rude style with elegance to shine francis   hor epist ad aug  as the romans derived their eloquence poetry and learning from the greeks so they must be confessed to be far inferior to them in genius for all these accomplishments they were a more grave and magnificent but a less acute and sprightly people they had neither the vivacity nor the sensibility of the greeks their passions were not so easily moved nor their conceptions so lively in comparison of them they were a phlegmatic nation their language resembled their character it was regular firm and stately but wanted that simple and expressive naivete and in particular that flexibility to suit every different mode and species of composition for which the greek tongue is distinguished above that of every other country graiis ingenium graiis dedit ore rotundo musa loqui to her loved greeks the muse indulgent gave to her loved greeks with greatness to conceive and in sublimer tone their language raise her greeks were only covetous of praise francis  ars poet and hence when we compare together the various rival productions of greece and rome we shall always find this distinction obtain that in the greek productions there is more native genius in the roman more regularity and art what the greeks invented the romans polished the one was the original rough sometimes and incorrect the other a finished copy  as the roman government during the republic was of the popular kind there is no doubt but that in the hands of the leading men public speaking became early an engine of government and was employed for gaining distinction and power but in the rude unpolished times of the state their speaking was hardly of that sort that could be called eloquence though cicero in his treatise de claris oratoribus endeavors to give some reputation to the elder cato and those who were his contemporaries yet he acknowledges it to have been asperum et horridum genus dicendi a rude and harsh strain of speech it was not till a short time preceding ciceros age that the roman orators rose into any note crassus and antonius two of the speakers in the dialogue de oratore appear to have been the most eminent whose different manners cicero describes with great beauty in that dialogue and in his other rhetorical works but as none of their productions are extant nor any of hortensiuss who was ciceros cotemporary and rival at the bar it is needless to transcribe from ciceros writings the account which he gives of those great men and of the character of their eloquence such as are desirous of particular information on this head had better have recourse to the original by reading ciceros three books de oratore and his other two treatises entitled the one brutus sive de claris oratoribus the other orator ad m brutum which on several accounts well deserve perusal   the object in this period most worthy to draw our attention is cicero himself whose name alone suggests every thing that is splendid in oratory with the history of his life and with his character as a man and a politician we have not at present any direct concern we consider him only as an eloquent speaker and in this view it is our business to remark both his virtues and his defects if he has any his virtues are beyond controversy eminently great in all his orations there is high art he begins generally with a regular exordium and with much preparation and insinuation prepossesses the hearers and studies to gain their affections his method is clear and his arguments are arranged with great propriety his method is indeed more clear than that of demosthenes and this is one advantage which he has over him we find every thing in its proper place he never attempts to move till he has endeavored to convince and in moving especially the softer passions he is very successful no man that ever wrote knew the power and force of words better than cicero he rolls them along with the greatest beauty and pomp and in the structure of his sentences is curious and exact to the highest degree he is always full and flowing never abrupt he is a great amplifier of every subject magnificent and in his sentiments highly moral his manner is on the whole diffuse yet it is often happily varied and suited to the subject in his four orations for instance against catiline the tone and style of each of them particularly the first and last is very different and accommodated with a great deal of judgment to the occasion and the situation in which they were spoken when a great public object roused his mind and demanded indignation and force he departs considerably from that loose and declamatory manner to which he inclines at other times and becomes exceedingly cogent and vehement this is the case in his orations against anthony and in those two against verres and catiline  together with those high qualities which cicero possesses he is not exempt from certain defects of which it is necessary to take notice for the ciceronian eloquence is a pattern so dazzling by its beauties that if not examined with accuracy and judgment it is apt to betray the unwary into a faulty imitation and i am of opinion that it has sometimes produced this effect in most of his orations especially those composed in the earlier part of his life there is too much art even carried the length of ostentation there is too visible a parade of eloquence he seems often to aim at obtaining admiration rather than at operating conviction by what he says hence on some occasions he is showy rather than solid and diffuse where he ought to have been pressing his sentences are at all times round and sonorous they cannot be accused of monotony for they possess variety of cadence but from too great a study of magnificence he is sometimes deficient in strength on all occasions where there is the least room for it he is full of himself his great actions and the real services which he had performed to his country apologize for this in part ancient manners too imposed fewer restraints from the side of decorum but even after these allowances made ciceros ostentation of himself cannot be wholly palliated and his orations indeed all his works leave on our minds the impression of a good man but withal of a vain man  the defects which we have now taken notice of in ciceros eloquence were not unobserved by his own cotemporaries this we learn from quinctilian and from the author of the dialogue de causis corruptae eloquentiae brutus we are informed called him fractum et elumbem broken and enervated suorum temporum homines says quinctilian incessere audebant eum ut tumidiorem and asianum et redundantem et in repititionibus nimium et in salibus aliquando frigidum and in compositione fractum et exsultantem and pene viro molliorem his cotemporaries ventured to reproach him as swelling redundant and asiatic too frequent in repetitions in his attempts toward wit sometimes cold and in the strain of his composition feeble desultory and more effeminate than became a man  these censures were undoubtedly carried too far and savor of malignity and personal enmity they saw his defects but they aggravated them and theso urce of these aggravations can be traced to the difference which prevailed in rome in ciceros days between two great parties with respect to eloquence the attici and the asiani the former who called themselves the attics were the patrons of what they conceived to be the chaste simple and natural style of eloquence from which they accused cicero as having departed and as leaning to the florid asiatic manner in several of his rhetorical works particularly in his orator ad brutum cicero in his turn endeavors to expose this sect as substituting a frigid and jejune manner in place of the true attic eloquence and contends that his own composition was formed upon the real attic style in the  0th chapter of the last book of quinctilians institutions a full account is given of the disputes between these two parties and of the rhodian or middle manner between the attics and the asiatics quinctilian himself declares on ciceros side and whether it be called attic or asiatic prefers the full the copious and the amplifying style he concludes with this very just observation plures sunt eloquentiae facies sed stultissimum est quaerere ad quam recturus se sit orator cum omnis species quae modo recta est habeat usum  utetur enim ut res exiget omnibus nec pro causa modo sed pro partibus causae eloquence admits of many different forms and nothing can be more foolish than to enquire by which of them an orator is to regulate his composition since every form which is in itself just has its own place and use the orator according as circumstances require will employ them all suiting them not only to the cause or subject of which he treats but to the different parts of that subject   on the subject of comparing cicero and demosthenes much has been said by critical writers the different manners of these two princes of eloquence and the distinguishing characters of each are so strongly marked in their writings that the comparison is in many respects obvious and easy the character of demosthenes is vigor and austerity that of cicero is gentleness and insinuation in the one you find more manliness in the other more ornament the one is more harsh but more spirited and cogent the other more agreeable but withal looser and weaker  to account for this difference without any prejudice to cicero it has been said that we must look to the nature of their different auditories that the refined athenians followed with ease the concise and convincing eloquence of demosthenes but that a manner more popular more flowery and declamatory was requisite in speaking to the romans a people less acute and less acquainted with the arts of speech but this is not satisfactory for we must observe that the greek orator spoke much oftener before a mixed multitude than the roman almost all the public business of athens was transacted in popular assemblies the common people were his hearers and his judges whereas cicero generally addressed himself to the patres conscripti or in criminal trials to the praetor and the select judges and it cannot be imagined that the persons of highest rank and best education in rome required a more diffuse manner of pleading than the common citizens of athens in order to make them understand the cause or relish the speaker perhaps we shall come nearer the truth by observing that to unite together all the qualities without the least exception that form a perfect orator and to excel equally in each of those qualities is not to be expected from the limited powers of human genius the highest degree of strength is i suspect never found united with the highest degree of smoothness and ornament equal attentions to both are incompatible and the genius that carries ornament to its utmost length is not of such a kind as can excel as much in vigor for there plainly lies the characteristical difference between these two celebrated orators  it is a disadvantage to demosthenes that besides his conciseness which sometimes produces obscurity the language in which he writes is less familiar to most of us than the latin and that we are less acquainted with the greek antiquities than we are with the roman we read cicero with more ease and of course with more pleasure independent of this circumstance too he is no doubt in himself a more agreeable writer than the other but notwithstanding this advantage i am of opinion that were the state in danger or some great public interest at stake which drew the serious attention of men an oration in the spirit and strain of demosthenes would have more weight and produce greater effects than one in the ciceronian manner were demostheness philippics spoken in a british assembly in a similar conjuncture of affairs they would convince and persuade at this day the rapid style the vehement reasoning the disdain anger boldness freedom which perpetually animate them would render their success infallible over any modern assembly i question whether the same can be said of ciceros orations whose eloquence however beautiful and however well suited to the roman taste yet borders oftener on declamation and is more remote from the manner in which we now expect to hear real business and causes of importance treated in this judgment i concur with mr david hume in his essay upon eloquence he gives it as his opinion that of all human productions the orations of demosthenes present to us the models which approach the nearest to perfection   in comparing demosthenes and cicero most of the french critics incline to give the preference to the latter p rapin the jesuit in the parallels which he has drawn between some of the most eminent greek and roman writers uniformly decides in favor of the roman for the preference which he gives to cicero he assigns and lays stress on one reason of a pretty extraordinary nature viz that demosthenes could not possibly have so complete an insight as cicero into the manners and passions of men why  because he had not the advantage of perusing aristotles treatise of rhetoric wherein says our critic he has fully laid open that mystery and to support this weighty argument he enters into a controversy with a gellius in order to prove that aristotles rhetoric was not published till after demosthenes had spoken at least his most considerable orations nothing can be more childish such orators as cicero and demosthenes derived their knowledge of the human passions and their power of moving them from higher sources than any treatise of rhetoric one french critic has indeed departed from the common tract and after bestowing on cicero those just praises to which the consent of so many ages shows him to be entitled concludes however with giving the palm to demosthenes this is fenelon the famous archbishop of cambray and author of telemachus himself surely no enemy to all the graces and flowers of composition it is in his reflections on rhetoric and poetry that he gives this judgment a small tract commonly published along with his dialogues on eloquence as his expressions are remarkably happy and beautiful the passage here referred to deserves to be inserted je ne crains pas dire que demosthene me paroit superieur a ciceron je proteste que person nadmire plus ciceron que je fais il embellit tout ce quil touch il fait honneur a la parole il fait des mots ce quun autre nen sauroit fair il a je ne sai combien de sorts desprits il est meme court and vehement toutes les fois quil veut lestre contre catiline contre verres contre antoine mais on remarque quelque parure dans son discourse lart y est merveilleux mais on lentrevoit lorateur en pensant au salut de la republique ne soublie pas et ne se laisse pas oublier demosthene paroit sortir de soi et ne voir que la patrie il ne cherche point le beau il le fait sans y penser il est audessus de ladmiration il se sert de la parole comme un homme modeste de son habit pour se couvrir il tonne il foudroye cest un torrent qui entraine tout on ne peut le critiquer parcequon est saisi on pense aux chois quil dit and non a ses paroles on le perd de vue on nest occupe que de philippe qui envahit tou je suis charm de ces deux orateurs mais javoue que je suis moins touch de lart infini and de la magnifique eloquence de ciceron que de la rapide simplicite de demosthene  these dialogues and reflections are particularly worthy of perusal as containing i think the justest ideas on the subject that are to be met with in any modern critical writer  the reign of eloquence among the romans was very short after the age of cicero it languished or rather expired and we have no reason to wonder at this being the case for not only was liberty entirely extinguished but arbitrary power felt in its heaviest and most oppressive weight providence having in its wrath delivered over the roman empire to a succession of some of the most execrable tyrants that ever disgraced and scourged the human race under their government it was naturally to be expected that taste would be corrupted and genius discouraged some of the ornamental arts less intimately connected with liberty continued for a while to prevail but for that masculine eloquence which had exercised itself in the senate and in the public affairs there was no longer any place the change which was produced on eloquence by the nature of the government and the state of the public manners is beautifully described in the dialogue de causis corruptae eloquentiae which is attributed by some to tacitus by others to quinctilian luxury effeminacy and flattery overwhelmed all the forum where so many great affairs had been transacted was now become a desert private causes were still pleaded but the public was no longer interested nor any general attention drawn to what passed there unus inter haec et alter dicenti assistit et res velut in solitudine agitur oratori autem clamore plausuque opus est et velut quodam theatro qualia quotidie antiquis oratoribus contingebant um tot ac tam nobiles forum coarctarent cum clientelae and tribus and municipiorum legationes periclitantibus assisterent cum in plerisque judiciis crederet populus romanus sua interesse quid judicaretur the courts of judicature are at present so unfrequented that the orator seems to stand alone and talk to bare walls but eloquence rejoices in the bursts of loud applause and exults in a full audience such as used to press round the ancient orators when the forum stood crowded with nobles when numerous retinue of clients when foreign ambassadors when tribes and whole cities assisted at the debate and when in many trials the roman people understood themselves to be concerned in the event   in the schools of the declaimers the corruption of eloquence was completed imaginary and fantastic subjects such as had no real life or business were made the themes of declamation and all manner of false and affected ornaments were brought into vogue pace vestra liceat dixisse says petronius arbiter to the declaimers of his time primi omnem eloquentiam perdidistis levibus enim ac inanibus sonis ludibria quaedam excitando effecistis ut corpus orationis enervaretur atque caderet et ideo ego existimo adolescentulos in scholis stultissimos fieri quia nihil ex iis quae in usu habemus aut vident sed piratas cum catenis in littore stantes et tyrannos edicta scribentes quibus imperent filiis ut patrum suorum capita praecidant sed responsa in pestilentia data ut virgins tres aut plures immolentur sed mellitos verborum globulos and omnia quasi papavere and sesamo sparsa qui inter haec nutriuntur non magis sapere possunt quam been olere qui in culina habitant with your permission i must be allowed to say that you have been the first destroyers of all true eloquence for by those mock subjects on which you employ your empty and unmeaning compositions you have enervated and overthrown all that is manly and substantial in oratory i cannot but conclude that the youth whom you educate must be totally perverted in your schools by hearing and seeing nothing which has any affinity to real life or human affairs but stories of pirates standing on the shore provided with chains for loading their captives and of tyrants issuing their edicts by which children are commanded to cut off the heads of their parents but responses given by oracles in the time of pestilence that several virgins must be sacrificed but glittering ornaments of phrase and a style highly spiced if we may say so with affected conceits they who are educated in the midst of such studies can no more acquire a good taste than they can smell sweet who dwell perpetually in a kitchen  in the hands of the greek rhetoricians the manly and sensible eloquence of their first noted speakers degenerated as i formerly showed into subtility and sophistry in the hands of the roman declaimers it passed into the quaint and affected into point and antithesis this corrupt manner begins to appear in the writings of seneca and shows itself also in the famous panegyric of pliny the younger on trajan which may be considered as the last effort of roman oratory though the author was a man of genius yet it is deficient in nature and ease we see throughout the whole a perpetual attempt to depart from the ordinary way of thinking and to support a forced elevation  in the decline of the roman empire the introduction of christianity gave rise to a new species of eloquence in the apologies sermons and pastoral writings of the fathers of the church among the latin fathers lactantius and minutius felix are the most remarkable for purity of style and in a later age the famous st augustine possesses a considerable share of sprightliness and strength but none of the fathers afford any just models of eloquence their language as soon as we descend to the third or fourth century becomes harsh and they are in general infected with the taste of that age a love of swollen and strained thoughts and of the play of words among the greek fathers the most distinguished by far for his oratorial merit is st chrysostom his language is pure his style highly figured he is copious smooth and sometimes pathetic but he retains at the same time much of that character which has been always attributed to the asiatic eloquence diffuse and redundant to a great degree and often overwrought and tumid he may be read however with advantage for the eloquence of the pulpit as being freer of false ornaments than the latin fathers  as there is nothing more that occurs to me deserving particular attention in the middle age i pass now to the state of eloquence in modern times here it must be confessed that in no european nation public speaking has been considered as so great an object or been cultivated with so much care as in greece or rome its reputation has never been so high its effects have never been so considerable nor has that high and sublime kind of it which prevailed in those ancient states been so much as aimed at notwithstanding too that a new profession has been established which gives peculiar advantages to oratory and affords it the noblest field i mean that of the church the genius of the world seems in this respect to have undergone some alteration the two countries where we might expect to find most of the spirit of eloquence are france and great britain france on account of the distinguished turn of the nation toward all the liberal arts and of the encouragement which for this century past those arts have received from the public great britain on account both of the public capacity and genius and of the free government which it enjoys yet so it is that in neither of those countries has the talent of public speaking risen near to the degree of its ancient splendour while in other productions of genius both in prose and in poetry they have contended for the prize with greece and rome nay in some compositions may be thought to have surpassed them the names of demosthenes and cicero stand at this day unrivalled in fame and it would be held presumptuous and absurd to pretend to place any modern whatever on the same or even on a nearly equal rank  it seems particularly surprising that great britain should not have made a more conspicuous figure in eloquence than it has hitherto attained when we consider the enlightened and at the same time the free and bold genius of the country which seems not a little to favor oratory and when we consider that of all the polite nations it alone possesses a popular government or admits into the legislature such numerous assemblies as can be supposed to lie under the dominion of eloquence mr hume in his essay on eloquence makes this observation and illustrates it with his usual elegance he indeed supposes that no satisfactory reasons can be given to account for the inferiority of modern to ancient eloquence in this i differ from him and shall endeavor before the conclusion of this lecture to point out some causes to which i think it may in a great measure be ascribed in the three great scenes of public speaking  notwithstanding this advantage it must be confessed that in most parts of eloquence we are undoubtedly inferior not only to the greeks and romans by many degrees but also to the french we have philosophers eminent and conspicuous perhaps beyond any nation in all the parts of science we have both taste and erudition in a high degree we have historians we have poets of the greatest name but of orators or public speakers how little have we to boast and where are the monuments of their genius to be found in every period we have had some who made a figure by managing the debates in parliament but that figure was commonly owing to their wisdom or their experience in business more than to their talents for oratory and unless in some few instances wherein the power of oratory has appeared indeed with much luster the art of parliamentary speaking rather obtained to several a temporary applause than conferred upon any a lasting renown at the bar though questionless we have many able pleaders yet few or none of their pleadings have been thought worthy to be transmitted to posterity nor have commanded attention any longer than the cause which was the subject of them interested the public while in france the pleadings of patru in the former age and those of cochin and daguesseau in later times are read with pleasure and are often quoted as examples of eloquence by the french critics in the same manner in the pulpit the british divines have distinguished themselves by the most accurate and rational compositions which perhaps any nation can boast of many printed sermons we have full of good sense and of sound divinity and morality but the eloquence to be found in them the power of persuasion of interesting and engaging the heart which is or ought to be the great object of the pulpit is far from bearing a suitable proportion to the excellence of the matter there are few arts in my opinion farther from perfection than that of preaching is among us the reasons of which i shall afterward have occasion to discuss in proof of the fact it is sufficient to observe that an english sermon instead of being a persuasive animated oration seldom rises beyond the strain of correct and dry reasoning whereas in the sermons of bossuet massillon bourdaloue and flechier among the french we see a much higher species of eloquence aimed at and in a great measure attained than the british preachers have in view  in general the characteristical difference between the state of eloquence in france and in great britain is that the french have adopted higher ideas both of pleasing and persuading by means of oratory though sometimes in the execution they fail in great britain we have taken up eloquence on a lower key but in our execution as was naturally to be expected have been more correct in france the style of their orators is ornamented with bolder figures and their discourse carried on with more amplification more warmth and elevation the composition is often very beautiful but sometimes also too diffuse and deficient in that strength and cogency which renders eloquence powerful a defect owing perhaps in part to the genius of the people which leads them to attend fully as much to ornament as to substance and in part to the nature of their government which by excluding public speaking from having much influence on the conduct of public affairs deprives eloquence of its best opportunity for acquiring nerves and strength hence the pulpit is the principal field which is left for their eloquence the members too of the french academy give harangues at their admission in which genius often appears but laboring under the misfortune of having no subject to discourse upon they run commonly into flattery and panegyric the most barren and insipid of all topics  i observed before that the greeks and romans aspired to a more sublime species of eloquence than is aimed at by the moderns theirs was of the vehement and passionate kind by which they endeavored to inflame the minds of their hearers and hurry their imaginations away and suitable to this vehemence of thought was their vehemence of gesture and action the supplosio pedis vide de clar orator  the percussio frontis and femoris were as we learn from ciceros writings usual gestures among them at the bar though now they would be reckoned extravagant any where except upon the stage modern eloquence is much more cool and temperate and in great britain especially has confined itself almost wholly to the argumentative and rational it is much of that species which the ancient critics called the tenuis or subtilis which aims at convincing and instructing rather than affecting the passions and assumes a tone not much higher than common argument and discourse  several reasons may be given why modern eloquence has been so limited and humble in its efforts in the first place i am of opinion that this change must in part be ascribed to that correct turn of thinking which has been so much studied in modern times it can hardly be doubted that in many efforts of mere genius the ancient greeks and romans excelled us but on the other hand that in accuracy and closeness of reasoning on many subjects we have some advantage over them ought i think to be admitted also in proportion as the world has advanced philosophy has made greater progress a certain strictness of good sense has in this island particularly been cultivated and introduced into every subject hence we are more on our guard against the flowers of elocution we are on the watch we are jealous of being deceived by oratory our public speakers are obliged to be more reserved than the ancients in their attempts to elevate the imagination and warm the passions and by the influence of prevailing taste their own genius is sobered and chastened perhaps in too great a degree it is likely too i confess that what we fondly ascribe to our correctness and good sense is owing in a great measure to our phlegm and natural coldness for the vivacity and sensibility of the greeks and romans more especially of the former seem to have been much greater than ours and to have given them a higher relish of all the beauties of oratory  besides these national considerations we must in the next place attend to peculiar circumstances in the three great scenes of public speaking which have proved disadvantageous to the growth of eloquence among us though the parliament of great britain be the noblest field which europe at this day affords to a public speaker yet eloquence has never been so powerful an instrument there as it was in the popular assemblies of greece and rome under some former reigns the high hand of arbitrary power bore a violent sway and in later times ministerial influence has generally prevailed the power of speaking though always considerable yet has been often found too feeble to counterbalance either of these and of course has not been studied with so much zeal and fervor as where its effect on business was irresistible and certain  at the bar our disadvantage in comparison of the ancients is great among them the judges were generally numerous the laws were few and simple the decision of causes was left in a great measure to equity and the sense of mankind here was an ample field for what they termed judicial eloquence but among the moderns the case is quite altered the system of law is become much more complicated the knowledge of it is thereby rendered so laborious an attainment as to be the chief object of a lawyers education and in a manner the study of his life the art of speaking is but a secondary accomplishment to which he can afford to devote much less of his time and labor the bounds of eloquence besides are now much circumscribed at the bar and except in a few cases reduced to arguing from strict law statute or precedent by which means knowledge much more than oratory is become the principal requisite  with regard to the pulpit it has certainly been a great disadvantage that the practice of reading sermons in stead of repeating them from memory has prevailed so universally in england this may indeed have introduced accuracy but it has done great prejudice to eloquence for a discourse read is far inferior to an oration spoken it leads to a different sort of composition as well as of delivery and can never have an equal effect upon any audience another circumstance too has been unfortunate the sectaries and fanatics before the restoration adopted a warm zealous and popular manner of preaching and those who adhered to them in aftertimes continued to distinguish themselves by somewhat of the same manner the odium of these sects drove the established church from that warmth which they were judged to have carried too far into the opposite extreme of a studied coolness and composure of manner hence from the art of persuasion which preaching ought always to be it has passed in england into mere reasoning and instruction which not only has brought down the eloquence of the pulpit to a lower tone than it might justly assume but has produced this farther effect that by accustoming the public ear to such cool and dispassionate discourses it has tended to fashion other kinds of public speaking upon the same model  thus i have given some view of the state of eloquence in modern times and endeavored to account for it it has as we have seen fallen below that splendour which it maintained in ancient ages and from being sublime and vehement has come down to be temperate and cool yet still in that region which it occupies it admits great scope and to the defect of zeal and application more than to the want of capacity and genius we may ascribe its not having hitherto risen higher it is a field where there is much honor yet to be reaped it is an instrument which may be employed for purposes of the highest importance the ancient models may still with much advantage be set before us for imitation though in that imitation we must doubtless have some regard to what modern taste and modern manners will bear of which i shall afterward have occasion to say more  lecture xxvii different kinds of public speaking  eloquence of popular assemblies  extracts from demosthenes after the preliminary views which have been given of the nature of eloquence in general and of the state in which it has subsisted in different ages and countries i am now to enter on considering the different kinds of public speaking the distinguishing characters of each and the rules which relate to them the ancients divided all orations into three kinds the demonstrative the deliberative and the judicial the scope of the demonstrative was to praise or to blame that of the deliberative to advise or to dissuade that of the judicial to accuse or to defend the chief subjects of demonstrative eloquence were panegyrics invectives gratulatory and funeral orations the deliberative was employed in matters of public concern agitated in the senate or before the assemblies of the people the judicial is the same with the eloquence of the bar employed in addressing judges who have power to absolve or condemn this division runs through all the ancient treatises on rhetoric and is followed by the moderns who copy them it is a division not inartificial and comprehends most or all of the matters which can be the subject of public discourse it will however suit our purpose better and be found i imagine more useful to follow that division which the train of modern speaking naturally points out to us taken from the three great scenes of eloquence popular assemblies the bar and the pulpit each of which has a distinct character that particularly suits it this division coincides in part with the ancient one the eloquence of the bar is precisely the same with what the ancients called the judicial the eloquence of popular assemblies though mostly of what they term the deliberative species yet admits also of the demonstrative the eloquence of the pulpit is altogether of a distinct nature and cannot be properly reduced under any of the heads of the ancient rhetoricians  to all the three pulpit bar and popular assemblies belong in common the rules concerning the conduct of a discourse in all its parts of those rules i purpose afterward to treat at large but before proceeding to them i intend to show first what is peculiar to each of these three kinds of oratory in their spirit character or manner for every species of public speaking has a manner or character peculiarly suited to it of which it is highly material to have a just idea in order to direct the application of general rules the eloquence of a lawyer is fundamentally different from that of a divine or a speaker in parliament and to have a precise and proper idea of the distinguishing character which any kind of public speaking requires is the foundation of what is called a just taste in that kind of speaking  laying aside any question concerning the preeminence in point of rank which is due to any one of the three kinds before mentioned i shall begin with that which tends to throw most light upon the rest viz the eloquence of popular assemblies the most august theater for this kind of eloquence to be found in any nation of europe is beyond doubt the parliament of great britain in meetings too of less dignity it may display itself wherever there is a popular court or wherever any number of men are assembled for debate or consulation there in different forms this species of eloquence may take place  its object is or ought always to be persuasion there must be some end proposed some point most commonly of public utility or good in favor of which we seek to determine the hearers now in all attempts to persuade men we must proceed upon this principle that it is necessary to convince their understanding nothing can be more erroneous than to imagine that because speeches to popular assemblies admit more of a declamatory style than some other discourses they therefore stand less in need of being supported by sound reasoning when modelled upon this false idea they may have the show but never can produce the effect of real eloquence even the show of eloquence which they make will please only the trifling and superficial for with all tolerable judges indeed almost with all men mere declamation soon becomes insipid of whatever rank the hearers be a speaker is never to presume that by a frothy and ostentatious harangue without solid sense and argument he can either make impression on them or acquire fame to himself it is at least a dangerous experiment for where such an artifice succeeds once it will fail ten times even the common people are better judges of argument and good sense than we sometimes think them and upon any question of business a plain man who speaks to the point without art will generally prevail over the most artful speaker who deals in flowers and ornament rather than in reasoning much more when public speakers address themselves to any assembly where there are persons of education and improved understanding they ought to be careful not to trifle with their hearers  let it be ever kept in view that the foundation of all that can be called eloquence is good sense and solid thought as popular as the orations of demosthenes were spoken to all the citizens of athens every one who looks into them must see how fraught they are with argument and how important it appeared to him to convince the understanding in order to persuade or to work on the principles of action hence their influence in his own time hence their fame at this day such a pattern as this public speakers ought to set before them for imitation rather than follow the tract of those loose and frothy declaimers who have brought discredit on eloquence let it be their first study in addressing any popular assembly to be previously masters of the business on which they are to speak to be well provided with matter and argument and to rest upon these the chief stress this will always give to their discourse an air of manliness and strength which is a powerful instrument of persuasion ornament if they have genius for it will follow of course at any rate it demands only their secondary study cura sit verborum solicitudo rerum  to your expression be attentive but about your matter be solicitous is an advice of quinctilian which cannot be too often recollected by all who study oratory  in the next place in order to be persuasive speakers in a popular assembly it is in my opinion a capital rule that we be ourselves persuaded of whatever we recommend to others never when it can be avoided ought we to espouse any side of the argument but what we believe to be the true and the right one seldom or never will a man be eloquent but when he is in earnest and uttering his own sentiments they are only the verae voces ab imo pectore the unassumed language of the heart or head that carry the force of conviction in a former lecture when entering on this subject i observed that all high eloquence must be the offspring of passion or warm emotion it is this which makes every man persuasive and gives a force to his genius which it possesses at no other time under what disadvantage then is he placed who not feeling what he utters must counterfeit a warmth to which he is a stranger  i know that young people on purpose to train themselves to the art of speaking imagine it useful to adopt that side of the question under debate which to themselves appears the weakest and to try what figure they can make upon it but i am afraid this is not the most improving education for public speaking and that it tends to form them to a habit of flimsy and trivial discourse such a liberty they should at no time allow themselves unless in meetings where no real business is carried on but where declamation and improvement in speech is the sole aim nor even in such meetings would i recommend it as the most useful exercise they will improve themselves to more advantage and acquit themselves with more honor by choosing always that side of the debate to which in their own judgment they are most inclined and supporting it by what seems to themselves most solid and persuasive they will acquire the habit of reasoning closely and expressing themselves with warmth and force much more when they are adhering to their own sentiments than when they are speaking in contradiction to them in assemblies where any real business is carried on whether that business be of much importance or not it is always of dangerous consequence for young practitioners to make trial of this sort of play of speech it may fix an imputation on their characters before they are aware and what they intended merely as amusement may be turned to the discredit either of their principles or their understanding  debate in popular courts seldom allows the speaker that full and accurate preparation before hand which the pulpit always and the bar sometimes admits the arguments must be suited to the course which the debate takes and as no man can exactly foresee this one who trusts to a set speech composed in his closet will on many occasions be thrown out of the ground which he had taken he will find it preoccupied by others or his reasonings superseded by some new turn of the business and if he ventures to use his prepared speech it will be frequently at the hazard of making an awkward figure there is a general prejudice with us and not wholly an unjust one against set speeches in public meetings the only occasion when they have any propriety is at the opening of a debate when the speaker has it in his power to choose his field but as the debate advances and parties warm discourses of this kind become more unsuitable they want the native air the appearance of being suggested by the business that is going on study and ostentation are apt to be visible and of course though applauded as elegant they are seldom so persuasive as more free and unconstrained discourses  this however does not by any means conclude against premeditation of what we are to say the neglect of which and the trusting wholly to extemporaneous efforts will unavoidably produce the habit of speaking in a loose and undigested manner but the premeditation which is of most advantage in the case which we now consider is of the subject or argument in general rather than of nice composition on any particular branch of it with regard to the matter we cannot be too accurate in our preparation so as to be fully masters of the business under consideration but with regard to words and expression it is very possible so far to overdo as to render our speech stiff and precise indeed till once persons acquire that firmness that presence of mind and command of expression in a public meeting which nothing but habit and practice can bestow it may be proper for a young speaker to commit to memory the whole of what he is to say but after some performances of this kind have given him boldness he will find it the better method not to confine himself so strictly but only to write beforehand some sentences with which he intends to set out in order to put himself fairly in the train and for the rest to set down short notes of the topics or principal thoughts upon which he is to insist in their order leaving the words to be suggested by the warmth of discourse such short notes of the substance of the discourse will be found of considerable service to those especially who are beginning to speak in public they will accustom them to some degree of accuracy which if they speak frequently they are in danger too soon of losing they will even accustom them to think more closely on the subject in question and will assist them greatly in arranging their thoughts with method and order  this leads me next to observe that in all kinds of public speaking nothing is of greater consequence than a proper and clear method i mean not that formal method of laying down heads and subdivisions which is commonly practiced in the pulpit and which in popular assemblies unless the speaker be a man of great authority and character and the subject of great importance and the preparation too very accurate is rather in hazard of disgusting the hearers such an introduction presenting always the melancholy prospect of along discourse but though the method be not laid down in form no discourse of any length should be without method that is every thing should be found in its proper place every one who speaks will find it of the greatest advantage to himself to have previously arranged his thoughts and classed under proper heads in his own mind what he is to deliver this will assist his memory and carry him through his discourse without that confusion to which one is every moment subject who has fixed no distinct plan of what he is to say and with respect to the hearers order in discourse is absolutely necessary for making any proper impression it adds both force and light to what is said it makes them accompany the speaker easily and readily as he goes along and makes them feel the full effect of every argument which he employs few things therefore deserve more to be attended to than distinct arrangement for eloquence however great can never produce entire conviction without it of the rules of method and the proper distribution of the several parts of a discourse i am hereafter to treat  let us now consider of the style and expression suited to the eloquence of popular assemblies beyond doubt these give scope for the most animated manner of public speaking the very aspect of a large assembly engaged in some debate of moment and attentive to the discourse of one man is sufficient to inspire that man with such elevation and warmth as both give rise to strong expressions and gives them propriety passion easily rises in a great assembly where the movements are communicated by mutual sympathy between the orator and the audience those bold figures of which i treated formerly as the native language of passion then have their proper place that ardour of speech that vehemence and glow of sentiment which arise from a mind animated and inspired by some great and public object form the peculiar characteristics of popular eloquence in its highest degree of perfection  the liberty however which we are now giving of the strong and passionate manner to this kind of oratory must be always understood with certain limitations and restraints which it will be necessary to point out distinctly in order to guard against dangerous mistakes on this subject  as first the warmth which we express must be suited to the occasion and the subject for nothing can be more preposterous than an attempt to introduce great vehemence into a subject which is either of slight importance or which by its nature requires to be treated of calmly a temperate tone of speech is that for which there is most frequent occasion and he who is on every subject passionate and vehement will be considered as a blusterer and meet with little regard  in the second place we must take care never to counterfeit warmth without feeling it this always betrays persons into an unnatural manner which exposes them to ridicule for as i have often suggested to support the appearance without the real feeling of passion is one of the most difficult things in nature the disguise can almost never be so perfect but it is discovered the heart can only answer to the heart the great rule here as indeed in every other case is to follow nature never to attempt a strain of eloquence which is not seconded by our own genius one may be a speaker both of much reputation and much influence in the calm argumentative manner to attain the pathetic and the sublime of oratory requires those strong sensibilities of mind and that high power of expression which are given to few  in the third place even when the subject justifies the vehement manner and when genius prompts it when warmth is felt not counterfeited we must however set a guard on ourselves not to allow impetuosity to transport us too far without emotion in the speaker eloquence as was before observed will never produce its highest effects but at the same time if the speaker lose command of himself he will soon lose command of his audience too he must never kindle too soon he must begin with moderation and study to carry his hearers along with him as he warms in the progress of his discourse for if he runs before in the course of passion and leaves them behind if they are not tuned if we may speak so unison to him the discord will presently be felt and be very grating let a speaker have never so good reason to be animated and fired by his subject it is always expected of him that the awe and regard due to his audience should lay a decent restraint upon his warmth and prevent it from carrying him beyond certain bounds if when most heated by the subject he can be so far master of himself as to preserve close attention to argument and even to some degree of correct expression this selfcommand this exertion of reason in the midst of passion has a wonderful effect both to please and to persuade it is indeed the masterpiece the highest attainment of eloquence uniting the strength of reason with the vehemence of passion affording all the advantages of passion for the purpose of persuasion without the confusion and disorder which are apt to accompany it  in the fourth place in the highest and most animated strain of popular speaking we must always preserve regard to what the public ear will bear this direction i give in order to guard against an injudicious imitation of ancient orators who both in their pronunciation and gesture and in their figures of expression used a bolder manner than what the greater coolness of modern taste will readily suffer this may perhaps as i formerly observed be a disadvantage to modern eloquence it is no reason why we should be too severe in checking the impulse of genius and continue always creeping on the ground but it is a reason however why we should avoid carrying the tone of declamation to a height that would now be reckoned extravagant demosthenes to justify the unsuccessful action of cheronaea calls up the manes of those heroes who fell in the battle of marathon and plataea and swears by them that their fellow citizens had done well in their endeavors to support the same cause cicero in his oration for milo implores and attests the alban hills and groves and makes a long address to them and both passages in these orators have a fine effect the passage in cicero is very beautiful and adorned with the highest coloring of his eloquence non est humano conilio ne mediocri quidem judices deorum immortalium cura res illa perfecta religiones mehercule ipsae araeque cum illam belluam cadere viderunt commoviste se videntur et jus in illo suum retinuisse vos enim jam albani tumuli atque luci vos inquam imploro atque obtestor vosque albanorum obae arae sacrorum populi romani sociae et equales quas ille praeceps amentia caesis prostratisque sanctissimiis lucis substructionum insanis molibus oppresserat vestrae tum arae vestrae religiones viguerunt vestra vis valuit quam ille omni scelere polluerat tuque ex tuo edito monte latiali sancte jupiter cujus ille lacus nemora finesque saepe omni nefario stupro scelere macularat aliquando ad eum puniendum oculos aperuisti vobis illae vobis vestro in conspectu serae sed justae tamen and debitae poenae solutae sunt  but how few modern orators could venture on such apostrophes and what a power of genius would it require to give such figures now their proper grace or make them produce a due effect upon the hearers  in the fifth and last place in all kinds of public speaking but especially in popular assemblies it is a capital rule to attend to all the decorums of time place and character no warmth of eloquence can atone for the neglect of these that vehemence which is becoming in a person of character and authority may be unsuitable to the modesty expected from a young speaker that sportive and witty manner which may suit one subject and on eassembly is altogether out of place in a grave cause and a solemn meeting caput artis est says quinctilian decere the first principle of art is to observe decorum no one should ever rise to speak in public without forming to himself a just and strict idea of what suits his own age and character what suits the subject the hearers the place the occasion and adjusting the whole train and manner of his speaking on this idea all the ancients insist much on this consult the first chapter of the eleventh book of quinctilian which is employed wholly on this point and is full of good sense ciceros admonitions in his orator ad brutum i shall give in his own words which should never be forgotten by any who speak in public est eloquentiae sicut reliquarum rerum fundamentum sapientia ut enim in vita sic in oratione nihil est difficilius quam quod deceat videre hujus ignoratione saepissime peccatur non enim omnis fortuna non omnis auctoritas non omnis aetas nec vero locus aut tempus aut auditor omnis eodem aut verborum genere tractandus est aut sententiarum semperque in omni part orationis ut vitae quid deceat considerandum quod et in re de qua agitur positum est et in personis et eorum qui dicunt et eorum qui audiunt good sense is the foundation of eloquence as it is of all other things that are valuable it happens in oratory exactly as it does in life that frequently nothing is more difficult than to discern what is proper and becoming in consequence of mistaking this the grossest faults are often committed for to the different degrees of rank fortune and age among men to all the varieties of time place and auditory the same style of language and the same strain of thought cannot agree in every part of a discourse just as in every part of life we must attend to what is suitable and decent whether that be determined by the nature of the subject of which we treat or by the characters of those who speak or of those who hear   so much for the considerations that require to be attended to with respect to the vehemence and warmth which is allowed in popular eloquence  the current of style should in general be full free and natural quaint and artificial expressions are out of place here and always derogate from persuasion it is a strong and manly style which should chiefly be studied and metaphorical language when properly introduced produces often a happy effect when the metaphors are warm glowing and descriptive some inaccuracy in them will be overlooked which in a written composition would be remarked and censured amidst the torrent of declamation the strength of the figure makes impression the inaccuracy of it escapes  with regard to the degree of conciseness or diffuseness suited to popular eloquence it is not easy to fix any exact bounds i know that it is common to recommend a diffuse manner as the most proper i am inclined however to think that there is danger of erring in this respect and that by indulging too much in the diffuse style public speakers often lose more in point of strength than they gain by the fullness of their illustration there is no doubt that in speaking to a multitude we must not speak in sentences and apothegms care must be taken to explain and to inculcate but this care may be and frequently is carried too far we ought always to remember that how much soever we may be pleased with hearing ourselves speak every audience is very ready to tire and the moment they begin to tire all our eloquence goes for nothing a loose and verbose manner never fails to create disgust and on most occasions we had better run the risque of saying too little than too much better place our thought in one strong point of view and rest it there than by turning it into every light and pouring forth a profusion of words upon it exhaust the attention of our hearers and leave them flat and languid  of pronounciation and delivery i am hereafter to treat apart it is sufficient now to observe that in speaking to mixed assemblies the best manner of delivery is the firm and the determined an arrogant and overbearing manner is indeed always disagreeable and the least appearance of it ought to be shunned but there is a certain decisive tone which may be assumed even by a modest man who is thoroughly persuaded of the sentiments he utters and which is the best calculated for making a general impression a feeble and hesitating manner bespeaks always some distrust of a mans own opinion which is by no means a favorable circumstance for his inducing others to embrace it  these are the chief thoughts which have occurred to me from reflection and observation concerning the peculiar distinguishing characters of the eloquence proper for popular assemblies the sum of what has been said is this the end of popular speaking is persuasion and this must be founded on conviction argument and reasoning must be the basis if we would be speakers of business and not mere declaimers we should be engaged in earnest on the side which we espouse and utter as much as possible our own and not counterfeited sentiments the premeditation should be of things rather than of words clear order and method should be studied the manner and expression warm and animated though still in the midst of that vehemence which may at times be suitable carried on under the proper restraints which regard to the audience and to the decorum of character ought to lay on every public speaker the style free and easy strong and descriptive rather than diffuse and the delivery determined and firm to conclude this head let every orator remember that the impression made by fine and artful speaking is momentary that made by argument and good sense is solid and lasting  i shall now that i may afford an exemplification of that species of oratory of which i have been treating insert some extracts from demosthenes even under the great disadvantage of an english translation they will exhibit a small specimen of that vigorous and spirited eloquence which i have so often praised i shall take my extracts mostly from the philippics and olynthiacs which were entirely popular orations spoken to the general convention of the citizens of athens and as the subject of both the philippics and the olynthiacs is the same i shall not confine myself to one oration but shall join together passages taken from two or three of them such as may show his general strain of speaking on some of the chief branches of the subject the subject in general is to rouse the athenians to guard against philip of macedon whose growing power and crafty policy had by that time endangered and soon after overwhelmed the liberties of greece the athenians began to be alarmed but their deliberations were slow and their measures feeble several of their favorite orators having been gained by philips bribes to favor his cause in this critical conjuncture of affairs demosthenes arose in the following manner he begins his first philippic which like the exordiums of all his orations is simple and artless in the following extracts lelands translation is mostly followed  had we been convened athenians on some new subject of debate i had waited till most of your usual counselors had declared their opinions if i had approved of what was proposed by them i should have continued silent if not i should then have attempted to speak my sentiments but since those very points on which these speakers have oftentimes been heard already are at this time to be considered though i have arisen first i presume i may expect your pardon for if they on former occasions had advised the proper measures you would not have found it needful to consult at present  first then athenians however wretched the situation of our affairs at present seems it must not by any means be thought desperate what i am now going to advance may possibly appear a paradox yet it is a certain truth that our past misfortunes afford a circumstance the most favorable of all others to our future hopes this thought is only hinted in the first philippic but brought out more fully in the third as the same thoughts occasioned by similar situations of affairs sometimes occur in the different orations on this subject  and what is that even that our present difficulties are owing entirely to our total indolence and utter disregard to our own interest for were we thus situated in spite of every effort which our duty demanded then indeed we might regard our fortunes as absolutely desperate but now philip has only conquered your supineness and inactivity the state he has not conquered you cannot be said to be defeated your force has never been exerted  if there is a man in this assembly who thinks that we must find a formidable enemy in philip while he views on one hand the numerous armies which surround him and on the other the weakness of our state despoiled of so much of its dominions i cannot deny that he thinks justly yet let him reflect on this there was a time athenians when we possessed pydna potidoea and melthone and all that country round when many of the states now subjected to him were free and independent and more inclined to our alliance than to his if philip at that time weak in himself and without allies had desponded of success against you he would never have engaged in those enterprises which are now crowned with success nor could have raised himself to that pitch of grandeur at which you now behold him but he knew well that the strongest places are only prizes laid between the combatants and ready for the conqueror he knew that the dominions of the absent devolve naturally to those who are in the field the possessions of the supine to the active and intrepid animated by these sentiments he overturns whole nations he either rules universally as a conqueror or governs as a protector for mankind naturally seek confederacy with such as they see resolved and preparing not to be wanting to themselves  if you my countrymen will now at length be persuaded to entertain the like sentiments if each of you will be disposed to approve himself an useful citizen to the utmost that his station and abilities enable him if the rich will be ready to contribute and the young to take the field in one word if you will be yourselves and banish these vain hopes which every single person entertains that the active part of public business may lie upon others and he remain at his ease you may then by the assistance of the gods recall those opportunities which your supineness has neglected regain your dominions and chastise the insolence of this man  but when o my countrymen will you begin to exert your vigor do you wait till roused by some dire event till forced by some necessity when then are we to think of our present condition to free men the disgrace attending on misconduct is in my opinion the most urgent necessity or say is it your sole ambition to wander through the public places each enquiring of the other what new advices can any thing be more new than that a man of macedon should conquer the athenians and give law to greece is philip dead  no  but he is sick pray what is it to you whether philip is sick or not supposing he should die you would raise up another philip if you continue thus regardless of your interest  many i know delight more in nothing than in circulating all the rumors they hear as articles of intelligence some cry philip has joined with the lacedaemonians and they are concerting the destruction of thebes others assure us he has sent an embassy to the king of persia others that he is fortifying places in illyria thus we all go about framing our several tales i do believe indeed athenians that he is intoxicated with his greatness and does entertain his imagination with many such visionary projects as he sees no power rising to oppose him but i cannot be persuaded that he has so taken his measures that the weakest among us for the weakest they are who spread such rumors know what he is next to do let us disregard these tales let us only be persuaded of this that he is our enemy that we have long been subject to his insolence that whatever we expected to have been done for us by others has turned against us that all the resources left is in ourselves and that if we are not inclined to carry our arms abroad we shall be forced to engage him at home let us be persuaded of these things and then we shall come to a proper determination and be no longer guided by rumors we need not be solicitous to know what particular events are to happen we may be well assured that nothing good can happen unless we give due attention to our own affairs and act as becomes athenians  were it a point generally acknowledged phil iii that philip is now at actual war with the state the only thing under deliberation would then be how to oppose him with most safety but since there are persons so strangely infatuated that although he has already possessed himself of a considerable part of our dominions although he is still extending his conquests although all greece has suffered by his injustice yet they can hear it repeated in this assembly that it is some of us who seek to embroil the state in war this suggestion must first be guarded against i readily admit that were it in our power to determine whether we should be at peace or war peace if it depended on our option is most desirable to be embraced but if the other party has drawn the sword and gathered his armies round him if he amuses us with the name of peace while in fact he is proceeding to the greatest hostilities what is left for us but to oppose him if any man takes that for a peace which is only a preparation for his leading his forces directly upon us after his other conquests i hold that mans mind to be disordered at least it is only our conduct toward philip not philips conduct toward us that is to be termed a peace and this is the peace for which philips treasures are expended for which his gold is so liberally scattered among our venal orators that he may be at liberty to carry on the war against you while you make no war on him  heavens is there any man of a right mind who would judge of peace or war by words and not by actions is there any man so weak as to imagine that it is for the sake of those paltry villages of thrace drongylus and cabyle and mastira that philip is now braving the utmost dangers and enduring the severity of toils and seasons and that he has no designs upon the arsenals and the navies and the silver mines of athens or that he will take up his winter quarters among the cells and dungeons of thrace and leave you to enjoy all your revenues in peace but you wait perhaps till he declare war against you  he will never do so  no though he were at your gates he will still be assuring you that he is not at war such were his professions to the people of oreum when his forces were in the heart of their country such his professions to those of pherae until the moment he attacked their walls and thus he amused the olynthians till he came within a few miles of them and then he sent them a message that either they must quit their city or he his kingdom he would indeed be the absurdest of mankind if while you suffer his outrages to pass unnoticed and are wholly engaged in accusing and prosecuting one another he should by declaring war put an end to your private contests warn you to direct all your zeal against him and deprive his pensioners of their most specious pretense for suspending your resolutions that of his not being at war with the state i for my part hold and declare that by his attack of the megaraeans by his attempts upon the liberty of eubaea by his late incursions into thrace by his practices in peloponnesus philip has violated the treaty he is in a state of hostility with you unless you shall affirm that he who prepares to besiege a city is still at peace until the walls be actually invested the man whose designs whose whole conduct tends to reduce me to subjection that man is at war with me though not a blow has yet been given nor a sword drawn  all greece all the barbarian world is too narrow for this mans ambition and though we greeks see and hear all this we send no embassies to each other we express no resentment but into such wretchedness are we sunk that even to this day we neglect what our interest and duty demand without engaging in associations or forming confederacies we look with unconcern upon philips growing power each fondly imagining that the time in which another is destroyed is so much time gained to him although no man can be ignorant that like the regular periodic return of a fever he is coming upon those who think themselves the most remote from danger  and what is the cause of our present passive disposition for some cause sure there must be why the greeks who have been so zealous heretofore in defense of liberty are now so prone to slavery the cause athenians is that a principle which was formerly fixed in the minds of all now exists no more a principle which conquered the opulence of persia maintained the freedom of greece and triumphed over the powers of sea and land that principle was an unanimous abhorrence of all those who accepted bribes from princes that were enemies to the liberties of greece to be covicted of bribery was then a crime altogether unpardonable neither orators nor generals would then sell for gold the favorable conjunctures which fortune put into their hands no gold could impair our firm concord at home our hatred and diffidence of tyrants and barbarians but now all things are exposed to sale as in a public market corruption has introduced such manners as have proved the bane and destruction of our country is a man known to have received foreign money people envy him does he own it they laugh is he convicted in form they forgive him so universally has this contagion diffused itself among us  if there be any who though not carried away by bribes yet are struck with terror as if philip was something more than human they may see upon a little consideration that he has exhausted all those artifices to which he owes his present elevation and that his affairs are now ready to decline for i myself athenians should think philip really to be dreaded if i saw him raised by honorable means  when forces join in harmony and affection and one common interest unites confederating powers then they share the toils with alacrity and endure distresses with perseverance but when extravagant ambition and lawless power as in the case of philip have aggrandized a single person the first pretense the slightest accident overthrows him and dashes his greatness to the ground for it is not possible athenians it is not possible to found a lasting power upon injustice perjury and treachery these may perhaps succeed for once and borrow for a while from hope a gay and a slourishing appearance but time betrays their weakness and they fall of themselves to ruin for as in structures of every kind the lower parts should have the firmest stability so the grounds and principles of great enterprises should be justice and truth but this solid foundation is wanting to all the enterprises of philip  hence among his confederates there are many who hate who distrust who envy him if you will exert yourselves as your honor and your interest require you will not only discover the weakness and insincerity of his confederates but the ruinous condition also of his own kingdom for you are not to imagine that the inclinations of his subjects are the same with those of their prince he thirsts for glory but they have no part in this ambition harassed by those various excursions he is ever making they groan under perpetual calamity torn from their business and their families and beholding commerce excluded from their coasts all those glaring exploits which have given him his apparent greatness have wasted his natural strength his own kingdom and rendered it much weaker than it originally was besides his profligacy and baseness and those troops of butfoons and dissolute persons whom he caresses and keeps constantly about him are to men of just discernment great indications of the weakness of his mind at present his successes cast a shade over these things but let his arms meet with the least disgrace his feebleness will appear and his character be exposed for as in our bodies while a man is in apparent health the effect of some inward debility which has been growing upon him may for a time be concealed but as soon as it comes the length of disease all his secret infirmities show themselves in whatever part of his frame the disorder is lodged so in states and monarchies while they carry on a war abroad many defects escape the general eye but as soon as war reaches their own territory their infirmities come forth to general observation  fortune has great influence in all human affairs but i for my part should prefer the fortune of athens with the least degree of vigor in sserting your cause to this mans fortune for we have many better reasons to depend upon the favor of heaven than this man but indeed he who will not exert his own strength has no title to depend either on his friends or on the gods is it at all surprising that he who is himself ever amidst the labors and dangers of the field who is every where whom no opportunity escapes to whom no season is unfavourable should be superior to you who are wholly engaged in contriving delays and framing decrees and enquiring after news the contrary would be much more surprising if we who have never hitherto acted as became a state engaged in war should conquer one who acts in every instance with indefatigable vigilance it is this athenians it is this which gives him all his advantage against you philip constantly surrounded by his troops and perpetually engaged in projecting his designs can in a moment strike the blow where he pleases but we when any accident alarms us first appoint our trierarchs then we allow them the exchange by substitution then the supplies are considered next we resolve to man our fleet with strangers and foreigners then find it necessary to supply their place ourselves in the midst of these delays what we are sailing to defend the enemy is already master of for the time of action is spent by us in preparing and the issues of war will not wait for our slow and irresolute measures  consider then your present situation and make such provision as the urgent danger requires talk not of your ten thousands or your twenty thousand foreigners of those armies which appear so magnificent on paper only great and terrible in your decrees in execution weak and contemptible but let your army be made up chiefly of the native forces of the state let it be an athenian strength to which you are to trust and whomsoever you appoint as general let them be entirely under his guidance and authority for ever since our armies have been formed of foreigners alone their victories have been gained over our allies and confederates only while our enemies have risen to an extravagance of power    the orator goes on to point out the number of forces which should be raised the places of their destination the season of the year in which they should set out and then proposes in form his motion as we would call it or his decree for the necessary supply of money and for ascertaining the funds from which it should be raised having finished all that relates to the business under deliberation he concludes these orations on public affairs commonly with no longer peroration than the following which terminates the first philippic i for my part have never upon any occasion chosen to court your favor by speaking any thing but what i was convinced would serve you and on this occasion you have heard my senments freely declared without art and without reserve i should have been pleased indeed that as it is for your advantage to have your true interest laid before you so i might have been assured that he who lays it before you would share the advantage but uncertain as i know the consequence to be with respect to myself i yet determined to speak because i was convinced that these measures if pursued must prove beneficial to the public and of all those opinions which shall be offered to your acceptance may the gods determine that to be chosen which will best advance the general welfare  these extracts may serve to give some imperfect idea of the manner of demosthenes for a juster and more complete one recourse must be had to the excellent original  lecture xxviii eloquence of the bar  analysis of ciceros oration for cluentius i treated in the last lecture of what is peculiar to the eloquence of popular assemblies much of what was said on that head is applicable to the eloquence of the bar the next great scene of public speaking to which i now proceed and my observations upon which will therefore be the shorter all however that was said in the former lecture must not be applied to it and it is of importance that i begin with showing where the distinction lies  in the first place the ends of speaking at the bar and in popular assemblies are commonly different in popular assemblies the great object is persuasion the orator aims at determining the hearers to some choice or conduct as good fit or useful for accomplishing this end it is incumbent on him to apply himself to all the principles of action in our nature to the passions and to the heart as well as to the understanding but at the bar conviction is the great object there it is not the speakers business to persuade the judges to what is good or useful but to show them what is just and true and of course it is chiefly or solely to the understanding that his eloquence is addressed this is a characteristical difference which ought ever to be kept in view  in the next place speakers at the bar address themselves to one or to a few judges and these too persons generally of age gravity and authority of character there they have not those advantages which a mixed and numerous assembly affords for employing all the arts of speech even supposing their subject to admit them passion does not rise so easily the speaker is heard more coolly he is watched over more severely and would expose himself to ridicule by attempting that high vehement tone which is only proper in speaking to a multitude  in the last place the nature and management of the subject which belong to the bar require a very different species of oratory from that of popular assemblies in the latter the speaker has a much wider range he is seldom confined to any precise rule he can fetch his topics from a great variety of quarters and employ every illustration which his fancy or imagination suggest but at the bar the field of speaking is limited to precise law and statute imagination is not allowed to take its scope the advocate has always lying before him the line the square and the compass these it is his principal business to be continually applying to the subjects under debate  for these reasons it is clear that the eloquence of the bar is of a much more limited more sober and chastened kind than that of popular assemblies and for similar reasons we must beware of considering even the judicial orations of cicero or demosthenes as exact models of the manner of speaking which is adapted to the present state of the bar it is necessary to warn young lawyers of this because though these were pleadings spoken in civil or criminal causes yet in fact the nature of the bar anciently both in greece and rome allowed a much nearer approach to popular eloquence than what it now does this was owing chiefly to two causes  first because in the ancient judicial orations strict law was much less an object of attention than it is become among us in the days of demosthenes and cicero the municipal statutes were few simple and general and the decision of causes was trusted in a great measure to the equity and common sense of the judges eloquence much more than jurisprudence was the study of those who were to plead causes cicero somewhere says that three months study was sufficient to make any man a complete civilian nay it was thought that one might be a good pleader at the bar who had never studied law at all for there were among the romans a set of men called pragmatici whose office it was to give the orator all the law knowledge which the cause he was to plead required and which he put into that popular form and dressed up with those colors of eloquence that were most fitted for influencing the judges before whom he spoke  we may observe next that the civil and criminal judges both in greece and rome were commonly much more numerous than they are with us and formed a sort of popular assembly the renowned tribunal of the areopagus at athens consisted of fifty judges at the least vide potter antiq vol i p  0   some make it to consist of a great many more when socrates was condemned by what court it is uncertain we are informed that no fewer than   0 voted against him in rome the praetor who was the proper judge both in civil and criminal causes named for every cause of moment the judices selecti as they were called who were always numerous and had the office and power of both judge and jury in the famous cause of milo cicero spoke to fiftyone judices selecti and so had the advantage of addressing his whole pleading not to one or a few learned judges of the point of law as is the case with us but to an assembly of roman citizens hence all those arts of popular eloquence which we find the roman orator so frequently employing and probably with much success hence tears and commiseration are so often made use of as the instruments of gaining a cause hence certain practices which would be reckoned theatrical among us were common at the roman bar such as introducing not only the accused person dressed in deep mourning but presenting to the judges his family and his young children endeavoring to move them by their cries and tears  for these reasons on account of the wide difference between the ancient and modern state of the bar to which we may add also the difference in the turn of ancient and modern eloquence which i formerly took notice of too strict an imitation of ciceros manner of pleading would now be extremely injudicious to great advantage he may still be studied by every speaker at the bar in the address with which he opens his subject and the insinuation he employs for gaining the favor of the judges in the distinct arrangement of his facts in the gracefulness of his narration in the conduct and exposition of his arguments he may and he ought to be imitated a higher pattern cannot be set before us but one who should imitate him also in his exaggeration and amplifications in his diffuse and pompous declamation and in his attempts to raise passion would now make himself almost as ridiculous at the bar as if he should appear there in the toga of a roman lawyer  before i descend to more particular directions concerning the eloquence of the bar i must be allowed to take notice that the foundation of a lawyers reputation and success must always be laid in a profound knowledge of his own profession nothing is of such consequence to him or deserves more his deep and serious study for whatever his abilities as a speaker may be if his knowledge of the law be reckoned superficial few will chose to commit their cause to him besides previous study and a proper stock of knowledge attained another thing highly material to the success of every pleader is a diligent and painful attention to every cause with which he is entrusted so as to be thoroughly master of all the facts and circumstances relating to it on this the ancient rhetoricians insist with great earnestness and justly represent it as a necessary basis to all the eloquence that can be exerted in pleading cicero tells us under the character of antonius in the second book de oratore that he always conversed at full length with every client who came to consult him that he took care there should be no witness to their conversation in order that his client might explain himself more freely that he was wont to start every objection and to plead the cause of the adverse party with him that he might come at the whole truth and be fully prepared on every point of the business and that after the client had retired he used to balance all the facts with himself under three different characters his own that of the judge and that of the advocate on the opposite side he censures very severely those of the profession who decline taking so much trouble taxing them not only with shameful negligence but with dishonesty and breach of trust equidem soleo dare operam ut de sua quisque re me ipse doceat et nequis alius adsit qno liberius loquatur et agere adversarii causam ut ille agat suam et quicquid de sua re cogitaret in medium proferat itaque cum ille decessit tres personas unus sustineo summa animi equitate meam adversarii judicis  nonnulli dum operam suam multam existimari volunt ut toto foro volitare et a causa ad causam ire videantur causas dicunt incognitas in quo est illa quidem magna offensio vel negligentiae susceptis rebus vel perfidiae receptis sed etiam illa major opinione quod nemo potest de ea re quam non novit non turpissime dicere  to the same purpose quinctilian in the eighth chapter of his last book delivers a great many excellent rules concerning all the methods which a lawyer should employ for attaining the most thorough knowledge of the cause he is to plead again and again recommending patience and attention in conversation with clients and observing very sensibly non tam obest audire surpervacua quam ignorare necessaria frequenter enim et vulnus et remedium in iis orator inveniet quae litigatori in neutram partem habere momentum videbantur to listen to something that is superfluous can do no hurt whereas to be ignorant of something that is material may be highly prejudicial the advocate will frequently discover the weak side of a cause and learn at the same time what is the proper defense from circumstances which to the party himself appeared to be of little or no moment   supposing an advocate to be thus prepared with all the knowledge which the study of the law in general and of that cause which he is to plead in particular can furnish him i must next observe that eloquence in pleading is of the highest moment for giving support to a cause it were altogether wrong to infer that because the ancient popular and vehement manner of pleading is now in a great measure superseded there is therefore no room for eloquence at the bar and that the study of it is become superfluous though the manner of speaking be changed yet still there is a right and a proper manner which deserves to be studied as much as ever perhaps there is no scene of public speaking where eloquence is more necessary for on other occasions the subject on which men speak in public is frequently sufficient by itself to interest the hearers but the dryness and subtilty of the subjects generally agitated at the bar require more than any other a certain kind of eloquence in order to command attention in order to give proper weight to the arguments that are employed and to prevent any thing which the pleader advances from passing unregarded the effect of good speaking is always very great there is as much difference in the impression made upon the hearers by a cold dry and confused speaker and that made by one who pleads the same cause with elegance order and strength as there is between our conception of an object when it is presented to us in a dim light and when we behold it in a full and clear one  it is no small encouragement to eloquence at the bar that of all the liberal professions none gives fairer play to genius and abilities than that of the advocate he is less exposed than some others to suffer by the arts of rivalry by popular prejudices or secret intrigues he is sure of coming forward according to his merit for he stands forth every day to view he enters the list boldly with his competitors every appearance which he makes is an appeal to the public whose decision seldom fails of being just because it is impartial interest and friends may set forward a young pleader with peculiar advantages beyond others at the beginning but they can do no more than open the field to him a reputation resting on these assistances will soon fall spectators remark judges decide parties watch and to him will the multitude of clients never fail to resort who gives the most approved specimens of his knowledge eloquence and industry  it must be laid down for a first principle that the eloquence suited to the bar whether in speaking or in writing law papers is of the calm and temperate kind and connected with close reasoning sometimes a little play may be allowed to the imagination in order to enliven a dry subject and to give relief to the fatigue of attention but this liberty must be taken with a sparing hand for a florid style and a sparkling manner never fail to make the speaker be heard with a jealous ear by the judge they detract from his weight and always produce a suspicion of his failing in soundness and strength of argument it is purity and neatness of expression which is chiefly to be studied a style perspicuous and proper which shall not be needlessly overcharged with the pedantry of law terms and where at the same time no affectation shall appear of avoiding these when they are suitable and necessary  verbosity is a common fault of which the gentlemen of this profession are accused and into which the habit of speaking and writing so hastily and with so little preparation as they are often obliged to do almost unavoidably betrays them it cannot therefore be too much recommended to those who are beginning to practice at the bar that they should early study to guard against this while as yet they have full leisure for preparation let them form themselves especially in the papers which they write to the habit of a strong and a correct style which expresses the same thing much better in a few words than is done by the accumulation of intricate and endless periods if this habit be once acquired it will become natural to them afterward when the multiplicity of business shall force them to compose in a more precipitant manner whereas if the practice of a loose and negligent style has been suffered to become familiar it will not be in their power even upon occasions when they wish to make an unusual effort to express themselves with energy and grace  distinctness is a capital property in speaking at the bar this should be shown chiefly in two things first in stating the question in showing clearly what is the point in debate what we admit what we deny and where the line of division begins between us and the adverse party next it should be shown in the order and arrangement of all the parts of the pleading in every sort of oration a clear method is of the utmost consequence but in those embroiled and difficult cases which belong to the bar it is almost all in all too much much pains therefore cannot be taken in previously studying the plan and method if there be indistinctness and disorder there we can have no success in convincing we leave the whole cause in darkness  with respect to the conduct of narration and argumentation i shall hereafter make several remarks when i come to treat of the component parts of regular oration i shall at present only observe that the narration of facts at the bar should always be as concise as the nature of them will admit facts are always of the greatest consequence to be remembered during the course of the pleading but if the pleader be tedious in his manner of relating them and needlessly circumstantial he lays too great a load upon the memory whereas by cutting off all superfluous circumstances in his recital he adds strength to the material facts he both gives a clearer view of what he relates and makes the impression of it more lasting in argumentation again i would incline to give scope to a more diffuse manner at the bar than on some other occasions for in popular assemblies where the subject of debate is often a plain question arguments taken from known topics gain strength by their conciseness but the obscurity of lawpoints frequently requires the arguments to be spread out and placed in different lights in order to be fully apprehended  when the the pleader comes to refute the arguments employed by his adversary he should be on his guard not to do them injustice by disguising or placing them in a false light the deceit is soon discovered it will not fail of being exposed and tends to impress the judge and the hearers with distrust of the speaker as one who either wants discernment to perceive or wants fairness to admit the strength of the reasoning on the other side whereas when they see that he states with accuracy and candor the arguments which have been used against him before he proceeds to combat them a strong prejudice is created in his favor they are naturally led to think that he has a clear and full conception of all that can be said on both sides of the argument that he has entire confidence in the goodness of his own cause and does not attempt to support it by any artifice or concealment the judge is thereby inclined to receive much more readily the impressions which are given by a speaker who appears both so fair and so penetrating there is no part of the discourse in which the orator has greater oppoortunity of showing a masterly address than when he sets himself to represent the reasonings of his antagonists in order to refute them  wit may sometimes be of service at the bar especially in a lively reply by which we may throw ridicule on something that has been said on the other side but though the reputation of wit be dazzling to a young pleader i woul never advise him to rest his strength upon this talent it is not his business to make an audience laugh but to convince the judge and seldom or never did any one rise to eminence in his profession by being a witty lawyer  a proper degree of warmth in pleading a cause is always of use though in speaking to a multitude greater vehemence be natural yet in addressing ourselves even to a single man the warmth which arises from seriousness and earnestness is one of the most powerful means of persuading him an advocate personates his client he has taken upon him the whole charge of his interests he stands in his place it is improper therefore and has a bad effect upon the cause if he appears indifferent and unmoved and few clients will be fond of trusting their interests in the hands of a cold speaker  at the same time he must beware of prostituting his earnestness and sensibility so much as to enter with equal warmth into every cause that is committed to him whether it can be supposed really to excite his zeal or not there is a dignity of character which it is of the utmost importance for every one in this profession to support for it must never be forgotten that there is no instrument of persuasion more powerful than an opinion of probity and honor in the person who undertakes to persuade plurimum ad omnia momenti est in hoc positum si vir bonus creditur sic enim contingit ut non studium advocati videatur afferre sed pene testis fidem quinct l iv c    it is scarcely possible for any hearer to separate altogether the impression made by the character of him that speaks from the things that he says however secretly and imperceptibly it will be always lending its weight to one side or other either detracting from or adding to the authority and influence of his speech this opinion of honor and probity must therefore be carefully preserved both by some degree of delicacy in the choice of causes and by the manner of conducting them and though perhaps the nature of the profession may render it extremely difficult to carry this delicacy its utmost length yet there are attentions to this point which as every good man for virtues sake so every prudent man for reputations sake will find to be necessary he will always decline embarking in causes that are odious and manifestly unjust and when he supports a doubtful cause he will lay the chief stress upon such arguments as appear to his own judgment the most tenable reserving his zeal and his indignation for cases where injustice and iniquity are flagrant but of the personal qualities and virtues requisite in public speakers i shall afterward have occasion to discourse  these are the chief directions which have occurred to me concerning the peculiar strain of speaking at the bar in order to illustrate the subject farther i shall give a short analysis of one of ciceros pleadings or judicial orations i have chosen that pro cluentio the celebrated one pro milone is more labored and showy but it is too declamatory that pro cluentio comes nearer the strain of a modern pleading and though it has the disadvantage of being very long and complicated too in the subject yet it is one of the most chaste correct and forcible of all ciceros judicial orations and well deserves attention for its conduct  avitus cluentius a roman knight of splendid family and fortunes had accused his stepfather oppianicus of an attempt to poison him he prevailed in the prosecution oppianicus was condemned and banished but as rumors arose of the judges having been corrupted by money in this cause these gave occasion to much popular clamor and had thrown a heavy odium on cluentius eight years afterward oppianicus died an accusation was brought against cluentius of having poisoned him together with a charge also of having bribed the judges in the former trial to condemn him in this action cicero defends him the accusers were sassia the mother of cluentius and widow of oppianicus and young oppianicus the son q naso the praetor was judge together with a considerable number of judices selecti  the introduction of the oration is simple and proper taken from no commonplace topic but from the nature of the cause it begins with taking notice that the whole oration of the accuser was divided into two parts animadverte judices omnem accusatoris orationem in duas divisam esse parts quarum altera mihi niti et magnopere confidere videbatur invidia jam inveterata judicii juniani altera tantummodo consuetudinis causa timide et diffidenter attingere rationem veneficii criminum qua de re lege est haec question constituta itaque mihi certum est hanc eandem distributionem invidiae et criminum sic in defensione servare ut omnes intelligant nihil me nec subterfugere voluisse reticendo nec obscurare dicendo  these two parts were the charge of having poisoned oppianicus on which the accuser conscious of having no proof did not lay the stress of his cause but rested it chiefly on the other charge of formerly corrupting the judges which was capital in certain cases by the roman law cicero purposes to follow him in this method and to apply himself chiefly to the vindication of his client from the latter charge he makes several proper observations on the danger of judges suffering themselves to be swayed by a popular cry which often is raised by faction and directed against the innocent he acknowledges that cluentius had suffered much and long by reproach on account of what had passed at the former trial but begs only a patient and attentive hearing and assures the judges that he will state every thing relating to that matter so fairly and so clearly as shall give them entire satisfaction a great appearance of candor reigns throughout this introduction  the crimes with which cluentius were charged were heinous a mother accusing her son and accusing him of such actions as having first bribed judges to condemn her husband and having afterward poisoned him were circumstances that naturally raised strong prejudices against ciceros client the first step therefore necessary for the orator was to remove these prejudices by showing what sort of persons cluentiuss mother and her husband oppianicus were and thereby turning the edge of public indignation against them the nature of the cause rendered this plan altogether proper and in similar situations it is fit to be imitated he executes his plan with much eloquence and force and in doing it lays open such a scene of infamy and complicated guilt as gives a shocking picture of the manners of that age and such as would seem incredible did not cicero refer to the proof that was taken in the former trial of the facts which he alleges  sassia the mother appears to have been altogether of an abandoned character soon after the death of her first husband the father of cluentius she fell in love with aurius melinus a young man of illustrious birth and great fortune who was married to her own daughter she prevailed with him to divorce her daughter and then she married him herself lectum illum genialem quem biennio ante filiae suae nubenti straverat in eadem domo sibi ornari et sterni expulsa atque exturbata filia jubet nubit genero socrus nullis auspicibus funestis ominibus omnium o mulieris scelus incredibile and praeter hanc unam in omni vita inauditum o audacitm singularem non timuisse si minus vim deorum hominumque famam at illam ipsam noctem facesque illas nuptiales non limen cubiculi non cubile filiae non parietes denique ipsos superiorum testes nuptiarum perfregit ac prostravit omnia cupiditate and furore vicit pudorem libido timorem audacia rationem amentia  the warmth of ciceros eloquence which this passage beautifully exemplifies is here fully justified by the subject  this melinus being afterward by the means of oppianicus involved in syllas proscription and put to death and sassia being left for the second time a widow and in a very opulent situation oppianicus himself made his addresses to her she not startled at the impudence of the proposal nor at the thoughts of marrying one whose hands had been imbrued in her former husbands blood objected only as cicero says to oppianicus having two sons by his present wife oppianicus removed the objection by having his sons privately dispatched and then divorcing his wife the infamous match was concluded between him and sassia these flagrant deeds are painted as we may well believe with the highest colors of ciceros eloquence which there has a very proper field cluentius as a man of honor could no longer live on any tolerable terms with a woman a mother only in the name who had loaded herself and all her family with so much dishonor and hence the feud which had ever since subsisted between them and had involved her unfortunate son in so much trouble and persecution as for oppianicus cicero gives a sort of history of his life and a full detail of his crimes and by what he relates oppianicus appears to have been a man daring fierce and cruel insatiable in avarice and ambition trained and hardened in all the crimes which those turbulent times of marius and syllas proscriptions produced such a man says our orator as in place of being surprised that he was condemned you ought rather to wonder that he had escaped so long  and now having prepared the way by all this narration which is clear and elegant he enters on the history of that famous trial in which his client was charged with corrupting the judges both cluentius and oppianicus were of the city larinum in a public contest about the rights of the freemen of that city they had taken opposite sides which embittered the misunderstanding already subsisting between them sassia now the wife of oppianicus pushed him on to the destruction of her son whom she had long hated as one who was conscious of her crimes and as cluentius was known to have made no will they expected upon his death to succeed to his fortune the plan was formed therefore to dispatch him by poison which considering their former conduct is no incredible part of the story cluentius was at that time indisposed the servant of his physician was to be bribed to give him poison and one fabricius an intimate friend of oppianicus was employed in the negotiation the servant having made the discovery cluentius first prosecuted scamander a freedman of fabricius in whose custody the poison was found and afterward fabricius for this attempt upon his life he prevailed in both actions and both these persons were condemned by the voices almost unanimous of the judges  of both these prejudicia as our author calls them or previous trials he gives a very particular account and rests upon them a great part of his argument as in neither of them there was the least charge or suspicion of any attempt to corrupt the judges but in both these trials oppianicus was pointed at plainly in both scamander and fabricius were prosecuted as only the instruments and ministers of his cruel designs as a natural consequence therefore cluentius immediately afterward raised a third prosecution against oppianicus himself the contriver and author of the whole it was in this prosecution that money was said to have been given to the judges all rome was filled with the report of it and the alarm loudly raised that no mans life or liberty was safe if such dangerous practices were not checked by the following arguments cicero defends his client against this heavy charge of the crimen corrupti judicii  he reasons first that there was not the least reason to suspect it seeing the condemnation of oppianicus was a direct and necessary consequence of the judgments given against scamander and fabricius in the two former trials trials that were fair and uncorrupted to the satisfaction of the whole world yet by these the road was laid clearly open to the detection of oppianicuss guilt his instruments and ministers being once condemned and by the very same judges too nothing could be more absurd than to raise a cry about an innocent person being circumvened by bribery when it was evident on the contrary that a guilty person was now brought into judgment under such circumstances that unless the judges were altogether inconsistent with themselves it was impossible for him to be acquitted  he reasons next that if in this trial there was any corruption of the judges by money it was infinitely more probable that corruption should have proceeded from oppianicus than from cluentius for setting aside the difference of character between the two men the one fair the other flagitious what motive had cluentius to try so odious and dangerous an experiment as that of bribing judges was it not much more likely that he should have had recourse to this last remedy who saw and knew himself and his cause to be in the utmost danger than the other who had a cause clear in itself and of the issue of which in consequence of the two previous sentences given by the same judges he had full reason to be confident was it not much more likely that he should bribe who had every thing to fear whose life and liberty and fortune were at stake than he who had already prevailed in a material part of his charge and who had no further interest in the issue of the prosecution than as justice was concerned  in the third place he asserts it as a certain fact that oppianicus did attempt to bribe the judges that the corruption in this trial so much complained of was employed not by cluentius but against him he calls on titus attius the orator on the opposite side he challenges him to deny if he can or if he dare that stalenus one of the thirtytwo judices selecti did receive money from oppianicus he names the sum that was given he names the persons that were present when after the trial was over stalenus was obliged to refund the bribe this is a strong fact and would seem quite decisive but unluckily a very cross circumstance occurs here for this very stalenus gave his voice to condemn oppianicus for this strange incident cicero accounts in the following manner stalenus says he known to be a worthless man and accustomed before to the like practices entered into a treaty with oppianicus to bring him off and demanded for that purpose a certain sum which he undertook to distribute among a competent number of the other judges when he was once in possession of the money when he found a greater treasure than ever he had been master of deposited in his empty and wretched habitation he became very unwilling to part with any of it to his colleagues and bethought himself of some means by which he could contrive to keep it all to himself the scheme which he devised for this purpose was to promote the condemnation instead of the acquittal of oppianicus as from a condemned person he did not apprehend much danger of being called to account or being obliged to make restitution in place therefore of endeavoring to gain any of his colleagues he irritated such as he had influence with against oppianicus by first promising them money in his name and afterward telling them that oppianicus had cheated him cum esser egens sumptuosus audax callidus perfidiosus and com domi suae missriimis in locis et inanissimis tantum nummorum positum viderit ad omnem malitiam and fraudem versare mentem suam coepit demne judicibus mihi igitur ipsi praeter periculum et infamiam quid quaeretur siquis eum forte casus ex periculo eripuerit nonne reddendum est praecipitantem igitur impellamus inquit et perditum prosternamus capit hoc consilium ut pecuniam quibusdam judicibus levissimis polliceatur deinde eam postea supprimat ut quoniam graves homines sua sponte severe judicaturos purabat hos qui leviores erant destitutione iratos oppianico redderet  when sentence was to be pronounced he had taken measures for being absent himself but being brought by oppianicuss lawyers from another court and obliged to give his voice he found it necessary to lead the way in condemning the man whose money he had taken without fulfilling the bargain which he had made with him  by these plausible facts and reasonings the character of cluentius seems in a great measure cleared and what cicero chiefly intended the odium thrown upon the adverse party but a difficult part of the orators business still remained there were several subsequent decisions of the praetor the censors and the senate against the judges in this cause which all proceeded or seemed to proceed upon this ground of bribery and corruption for it is plain the suspicion prevailed that if oppianicus had given money to stalenus cluentius had outbribed him to all these decisions however cicero replies with much distinctness and subtilty of argument though it might be tedious to follow him through all his reasonings on these heads he shows that the facts were at that time very indistinctly known that the decisions appealed to were hastily given that not one of them concluded directly against his client and that such as they were they were entirely brought about by the inflammatory and factious harangues of quinctius the tribune of the people who had been the agent and advocate of oppianicus and who enraged at the defeat he had sustained had employed all his tribunitial influence to raise a storm against the judges who condemned his client  at length cicero comes to reason concerning the point of law the crimen corrupti judicii or the bribing of the judges was capital in the famous lex cornelia de sicariis was contained this clause which we find still extant pandect lib xlviii tit  0   qui judicem corruperit vel corrumpendum curaverit hac lege teneatur this clause however we learn from cicero was restricted to magistrates and senators and as cluentius was only of the equestrain order he was not even supposing him guilty within the law of this cicero avails himself doubly and as he shows here the most masterly address i shall give a summary of his pleading on this part of the cause you says he to the advocate for the prosecutor you t attius i know had every where given it out that i was to defend my client not from facts not upon the footing of innocence but by taking advantage merely of the law in his behalf have i done so i appeal to yourself have i sought to cover him behind a legal defense only on the contrary have i not pleaded his cause as if he had been a senator liable by the cornelian law to be capitally convicted and shown that neither proof nor probable presumption lies against his innocence in doing so i must acquaint you that i have complied with the desire of cluentius himself for when he first consulted me in this cause and when i informed him that it was clear no action could be brought against him from the cornelian law he instantly besought and obtested me that i would not rest his defense upon that ground saying with tears in his eyes that his reputation was as dear to him as his life and that what he sought as an innocent man was not only to be absolved from any penalty but to be acquitted in the opinion of all his fellowcitizens  hitherto then i have pleaded this cause upon his plan but my client must forgive me if now i shall plead it upon my own for i should be wanting to myself and to that regard which my character and station require me to bear to the laws of the state if i should allow any person to be judged of by a law which does not bind him you attius indeed have told us that it was a scandal and reproach that a roman knight should be exempted from those penalties to which a senator for corrupting judges is liable but i must tell you that it would be a much greater reproach in a state that is regulated by law to depart from the law what safety have any of us in our persons what security for our rights if the law shall be set aside by what title do you q naso sit in that chair and preside in this judgment by what right t attius do you accuse or do i desend whence all the solemnity and pomp of judges and clerks and officers of which this house is full does not all proceed from the law which regulates the whole departments of the state which as a common bond holds its members together and like the soul within the body actuates and directs all public functions ait attius indignum esse facinus si senator judicio quemquam circumvenerit eum legibus teneri si eques romanus hoc idem fecerit eum non teneri ut tibi concedam hoc indignum esse tu mihi concedas necesse est multo esse indignius in ea civitate quae legibus contineatur discedi legibus hoc nam vinculum est hujus dignitatis qua fruimur in republica hoc fundamentum libertatis hic fons equitatis mens et animus et consilium et sententia civitatis posita est in legibus ut corpora nostra sine mente sic civitas sine lege suis partibus ut nervis ac sanguine and membris uti non potest legum ministri magistratus legum interpretes judices legum denique idcirco omnes simus servi ut liberi esse possimus quid est q naso cur tu in hoc loco sedeas etc  on what ground then dare you speak lightly of the law or move that in a criminal trial judges should advance one step beyond what it permits them to go the wisdom of our ancestors has found that as senators and magistrates enjoy higher dignities and greater advantages than other members of the state the law should also with regard to them be more strict and the purity and uncorruptedness of their morals be guarded by more severe sanctions but if it be your pleasure that this institution should be altered if you wish to have the cornelian law concerning bribery extended to all ranks then let us join not in violating the law but in proposing to have this alteration made by a new law my client cluentius will be the foremost in this measure who now while the old law subsists rejected its defense and required his cause to be pleaded as if he had been bound by it but though he would not avail himself of the law you are bound in justice not to stretch it beyond its proper limit  such is the reasoning of cicero on this head eloquent surely and strong as his manner is diffuse i have greatly abridged it from the original but have endeavored to detain its force  in the latter part of the oration cicero treats of the other accusation that was brought against cluentius of having poisoned oppianicus on this it appears his accusers themselves laid small stress having placed their chief hope in overwhelming cluentius with the odium of bribery in the former trial and therefore on this part of the cause cicero does not dwell long he shows the imbrobability of the whole tale which they related concerning this pretended poisoning and makes it appear to be altogether destitute of any shadow of proof  nothing therefore remains but the peroration or conclusion of the whole in this as indeed throughout the whole of this oration cicero is uncommonly chaste and in the midst of much warmth and earnestness keeps clear of turgid declamation the peroration turns on two points the indignation which the character and conduct of sassia ought to excite and the compassion due to a son persecuted through his whole life by such a mother he recapitulates the crimes of sassia her lewdness her violation of every decorum her incestuous marriages her violence and cruelty he places in the most odious light the eagerness and fury which she had shown in the suit she was carrying on against her son describes her journey from larinum to rome with a train of attendants and a great store of money that she might employ every method for circumvening and oppressing him in this trial while in the whole course of her journey she was so detested as to make a solitude wherever she lodged she was shunned and avoided by all her company and her very looks were reckoned contagious the house was deemed polluted which was entered into by so abandoned a woman cum appropinquare hujus judicium ei nuntiatum est confestim hic advolavit ne aut accusatoribus diligentia aut pecunia testibus deessit aut ne forte matter hoc sibi optatissimum spectaculum hujus sordium atque luctus et tanti squaloris amitteret jam vero quod iter romam hujus mulieris fuisse existimatis quod ego propter vicinitatem aquinatium et venafranorum ex multis comperi quos concursus in his oppidis quantos et virorum et mulierum gemitus esse factos mulierem quandam latino atque illam usque a mari supero romam proficisci cum magno comitatu et pecunia quo facilius circumvenire judicio capitis atque opprimere filium possit nemo erat illorum poene dicam quin expiandum illum locum esse arbitraretur quacunque illa iter fecisset nemo quin terram ipsam violari quae matter est omnium vestigiis consceleratae matris putaret itaque nullo in oppido consistendi ei potestas fuit nemo ex tot hospitibus inventus est qui non contagionem aspectus fugeret  to this he opposes the character of cluentius fair unspotted and respectable he produces the testimonies of the magistrates of larinum in his favor given in the most ample and honorable manner by a public decree and supported by a great concourse of the most noted inhabitants who were now present to second every thing that cicero could say in favor of cluentius  wherefore judges he concludes if you abominate crimes stop the triumph of this impious woman prevent this most unnatural mother from rejoicing in her sons blood if you love virtue and worth relieve this unfortunate man who for so many years has been exposed to most unjust reproach through the calumnies raised against him by sassia oppianicus and all their adherents better far it had been for him to have ended his days at once by the poison which oppianicus had prepared for him than to have escaped those snares if he must still be oppressed by an odium which i have shown to be so unjust but in you he trusts in your clemency and your equity that now on a full and fair hearing of his cause you will restore him to his honor you will restore him to his friends and fellowcitizens of whose zeal and high estimation of him you have seen such strong proofs and will show by your decision that though faction and calumny may reign for a while in populat meetings and harangues in trial and judgment regard is paid to the truth only  i have given only a skeleton of this oration of cicero what i have principally aimed at was to show his disposition and method his arrangement of facts and the conduct and force of some of his main arguments but in order to have a full view of the subject and of the art with which the orator manages it recourse must be had to the original few of ciceros orations contain a greater variety of facts and argumentations which renders it difficult to analyze it fully but for this reason i chose it as an excellent example of managing at the bar a complex and intricate cause with order elegance and force  lecture xxix eloquence of the pulpit before treating of the structure and component parts of a regular oration i purposed making some observations on the peculiar strain the distinguishing characters of each of the three great kinds of public speaking i have already treated of the eloquence of popular assemblies and of the eloquence of the bar the subject which remains for this lecture is the strain and spirit of that eloquence which is suited to the pulpit  let us begin with considering the advantages and disadvantages which belong to this field of public speaking the pulpit has plainly several advantages peculiar to itself the dignity and importance of its subjects must be acknowledged superior to any other they are such as ought to interest every one and can be brought home to every mans heart and such as admit at the same time both the highest embellishment in describing and the greatest vehemence and warmth in enforcing them the preacher has also great advantages in treating his subjects he speaks not to one or a few judges but to a large assembly he is secure from all interruption he is obliged to no replies or extemporaneous efforts he chooses his theme at leisure and comes to the public with all the assistance which the most accurate premeditation can give him  but together with these advantages there are also peculiar difficulties that attend the eloquence of the pulpit the preacher it is true has no trouble in contending with an adversary but then debate and contention enliven the genius of men and procure attention the pulpit orator is perhaps in too quiet possession of his field his subjects of discourse are in themselves noble and important but they are subjects trite and familiar they have for ages employed so many speakers and so many pens the public ear is so much accustomed to them that it requires more than an ordinary power of genius to fix attention nothing within the reach of art is more difficult than to bestow on what is common the grace of novelty no sort of composition whatever is such a trial of skill as where the merit of it lies wholly in the execution not in giving any information that is new not in convincing men of what they did not believe but in dressing truths which they knew and of which they were before convinced in such colors as may most forcibly affect their imagination and heart what i have said on this subject coincides very much with the observations made by the famous m bruyere in his maeurs de siecle when he is comparing the eloquence of the pulpit with that of the bar leloquence de la chair en ce qui y enter dhumain and du talent de lorateur est cachee connue de peu de persons and dune difficile execution il faut marcher par des chemins battus dire ce qui a ete dit and ce que lon prevoit que vous allez dire les matieres sont grandes mais usees and triviales les principes surs mais dont les auditeurs penetrent les conclusions dune seule vue il y enter des sujets qui sont sublimes mais qui peut traiter le sublime  le predicateur nest point soutenu comme lavocat par des faits toujours nouveaux par de differens evenements par des avantures inoues il ne sexerce point sur les questions douteuses il ne fait point valoir les violentes conjectures and les presomptions toutes choles neanmoins qui elevent le genie lui donnent de la force and de letendue and qui contraignent bien moins leloquence quelles ne le fixent and le dirigent il doit au contraire tirer son discourse dune source commune and au tout le monde puise and sil secarte de ces lieux communs il nest plus populaire il est abstrait ou declamateur  the inference which he draws from tlese reflections is very just  il est plus aise de precher que de plaider mais plus difficile de bien precher que de bien plaider les characteres ou moeurs de ce siecle p  0   it is to be considered too that the subject of the preacher generally confines him to abstract qualities to virtues and vices whereas that of other popular speakers leads them to treat of persons which is a subject that commonly interests the hearers more and takes faster hold of the imagination the preachers business is solely to make you detest the crime the pleaders to make you detest the criminal he describes a living person and with more facility rouses your indignation from these causes it comes to pass that though we have a great number of moderately good preachers we have however so few that are singularly eminent we are still far from perfection in the art of preaching and perhaps there are few things in which it is more difficult to excel what i say here and in other passages of our being far from perfection in the art of preaching and of their being few who are singularly eminent in it is to be always understood as referring to an ideal view of the perfection of this art which none perhaps since the days of the apostles ever did or ever will reach but in that degree of the eloquence of the pulpit which promotes in a considerable measure the great end of edification and gives a just title to high reputation and esteem there are many who hold a very honorable rank i agree entirely in opinion with a candid judge dr campbell on rhetoric b i chapter  0 who observes that considering how rare the talent of eloquence is among men and considering all the disadvantages under which preachers labor particularly from the frequency of this exercise joined with the other duties of their office to which fixed pastors are obliged there is more reason to wonder that we hear so many instructive and even eloquent sermons than that we hear so few  the object however is noble and worthy upon many accounts of being pursued with zeal  it may perhaps occur to some that preaching is no proper subject of the art of eloquence this it may be said belongs only to human studies and inventions but for the truths of religion with the greater simplicity and the less mixture of art they are set forth they are likely to prove the more successful this objection would have weight if eloquence were as the persons who make such an objection commonly take it to be an ostentatious and deceitful art the study of words and of plausibility only calculated to please and to tickle the ear but against this idea of eloquence i have all along guarded true eloquence is the art of placing truth in the most advantageous light for conviction and persuasion this is what every good man who preaches the gospel not only may but ought to have at heart it is most intimately connected with the success of his ministry and were it needful as assuredly it is not to reason any further on this head we might refer to the discourses of the prophets and apostles as models of the most sublime and persuasive eloquence adapted both to the imagination and the passions of men  an essential requisite in order to preach well is to have a just and at the same time a fixed and habitual view of the end of preaching for in no art can any man execute well who has not a just idea of the end and object of that art the end of all preaching is to persuade men to become good every sermon therefore should be a persuasive oration not but that the preacher is to instruct and to teach to reason and argue all persuasion as i showed formerly is to be founded on conviction the understanding must always be applied to in the first place in order to make a lasting impression on the heart and he who would work on mens passions or ininfluence their practice without first giving them just principles and enlightening their minds is no better than a mere declaimer he may raise transient emotions or kindle a passing ardour but can produce no solid or lasting effect at the same time it must be remembered that all the preachers instructions are to be of the practical kind and that persuasion must ever be his ultimate object it is not to discuss some abstruse point that he ascends the pulpit it is not to illustrate some metaphysical truth or to inform men of something which they never heard before but it is to make them better men it is to give them at once clear views and persuasive impressions of religious truth the eloquence of the pulpit then must be popular eloquence one of the first qualities of preaching is to be popular not in the sense of accommodation to the humors and prejudices of the people which tends only to make a preacher contemptible but in the true sense of the word calculated to make impression on the people to strike and to seize their hearts i scruple not therefore to assert that the abstract and philosophical manner of preaching however it may have sometimes been admired is formed upon a very faulty idea and deviates widely from the just plan of pulpit eloquence rational indeed a preacher ought always to be he must give his audience clear ideas on every subject and entertain them with sense not with sound but to be an accurate reasoner will be small praise if he be not a persuasive speaker also  now if this be the proper idea of a sermon a persuasive oration one very material consequence follows that the preacher himself in order to be successful must be a good man in a preceding lecture i endeavored to show that on no subject can any man be truly eloquent who does not utter the verae voces ab imo pectore who does not speak the language of his own conviction and his own feelings if this holds as in my opinion it does in other kinds of public speaking it certainly holds in the highest degree in preaching there it is of the utmost consequence that the speaker firmly believe both the truth and the importance of those principles which he inculcates on others and not only that he believe them speculatively but have a lively and serious feeling of them this will always give an earnestness and strength a fervor of piety to his exhortations superior in its effects to all the arts of studied eloquence and without it the assistance of art will seldom be able to conceal the mere declaimer a spirit of true piety would prove the most effectual guard against those errors which preachers are apt to commit it would make their discourses solid cogent and useful it would prevent those frivolous and ostentatious harangues which have no other aim than merely to make a parade of speech or amuse an audience and perhaps the difficulty of attaining that pitch of habitual piety and goodness which the perfection of pulpit eloquence would require and of uniting it with that thorough knowledge of the world and those other talents which are requisite for excelling in the pulpit is one of the great causes why so few arrive at very high eminence in this sphere  the chief characteristics of the eloquence suited to the pulpit as distinguished from the other kinds of public speaking appear to me to be these two gravity and warmth the serious nature of the subjects belonging to the pulpit requires gravity their importance to mankind requires warmth it is far from being either easy or common to unite these characters of eloquence the grave when it is predominant is apt to run into a dull uniform solemnity the warm when it wants gravity borders on the theatrical and light the union of the two must be studied by all preachers as of the utmost consequence both in the composition of their discourses and in their manner of delivery gravity and warmth united form that character of preaching which the french call onction the affecting penetrating interesting manner flowing from a strong sensibility of heart in the preacher to the importance of those truths which he delivers and an earnest desire that they may make full impression on the hearts of his hearers  next to a just idea of the nature and object of pulpit eloquence the point of gre test importance to a preacher is a proper choice of the subjects on which he preaches to give rules for the choice of subjects for sermons belongs to the theological more than to the rhetorical chair only in general they should be such as appear to the preacher to be the most useful and the best accommodated to the circumstances of his audience no man can be called eloquent who speaks to an assembly on subjects or in a strain which none or few of them comprehend the unmeaning applause which the ignorant give to what is above their capacity common sense and common probity must teach every man to despise usefulness and true eloquence always go together and no man can long be reputed a good preacher who is not acknowledged to be an useful one  the rules which relate to the conduct of the different parts of a sermon the introduction division argumentative and pathetic parts i reserve to be afterward delivered when treating of the conduct of a discourse in general but some rules and observations which respect a sermon as a particular species of composition i shall now give and i hope they may be of some use  the first which i shall mention is to attend to the unity of a sermon unity indeed is of great consequence in every composition but in other discourses where the choice and direction of the subject are not left to the speaker it may be less in his power to preserve it in a sermon it must be always the preachers own fault if he transgress it what i mean by unity is that there should be some one main point to which the whole strain of the sermon shall refer it must not be a bundle of different subjects strung together but one object must predominate throughout this rule is founded on what we all experience that the mind can attend fully only to one capital object at a time by dividing you always weaken the impression now this unity without which no sermon can either have much beauty or much force does not require that there should be no divisions or separate heads in the discourse or that one single thought only should be again and again turned up to the hearers in different lights it is not to be understood in so narrow a sense it admits of some variety it admits of underparts and appendages provided always that so much union and connection be preserved as to make the whole concur in some one impression upon the mind i may employ for instance several different arguments to enforce the love of god i may also enquire perhaps into the causes of the decay of this virtue still one great object is presented to the mind but if because my text says he that loves god must love his brother also i should therefore mingle in one discourse arguments for the love of god and for the love of our neighbor i would offend unpardonably against unity and leave a very loose and confused impression on the hearers minds  in the second place sermons are always the more striking and commonly the more useful the more precise and particular the subject of them be this follows in a great measure from what i was just now illustrating though a general subject is capable of being conducted with a considerable degree of unity yet that unity can never be so complete as in a particular one the impression made must always be more undeterminate and the instruction conveyed will commonly too be less direct and convincing general subjects indeed such as the excellency or the pleasures of religion are often chosen by young preachers as the most showy and the easiest to be handled and doubtless general views of religion are not to be neglected as on several occasions they have great propriety but these are not the subjects most favorable for producing the high effects of preaching they fall in almost unavoidably with the beaten tract of commonplace thought attention is much more commanded by seizing some particular view of a great subject some single interesting topic and directing to that point the whole force of argument and eloquence to recommend some one grace or virtue or to inveigh against a particular vice furnishes a subject not deficient in unity or precision but if we confine ourselves to that virtue or vice as assuming a particular aspect and consider it as it appears in certain characters or affects certain situations in life the subject becomes still more interesting the execution is i admit more difficult but the merit and the effect are higher  in the third place never study to say all that can be said upon a subject no error is greater than this select the most useful the most striking and persuasive topics which the text suggests and rest the discourse upon these if the doctrines which ministers of the gospel preach were altogether new to their hearers it might be requisite for them to be exceeding full on every particular lest there should be any hazard of their not affording complete information but it is much less for the sake of information than of persuasion that discourses are delivered from the pulpit and nothing is more opposite to persuasion than an unnecessary and tedious fullness there are always some things which the preacher may suppose to be known and some things which he may only shortly touch if he seek to omit nothing which his subject suggests it will unavoidably happen that he will encumber it and weaken its force  in studying a sermon he ought to place himself in the situation of a serious hearer let him suppose the subject addressed to himself let him consider what views of it would strike him most what arguments would be most likely to persuade him what parts of it would dwell most upon his mind let these be employed as his principal materials and in these it is most likely his genius will exert itself with the greatest vigor the spinning and wiredrawing mode which is not uncommon among preachers enervates the noblest truths it may indeed be a consequence of observing the rule which i am now giving that fewer sermons will be preached upon one text than is sometimes done but this will in my opinion be attended with no disadvantage i know no benefit that arises from introducing a whole system of religious truth under every text the simplest and most natural method by far is to choose that view of a subject to which the text principally leads and to dwell no longer on the text than is sufficient for discussing the subject in that view which can commonly be done with sufficient profoundness and distinctness in one or a few discourses for it is a very false notion to imagine that they always preach the most profoundly or go the deepest into a subject who dwell on it the longest on the contrary that tedious circuit which some are ready to take in all their illustrations is very frequently owing either to their want of discernment for perceiving what is most important in the subject or to their want of ability for placing it in the most proper point of view  in the fourth place study above all things to render your instructions interesting to the hearers this is the great trial and mark of true genius for the eloquence of the pulpit for nothing is so fatal to success in preaching as a dry manner a dry sermon can never be a good one in order to preach in an interesting manner much will depend upon the delivery of a discourse for the manner in which a man speaks is of the utmost consequence for affecting his audience but much will also depend on the composition of the discourse correct language and elegant description are but the secondary instruments of preaching in an interesting manner the great secret lies in bringing home all that is spoken to the hearts of the hearers so as to make every man think that the preacher is addressing him in particular for this end let him avoid all intricate reasonings avoid expressing himself in general speculative propositions or laying down practical truths in an abstract metaphysical manner as much as possible the discourse ought to be carried on in the strain of direct address to the audience not in the strain of one writing an essay but of one speaking to a multitude and studying to mix what is called application or what has an immediate reference to practice with the doctrinal and didactic parts of the sermon  it will be of much advantage to keep always in view the different ages characters and conditions of men and to accommodate directions and exhortations to these different classes of hearers whenever you bring forth what a man feels to touch his own character or to suit his own circumstances you are sure of interesting him no study is more necessary for this purpose than the study of human life and the human heart to be able to unfold the heart and to discover a man to himself in a light in which he never saw his own character before produces a wonderful effect as long as the preacher hovers in a cloud of general observations and descends not to trace the particular lines and features of manners the audience are apt to think themselves unconcerned in the description it is the striking accuracy of moral characters that gives the chief power and effect to a preachers discourse hence examples founded on historical facts and drawn from real life of which kind the scriptures afford many always when they are well chosen command high attention no favorable opportunity of introducing these should be omitted they correct in some degree that disadvantage to which i before observed preaching is subject of being confined to treat of qualities in the abstract not of persons and place the weight and reality of religious truths in the most convincing light perhaps the most beautiful and among the most useful sermons of any though indeed the most difficult in composition are such as are wholly characteristical or founded on the illustration of some peculiar character or remarkable piece of history in the sacred writings by pursuing which one can trace and lay open some of the most secret windings of mans heart other topics of preaching have been much beaten but this is a field which wide in itself has hitherto been little explored by the composers of sermons and possesses all the advantages of being curious new and highly useful bishop butlers sermon on the character of balaam will give an idea of that sort of preaching which i have in my eye  in the fifth and last place let me add a caution against taking the model of preaching from particular fashions that chance to have the vogue these are torrents that swell to day and have spent themselves by tomorrow sometimes it is the taste of poetical preaching sometimes of philosophical that has the fashion on its side at one time it must be all pathetic at another time all argumentative according as some celebrated preacher has set the example each of thesemodes in the extreme is very faulty and he who conforms himself to it will both cramp genius and corrupt it it is the universal taste of mankind which is subject to no such changing modes that alone is entitled to possess any authority and this will never give its sanction to any strain of preaching but what is founded on human nature connected with usefulness adapted to the proper idea of a sermon as a serious persuasive oration delivered to a multitude in order to make them better men let a preacher form himself upon this standard and keep it close in his eye and he will be in a much surer road to reputation and success at last than by a servile compliance with any popular taste or transient humor of his hearers truth and good sense are firm and will establish themselves mode and humor are feeble and fluctuating let him never follow implicitly any one example or become a servile imitator of any preacher however much admired from various examples he may pick up much for his improvement some he may prefer to the rest but the servility of imitation extinguishes all genius or rather is a proof of the entire want of genius  with respect to style that which the pulpit requires must certainly in the first place be very perspicuous as discourses spoken there are calculated for the instruction of all sorts of hearers plainness and simplicity should reign in them all unusual swollen or high sounding words should be avoided especially all words that are merely poetical or merely philosophical young preachers are apt to be caught with the glare of these and in young composers the error may be excusable but they may be assured that it is an error and proceeds from their not having yet acquired a correct taste dignity of expression indeed the pulpit requires in a high degree nothing that is mean or grovelling no low or vulgar phrases ought on any account to be admitted but this dignity is perfectly consistent with simplicity the words employed may be all plain words easily understood and in common use and yet the style may be abundantly dignified and at the same time very lively and animated for a lively animated style is extremely suited to the pulpit the earnestness which a preacher ought to feel and the grandeur and importance of his subjects justify and often require warm and glowing expressions he not only may employ metaphors and comparisons but on proper occasions may apostrophise the saint or the sinner may personify inanimate objects break out into bold exclamations and in general has the command of the most passionate figures of speech but on this subject of the proper use and management of figures i have insisted so fully in former lectures that i have no occasion now to give particular directions unless it be only to recall to mind that most capital rule never to employ strong figures or a pathetic style except in cases where the subject leads to them and where the speaker is impelled to the use of them by native unaffected warmth  the language of sacred scripture properly employed is a great ornament to sermons it may be employed either in the way of quotation or allusion direct quotations brought from scripture in order to support what the preacher inculcates both give authority to his doctrine and render his discourse more solemn and venerable allusions to remarkable passages or expressions of scripture when introduced with propriety have generally a pleasing effect they afford the preacher a fund of metaphorical expression which no other composition enjoys and by means of which he can vary and enliven his style but he must take care that any such allusions be natural and easy for if they seem forced they approach to the nature of conceits bishop sherlock when showing that the views of reason have been enlarged and the principles of natural religion illustrated by the discoveries of christianity attacks unbelievers for the abuse they make of these advantages in the following manner what a return do we make for those blessings we have received how disrespectfully do we treat the gospel of christ to which we owe that clear light both of reason and nature which we now enjoy when we endeavor to set up reason and nature in opposition to it ought the withered hand which christ has restored and made whole to be lifted up against him vol i disc i this allusion to a noted miracle of our lords appears to me happy and elegant dr seed is remarkably fond of allusions to scripture style but he sometimes employs such as are too strained and fanciful as when he says sermon iv no one great virtue will come single the virtues that be her fellows will bear her company with joy and gladnses alluding to a passage in the xlvth psalm which relates to the virgins the companions of the kings daughter and sermon xiii having said that the universities have justly been called the eyes of the nation he adds and if the eyes of the nation be evil the whole body of it must be full of darkness   in a sermon no points or conceits should appear no affected smartness and quaintness of expression these derogate much from the dignity of the pulpit and give to a preacher that air of foppishness which he ought above all things to shun it is rather a strong expressive style than a sparkling one that is to be studied but we must beware of imagining that we render style strong and expressive by a constant and multiplied use of epithets this is a great error epithets have often great beauty and force but if we introduce them into every sentence and string many of them together to one object in place of strengthening we clog and enfeeble style in place of illustrating the image we render it confused and indistinct he that tells me of this perishing mutable and transitory world by all these three epithets does not give me so strong an idea of what he would convey as if he had used one of them with propriety i conclude this head with an advice never to have what may be called a favorite expression for it shows affectation and becomes disgusting let not any expression which is remarkable for its luster or beauty occur twice in the same discourse the repetition of it betrays a fondness to shine and at the same time carries the appearance of barren invention  as to the question whether it be most proper to write sermons fully and commit them accurately to memory or to study only the matter and thoughts and trust the expression in part at least to the delivery i am of opinion that no universal rule can here be given the choice of either of these methods must be left to preachers according to their different genius the expressions which come warm and glowing from the mind during the fervor of pronunciation will often have a superior grace and energy to those which are studied in the retirement of the closet but then this fluency and power of expression cannot at all times be depended upon even by those of the readiest genius and by many can at no time be commanded when overawed by the presence of an audience it is proper therefore to begin at least the practice of preaching with writing as accurately as possible this is absolutely necessary in the beginning in order to acquire the power and habit of correct speaking nay also of correct thinking upon religious subjects i am inclined to go further and to say that it is proper not only to begin thus but also to continue as long as the habits of industry last in the practice both of writing and committing to memory relaxation in this particular is so common and so ready to grow upon most speakers in the pulpit that there is little occasion for giving any cautions against the extreme of overdoing in accuracy  of pronunciation or delivery i am hereafter to treat apart all that i shall now say upon this head is that the practice of reading sermons is one of the greatest obstacles to the eloquence of the pulpit in great britain where alone this practice prevails no discourse which is designed to be persuasive can have the same force when read as when spoken the common people all feel this and their prejudice against this practice is not without foundation in nature what is gained hereby in point of correctness is not equal i apprehend to what is lost in point of persuasion and force they whose memories are not able to retain the whole of a discourse might aid themselves considerably by short notes lying before them which would allow them to preserve in a great measure the freedom and ease of one who speaks  the french and english writers of sermons proceed upon very different ideas of the eloquence of the pulpit and seem indeed to have split it betwixt them a french sermon is for most part a warm animated exhortation an english one is a piece of cool instructive reasoning the french preachers address themselves chiefly to the imagination and the passions the english almost solely to the understanding it is the union of these two kinds of composition of the french earnestness and warmth with the english accuracy and reason that would form according to my idea the model of a perfect sermon a french sermon woul sound in our ears as a florid and often as an enthusiastic harangue the censure which in fact the french critics pass on the english preachers is that they are philosophers and logicians but not orators les sermons sont suivant notre method de vrais discourse oratoires and non pas comme chez les anglois des discussions metaphysiques plus convenables a une une academie quaux assemblies populaires qui se sorment dans nos temples et quil sagit dinstruire des devoirs du chretianisme dencourager de consoler dedifier rhetorique francoise par m crevier tome i p      the defects of most of the french sermons are these from a mode that prevails among them of taking their texts from the lesson of the day the connection of the text with the subject is often unnatural and forced one of massillons best sermons that on the coldness and langour with which christians perform the duties of religion is preached from luke iv    and he arose out of the synagogue and entered into simons house and simons wifes mother was taken ill with a great fever  their applications of scripture are fanciful rather than instructive their method is stiff and cramped by their practice of dividing their subject always either into three or two main points and their composition is in general too diffuse and consists rather of a very few thoughts spread out and highly wrought up than of a rich variety of sentiments admitting however all these defects it cannot be denied that their sermons are formed upon the idea of a persuasive popular oration and therefore i am of opinion they may be read with benefit  among the french protestant divines saurin is the most distinguished he is copious eloquent and devout though too ostentatious in his manner among the roman catholics the two most eminent are bourdaloue and massillon it is a subject of dispute among the french critics to which of these the preference is due and each of them have their several partisans to bourdaloue they attribute more solidity and close reasoning to massillon a more pleasing and engaging manner bourdaloue is indeed a great reasoner and inculcates his doctrines with much zeal piety and earnestness but his style is verbose he is disagreeably full of quotations from the fathers and he wants imagination massillon hae more grace more sentiment and in my opinion every way more genius he discovers much knowledge both of the world and of the human heart he is pathetic and persuasive and upon the whole is perhaps the most eloquent writer of sermons which modern times have produced in order to give an idea of that kind of eloquence which is employed by the french preachers i shall insert a passage from massillon which in the encyclopedie article eloquence is extolled by voltaire who was the author of that article as a chefdoeuvre equal to any thing of which either ancient or modern times can boast the subject of the sermon is the small number of those who shall be saved the strain of the whole discourse is extremely serious and animated but when the orator came to the passage which follows voltaire informs us that the whole assembly were moved that by a sort of involuntary motion they started up from their seats and that such murmurs of surprise and and acclamations arose as disconcerted the speaker though they increased the effect of his discourse  je marrete a vous mes freres qui etes ici assembles je ne parle plus du rest des hommes je

au milieu du monde et ne pas ressembler a la soul sermons de massilon vol iv     during the period that preceded the restoration of king charles ii the sermons of the english divines abounded with scholastic casuistical theology they were full of minute divisions and subdivisions and scraps of learning in the didactic part but to these were joined very warm pathetic addresses to the consciences of the hearers in the applicatory part of the sermon upon the restoration preaching assumed a more correct and polished form it became disencumbered from the pedantry and scholastic divisions of the sectaries but it threw out also their warm and pathetic addresses and established itself wholly upon the modle of cool reasoning and rational instruction as the dissenters from the church continued to preserve somewhat of the old strain of preaching this led the established clergy to depart the farther from it whatever was earnest and passionate either in the composition or delivery of sermons was reckoned enthusiastic and fanatical and hence that argumentative manner bordering on the dry and unpersuasive which is too generally the character of english sermons nothing can be more correct upon that model than many of them are but the model itself on which they are formed is a confined and imperfect one dr clark for instance every where abounds in good sense and the most clear and accurate reasoning his applications of scripture are pertinent his style is always perspicuous and often elegant he instructs and he convinces in what then is he deficient in nothing except in the power of interesting and seizing the heart he shows you what you ought to do but he excites not the desire of doing it he treats man as if he were a being of pure intellect without imagination or passions archbishop tillotsons manner is more free and warm and he approaches nearer than most of the english divines to the character of popular speaking hence he is to this day one of the best models we have for preaching we must not indeed consider him in the light of a perfect orator his composition is too loose and remiss his style too feeble and frequently too flat to deserve that high character but there is in some of his sermons so much warmth and earnestness and through them all there runs so much ease and perspicuity such a vein of good sense and sincere piety as justly entitle him to be held as eminent a preacher as england has produced  in dr barrow one admires more the prodigious fecundity of his invention and the uncommon strength and force of his conceptions than the felicity of his execution or his talent in composition we see a genius far surpassing the common peculiar indeed almost to himself but that genius often shooting wild and unchastised by any discipline or study of eloquence  i cannot attempt to give particular characters of that great number of writers of sermons which this and the former age have produced among whom we meet with a variety of the most respectable names we find in their composition much that deserves praise a great display of abilities of different kinds much good sense and piety sound divinity and useful instruction though in general the degree of eloquence bears not perhaps equal proportion to the goodness of the matter bishop atterbury deserves being particularly mentioned as a model of correct and beautiful style besides having the merit of a warmer and more eloquent strain of writing in some of his sermons than is commonly met with had bishop butler in place of abstract philosophical essays given us more sermons in the strain of those two excellent ones which he has composed upon selfdeceit and upon the character of balaam we would then have pointed him out as distinguished for that species of characteristical sermons which i before recommended  though the writings of the english divines are very proper to be read by such as are designed for the church i must caution them against making too much use of them or transcribing large passages from them into the sermons they compose such as once indulge themselves in this practice will never have any fund of their own infinitely better it is to venture into the public with thoughts and expressions which have occured to themselves though of inferior beauty than to disfigure their compositions by borrowed and illsorted ornaments which to a judicious eye will be always in hazard of discovering their own poverty when a preacher sits down to write on any subject never let him begin with seeking to consult all who have written on the same text or subject this if he consult many will throw perplexity and confusion into his ideas and if he consults only one will often warp him insensibly into his method whether it be right or not but let him begin with pondering the subject on his own thoughts let him endeavor to fetch materials from within to collect and arrange his ideas and form some sort of plan to himself which it is always proper to put down in writing then and not till then he may enquire how others have treated the same subject by this means the method and the leading thoughts in the sermon are likely to be his own these thoughts he may improve by comparing them with the tract of sentiment which others have pursued some of their sense he may without blame incorporate into his composition retaining always his own words and style this is fair assistance all beyond is plagiarism  on the whole never let the principle with which we set out at first be forgotten to keep close in view the great end for which a preacher mounts the pulpit even to infuse good dispositions into his hearers to persuade them to serve god and to become better men let this always dwell on his mind when he is composing and it will diffuse through his compositions that spirit which will render them at once esteemed and useful the most useful preacher is always the best and will not fail of being esteemed so embellish truth only with a view to gain it the more full and free admission into your hearers minds and your ornaments will in that case be simple masculine natural the best applause by far which a preacher can receive arises from the serious and deep impressions which his discourse leaves on those who hear it the finest encomium perhaps ever bestowed on a preacher was given by louis xiv to the eloquent bishop of clermont father massillon whom i before mentioned with so much praise after hearing him preach at versailles he said to him father i have heard many great orators in this chapel i have been highly pleased with them but for you whenever i hear you i go away displeased with myself for i see more of my own character  lecture xxx critical examination of a sermon of bishop atterburys the last lecture was employed in observations on the peculiar and distinguishing characters of the eloquence proper for the pulpit but as rules and directions when delivered in the abstract are never so useful as when they are illustrated by particular instances it may perhaps be of some benefit to those who are designed for the church that i should analyze an english sermon and consider the matter of it together with the manner for this purpose i have chosen bishop atterbury as my example who is deservedly accounted one of our most eloquent writers of sermons and whom i mentioned as such in the last lecture at the same time he is more distinguished for elegance and purity of expression than for profoundness of thought his style though sometimes careless is upon the whole neat and chaste and more beautiful than that of most writers of sermons in his sentiments he is not only rational but pious and devotional which is a great excellency the sermon which i have singled out is that upon praise and thanksgiving the first sermon of the first volume which is reckoned one of his best in examining it it is necessary that i should use full liberty and together with the beauties point out any defects that occur to me in the matter as well as in the style  psalm l    offer unto god thanksgiving  among the many excellencies of this pious collection of hymns for which so particular a value has been set upon it by the church of god in all ages this is not the least that the true price of duties is there justly stated men are called off from resting in the outward show of religion in ceremonies and ritual observances and taught rather to practice that which was shadowed out by these rites and to which they are designed to lead sound inward piety and virtue  the several composers of these hymns were prophets persons whose business it was not only to foretell events for the benefit of the church in succeeding times but to correct and reform also what was amiss among that race of men with whom they lived and conversed to preserve a foolish people from idolatry and false worship to rescue the law from corrupt glosses and superstitious abuses and to put men in mind of what they are so willing to forget that eternal and invariable rule which was before these positive duties would continue after them and was to be observed even then in preference to them  the discharge i say of this part of the prophetic office taking up so much room in the book of psalms this has been one reason among many others why they have always been so highly esteemed because we are from hence furnished with a proper reply to an argument commonly made use of by unbelievers who look upon all revealed religions as pious frauds and impostures on the account of the prejudices they have entertained in relation to that of the jews the whole of which they first suppose to lie in external performances and then easily persuade themselves that god could never be the author of such a mere piece of pageantry and empty formality nor delight in a worship which consisted purely in a number of odd unaccountable ceremonies which objection of theirs we should not be able thoroughly to answer unless we could prove chiefly out of the psalms and other parts of the prophetic writings that the jewish religion was somewhat more than bare outside and show and that inward purity and the devotion of the heart was a duty then as well as now  this appears to me an excellent introduction the thought on which it rests is solid and judicious that in the book of psalms the attention of men is called to the moral and spiritual part of religion and the jewish dispensation thereby vindicated from the suspicion of requiring nothing more from its votaries than the observance of the external rites and ceremonies of the law such views of religion are proper to be often displayed and deserve to be insisted on by all who wish to render preaching conductive to the great purpose of promoting righteousness and virtue the style as far as we have gone is not only free from faults but elegant and happy  it is a great beauty in an introduction when it can be made to turn on some one thought fully brought out and illustrated especially if that thought has a close connection with the following discourse and at the same time does not anticipate any thing that is afterward to be introduced in a more proper place this introduction of atterburys has all these advantages the encomium which he makes on the strain of davids psalms is not such as might as well have been prefixed to any other discourse the text of which was taken from any of the psalms had this been the case the introduction would have lost much of its beauty we shall see from what follows how naturally the introductory thought connects with his text and how happily it ushers it in  one great instance of this proof we have in the words now before us which are taken from a psalm of asaph written on purpose to set out the weakness and worthlessness of external performances when compared with more substantial and vital duties to enforce which doctrine god himself is brought in as delivering it hear o my people and i will speak o israel and i will testify against thee i am god even thy god the preface is very solemn and therefore what it ushers in we may be sure is of no common importance i will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings to have been continually before me that is i will not so reprove thee for any failures in thy sacrifices and burntofferings as if these were the only or the chief things i required of thee i will take no bullock out of thy house nor hegoat out of thy folds i prescribed not sacrifices to thee for my own sake because i needed them for every beast of the forest is mine and the cattle on a thousand hills mine they are and were before i commanded thee to offer them to me so that as it follows if i were hungry yet would i not tell thee for the world is mine and the fullness thereof but can ye be so gross and senseless as to think me liable to hunger and thirst as to imagine that wants of that kind can touch me will i eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats  thus does he expostulate severely with them after the most graceful manner of the eastern poetry the issue of which is a plain and full resolution of the case in those few words of the text  offer unto god thanksgiving would you do your homage the most agreeable way would you render the most acceptable of services offer unto god thanksgiving  it is often a difficult matter to illustrate gracefully the text of a sermon from the context and to point out the connection between them this is a part of the discourse which is apt to become dry and tedious especially when pursued into a minute commentary and therefore except as far as such illustration from the context is necessary for explaining the meaning or in cases where it serves to give dignity and force to the text i would advise it to be always treated with brevity sometimes it may even be wholly omitted and the text assumed merely as an independent proposition if the connection with the context be obscure and would require a laborious explanation in the present case the illustration from the context is singularly happy the passage of the psalm on which it is founded is noble and spirited and connected in such a manner with the text as to introduce it with a very striking emphasis on the language i have little to observe except that the phrase one great instance of this proof is a clumsy expression it was sufficient to have said one great proof or one great instance of this in the same sentence when he speaks of setting out the weakness and worthlessness of external performances we may observe that the word worthlessness as it is now commonly used signifies more than the deficiency of worth which is all that the author means it generally imports a considerable degree of badness or blame it would be more proper therefore to say the imperfection or the insignificancy of external performances  the use i intend to make of these words is from hence to raise some thoughts about that very excellent and important duty of praise and thanksgiving a subject not unfit to be discoursed of at this time whether we consider either the more than ordinary coldness that appears of late in mens tempers toward the practice of this or any other part of a warm and affecting devotion the great occasion of setting aside this particular day in the calendar some years ago or the new instances of mercy and goodness which god has lately been pleased to bestow upon us answering at last the many prayers and fastings by which we have besought him so long for the establishment of their majestys throne and for the success of their arms and giving us in his good time an opportunity of appearing before him in the more delightful part of our duty with the voice of joy and praise with a multitude that keep holidays  in this paragraph there is nothing remarkable no particular beauty or neatness of expression and the sentence which it forms is long and tiresome  to raise some thoughts about that very excellent etc is rather loose and awkward  better  to recommend that very excellent etc and when he mentions setting aside a particular day in the calendar one would imagine that setting apart would have been more proper as to set aside seems rather to suggest a different idea   offer unto god thanksgiving  which that we may do let us enquire first how we are to understand this command of offering praise and thanksgiving unto god and then how reasonable it is that we should comply with it  this is the general division of the discourse an excellent one it is and corresponds to many subjects of this kind where particular duties are to be treated of first to explain and then to recommend or enforce them a division should always be simple and natural and much depends on the proper view which it gives of the subject  our enquiry into what is meant here will be very short for who is there that understands any thing of religion but knows that the offering praise and thanks to god implies our having a lively and devout sense of his excellencies and of his benefits our recollecting them with humility and thankfulness of heart and our expressing these inward affections by suitable outward signs by reverent and lowly postures of body by songs and hymns and spiritual ejaculations either publicly or privately either in the customary and daily service of the church or in its more solemn assemblies convened upon extraordinary occasions this is the account which every christan easily gives himself of it and which therefore it would be needless to enlarge upon i shall only take notice upon this head that praise and thanksgiving do in strictness of speech signify things somewhat different our praise properly terminates in god on account of his natural excellencies and perfections and is that act of devotion by which we confess and admire his several attributes but thanksgiving is a narrower duty and imports only a grateful sense and acknowledgment of past mercies we praise god for all his glorious acts of every kind that regard either us or other men for his very vengeance and those judgments which he sometimes sends abroad in the earth but we thank him properly speaking for the instances of his goodness alone and for such only of these as we ourselves are someway concerned in this i say is what the two words strictly imply but since the language of scripture is generally less exact and uses either of them often to express the other by i shall not think myself obliged in what follows thus nicely always to distinguish them  there was room here for insisting more fully on the nature of the duty than the author has done under this head in particular this was the place for correcting the mistake to which men are always prone of making thanksgiving to consist merely in outward expressions and for showing them that the essence of the duty lies in the inward feelings of the heart in general it is of much use to give full and distinct explications of religious duties but as our author intended only one discourse on the subject he could not enlarge with equal fullness on every part of it and he has chosen to dwell on that part on which indeed it is most necessary to enlarge the motives enforcing the duty for as it is an easier matter to know than to practice duty the persuasive part of the discourse is that to which the speaker should always bend his chief strength the account given in this head of the nature of praise and thanksgiving though short is yet comprehensive and distinct and the language is smooth and elegant  now the great reasonableness of this duty of praise or thanksgiving and our several obligations to it will appear if we either consider it absolutely in itself as the debt of our natures or compare it with other duties and show the rank it bears among them or set out in the last place some of its peculiar properties and advantages with regard to the devout performer of it  the author here enters upon the main part of his subject the reasonableness of the duty and mentions three arguments for proving it these are well stated and are in themselves proper and weighty considerations how far he has handled each of them to advantage will appear as we proceed i cannot however but think that he has omitted one very material part of the argument which was to have shown the obligations we are under to this duty from the various subjects of thanksgiving afforded us by the divine goodness this would have led him to review the chief benefits of creation providence and redemption and certainly they are these which lay the foundation of the whole argument for thanksgiving the heart must first be affected with a suitable sense of the divine benefits before one can be excited to praise god iy you would persuade me to be thankful to a benefactor you must not employ such considerations merely as those upon which the author here rests taken from gratitudes being the law of my nature or bearing a high rank among moral duties or being attended with peculiar advantages these are considerations but of a secondary nature you must begin with setting before me all that my friend has done for me if you mean to touch my heart and to call forth the emotions of gratitude the case is perfectly similar when we are exhorted to give thanks to god and therefore in giving a full view of the subject the blessings conferred on us by divine goodness should have been taken into the argument  it may be said however in apology for our author that this would have led him into too wide a field for one discourse and into a field also which is difficult because so beaten the enumeration of the divine benefits he therefore seems to take it for granted that we have upon our minds a just sense of these benefits he assumes them as known and acknowledged and setting aside what may be called the pathetic part of the subject or what was calculated to warm the heart he goes on to the reasoning part in this management i cannot altogether blame him i do not by any means say that it is necessary in every discourse to take in all that belongs to the doctrine of which we treat many a discourse is spoiled by attempting to render it too copious and comprehensive the preacher may without reprehension take up any part of a great subject to which his genius at the time leads him and make that his theme but when he omits any thing which may be thought essential he ought to give notice that this is a part which for the time he lays aside something of this sort would perhaps have been proper here our author might have begun by saying that the reasonableness of this duty must appear to every thinking being who reflects upon the infinite obligations which are laid upon us by creating preserving and redeeming love and after taking notice that the field which these open was too wide for him to enter upon at that time have proceeded to his other heads let us now consider these separately  the duty of praise and thanksgiving considered absolutely in itself is i say the debt and law of our nature we had such faculties bestowed on us by our creator as made us capable of satisfying this debt and obeying this law and they never therefore work more naturally and freely than when they are thus employed  it is one of the earliest instructions given us by philosophy and which has ever since been approved and inculcated by the wisest men of all ages that the original design of making man was that he might praise and honor him who made him when god had finished this goodly frame of things we call the world and put together the several parts of it according to his infinite wisdom in exact number weight and measure there was still wanting a creature in these lower regions that could apprehend the beauty order and exquisite contrivance of it that from contemplating the gift might be able to raise itself to the great giver and do honor to all his attributes every thing indeed that god made did in some sense glorify its author inasmuch as it carried upon it the plain mark and impress of the deity and was an effect worthy of that first cause from whence it flowed and thus might the heavens be said at the first moment in which they stood forth to declare his glory and the firmament to show his handiwork but this was an imperfect and defective glory the sign was of no signification here below whilst there was no one here as yet to take notice of it man therefore was formed to supply this want endowed with powers fit to find out and to acknowledge these unlimited perfections and then put into this temple of god this lower world as the priest of nature to offer up the incense of thanks and praise for the mute and insensible part of the creation  this i say has been the opinion all along of the most thoughtful men down from the most ancient times and though it be not demonstrative yet it is what we cannot but judge highly reasonable if we do but allow that man was made for some end or other and that he is capable of perceiving that end for then let us search and enquire never so much we shall find no other account of him that we can rest upon so well if we say that he was made purely for the good pleasure of god this is in effect to say that he was made for no determinate end or for none at least that we can discern if we say that he was designed as an instance of the wisdom and power and goodness of god this indeed may be the reason of his being in general for it is the common reason of the being of every thing besides but it gives no account why he was made such a being as he is a reflecting thoughtful inquisitive being the particular reason of this seems most aptly to be drawn from the praise and honor that was not only to redound to god from him but to be given to god by him  the thought which runs through all this passage of mans being the priest of nature and of his existence being calculated chiefly for this end that he might offer up the praises of the mute part of the creation is an ingenious thought and well illustrated it was a favorite idea among some of the ancient philosophers and it is not the worse on that account as it thereby appears to have been a natural sentiment of the human mind in composing a sermon however it might have been better to have introduced it as a sort of collateral argument or an incidental illustration than to have displayed it with so much pomp and to have placed it in the front of the arguments for this duty it does not seem to me when placed in this station to bear all the stress which the author lays upon it when the divine goodness brought man into existence we cannot well conceive that its chief purpose was to form a being who might sing praises to his maker prompted by infinite benevolence the supreme creator formed the human race that they might rise to happiness and to the enjoyment of himself through a course of virtue or proper action the sentiment on which our author dwells however beautiful appears too loose and rhetorical to be a principal head of discourse  this duty therefore is the debt and law of our nature and it will more distinctly appear to be such if we consider the two ruling faculties of our mind the understanding and the will apart in both which it is deeply founded in the understanding as in the principle of reason which owns and acknowledges it in the will as in the fountain of gratitude and return which prompts and even constrains us to pay it   reason was given us as a rule and measure by the help of which we were to proportion our esteem of every thing according to the degrees of perfection and goodness which we found therein it cannot therefore if it does its office at all but apprehend god as the best and most perfect being it must needs see and own and admire his infinite perfections and this is what is strictly meant by praise which therefore is expressed in scripture by confessing to god and acknowledging him by ascribing to him what is his due and as far as this sense of the words reaches it is impossible to think of god without praising him for it depends not on the understanding how it shall apprehend things any more than it does on the eye how visible objects shall appear to it  the duty takes the further and surer hold of us by the means of the will and that strong bent toward gratitude which the author of our nature has implanted in it there is not a more active principle than this in the mind of man and surely that which deserves its utmost force and should set all its springs awork is god the great and universal benefactor from whom alone we received whatever we either have or are and to whom we can possibly repay nothing but our praises or to speak more properly on this head and according to the strict import of the word our thanksgiving who has first given to god says the great apostle in his usual figure and it shall be recompensed unto him again a gift it seems always requires a recompense nay but of him and through him and to him are all things of him as the author through him as the preserver and governor to him as the end and perfection of all things to whom therefore as it follows be glory for ever amen  i cannot much approve of the light in which our author places his argument in these paragraphs there is something too metaphysical and refined in his deducing in this manner the obligation to thanksgiving from the two faculties of the mind understanding and will though what he says be in itself just yet the argument is not sufficiently plain and striking arguments in sermons especially on subjects that so naturally and easily suggest them should be palpable and popular should not be brought from topics that appear far sought but should directly address the heart and feelings the preacher ought never to depart too far from the common ways of thinking and expressing himself i am inclined to think that this whole head might have been improved if the author had taken up more obvious ground had stated gratitude as one of the most natural principles in the human heart had illustrated this by showing how odious the opposite disposition is and with what general consent men in all ages have agreed in hating and condemning the ungrateful and then applying these reasonings to the present case had placed in a strong view that entire corruption of moral sentiment which it discovers to be destitute of thankful emotions toward the supreme benefactor of mankind as the most natural method of giving vent to grateful sentiments is by external expressions of thanksgiving he might then have answered the objection that is apt to occur of the expression of our praise being insignificant to the almighty but by seeking to be too refined in his argument he has omitted some of the most striking and obvious considerations and which properly displayed would have afforded as great a field for eloquence as the topics which he has chosen he goes on  gratitude consists in an equal return of benefits if we are able of thanks if we are not which thanks therefore must rise always in proportion as the favors received are great and the receiver incapable of making any other sort of requital now since no man has benefited god at any time and yet every man in each moment of his life is continually benefited by him what strong obligations must we needs be under to thank him it is true our thanks are really as insignificant to him as any other kind of return would be in themselves indeed they are worthless but his goodness has put a value upon them he has declared he will accept them in lieu of the vast debt we owe and after that which is fittest for us to dispute how they came to be taken as an equivalent or to pay them  it is therefore the voice of nature as far as gratitude itself is so that the good things we receive from above should be sent back again thither in thanks and praises as the rivers run into the sea to the place the ocean of beneficence from whence the rivers come thither should they return again  in these paragraphs he has indeed touched some of the considerations which i mentioned but he has only touched them whereas with advantage they might have formed the main body of his argument  we have considered the duty absolutely we are now to compare it with others and to see what rank it bears among them and here we shall find that among all the acts of religion immediately addressed to god this is much the noblest and most excellent as it must needs be if what has been laid down be allowed that the end of mans creation was to praise and glorify god for that cannot but be the most noble and excellent act of any being which best answers the end and design of it other parts of devotion such as confession and prayer seem not originally to have been designed for man nor man for them they imply guilt and want with which the state of innocence was not acquainted had man continued in that estate his worship like the devotions of angels had been paid to heaven in pure acts of thanksgiving and nothing had been left for him to do beyond the enjoying the good things of life as nature directed and praising the god of nature who bestowed them but being fallen from innocence and abundance having contracted guilt and forfeited his right to all sorts of mercies prayer and consession became necessary for a time to retrieve the loss and to restore him to that state wherein he should be able to live without them these are fitted therefore for a lower dispensation before which in paradise there was nothing but praise and after which there shall be nothing but that in heaven our perfect state did at first and will at last consist in the performance of this duty and herein therefore lies the excellence and the honor of our nature  it is the same way of reasoning by which the apostle has given the preference to charity beyond faith and hope and every spiritual gift charity never fails says he meaning that it is not a virtue useful only in this life but will accompany us also into the next but whether there be prophesies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away these are gifts of a temporary advantage and shall all perish in the using for we know in part and we prophesy in part our present state is imperfect and therefore what belongs to that and only that must be imperfect too but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away the argument of st paul we see which sets charity above the rest of christian graces will give praise also the preeminence over all the parts of christian worship and we may conclude our reasoning therefore as he does his and now abides confession prayer and praise these three but the greatest of these is praise  the author here enters on the second part of his argument the high rank which thanksgiving holds when compared with other duties of religion this he handles with much eloquence and beauty his idea that this was the original worship of man before his fall rendered other duties requisite and shall continue to be his worship in heaven when the duties which are occasioned by a consciousness of guilt shall have no place is solid and just his illustration of it is very happy and the style extremely flowing and sweet seldom do we meet with any piece of composition in sermons that has more merit than this head  it is so certainly on other accounts as well as this particularly as it is the most disinterested branch of our religous service such as has the most of god and the least of ourselves in it of any we pay and therefore approaches the nearest of any to a pure and free and perfect act of homage for though a good action does not grow immediately worthless by being done with the prospect of advantage as some have strangely imagined yet it will be allowed i suppose that its being done without the mixture of that end or with as little of it as possible recommends it so much the more and raises the price of it does job fear god for naught was an objection of satan which implied that those duties were most valuable where our own interest was least aimed at and god seems by the commission he then gave satan to try experiments upon job thus far to have allowed his plea now our requests for future and even our acknowledgments of past mercies center purely in ourselves our own interest is the direct aim of them but praise is a generous and unmercenary principle which proposes no other end to itself but to do as is fit for a creature endowed with such faculties to do toward the most perfect and beneficent of beings and to pay the willing tribute of honor there where the voice of reason directs us to pay it god has indeed annexed a blessing to the duty and when we know this we cannot choose while we are performing the duty but have some regard to the blessing which belongs to it however that is not the direct aim of our devotions nor was it the first motive that stirred us up to them had it been so we should naturally have betaken ourselves to prayer and breathed out our desires in that form wherein they are most properly conveyed  in short praise is our most excellent work a work common to the church triumphant and militant and which militant and which lifts us up into communion and fellowship with angels the matter about which it is conversant is always the perfections of gods nature and the act itself is the perfection of ours  our authors second illustration is taken from praise being the most disinterested act of homage this he explains justly and elegantly though perhaps the consideration is rather too thin and refined for enforcing religious duties as creatures such as we in approaching to the divine presence can never be supposed to lay aside all consideration of our own wants and necessities and certainly are not required as the author admits to divest ourselves of such regards the concluding sentence of this head is elegant and happily expressed  i come now in the last place to set out some of its peculiar properties and advantages which recommend it to the devout performer and    it is the most pleasing part of our devotions it proceeds always from a lively cheerful temper of mind and it cherishes and improves what it proceeds from for it is good to sing praises unto our god says one whose experience in this case we may rely upon for it is pleasant and praise is comely petition and confession are the language of the indigent and the guilty the breathings of a sad and contrite spirit is any afflicted let him pray but is any merry let him sing psalms the most usual and natural way of mens expressing the mirth of their hearts is in a song and songs are the very language of praise to the expressing of which they are in a peculiar manner appropriated and are scarce of any other use in religion indeed the whole composition of this duty is such as throughout speaks ease and delight to the mind it proceeds from love and from thankfulness from love the fountain of pleasure the passion which gives every thing we do or enjoy its relish and agreeableness from thankfulness which involves in it the memory of past benefits the actual presence of them to the mind and the repeated enjoyment of them and as is its principle such is its end also for it procures quiet and ease to the mind by doing somewhat toward satisfying that debt which it labors under by delivering it of those thoughts of praise and gratitude those exultations it is so full of and which would grow uneasy and troublesome to it if they were kept in if the thankful refrained it would be pain and grief to them but then then is their soul satisfied as with marrow and fatness when their mouth praises god with joyful lips  in beginning this head of discourse the expression which the author uses to set out some of its peculiar properties and advantages would now be reckoned not so proper an expression as to point out or to show the first subdivision concerning praise being the most pleasant part of devotion is very just and well expressed as far as it goes but seems to me rather defective much more might have been said upon the pleasure that accompanies such exalted acts of devotion it was a cold thought to dwell upon its disburdening the mind of a debt the author should have insisted more upon the influence of praise and thanksgiving in warming gladdening soothing the mind lifting it above the world to dwell among divine and eternal objects he should have described the peace and joy which then expand the heart the relief which this exercise procures from the cares and agitations of life the encouraging views of providence to which it leads our attention and the trust which it promotes in the divine mercy for the future by the commemoration of benefits past in short this was the place for his pouring out a greater flow of devotional sentiments than what we here find    it is another distinguishing property of divine praise that it enlarges the powers and capacities of our souls turning them from low and little things upon their greatest and noblest object the divine nature and employing them in the discovery and admiration of those several perfections that adorn it we see what difference there is between man and man such as there is hardly greater between man and beast and this proceeds chiefly from the different sphere of thought which they act in and the different objects they converse with the mind is essentially the same in the peasant and the prince the force of it naturally equal in the untaught man and the philosopher only the one of these is busied in mean affairs and within narrower bounds the other exercises himself in things of weight and moment and this it is that puts the wide distance between them noble objects are to the mind what the sunbeams are to a bud or flower they open and unfold as it were the leaves of it put it upon exerting and spreading itself every way and call forth all those powers that lie hid and locked up in it the praise and admiration of god therefore brings this advantage along with it that it sets our faculties upon their full stretch and improves them to all the degrees of perfection of which they are capable  this head is just well expressed and to censure it might appear hypercritical some of the expressions however one would think might be amended the simile for instance about the effects of the sunbeams upon the bud or flower is pretty but not correctly expressed they open and unfold as it were the leaves of it if this is to be literally applied to the flower the phrase as it were is needless if it is to be metaphorically understood which appears to be the case the leaves of the mind is harsh language besides that put it upon exerting itself is rather a low expression nothing is more nice than to manage properly such similies and allusions so as to preserve them perfectly correct and at the same time to render the image lively it might perhaps be amended in some such way as this as the sunbeams open the bud and unfold the leaves of a flower noble objects have a like effect upon the mind they expand and spread it and call forth those powers that before lay hid and locked up in the soul    it farther promotes in us an exquisite sense of gods honor and an high indignation of mind at every thing that openly profanes it for what we value and delight in we cannot with patience hear slighted or abused our own praises which we are constantly putting up will be a spur to us toward procuring and promoting the divine glory in every other instance and will make us set our faces against all open and avowed impieties which methinks should be considered a little by such as would be thought not to be wanting in this duty and yet are often silent under the foulest dishonours done to religion and its great author for tamely to hear gods name and worship vilified by others is no very good argument that we have been used to honor and reverence him in good earnest ourselves  the thought here is well founded though it is carelessly and loosely brought out the sentence our own praises which we are constantly putting up will be a spur to us toward procuring and promoting the divine glory in every other instance is both negligent in language and ambiguous in meaning for our own praises properly signifies the praises of ourselves much better if he had said those devout praises which we constantly offer up to the almighty will naturally prompt us to promote the divine glory in every other instance    it will beyond all this work in us a deep humility and consciousness of our own imperfections upon a frequent attention to god and his attributes we shall easily discover our own weakness and emptiness our swelling thoughts of ourselves will abate and we shall see and feel that we are altogether lighter to be laid in the balance than vanity and this is a lesson which to the greatest part of mankind is i think very well worth learning we are naturally presumptuous and vain full of ourselves and regardless of every thing besides especially when some little outward privileges distinguish us from the rest of mankind then it is odds but we look into ourselves with great degrees of complacency and are wiser and better every way in our own conceit than seven men that can render a reason now nothing will contribute so much to the cure of this vanity as a due attention to gods excellencies and perfections by comparing these with those which we imagine belong to us we shall learn not to think more highly of ourselves than we ought to think of ourselves but to think soberly we shall find more satisfaction in looking upwards and humbling ourselves before our common creator than in casting our eyes downward with scorn upon our fellow creatures and setting at naught any part of the work of his hands the vast distance we are at from real and infinite worth will astonish us so much that we shall not be tempted to value ourselves upon these lesser degrees of preeminence which custom or opinion or some little accidental advantages have given us over other men  though the thought here also be just yet alike deficiency in elegance and beauty appears the phrase it is odds but we look into ourselves with great degrees of complacency is much too low and colloquial for a sermon  he might have said we are likely or we are prone to look into ourselves  comparing these with those which we imagine to belong to us is also very careless style  by comparing these with the virtues and abilities which we ascribe to ourselves we shall learn  would have been purer and more correct    i shall mention but one use of it more and it is this that a conscientious praise of god will keep us back from all false and mean praise all fulsome and servile flatteries such as are in use among men praising as it is commonly managed is nothing else but a trial of skill upon a man how many good things we can possibly say of him all the treasures of oratory are ransacked and all the fine things that ever were said are heaped together for his sake and no matter whether it belongs to him or not so there be enough on it which is one deplorable instance among a thousand of the baseness of human nature of its small regard to truth and justice to right or wrong to what is or is not to be praised but he who has a deep sense of the excellencies of god upon his heart will make a god of nothing besides he will give every one his just encomium honor where honor is due and as much as is due because it is his duty to do so but the honor of god will suffer him to go no further which rule if it had been observed a neighboring prince who now god be thanked needs flattery a great deal more than ever he did would have wanted a great deal of that incense which has been offered up to him by his adorers  this head appears scarcely to deserve any place among the more important topics that naturally presented themselves on this subject at least it had much better have wanted the application which the author makes of his reasoning to the flatterers of louis xiv and the thanks which he offers to god for the affairs of that prince being in so low a state that he now needed flattery more than ever this political satire is altogether out of place and unworthy of the subject  one would be inclined to think upon reviewing our authors arguments that he has overlooked some topics respecting the happy consequences of this duty of fully as much importance as any that he has inserted particularly he ought not to have omitted the happy tendency of praise and thanksgiving to strengthen good dispositions in the heart to promote love to god and imitation of those perfections which we adore and to infuse a spirit of ardour and zeal into the whole of religion as the service of our benefactor these are consequences which naturally follow from the proper performance of this duty and which ought not to have been omitted as no opportunity should be lost of showing the good effect of devotion on practical religion and moral virtue and pointing out the necessary connection of the one with the other for certainly the great end of preaching is to make men better in all the relations of life and to promote that complete reformation of heart and conduct in which true christianity consists our author however upon the whole is not deficient in such views of religion for in his general strain of preaching as he is extremely pious so he is at the same time practical and moral  his summing up the whole argument in the next paragraph is elegant and beautiful and such concluding views of the subject are frequently very proper and useful upon these grounds does the duty of praise stand and these are the obligations that bind us to the performance of it it is the end of our being and the very rule and law of our nature flowing from the two great fountains of human action the understanding and the will naturally and almost necessarily it is the most excellent part of our religious worship enduring to eternity after the rest shall be done away and paid even now in the frankest manner with the least regard to our own interest it recommends itself to us by several peculiar properties and advantages as it carries more pleasure in it than all other kinds of devotion as it enlarges and exalts the several powers of the mind as it breeds in us an exquisite sense of gods honor and a willingness to promote it in the world as it teaches us to be humble and lowly ourselves and yet preserves us from base and sordid flattery from bestowing mean and undue praises upon others  after this our author addresses himself to two classes of men the careless and the profane his address to the careless is beautiful and pathetic that to the profane is not so well executed and is liable to some objection such addresses appear to me to be on several occasions very useful parts of a discourse they prevailed much in the strain of preaching before the restoration and perhaps since that period have been too much neglected they afford an opportunity of bringing home to the consciences of the audience many things which in the course of the sermon were perhaps delivered in the abstract  i shall not dwell on the conclusion of the sermon which is chiefly employed in observations on the posture of public affairs at that time considered upon the whole this discourse of bishop atterburys is both useful and beautiful though i have ventured to point out some defects in it seldom or never can we expect to meet with a composition of any kind which is absolutely perfect in all its parts and when we take into account the difficulties which i before showed to attend the eloquence of the pulpit we have perhaps less reason to look for perfection in a sermon than in any other composition  lecture xxxi conduct of a discourse in all its parts  introduction  division  narration and explication i have in the four preceding lectures considered what is peculiar to each of the three great fields of public speaking popular assemblies the bar and the pulpit i am now to treat of what is common to them all of the conduct of a discourse or oration in general the previous view which i have given of the distinguishing spirit and character of different kinds of public speaking was necessary for the proper application of the rules which i am about to deliver and as i proceed i shall farther point out how far any of these rules may have a particular respect to the bar to the pulpit or to popular courts  on whatever subject any one intends to discourse he will most commonly begin with some introduction in order to prepare the minds of his hearers he will then state his subject and explain the facts connected with it he will employ arguments for establishing his own opinion and overthrowing that of his antagonist he may perhaps if there be room for it endeavor to touch the passions of his audience and after having said all he thinks proper he will bring his discourse to a close by some peroration or conclusion this being the natural train of speaking the parts that compose a regular formal oration are these six first the exordium or introduction secondly the state and the division of the subject thirdly narration or explication fourthly the reasoning or arguments fifthly the pathetic part and lastly the conclusion i do not mean that each of these must enter into every public discourse or that they must enter always in this order there is no reason for being so formal on every occasion nay it would often be a fault and would render a discourse pedantic and stiff there may be many excellent discourses in public where several of these parts are altogether wanting where the speaker for instance uses no introduction but enters directly on his subject where he has no occasion either to divide or explain but simply reasons on one side of the question and then finishes but as the parts which i mentioned are the natural constituent parts of a regular oration and as in every discourse whatever some of them must be found it is necessary to our present purpose that i should treat of each of them distinctly  i begin of course with the exordium or introduction this is manifestly common to all the three kinds of public speaking it is not a rhetorical invention it is founded upon nature and suggested by common sense when one is going to counsel another when he takes upon him to instruct or to reprove prudence will generally direct him not to do it abruptly but to use some preparation to begin with somewhat that may incline the persons to whom he addresses himself to judge favorably of what he is about to say and may dispose them to such a train of thought as will forward and assist the purpose which he has in view this is or ought to be the main scope of an introduction accordingly cicero and quinctilian mention three ends to one or other of which it should be subservient reddere auditores benevolos attentos dociles  first to conciliate the good will of the hearers to render them benevolent or wellaffected to the speaker and to the subject topics for this purpose may in causes at the bar be sometimes taken from the particular situation of the speaker himself or of his client or from the character or behavior of his antagonists contrasted with his own on other occasions from the nature of the subject as closely connected with the interest of the hearers and in general from the modesty and good intention with which the speaker enters upon his subject the second end of an introduction is to raise the attention of the hearers which may be effected by giving them some hints of the importance dignity or novelty of the subject or some favorable view of the clearness and precision with which we are to treat it and of the brevity with which we are to discourse the third end is to render the hearers docile or open to persuasion for which end we must begin with studying to remove any particular prepossessions they may have contracted against the cause or side of the argument which we espouse  some one of these ends should be proposed by every introduction when there is no occasion for aiming at any of them when we are already secure of the good will the attention and the docility of the audience as may often be the case formal introductions can without any prejudice be omitted and indeed when they serve for no purpose but mere ostentation they had for the most part better be omitted unless as far as respect to the audience makes it decent that a speaker should not break in upon them too abruptly but by a short exordium prepare them for what he is going to say demostheness introductions are always short and simple ciceros are fuller and more artful  the ancient critics distinguish two kinds of introductions which they call principium and insinuatio principium is where the orator plainly and directly professes his aim in speaking insinuatio is where a larger compass must be taken and where presuming the disposition of the audience be to much against the orator he must gradually reconcile them to hearing him before he plainly discovers the point which he has in view  of this latter sort of introduction we have an admirable instance in ciceros second oration against rullus this rullus was tribune of the people and had proposed an agrarian law the purpose of which was to create a decemvirate or ten commissioners with absolute power for five years over all the lands conquered by the republic in order to divide them among the citizens such laws had often been proposed by factious magistrates and were always greedily received by the people cicero is speaking to the people he had newly been made consul by their interest and his first attempt is to make them reject this law the subject was extremely delicate and required much art he begins with acknowledging all the favors which he had received from the people in preference to the nobility he professes himself the creature of their power and of all men the most engaged to promote their interest he declares that he held himself to be the consul of the people and that he would always glory in preserving the character of a popular magistrate but to be popular he observes is an ambiguous word he understood it to import a steady attachment to the real interest of the people to their liberty their ease and their peace but by some he saw it was abused and made a cover to their own selfish and ambitious designs in this manner he begins to draw gradually nearer to his purpose of attacking the proposal of rullus but still with great management and reserve he protests that he is far from being an enemy to agrarian laws he gives the highest praises to the gracchi those zealous patrons of the people and assures them that when he first heard of rulluss law he had resolved to support it if he found it for their interest but that upon examining it he found it calculated to establish a dominion that was inconsistent with liberty and to aggrandize a few men at the expense of the public and then terminates his exordium with telling them that he is going to give his reasons for beging of this opinion but that if his reasons shall not satisfy them he will give up his own opinion and embrace theirs in all this there was great art his eloquence produced the intended effect and the people with one voice rejected this agrarian law  having given these general views of the nature and end of an introduction i proceed to lay down some rules for the proper composition of it these are the more necessary that this is a part of the discourse which requires no small care itis always of importance to begin well to make a favorable impression at first setting out when the minds of the hearers vacant as yet and free are most disposed to receive any impression easily i must add too that a good introduction is often found to be extremely difficult few parts of the discourse give the composer more trouble or are attended with more nicety in the execution  the first rule is that the introduction should be easy and natural the subject must always suggest it it must appear as cicero beautifully expresses it effloruisse penitus ex re de qua tum agitur to have sprung up of its own accord from the matter which is under consideration  it is too common a fault in introductions that they are taken from some commonplace topic which has no peculiar relation to the subject in hand by which means they stand apart like pieces detached from the rest of the discourse of this kind are sallusts introductions prefixed to his catilinarian and jugurthine wars they might as well have been introductions to any history or to any other treatise whatever and therefore though elegant in themselves they must be considered as blemishes in the work from want of due connection with it cicero though abundantly correct in this particular in his orations yet is not so in his other works it appears from a letter of his to atticus l xvi   that it was his custom to prepare at his leisure a collection of different introductions or prefaces ready to be prefixed to any work that he might afterward publish in consequence of this strange method of composing it happened to him to employ the same introduction twice without remembering it prefixing it to two different works upon atticus informing him of this he acknowledges the mistake and sends him a new introduction  in order to render introductions natural and easy it is in my opinion a good rule that they should not be planned till after one has meditated in his own mind the substance of his discourse then and not till then he should begin to think of some proper and natural introduction by taking a contrary course and laboring in the first place on an introduction every one who is accustomed to composition will often find that either he is led to lay hold of some commonplace topic or that instead of the introduction being accommodated to the discourse he is obliged to accommodate the whole discourse to the introduction which he had previously written cicero makes this remark though as we have seen his practice was not always conformable to his own rule omnibus rebus consideratis tum denique id quod primum est dicendum postremum soleo cogitare quo utar exordio nam si quando id primum invenire volui nullum mihi occurrit nisi aut exile aut nugatorium aut vulgar when i have planned and digested all the materials of my discourse it is my custom to think in the last place of the introduction with which i am to begin for if at any time i have endeavored to invent an introduction first was trifling nugatory and vulgar  after the mind has been once warmed and put in train by close meditation on the subject materials for the preface will then suggest themselves much more readily  in the second place in an introduction correctness should be carefully studied in the expression this is requisite on account of the situation of the hearers they are then more disposed to criticize than at any other period they are as yet unoccupied with the subject or the arguments their attention is wholly directed to the speakers style and manner something must be done therefore to prepossess them in his favor though for the same reasons too much art must be avoided for it will be more easily detected at that time than afterward and will derogate from persuasion in all that follows a correct plainness an elegant simplicity is the proper character of an introduction ut videamur says quinctilian accurate non callide dicere  in the third place modesty is another character which it must carry all appearances of modesty are favorable and prepossessing if the orator set out with an air of arrogance and ostentation the selflove and pride of the hearers will be presently awakened and will follow him with a very suspicious eye throughout all his progress his modesty should discover itself not only in his expressions at the beginning but in his whole manner in his looks in his gestures in the tone of his voice every auditory take in good part those marks of respect and awe which are paid to them by one who addresses them indeed the modesty of an introduction should never betray any thing mean or abject it is always of great use to an orator that together with modesty and deference to his hearers he should show a certain sense of dignity arising from a persuasion of the justice or importance of the subject on which he is to speak  the modesty of an introduction requires that it promise not too much non fumum ex fulgore sed ex fumo dare lucem he does not lavish at a blaze his fire sudden to glare and then in smoke expire but rises from a cloud of smoke to light and pours his specious miracles to sight hor ars poet francis  this certainly is the general rule that an orator should not put forth all his strength at the beginning but should rise and grow upon us as his discourse advances there are cases however in which it is allowable for him to set out from the first in a high and bold tone as for instance when he rises to defend some cause which has been much run down and decried by the public too modest a beginning might be then like a confession of guilt by the boldness and strength of his exordium he must endeavor to stem the tide that is against him and to remove prejudices by encountering them without fear in subjects too of a declamatory nature and in sermons where the subject is striking a magnificent introduction has sometimes a good effect if it be properly supported in the sequel thus bishop atterbury in beginning an eloquent sermon preached on the  0th of january the anniversary of what is called king charless martyrdom sets out in this pompous manner this is a day of trouble of rebuke and of blasphemy distinguished in the calendar of our church and the annals of our nation by the sufferings of an excellent prince who fell a sacrifice to the rage of his rebellious subjects and by his fall derived infamy misery and guilt on them and their sinful posterity bossuet flechier and the other celebrated french preachers very often begin their discourseswith labored and sublime introductions these raise attention and throw a luster on the subject but let every speaker be much on his guard against striking a higher note at the beginning than he is able to keep up in his progress  in the fourth place an introduction should usually be carried on in the calm manner this is seldom the place for vehemence and passion emotions must rise as the discourse advances the minds of the hearers must be gradually prepared before the speaker can venture on strong and passionate sentiments the exceptions to this rule are when the subject is such that the very mention of it naturally awakens some passionate emotion or when the unexpected presence of some person or object in a popular assembly inflames the speaker and makes him break forth with unusual warmth either of these will justify what is called the exordium ab abrupto thus the appearance of catiline in the senate renders the vehement beginning of ciceros first oration against him very natural and proper quousque tandem catilina abutere patientia nostra and thus bishop atterbury in preaching from this text blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me ventures on breaking forth with this bold exordium and can any man then be offended in thee blessed jesus which address to our savior he continues for a page or two till he enters on the division of his subject but such introductions as these should be hazarded by very few as they promise so much vehemence and unction through the rest of the discourse that it is very difficult to fulfill the expectations of the hearers  at the same time though the introduction is not the place in which warm emotions are usually to be attempted yet i must take notice that it ought to prepare the way for such as are designed to be raised in subsequent parts of the discourse the orator should in the beginning turn the minds of his hearers toward those sentiments and feelings which he seeks to awaken in the course of his speech according for instance as it is compassion or indignation or contempt on which his discourse is to rest he ought to sow the seeds of these in his introduction he ought to begin with breathing that spirit which he means to inspire much of the orators art and ability is shown in thus striking properly at the commencement the key note if we may so express it of the rest of his oration  in the fifth place it is a rule in introductions not to anticipate any material part of the subject when topics or arguments which are afterward to be enlarged upon are hinted at and in part brought forth in the introduction they lose the grace of novelty upon their second appearance the impression intended to be made by any capital thought is always made with the greatest advantage when it is made entire and in its proper place  in the last place the introduction ought to be proportioned both in length and in kind to the discourse that is to follow in length as nothing can be more absurd than to erect a very great portico before a small building and in kind as it is no less absurd to overcharge with superb ornaments the portico of a plain dwelling house or to make the entrance to a monument as gay as that to an arbor common sense directs that every part of a discourse should be suited to the strain and spirit of the whole  these are the principal rules that relate to introductions they are adapted in a great measure equally to discourses of all kinds in pleadings at the bar or speeches in public assemblies particular care must be taken not to employ any introduction of that kind which the adverse party may lay hold of and turn to his advantage to this inconvenience all those introductions are exposed which are taken from general and commonplace topics and it never fails to give an adversary a considerable triumph if by giving a small turn to something we had said in our exordium he can appear to convert to his own favor the principles with which we had set out in beginning our attack upon him in the case of replies quinctilian makes an observation which is very worthy of notice that introductions drawn from something that has been said in the course of the debate have always a peculiar grace and the reason he gives for it is just and sensible multum gratiae exordio est quod ab action diversae partis materiam trahit hoc ipso quod non compositum domi sed ibi atque e re natum et facilitate famam ingenii auget et facie simplicis sumptique e proximo sermonis fidem quoque acquirit adeo ut etiamsi reliqua scripta atque elaborara sint tamen videatur tota extemporalis oration cujus initium nihil preparatum habuisse manifestum est an introduction which is founded upon the pleading of the opposite party is extremely graceful for this reason that it appears not to have been meditated at home but to have taken rise from the business and to have been composed on the spot hence it gives to the speaker the reputation of a quick invention and adds weight likewise to his discourse as artless and unlaboured insomuch that though all the rest of his oration should be studied and written yet the whole discourse has the appearance of being extemporary as it is evident that the introduction to it was unpremeditated   in sermons such a practice as this cannot take place and indeed in composing sermons few things are more difficult than to remove an appearance of stiffness from an introduction when a formal one is used the french preachers as i before observed are often very splendid and lively in their introductions but among us attempts of this kind are not always so successful when long introductions are formed upon some commonplace topic as the desire of happiness being natural to man or the like they never fail of being tedious variety should be studied in this part of composition as much as possible often it may be proper to begin without any introduction at all unless perhaps one or two sentences explanatory introductions from the context are the most simple of any and frequently the best that can be used but as they are in hazard of becoming dry they should never be long a historical introduction has generally a happy effect to rouse attention when one can lay hold upon some noted fact that is connected with the text or the discourse and by a proper deduction of it open the way to the subject that is to be treated of  after the introduction what commonly comes next in order is the proposition or enunciation of the subject concerning which there is nothing to be said but that it should be as clear and distinct as possible and expressed in few and plain words without the least affectation to this generally succeeds the division or the laying down the method of the discourse on which it is necessary to make some observations i do not mean that in every discourse a formal division or distribution of it into parts is requisite there are many occasions of public speaking when this is neither requisite nor would be proper when the discourse perhaps is to be short or only one point is to be treated of or when the speaker does not choose to warn his hearers of the method he is to follow or of the conclusion to which he seeks to bring them order of one kind or other is indeed essential to every good discourse that is every thing should be so arranged as that what goes before may give light and force to what follows after but this may be accomplished by means of a concealed method what we call division is when the method is propounded in form to the hearers  the discourse in which this sort of division most commonly takes place is a sermon and a question has been moved whether this method of laying down heads as it is called be the best method of preaching a very able judge the archbishop of cambray in his dialogues on eloquence declares strongly against it he observes that it is a modern invention that it was never practiced by the fathers of the church and what is certainly true that it took its rise from the schoolmen when metaphysics began to be introduced into preaching he is of opinion that it renders a sermon stiff that it breaks the unity of the discourse and that by the natural connection of one part with another the attention of the hearers would be carried along the whole with more advantage  but notwithstanding his authority and his arguments i cannot help being of opinion that the present method of dividing a sermon into heads ought not to be laid aside established practice has now given it so much weight that were there nothing more in its favor it would be dangerous for any preacher to deviate so far from the common tract but the practice itself has also in my judgment much reason on its side if formal partitions give a sermon less of the oratorial appearance they render it however more clear more easily apprehended and of course more instructive to the bulk of hearers which is always the main object to be kept in view the heads of a sermon are great assistances to the memory and recollection of a hearer they serve also to fix his attention they enable him more easily to keep pace with the progress of the discourse they give him pauses and resting places where he can reflect on what has been said and look forward to what is to follow they are attended with this advantage too that they give the audience the opportunity of knowing before hand when they are to be released from the fatigue of attention and thereby make them follow the speaker more patiently reficit audientem says quinctilian taking notice of this very advantage of divisions in other discourses reficit audientem certo singularium partium fine non aliter quam facientibus iter multum detrahunt fatigationis notata spatia inscriptis lapidibus nam et exhausti laboris nosse mensuram voluptati est et hortatur ad reliqua fortius exequenda scire quantum supersit the conclusion of each head is a relief to the hearers just as upon a journey the milestones which are set up on the road serve to diminish the travellers fatigue for we are always pleased with seeing our labor begin to lessen and by calculating how much remains are stirred up to finish our task more cheerfully  with regard to breaking the unity of a discourse i cannot be of opinion that there arises from that quarter any argument against the method i am desending if the unity be broken it is to the nature of the heads or topics of which the speaker treats that this is to be imputed not to his laying them down in form on the contrary if his heads be wellchosen his marking them out and distinguishing them in place of impairing the unity of the whole renders it more conspicuous and complete by showing how all the parts of a discourse hang upon one another and tend to one point  in a sermon or in a pleading or any discourse where division is proper to be used the most material rules are  first that the several parts into which the subject is divided be really distinct from one another that is that no one include another it were a very absurd division for instance if one should propose to treat first of the advantages of virtue and next of those of justice or temperance because the first head evidently comprehends the second as a genus does the species which method of proceeding involves the subject in indistinctness and disorder  secondly in division we must take care to follow the order of nature beginning with the simplest points such as are easiest apprehended and necessary to be first discussed and proceeding thence to those which are built upon the former and which suppose them to be known we must divide the subject into those parts into which most easily and naturally it is resolved that the subject may seem to split itself and not to be violently torn asunder dividere as is commonly said non frangere  thirdly the several members of a division ought to exhaust the subject otherwise we do not make a complete division we exhibit the subject by pieces and corners only without giving any such plan as displays the whole  fourthly the terms in which our partitions are expressed should be as concise as possible avoid all circumlocution here admit not a single word but what is necessary precision is to be studied above all things in laying down a method it is this which chiefly makes a division appear neat and elegant when the several heads are propounded in the clearest most expressive and at the same time the fewest words possible this never fails to strike the hearers agreeably and is at the same time of great consequence toward making the divisions be more easily remembered  fifthly avoid an unnecessary multiplication of heads to split a subject into a great many minute parts by divisions and subdivisions without end has always a bad effect in speaking it may be proper in a logical treatise but it makes an oration appear hard and dry and unnecessarily fatigues the memory in a sermon there may be from three to five or six heads including subdivisions seldom should there be more  in a sermon or in a pleading at the bar few things are of greater consequence than a proper and happy division it should be studied with much accuracy and care for if one take a wrong method at first setting out it will lead him astray in all that follows it will render the whole discourse either perplexed or languid and though the hearers may not be able to tell where the fault or disorder lies they will be sensible there is a disorder somewhere and find themselves little affected by what is spoken the french writers of sermons study neatness and elegance in laying down their heads much more than the english do whose distributions though sensible and just yet are often inartificial and verbose among the french however too much quaintness appears in their divisions with an affectation of always setting out either with two or with three general heads of discourse a division of massillons on this text it is finished has been much extolled by the french critics this imports says the preacher the consummation first of justice on the part of god secondly of wickedness on the part of men thirdly of love on the part of christ this also of bourdaloues has been much praised from these words my peace i give unto you peace says he first to the understanding by submission to faith secondly to the heart by submission to the law  the next constituent part of a discourse which i mentioned was narration or explication i put these two together both because they fall nearly under the same rules and because they commonly answer the same purpose serving to illustrate the cause or the subject of which one treats before proceeding to argue either on one side or other or to make any attempt for interesting the passions of the hearers  in pleadings at the bar narration is often a very important part of the discourse and requires to be particularly attended to besides its being in any case no easy matter to relate with grace and propriety there is in narrations at the bar a peculiar difficulty the pleader must say nothing but what is true and at the same time he must avoid saying any thing that will hurt his cause the facts which he relates are to be the groundwork of all his future reasoning to recount them so as to keep strictly within the bounds of truth and yet to present them under the colors most favorable to his cause to place in the most striking light every circumstance which is to his advantage and to soften and weaken such as make against him demands no small exertion of skill and dexterity he must always remember that if he discovers too much art he defeats his own purpose and creates a distrust of his sincerity quinctilian very properly directs effugienda in hac praecipue part omnis calliditatis suspicio neque enim se usquam magis custodit judex quam cum narrat orator nihil tum videatur fictum nihil sollicitum omnia potius a causa quam ab oratore profecta videantur in this part of discourse the speaker must be very careful to shun every appearance of art and cunning for there is no time at which the judge is more upon his guard than when the pleader is relating facts let nothing then seem feigned nothing anxiously concealed let all that is said appear to arise from the cause itself and not to be the work of the orator   to be clear and distinct to be probable and to be concise are the qualities which critics chiefly require in narration each of which carries sufficiently the evidence of its importance distinctness belongs to the whole train of the discourse but is especially requisite in narration which ought to throw light on all that follows a fact or a single circumstance left in obscurity and misapprehended by the judge may destroy the effect of all the argument and reasoning which the speaker employs if his narration be improbable the judge will not regard it and if it be tedious and diffuse he will tire of it and forget it in order to produce distinctness besides the study of the general rules of perspicuity which were formerly given narration requires particular attention to ascertain clearly the names the dates the places and every other material circumstance of the facts recounted in order to be probable in narration it is material to enter into the characters of the persons of whom we speak and to show that their actions proceeded from such motives as are natural and likely to gain belief in order to be as concise as the subject will admit it is necessary to throw out all superfluous circumstances the rejection of which will likewise tend to make our narration more forcible and more clear  cicero is very remarkable for his talent of narration and from the examples in his orations much may be learned the narration for instance in the celebrated oration pro milone has been often and justly admired his scope is to show that though in fact clodius was killed by milo or his servants yet that it was only in selfdefence and that the design had been laid not by milo against clodius but by clodius against milos life all the circumstances for rendering this probable are painted with wonderful art in relating the manner of milos setting out from rome he gives the most natural description of a family excursion to the country under which it was impossible that any bloody design could be concealed he remained says he in the senate house that day till all the business was over he came home changed his clothes deliberately and waited for some time till his wife had got all her things ready for going with him in his carriage to the country he did not set out till such time as clodius might easily have been in rome if he had not been lying in wait for milo by the way by and by clodius met him on the road on horseback like a man prepared for action no carriage not his wife as was usual nor any family equipage along with him whilst milo who is supposed to be meditating slaughter and assassination is traveling in a carriage with his wife wrapped up in his cloak embarrassed with baggage and attended by a great train of women servants and boys he goes on describing the rencounter that followed clodiuss servants attacking those of milo and killing the driver of his carriage milo jumping out throwing off his cloak and making the best defense he could while clodiuss servants endeavored to surround him and then concludes his narration with a very delicate and happy stroke he does not say in plain words that milos servants killed clodius but that in the midst of the tumult milos servants without the orders without the knowledge without the presence of their master did what every master would have wished his servants in a like conjuncture to have done milo cum in senatu fuisset eo die quoad senatus dimissus est domum venit calceos et vestimenta mutavit paulisper dum se uxor ut fit comparat commoratus est deinde profectus est id temporis cum jam clodius si quidem eo die romam venturus erat redire potuisset obviam fit ei clodius expeditus in equo nulla rheda nullis impedimentis nullis graecis comitibus ut solebat sine uxore quod nunquam fere cum hic insidiator qui iter illud ad caedem faciendam apparasset cum uxore veheretur

non derivandi criminis causa sed ut factum est neque imperante neque sciente neque praesente domino quod suos quisque servos in tali re facere voluisset   in sermons where there is seldom any occasion for narration explication of the subject to be discoursed on comes in the place of narration at the bar and is to be taken up much on the same tone that is it must be concise clear and distinct and in a style correct and elegant rather than highly adorned to explain the doctrine of the text with propriety to give a full and perspicuous account of the nature of that virtue or duty which forms the subject of the discourse is properly the didactic part of preaching on the right execution of which much depends for all that comes afterward in the way of persuasion the great art of succeeding in it is to meditate profoundly on the subject so as to be able to place it in a clear and strong point of view consider what light other passages of scripture throw upon it consider whether it be a subject nearly related to some other from which it is proper to distinguish it consider whether it can be illustrated to advantage by comparing it with or opposing it to some other thing by enquiring into causes or tracing effects by pointing out examples or appealing to the feelings of the hearers that thus a definite precise circumstantial view may be afforded of the doctrine to be inculcated let the preacher be persuaded that by such distinct and apt illustrations of the known truths of religion he may both display great merit in the way of composition and what he ought to consider as far more valuable render his discourses weighty instructive and useful  lecture xxxii conduct of a discourse  the argumentative part  the pathetic part  the peroration in treating of the constituent parts of a regular discourse or oration i have already considered the introduction the division and the narration or explication i proceed next to treat of the argumentative or reasoning part of a discourse in whatever place or on whatever subject one speaks this beyond doubt is of the greatest consequence for the great end for which men speak on any serious occasion is to convince their hearers of something being either true or right or good and by means of this conviction to influence their practice reason and argument make the foundation as i have often inculcated of all manly and persuasive eloquence  now with respect to arguments three things are requisite first the invention of them secondly the proper disposition and arrangement of them and thirdly the expressing of them in such a style and manner as to give them their full force  the first of these invention is without doubt the most material and the groundwork of the rest but with respect to this i am afraid it is beyond the power of art to give any real assistance art cannot go so far as to supply a speaker with arguments on every cause and every subject though it may be of considerable use in assisting him to arrange and express those which his knowledge of the subject has discovered for it is one thing to discover the reasons that are most proper to convince men and another to manage those reasons with most advantage the latter is all that rhetoric can pretend to  the ancient rhetoricians did indeed attempt to go much farther than this they attempted to form rhetoric into a more complete system and professed not only to assist public speakers in setting off their arguments to most advantage but to supply the defect of their invention and to teach them where to find arguments on every subject and cause hence their doctrine of topics or loci communes and seeds argumentorum which makes so great a figure in the writings of aristotle cicero and quinctilian these topics or loci were no other than general ideas applicable to a great many different subjects which the orator was directed to consult in order to find out materials for his speech they had their intrinsic and extrinsic loci some loci that were common to all the different kinds of public speaking and some that were peculiar to each the common or general loci were such as genus and species cause and effect antecedents and consequents likeness and contrariety definition circumstances of time and place and a great many more of the same kind for each of the different kinds of public speaking they had their loci personarum and loci rerum as in demonstrative orations for instance the heads from which any one could be decried or praised his birth his country his education his kindred the qualities of his body the qualities of his mind the fortune he enjoyed the stations he had filled etc and in deliberative orations the topics that might be used in recommending any public measure or dissuading from it such as honesty justice facility profit pleasure glory assistance from friends mortification to enemies and the like  the grecian sophists were the first inventors of this artificial system of oratory and they showed a prodigious subtilty and fertility in the contrivance of these loci succeeding rhetoricians dazzled by the plan wrought them up into so regular a system that one would think they meant to teach how a person might mechanically become an orator without any genius at all they gave him receipts for making speeches on all manner of subjects at the same time it is evident that though this study of common places might produce very showy academical declamations it could never produce useful discourses on real business the loci indeed supplied a most exuberant fecundity of matter one who had no other aim but to talk copiously and plausibly by consulting them on every subject and laying hold of all that they suggested might discourse without end and that too though he had none but the most superficial knowledge of his subject but such discourse could be no other than trivial what is truly solid and persuasive must be drawn ex visceribus causae from a thorough knowledge of the subject and profound meditation on it they who would direct students of oratory to any other sources of argumentation only delude them and by attempting to render rhetoric too perfect an art they render it in truth a trifling and childish study  on this doctrine therefore of the rhetorical loci or topics i think it superfluous to insist if any think that the knowledge of them may contribute to improve their invention and extend their views they may consult aristotle and quinctilian or what cicero has written on this head in his treatise de inventione his topica and second book de oratore but when they are to prepare a discourse by which they purpose to convince a judge or to produce any considerable effect upon an assembly i would advise them to lay aside their common places and to think closely of their subject demosthenes i dare say consulted none of the loci when he was inciting the athenians to take arms against philip and where cicero has had recourse to them his orations are so much the worse on that account  i proceed to what is of more real use to point out the assistance that can be given not with respect to the invention but with respect to the disposition and conduct of arguments  two different methods may be used by orators in the conduct of their reasoning the terms of art for which are the analytic and the synthetic method the analytic is when the orator conceals his intention concerning the point he is to prove till he has gradually brought his hearers to the designed conclusion they are led on step by step from one known truth to another till the conclusion be stolen upon them as the natural consequence of a chain of propositions as for instance when one intending to prove the being of a god sets out with observing that every thing which we see in the world has had a beginning that whatever has a beginning must have had a prior cause that in human productions art shown in the effect necessarily infers design in the cause and proceeds leading you on from one cause to another till you arrive at one supreme first cause from whom is derived all the order and design visible in his works this is much the same with the socratic method by which that philosopher silenced the sophists of his age it is a very artful method of reasoning may be carried on with much beauty and is proper to be used when the hearers are much prejudiced against any truth and by imperceptible steps must be led to conviction  but there are few subjects that will admit this method and not many occasions on which it is proper to be employed the mode of reasoning most generally used and most suited to the train of popular speaking is what is called the synthetic when the point to be proved is fairly laid down and one argument after another is made to bear upon it till the hearers be fully convinced  now in allar guing one of the first things to be attended to is among the various arguments which may occur upon a cause to make a proper selection of such as appear to ones self the most solid and to employ these as the chief means of persuasion every speaker should place himself in the situation of a hearer and think how he would be affected by those reasons which he purposes to employ for persuading others for he must not expect to impose on mankind by mere arts of speech they are not so easily imposed on as public speakers are sometimes apt to think shrewdness and sagacity are found among all ranks and the speaker may be praised for his fine discourse while yet the hearers are not persuaded of the truth of any one thing he has uttered  supposing the arguments properly chosen it is evident that their effect will in some measure depend on the right arrangement of them so as they shall not justle and embarrass one another but give mutual aid and bear with the fairest and fullest direction on the point in view concerning this the following rules may be taken  in the first place avoid blending arguments confusedly together that are of a separate nature all arguments whatever are directed to prove one or other of these three things that something is true that it is morally right or fit or that it is profitable and good these make the three great subjects of discussion among mankind truth duty and interest but the arguments directed toward either of them are generically distinct and he who blends them all under one topic which he calls his argument as in sermons especially is too often done will render his reasoning indistinct and inelegant suppose for instance that i am recommending to an audience benevolence or the love of our neighbor and that i take my first argument from the inward satisfaction which a benevolent temper affords my second from the obligation which the example of christ lays upon us to this duty and my third from its tendency to procure us the goodwill of all around us my arguments are good but i have arranged them wrong for my first and third arguments are taken from considerations of interest internal peace and external advantages and between these i have introduced one which rests wholly upon duty i should have kept those classes of arguments which are addressed to different principles in human nature separate and distinct  in the second place with regard to the different degrees of strength in arguments the general rule is to advance in the way of climax ut augeatur semper et increscat oration this especially is to be the course when the speaker has a clear cause and is confident that he can prove it fully he may then adventure to begin with feebler arguments rising gradually and not putting forth his whole strength till the last when he can trust to his making a successful impression on the minds of hearers prepared by what has gone before but this rule is not to be always followed for if he distrusts his cause and has but one material argument on which to lay the stress putting less confidence in the rest in this case it is often proper for him to place this material argument in the front to preoccupy the hearers early and make the strongest effort at first that having removed prejudices and disposed them to be favorable the rest of his reasoning may be listened to with more docility when it happens that amidst a variety of arguments there are one or two which we are sensible are more inconclusive than the rest and yet proper to be used cicero advises to place these in the middle as a station less conspicuous than either the beginning or the end of the train of reasoning  in the third place when our arguments are strong and satisfactory the more they are distinguished and treated apart from each other the better each can then bear to be brought out by itself placed in its full light amplified and rested upon but when our arguments are doubtful and only of the presumptive kind it is safer to throw them together in a crowd and to run them into one another ut quae sunt natura imbecilla as quinctilian speaks mutuo auxilio sustineantur that though infirm of themselves they may serve mutually to prop each other he gives a good example in the case of one who was accused of murdering a relation to whom he was heir direct proof was wanting but you expected a succession and a great succession you was in distressed circumstances you was pushed to the utmost by your creditors you had offended your relation who had made you his heir you knew that he was just then intending to alter his will no time was to be lost each of these particulars by itself says the author is inconclusive but when they were assembled in one groupe they have effect  of the distinct amplification of one persuasive argument we have a most beautiful example in ciceros oration for milo the argument is taken from a circumstance of time milo was candidate for the consulship and clodius was killed a few days before the election he asks if any one could believe that milo would be mad enough at such a critical time by a most odious assassination to alienate from himself the favor of the people whose suffrages he was so anxiously courting this argument the moment it is suggested appears to have considerable weight but it was not enough simply to suggest it it could bear to be dwelt upon and brought out into full light the orator therefore draws a just and striking picture of that solicitous attention with which candidates at such a season always found it necessary to cultivate the good opinion of the people quo tempore says he scio enim quam timida sit ambitio quantaque et quam sollicita cupiditas consulatus omnia non modo quae reprehendi palam sed etiam quae obscure cogitari possunt timemus rumorem fabulam fictam et falsam perhorrescimus ora omnium atque oculos intuemur nihil enim est tam tenerum tam aut fragile aut flexibile quam voluntas erga nos sensusque civium qui non modo improbitati irascuntur candidatorum sed etiam in recte factis saepe fastidiunt from all which he most justly concludes hunc diem igitur campi speratum atque exoptatum sibi proponens milo cruentis manibus scelus atque facinus prae se ferens ad illa centuriarum auspicia veniebat quam hoc in illo minimum credibile well do i know to what length the timidity goes of such as are candidates for public offices and how many anxious cares and attentions a canvass for the consulship necessarily carries along with it on such an occasion we are afraid not only of what we may openly be reproached with but of what others may think of us in secret the slightest rumor the most improbable tale that can be devised to our prejudice alarms and disconcerts us we study the countenance and the looks of all around us for nothing is so delicate so frail and uncertain as the public favor our fellow citizens not only are justly offended with the vices of candidates but even on occasion of meritorious actions are apt to conceive capricious disgusts is there then the least credibility that milo after having so long fixed his attention on the important and wished for day of election would dare to have any thoughts of presenting himself before the august assembly of the people as a murderer and assassin with his hands embrued in blood  but though such amplification as this be extremely beautiful i must add a caution  in the fourth place against extending arguments too far and multiplying them too much this serves rather to render a cause suspected than to give it weight an unnecessary multiplicity of arguments both burdens the memory and detracts from the weight of that conviction which a few well chosen arguments carry it is to be observed too that in the amplification of arguments a diffuse and spreading method beyond the bounds of reasonable illustration is always enfeebling it takes off greatly from that vis et acumen which should be the distinguishing character of the argumentative part of a discourse when a speaker dwells long on a favorite argument and seeks to turn it into every possible light it almost always happens that fatigued with the effort he loses the spirit with which he set out and concludes with feebleness what he began with force there is a proper temperance in reasoning as there is in other parts of a discourse  after due attention given to the proper arrangement of arguments what is next requisite for their success is to express them in such a style and to deliver them in such a manner as shall give them full force on these heads i must refer the reader to the directions i have given in treating of style in former lectures and to the directions i am afterward to give concerning pronunciation and delivery  i proceed therefore next to another essential part of discourse which i mentioned as the fifth in order that is the pathetic in which if any where eloquence reigns and exerts its power i shall not in beginning this head take up time in combating the scruples of those who have moved a question whether it be consistent with firmness and candor in a public speaker to address the passions of his audience this is a question about words alone and which common sense easily determines in enquiries after mere truth in matters of simple information and instruction there is no question that the passions have no concern and that all attempts to move them are absurd wherever conviction is the object it is the understanding alone that is to be applied to it is by argument and reasoning that one man attempts to satisfy another of what is true or right or just but if persuasion be the object the case is changed in all that relates to practice there is no man who seriously means to persuade another but addresses himself to his passions more or less for this plain reason that passions are the great springs of human action the most virtuous man in treating of the most virtuous subject seeks to touch the heart of him to whom he speaks and makes no scruple to raise his indignation at injustice or his pity to the distressed though pity and indignation be passions  in treating of this part of eloquence the ancients made the same sort of attempt as they employed with respect to the argumentative part in order to bring rhetoric into a more perfect system they enquired metaphysically into the nature of every passion they gave a definition and a description of it they treated of its causes its effects and its concomitants and thence deduced rules for working upon it aristotle in particular has in his treatise upon rhetoric discussed the nature of the passions with much profoundness and subtilty and what he has written on that head may be read with no small profit as a valuable piece of moral philosophy but whether it will have any effect in rendering an orator more pathetic is to me doubtful it is not i am afraid any philosophical knowledge of the passions that can confer this talent we must be indebted for it to nature to a certain strong and happy sensibility of mind and one may be a most thorough adept in all the speculative knowledge that can be acquired concerning the passions and remain at the same time a cold and dry speaker the use of rules and instructions on this or any other part of oratory is not to supply the want of genius but to direct it where it is found into its proper channel to assist it in exerting itself with most advantage and to prevent the errors and extravagancies into which it is sometimes apt to run on the head of the pathetic the following directions appear to me to be useful  the first is to consider carefully whether the subject admit the pathetic and render it proper and if it does what part of the discourse is the most proper for attempting it to determine these points belongs to good sense for it is evident that there are many subjects which admit not the pathetic at all and that even in those that are susceptible of it an attempt to excite the passions in the wrong place may expose an orator to ridicule all that can be said in general is that if we expect any emotion which we raise to have a lasting effect we must be careful to bring over to our side in the first place the understanding and judgment the hearers must be convinced that there are good and sufficient grounds for their entering with warmth into the cause they must be able to justify to themselves the passion which they feel and remain satisfied that they are not carried away by mere delusion unless their minds be brought into this state although they may have been heated by the orators discourse yet as soon as he ceases to speak they will resume their ordinary tone of thought and the emotion which he has raised will die entirely away hence most writers assign the pathetic to the peroration or conclusion as its natural place and no doubt all other things being equal this is the impression that one would choose to make last leaving the minds of the hearers warmed with the subject after argument and reasoning had produced their full effect but wherever it is introduced i must advise  in the second place never to set apart a head of discourse in form for raising any passion never give warning that you are about to be pathetic and call upon your hearers as is sometimes done to follow you in the attempt this almost never fails to prove a refrigerant to passion it puts the hearers immediately on their guard and disposes them for criticizing much more than for being moved the indirect method of making an impression is likely to be more successful when you seize the critical moment that is favorable to emotion in whatever part of the discourse it occurs and then after due preparation throw in such circumstances and present such glowing images as may kindle their passions before they are aware this can often be done more happily in a few sentences inspired by natural warmth than in a long and studied address  in the third place it is necessary to observe that there is a great difference between showing the hearers that they ought to be moved and actually moving them this distinction is not sufficiently attended to especially by preachers who if they have a head in their sermon to show how much we are bound to be grateful to god or to be compassionate to the distressed are apt to imagine this to be a pathetic part now all the arguments you produce to show me why it is my duty why it is reasonable and fit that i should be moved in a certain way go no further than to dispose or prepare me for entering into such an emotion but they do not actually excite it to every emotion or passion nature has adapted a set of corresponding objects and without setting these before the mind it is not in the power of any orator to raise that emotion i am warmed with gratitude i am touched with compassion not when a speaker shows me that these are noble dispositions and that it is my duty to feel them or when he exclaims against me for my indifference and coldness all this time he is speaking only to my reason or conscience he must describe the kindness and tenderness of my friend he must set before me the distress suffered by the person for whom he would interest me then and not till then my heart begins to be touched my gratitude or my compassion begin to flow the foundation therefore of all successful execution in the way of pathetic oratory is to paint the object of that passion which we wish to raise in the most natural and striking manner to describe it with such circumstances as are likely to awaken it in the minds of others every passion is most strongly excited by sensation as anger by the feeling of an injury or the presence of the injurer next to the influence of sense is that of memory and next to memory is the influence of the imagination of this power therefore the orator must avail himself so as to strike the imagination of the hearers with circumstances which in luster and steadiness resemble those of sensation and remembrance in order to accomplish this  in the fourth place the only effectual method is to be moved yourselves there are a thousand interesting circumstances suggested by real passion which no art can imitate and no refinement can supply there is obviously a contagion among the passions ut ridentibus arrident sic fluentibus adflent humani vultus the internal emotion of the speaker adds a pathos to his words his looks his gestures and his whole manner which exerts a power almost irresistible over those who hear him quid enim aliud est causae ut lugentas in recenti dolor disertissime quaedam exclamare videantur et ira nonnunquam in indoctis quoque eloquentiam faciat quam quod illis inest vis mentis et veritas ipsa morum quare in iis quae verisimilia esse volumus simus ipsi similes eorum qui vere patiuntur affectibus et a tali animo proficiscatur oration qualem facere judicem volet  afficiamur antequam afficere conemur quinct lib    but on this point though the most material of all i shall not now insist as i have often had occasion before to show that all attempts toward becoming pathetic when we are not moved ourselves expose us to certain ridicule  quinctilian who discourses upon this subject with much good sense takes pains to inform us of the method which he used when he was a public speaker for entering into those passions which he wanted to excite in others setting before his own imagination what he calls phantasiae or visiones strong pictures of the distress or indignities which they had suffered whose cause he was to plead and for whom he was to interest his hearers dwelling upon these and putting himself in their situation till he was affected by a passion similar to that which the persons themselves had felt ut hominem occisum querar non omnia quae in re presenti accidisse credibile est in occulis habebo nonpercussor ille subitus erumpet non exparescet circumventus exclamabit vel rogabit vel fugiet non ferientem non concidentem videbo non animo sanguis et pallor et gemitus extremus denique expirantis hiatus insidet  ubi vero miseratione opus erit nobis ea de quibus querimur accidisse credamus atque id animo nostro persuadeamus nos illi simus quos gravia indigna tristia passos queramur nec agamus rem quasi alienam sed assumamus parumper illum dolorem ita dicemus quae in simili nostro casu dicturi essemus lib    to this method he attributes all the success he ever had in public speaking and there can be no doubt that whatever tends to increase an orators sensibility will add greatly to his pathetic powers  in the fifth place it is necessary to attend to the proper language of the passions we should observe in what manner any one expresses himself who is under the power of a real and a strong passion and we shall always find his language unaffected and simple it may be animated indeed with bold and strong figures but it will have no ornament or finery he is not at leisure to follow out the play of imagination his mind being wholly seized by one object which has heated it he has no other aim but to represent that in all its circumstances as strongly as he feels it this must be the style of the orator when he would be pathetic and this will be his style if he speaks from real feeling bold ardent simple no sort of description will then succeed but what is written fervente calamo if he stay till he can work up his style and polish and adorn it he will infallibly cool his own ardor and then he will touch the heart no more his composition will become frigid it will be the language of one who describes but who does not feel we must take notice that there is a great difference between painting to the imagination and painting to the heart the one may be done coolly and at leisure the other must always be rapid and ardent in the former art and labor may be suffered to appear in the latter no effect can follow unless it seem to be the work of nature only  in the sixth place avoid interweaving anything of a foreign nature with the pathetic part of a discourse beware of all digressions which may interrupt or turn aside the natural course of the passion when once it begins to rise and swell sacrifice all beauties however bright and showy which would divert the mind from the principal object and which would amuse the imagination rather than touch the heart hence comparisons are always dangerous and generally quite improper in the midst of passion beware even of reasoning unseasonably or at least of carrying on a long and subtle train of reasoning on occasions when the principal aim is to excite warm emotions  in the last place never attempt prolonging the pathetic too much warm emotions are too violent to be lasting nunquam debet esse longa miseratio nam cum veros dolores mitiget tempus citius evanescat necesse est illa quam dicendo effinximus imago in qua si moramur lacrymis fatigatur auditor et requiescit et ab illo quem ceperat impetu in rationem redit non patiamur igitur frigescere hoc opus et affectum cum ad summum perduxerimus relinquamus nec speremus fore ut aliena mala quisquam diu ploret quinct l    study the proper time of making a retreat of making a transition from the passionate to the calm tone in such a manner however as to descend without falling by keeping up the same strain of sentiment that was carried on before though now expressing it with more moderation above all things beware of straining passion too far of attempting to raise it to unnatural heights preserve always a due regard to what the hearers will bear and remember that he who stops not at the proper point who attempts to carry them farther in passion than they will follow him destroys his whole design by endeavoring to warm them too much he takes the most effectual method of freezing them completely  having given these rules concerning the pathetic i shall give one example from cicero which will serve to illustrate several of them particularly the last it shall be taken from his last oration against verres wherein he describes the cruelty exercised by verres when governor of sicily against one gavius a roman citizen this gavius had made his escape from prison into which he had been thrown by the governor and when just embarking at messina thinking himself now safe had uttered some threats that when he had once arrived at rome verres should hear of him and be brought to account for having put a roman citizen in chains the chief magistrate of messina a creature of verress instantly apprehends him and gives information of his threatenings the behavior of verres on this ocasion is described in the most picturesque manner and with all the colors which were proper in order to excite against him the public indignation he thanks the magistrate of messina for his diligence filled with rage he comes into the forum orders gavius to be brought forth the executioners to attend and against the laws and contrary to the wellknown privileges of a roman citizen commands him to be stripped naked bound and scourged publicly in a cruel manner cicero then proceeds thus caedebatur virgis in medio foro messanae civis romanus judices every word rises above another in describing this flagrant enormity and judices is brought out at the end with the greatest propriety caedebatur virgis in medio foro messanae civis romanus judices cum interea nullus gemitus nulla vox alia istius miseri inter dolorem crepitumque plagarum audiebatur nisi haec civis romanus sum hac se commemoratione civitatis omnia verbera depulsurum a corpore arbitrabatur is non modo hoc non perfecit ut virgarum vim deprecaretur sed cum imploraret saepius usurparetque nomen civis crux crux inquam infelici isto and aerumnoso qui nunquam istam potestatem viderat comparabatur o nomen dulce libertatis o jus eximium nostrae civitatis o lex porcia legesque semproniae  huccine omnia tandem reciderunt ut civis romanus in provincia populi romani in oppido foederatorum ab eo qui beneficio populi romani fasces et secures haberet deligatus in foro virgis caederetur in the midst of the marketplace of messana a roman citizen o judges was cruelly scourged with rods when in the mean time amidst the noise of the blows which he suffered no voice no complaint of this unhappy man was heard except this exclamation remember that i am a roman citizen by pleading this privilege of his birthright he hoped to have stopped the strokes of the executioner but his hopes were vain for so far was he from being able to obtain thereby any mitigation of his torture that when he continued to repeat this exclamation and to plead the rights of a citizen a cross a cross i say was preparing to be set up for the execution of this unfortunate person who never before had beheld that instrument of cruel death o sacred and honored name of liberty o boasted and revered privilege of a roman citizen o ye porcian and sempronion laws to this issue have ye all come that a citizen of rome in a province of the roman empire within an allied city should publicly in a market place be loaded with chains and beaten with rods at the command of one who from the favor of the roman people alone derived all his authority and ensigns of power   nothing can be finer nor better conducted than this passage the circumstances are well chosen for exciting both the compassion of his hearers for gavius and their indignation against verres the style is simple and the passionate exclamation the address to liberty and the laws is welltimed and in the proper style of passion the orator goes on to exaggerate verress cruelty still farther by another very striking circumstance he ordered a gibbet to be erected for gavius not in the common place of execution but just by the seashore over against the coast of italy let him said he who boasts so much of his being a roman citizen take a view from his gibbet of his own country  this base insult over a dying man is the least part of his guilt it was not gavius alone that verres meant to insult but it was you o romans it was every citizen who now hears me in the person of gavius he scoffed at your rights and showed in what contempt he held the roman name and roman liberties  hitherto all is beautiful animated pathetic and the model would have been perfect if cicero had stopped at this point but his redundant and florid genius carried him further he must needs interest not his hearers only but the beasts the mountains and the stones against verres si haec non ad cives romanos non ad amicos nostrae civitatis non ad eos qui populi romani nomen audissent denique si non ad homines verum ad bestias atque ut longius progrediar si in aliqua desertissima solitudine ad saxa et ad scopulos haec conqueri et deplorare vellem tamen omnia muta atque inanima tanta et tam indigna rerum atrocitate commoverentur were i employed in lamenting those instances of an atrocious oppression and cruelty not among an assembly of roman citizens not among the allies of our state not among those who had ever heard the name of the roman people not even among human creatures but in the midst of the brute creation and to go farther were i pouring forth my lamentations to the stones and to the rocks in some remote and desert wilderness even those mute and inanimate beings would at the recital of such shocking indignities be thrown into commotion  this with all the deference due to so eloquent an orator we must pronounce to be declamatory not pathetic this is straining the language of passion too far every hearer sees this immediately to be a studied figure of rhetoric it may amuse him but instead of inflaming him more it in truth cools his passion so dangerous it is to give scope to a flowery imagination when one intends to make a strong and passionate impression  no other part of discourse remains now to be treated of except the peroration or conclusion concerning this it is needless to say much because it must vary so considerably according to the strain of the preceding discourse sometimes the whole pathetic part comes in most properly at the peroration sometimes when the discourse has been entirely argumentative it is fit to conclude with summing up the arguments placing them in one view and leaving the impression of them full and strong on the mind of the audience for the great rule of a conclusion and what nature obviously suggests is to place that last on which we choose that the strength of our cause should rest  in sermons inferences from what has been said make a common conclusion with regard to these care should be taken not only that they rise naturally but what is less commonly attended to that they should so much agree with the strain of sentiment throughout the discourse as not to break the unity of the sermon for inferences how justly soever they may be deduced from the doctrine of the text yet have a bad effect if at the conclusion of a discourse they introduce some subject altogether new and turn off our attention from the main object to which the preacher had directed our thoughts they appear in this case like excrescences jutting out from the body which had better have been wanted and tend to enfeeble the impression which the composition as a whole is calculated to make  the most eloquent of the french perhaps indeed of all modern orators boussuet bishop of meaux terminates in a very moving manner his funeral oration on the great prince of conde with this return upon himself and his old age accept o prince these last efforts of a voice which you once well knew with you all my funeral discourses are now to end instead of deploring the death of others henceforth it shall be my study to learn from you how my own may be blessed happy if warned by those gray heirs of the account which i must soon give of my ministry i reserve solely for that flock whom i ought to feed with the word of life the feeble remains of a voice which now trembles and of an ardor which is now on the point of being extinct agreez

saint heureux si averti par ces chevaux blancs du compte que je dois render de mon administration je reserve au troupeau que je dois nourrir de la parole de vie les restes dune voix qui tomb and dune ardeur que seteint  these are the last sentences of that oration but the whole of the peroration from that passage venez peuples venez maintenant etc though it is too long for insertion is a great masterpiece of pathetic eloquence   in all discourses it is a matter of importance to hit the precise time of concluding so as to bring our discourse just to a point neither ending abruptly and unexpectedly nor disappointing the expectation of the hearers when they look for our being done and continuing to hover round and round the conclusion till they become heartily tired of us we should endeavor to go off with a good grace not to end with a languishing and drawling sentence but to close with dignity and spirit that we may leave the minds of the hearers warm and dismiss them with a favorable impression of the subject and of the speaker  lecture xxxiii pronunciation or delivery having treated of several general heads relating to eloquence or public speaking i now proceed to another very important part of the subject yet remaining that is pronunciation or delivery of a discourse how much stress was laid upon this by the most eloquent of all orators demosthenes appears from a noted saying of his related both by cicero and quinctilian when being asked what was the first point in oratory he answered delivery and being asked what was the second and afterward what was the third he still answered delivery there is no wonder that he should have rated this so high and that for improving himself in it he should have employed those assiduous and painful labors which all the ancients take so much notice of for beyond doubt nothing is of more importance to superficial thinkers the management of the voice and gesture in public speaking may appear to relate to decoration only and to be one of the inferior arts of catching an audience but this is far from being the case it is intimately connected with what is or ought to be the end of all public speaking persuasion and therefore deserves the study of the most grave and serious speakers as much as of those whose only aim it is to please  for let it be considered whenever we address ourselves to others by words our intention certainly is to make some impression on those to whom we speak it is to convey to them our own ideas and emotions now the tone of our voice our looks and gestures interpret our ideas and emotions no less than words do nay the impression they make on others is frequently much stronger than any that words can make we often see that an expressive look or a passionate cry unaccompanied by words convey to others more forcible ideas and rouse within them stronger passions than can be communicated by the most eloquent discourse the signification of our sentiments made by tones and gestures has this advantage above that made by words that it is the language of nature it is that method of interpreting our mind which nature has dictated to all and which is understood by all whereas words are only arbitrary conventional symbols of our ideas and by consequence must make a more feeble impression so true is this that to render words fully significant they must almost in every case receive some aid from the manner of pronunciation and delivery and he who in speaking should employ bare words without enforcing them by proper tones and accents would leave us with a faint and indistinct impression often with a doubtful and ambiguous conception of what he had delivered nay so close is the connection between certain sentiments and the proper manner of pronouncing them that he who does not pronounce them after that manner can never persuade us that he believes or feels the sentiments themselves his delivery may be such as to give the lie to all that he asserts when marcus callidius accused one of an attempt to poison him but enforced his accusation in a languid manner and without any warmth or earnestness of delivery cicero who pleaded for the accused person improved this into an argument of the falsity of the charge an tu m callidi nisi fingeres sic ageres in shakespeares richard ii the duchess of york thus impeaches the sincerity of her husband pleads he in earnest  look upon his face his eyes do drop no tears his prayers are jest his words come from his mouth ours from our breast he prays but faintly and would be denied we pray with heart and soul   but i believe it is needless to say any more in order to show the high importance of a good delivery i proceed therefore to such observations as appear to me most useful to be made on this head  the great objects which every public speaker will naturally have in his eye in forming his delivery are first to speak so as to be fully and easily understood by all who hear him and next to speak with grace and force so as to please and to move his audience let us consider what is most important with respect to each of these on this whole subject mr sheridans lectures on elocution are very worthy of being consulted and several hints are here taken from them   in order to be fully and easily understood the four chief requisites are a due degree of loudness of voice distinctness slowness and propriety of pronunciation  the first attention of every public speaker doubtless must be to make himself be heard by all those to whom he speaks he must endeavor to fill with his voice the space occupied by the assembly this power of voice it may be thought is wholly a natural talent it is so in a good measure but however may receive considerable assistance from art much depends for this purpose on the proper pitch and management of the voice every man has three pitches in his voice the high the middle and the low one the high is that which he uses in calling aloud to some one at a distance the low is when he approaches to a whisper the middle is that which he employs in common conversation and which he should use for ordinary in public discourse for it is a great mistake to imagine that one must take the highest pitch of his voice in order to be well heard by a great assembly this is confounding two things which are different loudness or strength of sound with the key or note on which we speak a speaker may render his voice louder without altering the key and we will always be able to give most body most persevering force of sound to that pitch of voice to which in conversation we are accustomed whereas by setting out on our highest pitch or key we certainly allow ourselves less compass and are likely to strain and outrun our voice before we have done we shall fatigue ourselves and speak with pain and whenever a man speaks with pain to himself he is always heard with pain by his audience give the voice therefore full strength and swell of sound but always pitch it on your ordinary speaking key make it a constant rule never to utter a greater quantity of voice than you can afford without pain to yourselves and without any extraordinary effort as long as you keep within these bounds the other organs of speech will be at liberty to discharge their several offices with ease and you will always have your voice under command but whenever you transgress these bounds you give up the reins and have no longer any management of it it is an useful rule too in order to be well heard to fix our eye on some of the most distant persons in the assembly and to consider ourselves as speaking to them we naturally and mechanically utter our words with such a degree of strength as to make ourselves be heard by one to whom we address ourselves provided he be within the reach of our voice as this is the case in common conversation it will hold also in public speaking but remember that in public as well as in conversation it is possible to offend by speaking too loud this extreme hurts the ear by making the voice come upon it in rumbling indistinct masses besides its giving the speaker the disagreeable appearance of one who endeavors to compel assent by mere vehemence and force of sound  in the next place to being well heard and clearly understood distinctness of articulation contributes more perhaps than more loudness of sound the quantity of sound necessary to fill even a large space is smaller than is commonly imagined and with distinct articulation a man of a weak voice will make it reach farther than the strongest voice can reach without it to this therefore every public speaker ought to pay great attention he must give every sound which he utters its due proportion and make every syllable and even every letter in the word which he pronounces be heard distinctly without slurring whispering or suppressing any of the proper sounds  in the third place in order to articulate distinctly moderation is requisite with regard to the speed of pronouncing precipitancy of speech confounds all articulation and all meaning i need scarcely observe that there may be also an extreme on the opposite side it is obvious that a lifeless drawling pronunciation which allows the minds of the hearers to be always outrunning the speaker must render every discourse insipid and fatiguing but the extreme of speaking too fast is much more common and requires the more to be guard edagainst because when it has grown up into a habit few errors are more difficult to be corrected to pronounce with a proper degree of slowness and with full and clear articulation is the first thing to be studied by all who begin to speak in public and cannot be too much recommended to them such a pronunciation gives weight and dignity to their discourse it is a great assistance to the voice by the pauses and rests which it allows it more easily to make and it enables the speaker to swell all his sounds both with more force and more music it assists him also in preserving a due command of himself whereas a rapid and hurried manner is apt to excite that flutter of spirits which is the greatest enemy to all right execution in the way of oratory promptum sit os says quinctilian non praeceps moderatum non lentum  after these fundamental attentions to the pitch and management of the voice to distinct articulation and to a proper degree of slowness of speech what a public speaker must in the fourth place study is propriety of pronunciation or the giving to every word which he utters that sound which the most polite usage of the language appropriates to it in opposition to broad vulgar or provincial pronunciation this is requisite both for speaking intelligibly and for speaking with grace or beauty instructions concerning this article can be given by the living voice only but there is one observation which it may not be improper here to make in the english language every word which consists of more syllables than one has one accented syllable the accent rests sometimes on the vowel sometimes on the consonant seldom or never is there more than one accented syllable in any english word however long and the genius of the language requires the voice to mark that syllable by a stronger percussion and to pass more slightly over the rest now having once learned the proper seats of these accents it is an important rule to give every word just the same accent in public speaking as in common discourse many persons err in this respect when they speak in public and with solemnity they pronounce the syllables in a different manner from what they do at other times they dwell upon them and protract them they multiply accents on the same word from a mistaken notion that it gives gravity and force to their discourse and adds to the pomp of public declamation whereas this is one of the greatest faults that can be committed in pronunciation it makes what is called a theatrical or mouthing manner and gives an artificial affected air to speech which detracts greatly both from its agreeableness and its impression  i proceed to treat next of those higher parts of delivery by studying which a speaker has something farther in view than merely to render himself intelligible and seeks to give grace and force to what he utters these may be comprised under four heads emphasis pauses tones and gestures let me only premise in general to what i am to say concerning them that attention to these articles of delivery is by no means to be confined as some might be apt to imagine to the more elaborate and pathetic parts of a discourse there is perhaps as great attention requisite and as much skill displayed in adapting emphases pauses tones and gestures properly to calm and plain speaking and the effect of a just and graceful delivery will in every part of a subject be found of high importance for commanding attention and enforcing what is spoken  first let us consider emphasis by this is meant a stronger and fuller sound of voice by which we distinguish the accented syllable of some word on which we design to lay particular stress and to show how it affects the rest of the sentence sometimes the emphatic word must be distinguished by a particular tone of voice as well as by a stronger accent on the right management of the emphasis depends the whole life and spirit of every discourse if no emphasis be placed on any words not only is discourse rendered heavy and lifeless but the meaning left often ambiguous if the emphasis be placed wrong we pervert and confound the meaning wholly to give a common instance such a simple question as this do you ride to town today is capable of no fewer than four different acceptations according as the emphasis is differnetly placed on the words if it be pronounced thus do you ride to town today the answer may naturally be no i send my servant in my stead if thus do you ride to town today answer no i intend to walk do you ride to town today no i ride out into the fields do you ride to town today no but i shall tomorrow in like manner in solemn discourse the whole force and beauty of an expression often depends on the accented word and we may present to the hearers quite different views of the same sentiment by placing the emphasis differently in the following words of our savior observe in what different lights the thought is placed according as the words are pronounced judas betrayest thou the son of man with a kiss betrayest thou  makes the reproach turn on the infamy of treachery betrayest thou  makes it rest upon judass connection with his master betrayest thou the son of man  rests it upon our saviors personal character and eminence betrayest thou the son of man with a kiss turns it upon his prostituting the signal of peace and friendship to the purpose of a mark of destruction  in order to acquire the proper management of the emphasis the great rule and indeed the only rule possible to be given is that the speaker study to attain a just conception of the force and spirit of those sentiments which he is to pronounce for to lay the emphasis with exact propriety is a constant exercise of good sense and attention it is far from being an inconsiderable attainment it is one of the greatest trials of a true and just taste and must arise from feeling delicately ourselves and from judging accurately of what is fittest to strike the feeling of others there is as great a difference between a chapter of the bible or any other piece of plain prose read by one who places the several emphases every where with taste and judgment and by one who neglects or mistakes them as there is between the same tune played by the most masterly hand or by the most bungling performer  in all prepared discourses it would be of great use if they were read over or rehearsed in private with this particular view to search for the proper emphases before they were pronounced in public marking at the same time with a pen the emphatical words in every sentence or at least in the most weighty and affecting parts of the discourse and fixing them well in memory were this attention oftener bestowed were this part of pronunciation studied with more exactness and not left to the moment of delivery as is commonly done public speakers would find their care abundantly repaid by the remarkable effects which it would produce upon their audience let me caution at the same time against one error that of multiplying emphatical words too much it is only by a prudent reserve in the use of them that we can give them any weight if they recur too often if a speaker attempts to render every thing which he says of high importance by a multitude of strong emphases we soon learn to pay little regard to them to crowd every sentence with emphatical words is like crowding all the pages of a book with italic characters which as to the effect is just the same with using no such distinctions at all  next to emphasis the pauses in speaking demand attention these are of two kinds first emphatical pauses and next such as mark the distinctions of sense an emphatical pause is made after something has been said of peculiar moment and on which we want to fix the hearers attention sometimes before such a thing is said we usher it in with a pause of this nature such pauses have the same effect as a strong emphasis and are subject to the same rules especially to the caution just now given of not repeating them too frequently for as they excite uncommon attention and of course raise expectation if the importance of the matter be not fully answerable to such expectation they occasion disappointment and disgust  but the most frequent and the principal use of pauses is to mark the divisions of the sense and at the same time to allow the speaker to draw his breath and the proper and graceful adjustment of such pauses is one of the most nice and difficult articles in delivery in all public speaking the management of the breath requires a good deal of care so as not to be obliged to divide words from one another which have so intimate a connection that they ought to be pronounced with the same breath and without the least separation many a sentence is miserably mangled and the force of the emphasis totally lost by divisions being made in the wrong place to avoid this every one while he is speaking should be very careful to provide a full supply of breath for what he is to utter it is a great mistake to imagine that the breath must be drawn only at the end of a period when the voice is allowed to fall it can easily be gathered at the intervals of the period when the voice is only suspended for a moment and by this management one may have always a sufficient stock for carrying on the longest sentences without improper interruptions  if any one in public speaking shall have formed to himself a certain melody or tune which requires rest and pauses of its own distinct from those of the sense he has for certain contracted one of the worst habits into which a public speaker can fall it is the sense which should always rule the pauses of the voice for wherever there is any sensible suspension of the voice the hearer is always led to expect somewhat corresponding in the meaning pauses in public discourse must be formed upon the manner in which we utter ourselves in ordinary sensible conversation and not upon the stiff artificial manner which we acquire from reading books according to the common punctuation the general run of punctuation is very arbitrary often capricious and false and dictates an uniformity of tone in the pauses which is extremely disagreeable for we are to observe that to render pauses graceful and expressive they must not only be made in the right place but also be accompanied with a proper tone of voice by which the nature of these pauses is intimated much more than by the length of them which can never be exactly measured sometimes it is only a slight and simple suspension of voice that is proper sometimes a degree of cadence in the voice is required and sometimes that peculiar tone and cadence which denotes the sentence finished in all these cases we are to regulate ourselves by attending to the manner in which nature teaches us to speak when engaged in real and earnest discourse with others  when we are reading or reciting verse there is a peculiar difficulty in making the pauses justly the difficulty arises from the melody of verse which dictates to the ear pauses or rests of its own and to adjust and compound these properly with the pauses of the sense so as neither to hurt the ear nor offend the understanding is so very nice a matter that it is no wonder we so seldom meet with good readers of poetry there are two kinds of pauses that belong to the music of verse one is the pause at the end of the line and the other the caesural pause in the middle of it with regard to the pause at the end of the line which marks that strain or verse to be finished rhyme renders this always sensible and in some measure compels us to observe it in our pronunciation in blank verse where there is a greater liberty permitted of running the lines into one another sometimes without any suspension in the sense it has been made a question whether in reading such verse with propriety any regard at all should be paid to the close of a line on the stage where the appearance of speaking in verse should always be avoided there can i think be no doubt that the close of such lines as make no pause in the sense should not be rendered perceptible to the ear but on other occasions this were improper for what is the use of melody or for what end has the poet composed in verse if in reading his lines we suppress his numbers and degrade them by our pronunciation into mere prose we ought therefore certainly to read blank verse so as to make every line sensible to the ear at the same time in doing so every appearance of singsong and tone must be carefully guarded against the close of the line where it makes no pause in the meaning ought to be marked not by such a tone as is used in finishing a sentence but without either letting the voice fall or elevating it it should be marked only by such a slight suspension of sound as may distinguish the passage from one line to another without injuring the meaning  the other kind of musical pause is that which falls somewhere about the middle of the verse and divides it into two hemistichs a pause not so great as that which belongs to the close of the line but still sensible to an ordinary ear this which is called the caesural pause in the french heroic verse falls uniformly in the middle of the line in the english it may fall after the  th  th  th or  th syllables in the line and no other where the verse is so constructed that this caesural pause coincides with the slightest pause or division in the sense the line can be read easily as in the two first verses of mr popes messiah ye nymphs of solyma begin the song to heavenly themes sublimer strains belong but if it shall happen that words which have such a strict and intimate connection as not to bear even a momentary separation are divided from one another by this caesural pause we then feel a sort of struggle between the sense and the sound which renders it difficult to read such lines gracefully the rule of proper pronunciation in such cases is to regard only the pause which the sense forms and to read the line accordingly the neglect of the caesural pause may make the line sound somewhat unharmoniously but the effect would be much worse if the sense were sacrificed to the sound for instance in the following line of milton  what in me is dark illumine what is low raise and support   the sense clearly dictates the pause after illumine at the end of the third syllable which in reading ought to be made accordingly though if the melody only were to be regarded illumine should be connected with what follows and the pause not made till the  th or  th syllable so in the following line of mr popes epistle to dr arbuthnot i sit with sad civility i read   the ear plainly paints out the caesural pause as salling after sad the  th syllable but it would be very bad reading to make any pause there so as to separate sad and civility the sense admits of no other pause than after the second syllable sit which therefore must be the only pause made in the reading  i proceed to treat next of tones in pronunciation which are different both from emphasis and pauses consisting in the modulation of the voice the notes or variations of sound which we employ in public speaking how much of the propriety the force and grace of discourse must depend on these will appear from this single consideration that to almost every sentiment we utter more especially to every strong emotion nature has adapted some peculiar tone of voice insomuch that he who should tell another that he was very angry or very grieved in a tone which did not suit such emotions instead of being believed would be laughed at sympathy is one of the most powerful principles by which persuasive discourse works its effect the speaker endeavors to transfuse into his hearers his own sentiments and emotions which he can never be successful in doing unless he utters them in such a manner as to convince the hearers that he feels them all that passes in the mind of man may be reduced to two classes which i call ideas and emotions by ideas i mean all thoughts which rise and pass in succession in the mind by emotions all exertions of the mind in arranging combining and separating its ideas as well as all the effects produced on the mind itself by those ideas from the more violent agitation of the passions to the calmer feelings produced by the operation of the intellect and the fancy in short thought is the object of the one internal feeling of the other that which serves to express the former i call the language of ideas and the latter the language of emotions words are the signs of the one tones of the other without the use of these two sorts of language it is impossible to communicate through the ear all that passes in the mind of man sheridan on the art of reading  the proper language and expression of tones therefore deserves to be attentively studied by every one who would be a successful orator  the greatest and most material instruction which can be given for this purpose is to form the tones of public speaking upon the tones of sensible and animated conversation we may observe that every man when he is much in earnest in common discourse when he is engaged in speaking on some subject which interests him nearly has an eloquent or persuasive tone and manner what is the reason of our being often so frigid and unpersuasive in public discourse but our departing from the natural tone of speaking and delivering ourselves in an affected artificial manner nothing can be more absurd than to imagine that as soon as one mounts a pulpit or rises in a public assembly he is instantly to lay aside the voice with which he expresses himself in private to assume a new studied tone and a cadence altogether foreign to his natural manner this has vitiated all delivery this has given rise to cant and tedious monotony in the different kinds of modern public speaking especially in the pulpit men departed from nature and sought to give a beauty or force as they imagined to their discourse by substituting certain studied musical tones in the room of the genuine expressions of sentiment which the voice carries in natural discourse let every public speaker guard against this error whether he speak in a private room or in a great assembly let him remember that he still speaks follow nature consider how she teaches you to utter any sentiment or feeling of your heart imagine a subject of debate started in conversation among grave and wise men and yourself bearing a share in it think after what manner with what tones and inflexions of voice you would on such an occasion express yourself when you was most in earnest and sought most to be listened to carry these with you to the bar to the pulpit or to any public assembly let these be the foundation of your manner of pronouncing there and you will take the surest method of rendering your delivery both agreeable and persuasive  i have said let these conversation tones be the foundation of public pronunciation for on some occasions solemn public speaking requires them to be exalted beyond the strain of common discourse in a formal studied oration the elevation of the style and the harmony of the sentences prompt almost necessarily a modulation of voice more rounded and bordering more upon music than conversation admits this gives rise to what is called the declaiming manner but though this mode of pronunciation runs considerably beyond ordinary discourse yet still it must have for its basis the natural tones of grave and dignified conversation i must observe at the same time that the constant indulgence of a declamatory manner is not favorable either to good composition or good delivery and is in hazard of betraying public speakers into that monotony of tone and cadence which is so generally complained of whereas he who forms the general run of his delivery upon a speaking manner is not likely ever to become disagreeable through monotony he will have the same natural variety in his tones which a person has in conversation indeed the perfection of delivery requires both these different manners that of speaking with liveliness and ease and that of declaiming with stateliness and dignity to be possessed by one man and to be employed by him according as the different parts of his discourse require either the one or the other this is a perfection which not many attain the greatest part of public speakers allowing their delivery to be formed altogether accidentally according as some turn of voice appears to them most beautiful or some artificial model has caught their fancy and acquiring by this means a habit of pronunciation which they can never vary but the capital direction which ought never to be forgotten is to copy the proper tones for expressing every sentiment from those which nature dictates to us in conversation with others to speak always with her voice and not to form to ourselves a fantastic public manner from an absurd fancy of its being more beautiful than a natural one loquere says an author of the last century who has written a treatise in verse de gestu et voce oratoris  loquere hoc vitium commune loquatur ut nemo at ens declamitet omnia voce tu loquere ut mos est hominum boat and latrat ille ille ululat rudit hic sari si talia dignum est non hominem vox ulla sonat ratione loquentem joannes lucas de gestu et voce lib ii paris        it now remains to treat of gesture or what is called action in public discourse some nations animate their words in common conversation with many more motions of the body than others do the french and the italians are in this respect much more sprightly than we but there is no nation hardly any person so phlegmatic as not to accompany their words with some actions and gesticulations on all occasions when they are much in earnest it is therefore unnatural in a public speaker it is inconsistent with that earnestness and seriousness which he ought to show in all affairs of moment to remain quite unmoved in his outward appearance and to let the words drop from his mouth without any expression of meaning or warmth in his gesture  the fundamental rule as to propriety of action is undoubtedly the same with what i gave as to propriety of tone attend to the looks and gestures in which earnestness indignation compassion or any other emotion discovers itself to most advantage in the common intercourse of men and let these be your model some of these looks and gestures are common to all men and there are also certain peculiarities of manner which distinguish every individual a public speaker must take that manner which is most natural to himself for it is here just as in tones it is not the business of a speaker to form to himself a certain set of motions and gestures which he thinks most becoming and agreeable and to practice these in public without their having any correspondence to the manner which is natural to him in private his gestures and motions ought all to carry that kind of expression which nature has dictated to him and unless this be the case it is impossible by means of any study to avoid their appearing stiff and forced  however although nature must be the groundwork i admit that there is room in this matter for some study and art for many persons are naturally ungraceful in the motions which they make and this ungracefulness might in part at least be reformed by application and care the study of action in public speaking consists chiefly in guarding against awkward and disagreeable motions and in learning to perform such as are natural to the speaker in the most becoming manner for this end it has been advised by writers on this subject to practice before a mirror where one may see and judge of their own gestures but i am afraid persons are not always the best judges of the gracefulness of their own motions and one may declaim long enough before a mirror without correcting any of his faults the judgment of a friend whose good taste they can trust will be found of much greater advantage to beginners than any mirror they can use with regard to particular rules concerning action and gesticulation quinctilian has delivered a great many in the last chapter of the   th book of his institutions and all the modern writers on this subject have done little else but translate them i am not of opinion that such rules delivered either by the voice or on paper can be of much use unless persons saw them exemplified before their eyes the few following hints only i shall adventure to throw out in case they may be of any service when speaking in public one should study to preserve as much dignity as possible in the whole attitude of the body an erect posture is generally to be chosen standing firm so as to have the fullest and freest command of all his motions any inclination which is used should be forwards toward the hearers which is a natural expression of earnestness as for the countenance the chief rule is that it should correspond with the nature of the discourse and when no particular emotion is expressed a serious and manly look is always the best the eyes should never be fixed close on any one object but move easily round the audience in the motions made with the hands consists the chief part of gesture in speaking the ancients condemned all motions performed by the left hand alone but i am not sensible that these are always offensive though it is natural for the right hand to be more frequently employed warm emotions demand the motion of both hands corresponding together but whether one gesticulates with one or with both hands it is an important rule that all his motions should be free and easy narrow and straitened movements are generally ungraceful for which reason motions made with the hands are directed to proceed from the shoulder rather than from the elbow perpendicular movements too with the hands that is in the straight line up and down which shakespeare in hamlet calls sawing the air with the hand are seldom good oblique motions are in general the most graceful to sudden and nimble motions should be likewise avoided earnestness can be fully expressed without them shakespeares directions on this head are full of good sense use all gently says he and in the very torrent and tempest of passion acquire a temperance that may give it smoothness   i shall only add further on this head that in order to succeed well in delivery nothing is more necessary than for a speaker to guard against a certain flutter of spirits which is peculiarly incident to those who begin to speak in public he must endeavor above all things to be recollected and master of himself for this end he will find nothing of more use to him than to study to become wholly engaged in his subject to be possessed with a sense of its importance or seriousness to be concerned much more to persuade than to please he will generally please most when pleasing is not his sole nor chief aim this is the only rational and proper method of raising ones self above that timid and bashful regard to an audience which is so ready to disconcert a speaker both as to what he is to say and as to his manner of saying it  i cannot conclude without an earnest admonition to guard against all affectation which is the certain ruin of good delivery let your manner whatever it is be your own neither imitated from another nor assumed upon some imaginary model which is unnatural to you whatever is native even though accompanied with several defects yet is likely to please because it shows us a man because it has the appearance of coming from the heart whereas a delivery attended with several acquired graces and beauties if it be not easy and free if it betray the marks of art and affectation never fails to disgust to attain any extremely correct and perfectly graceful delivery is what few can expect so many natural talents being requisite to concur in forming it but to attain what as to the effect is very little inferior a forcible and persuasive manner is within the power of most persons if they will only unlearn false and corrupt habits if they will only unlearn false and corrupt habits if they will allow themselves to follow nature and will speak in public as they do in private when they speak in earnest and from the heart if one has naturally any gross defects in his voice or gestures he begins at the wrong end if he attempts at reforming them only when he is to speak in public he should begin with rectifying them in his private manner of speaking and then carry to the public the right habit he has formed for when a speaker is engaged in a public discourse he should not be then employing his attention about his manner or thinking of his tones and his gestures if he be so employed study and affectation will appear he ought to be then quite in earnest wholly occupied with his subject and his sentiments leaving nature and previously formed habits to prompt and suggest his manner of delivery  end of the second volume
