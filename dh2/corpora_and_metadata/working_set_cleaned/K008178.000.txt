  la vergne inn  e kirkall sculp the resurrection a poem  written by mr addison  venient cito saecula cum jam socius calor ossa revisat animataque sanguine vivo habitacula pristina gestet prud london printed for e curll in fleet street      price six pence  the preface the following lines are esteemed by the best judges to be the finest sketch of the resurrection that any age or language has produced nor do their only excellence consist in being an accurate poem but also in being an exact copy of the painters old fuller original upon the altar in magdalen college but so much improved with all the strongest figures and most lively embellishments of a poetical description that the reader receives a double satisfaction in seeing the two sisterarts so useful to each other in borrowing mutual helps and mutual advantages  it is indeed wonderful to find in the narrow compass of so few pages all the most dreadful circumstances of that last terrible crisis of time the poem is a beautiful and succinct epitome of all that has or can ever be said on that important subject the very text which the ingenious mr young has so largely and elegantly paraphrased upon in his excellent poem on the last day  mr addison is to be distinguished through all his performances both latin and english and in his latin particularly in the following one and that on the peace of riswick by the strength of his images and by a forcible and unaffected vivacity of expression which none of our moderns have attained to in so much perfection and which is very rarely to be met with even in any of the ancients since virgil and horace  having mentioned mr addison i cannot avoid congratulating my country on his preferment to one of her greatest civil employments nor forbear observing how happy we are in a king who has shown the world that he will distribute his favors amongst those only whom merit and virtue shall recommend to his service  with what uncommon luster must that man appear to posterity who is not only the best writer and most candid patron of the age he lives in but also the finest gentleman the sincerest friend the most affectionate husband the most accomplished statesman and the most exemplary christian under every one of these views mr addison gains the esteem and admiration even of the bitterest enemies to that cause which he so warmly espouses of the most furious partisans and the most prejudiced of mankind  i must forbear to enlarge any farther on the character of that truly great and good man lest i draw upon my self the imputation of a flatterer by relating what all the world except himself only will allow to be the severest truth  i shall make no excuse for offering the following poem to the world in an english dress and under all the disadvantages of an imperfect translation i have often read it in the original with the greatest pleasure and satisfaction and i hope it will need no apology to be willing to communicate so useful and sublime an entertainment in the best manner i can to those of my fellow subjects who are not qualified to read it in the latin original  resurrectio delineata ad altar col magd oxon egregios fuci tractus

     the resurrection a poem the pencils glowing lines and vast command and mankind rising from the painters hand the awful judge arrayed in beamy light and specter trembling at the dreadful sight to sing o muse the pious bard inspire and waken in his breast the sacred fire the hallowed field a bare white wall of late now clothed in gaudy colors shines in state and lest some little interval confess it is ancient simple form and homely dress the skilful artist laid over every part the first foundation of his future art over the wide frame his ductile colors led and with thick daubings all the wall overspread as ever you spangling orbs were hung on high lest one great blank should yawn through boundless sky through the wide heavenly arch and trackless road in azure volumes the pure ether flowed the sun at length burns out intensely bright and the pale crescent sheds her borrowed light with thicksown stars the radiant pole is crowned of milky glories a long tract is found overflows and whitens all the heavens around so when the groundwork of the piece was laid nor yet the painter had his art displayed with slower hand and pencil more divine he blends each color heightens every line till various forms the breathing picture wears and a mute groupe of images appears celestial guards the topmost height attend and crowds of angels over the wall descend with their big cheeks the deafning clarions wind whose dreadful clangors startle all mankind even the dead hear the laboring graves conceive and the swollen clod in picture seems to heave ten thousand worlds revive to better skies and from their tombs the thronging coarses rise so when famed cadmus sowed the fruitful field with pregnant throws the quickened furrow swelled from the warm soil sprung up a warlike train and human harvests covered all the plain and now from every corner of the earth the scattered dust is called to second birth whether in mines it formed the ripening mass or humbly mixed and flourished in the grass the severed body now unites again and kindred atoms rally into men the various joints resume their ancient seats and every limb its former task repeats here an imperfect form returns to light not half renewed dishonest to the sight maimed of his nose appears his blotted face and scarce the image of a man we trace here by degrees infused the vital ray gives the first motion to the panting clay here on the guilty brow pale horrors glare and all the figure labors with despair from scenes like these now turn thy wondering sight and if thou can withstand such floods of light look where thy savior fills the middle space the godhead opening in his awful face see what mild beams their gracious influence shed and how the pointed radiance crowns his head around his temples lambent glories shine and on his brow sits majesty divine his eye balls lighten the celestial fires and every grace to speak the god conspires how changed from him who came to be betrayed and who for man the precious ransom paid who did on earth such arduous toils sustain and patient bore an irksom life of pain but death and hell subdued the deity ascends triumphant to his native sky and rising far above the ethereal height the sun and moon diminished to his sight and now to view he bared his bleeding side and his pierced hands and feet in crimson died still did the nails the recent scars reveal and bloody tracks of the transfixing steel hither in crowds the blessed shape their flight and throng the mansions of immortal light the fruitful matron and the spotless maid and infants with a longer life repaid stand round and drinking in celestial rays on their redeemer fix with ardent gaze and all the heavens resound with hymns of praise each bosom kindles with seraphic joy and conscious raptures all the soul employ not equal raptures swell the sybils breast when by the inmate deity possessed when phoebus the prophetic maid inspires and her limbs tremble with convulsive fires but whence this sudden blaze of dazzling light what mitred brow is that which greets my sight forth from a stately tomb he lifts his head and to the skies on angels wings is sped i know the form  alike the look and mien another william wainflet bishop of winchester he was the founder of magdalen college and the hall adjoining wainflet in his face is seen when will alas such spotless worth be found when will a mind with equal virtues crowned fearless he sees almighty vengeance rise and fixes on his god his guiltless eyes but now far different scenes our wonder claim horrent with darkness and malignant flame  the labored wall delusive picture hides and liquid sulphur rolls in burning tides so strong so fierce the painted flames arise the pale spectator views them with surprise believes the blazing wall indeed to burn and fears the frame should into ashes turn hither in ghastly crowds the guilty haste obscene with horror and with shame defaced with haggard looks the gloomy fiends appear they gnash their foamy teeth and frown severe a stern avenger with relentless mind waving a flamy faulchion stalks behind with which as once from paradise he drove he drives the sinner from the joys above what shall he do forlorn or whither fly to shun the ken of an allseeing eye what would he give amongst the just to shine and fall before omnipotence divine but oh too late in sighs he vents his woe too late his eyes with gushing tears overflow vain are his sighs and fruitless are his tears vengeance and justice stop the almightys ears see with what various charms the piece is fraught and with what pregnant marks of judgment wrought with how much grace the living colors glow not brighter colors paint the watery bow when the fresh showers her various luster share and every drop with
