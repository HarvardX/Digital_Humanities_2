the life of sir thomas pope founder of trinity college oxford chiefly compiled from original evidences  with an appendix of papers never before printed  the second edition corrected and enlarged  by thomas warton bd fellow of trinity college and fsa  london printed for thomas cadell in the strand mdcclxxx  preface biographers in the pursuit of information are naturally betrayed into minute researches the curiosity of the reader is seldom proportioned to that of the writer in this species of composition every incident relating to a favorite character which the mind has long contemplated with attention acquires importance on these principles we may venture to found a plausible excuse for the many trifling discoveries and intricate discussions of insignificant circumstances with which personal history so much abounds  to this apology which every biographer has a right to plead the writer of the following memoirs presumes he possesses a peculiar claim arising from his situation and connections he describes the life of a person whom the strongest principles of gratitude implanted in early years have habitually taught him to regard with united veneration and affection under these circumstances the slightest events appear interesting and the most frivolous anecdotes of such a life are investigated with a pleasing enthusiasm  in the mean time a want of materials might have justly been here alleged in extenuation of an objection so constantly urged against works of this kind it will readily be granted that to record the lives of men who have adorned their country by monuments of munificence is a tribute indispensably due to public merit and which cannot without public injustice be witheld but to discharge this duty even imperfectly and by those means however inadequate which the utmost exertions of diligent enquiry can afford is less unpardonable than to neglect it entirely when we cannot recover a perfect portrait of our friend and our benefactor we must be contented with a few faint outlines abundance only implies rejection and where but little can be collected it is necessary to retain every thing we must acquiesce in anecdotes of inconsiderable consequence while those of more importance cannot be procured  these inconveniences might have easily been prevented but our ancestors had no regard for futurity they trusted the remembrances of their heroes to chance and tradition or rather to the laborious investigation of a distant posterity for it is the task of modern times to commemorate if they cannot imitate the conspicuous examples of antiquity and to compose the panegyric of those virtues which exist no more inquisitive leisure is not the lot of earlier eras ages of action are succeeded by ages of enquiry  but that species of enquiry which properly belongs to the biographer seems in point of time to be posteriour to that which forms the province of the historian it does not grow fashionable till late it begins to be the favorite amusement of cultivated nations at their most polished periods when the more important and extensive stores of historical information have been exhausted the growing spirit of curiosity which increases in proportion as it is gratified still demands new gratifications it descends to particularities and delights to develope circumstances of a subordinate nature after many general histories have been written inquisitive minds are eager to explore the parts of what they have hitherto surveyed at large the ardour of research which gathers strength from contraction is exerted on distinct periods and at length personal history commences characters before only represented in the gross and but incidentally exhibited or superficially displayed now become the subject of critical disquisition and a separate examination occurences neglected or omitted by the historian form materials for the biographer and men of superior eminence are selected from the common mass of public transactions in which they were indistinctly grouped and delineated as detatched figures in a single point of view  nor was it till late after the restoration of literature that biography assumed its proper form and appeared in its genuine character the lives which were compiled at some distance after that period are extremely jejune and defective performances the first which approached to perfection were those of peireskius by peter gassendus and of melancthon by camerarius it was long before the perseverance of investigation connected with precision the patient toil of tracing evidences authenticating facts and digesting scattered notices grew into a science in a word before the accuracy of the antiquarian was engrafted on the researches of the biographer the masterly life of william of wykeham will best explain and illustrate these reflections a work which i choose to produce as an example on this occasion not only because it is here produced as an example with a peculiar degree of propriety but because it is a pattern of that excellence in this mode of writing which i mean to characterise and recommend  as sir thomas pope bore some share in the national transactions of his time to relieve the dryness of personal and local incidents i have endeavored to render these pages in some measure interesting to general readers by dilating this part of my performance and by sometimes introducing historical digressions yet resulting immediately from the tenor of my subject amongst these i flatter myself that my relation of the persecutions of the princess elizabeth may merit some attention of which i have thrown together a more uniform and circumstantial detail than has yet appeared with the addition of several anecdotes respecting that transaction not hitherto published  on the whole i may venture to affirm that i have at least attempted to make my work as entertaining as possible my materials have not always been of the most brilliant kind but they are such as have often enabled me to enliven and embellish my narrative by presenting pictures of ancient manners which are ever striking to the imagination  i have before hinted that my resources for compiling this history were slender and insufficient from books i could obtain scarce any information indeed my chief assistance has been derived from manuscript authorities i have not however in this respect found the success i wished yet i have carefully consulted every record that seemed likely to illustrate my subject and my references will show that i have searched a variety of authentic instruments preserved in the british museum the chapel of the rolls and other repositories of valuable originals of these the more important are printed at large in the appendix  among my references to manuscript authorities two sometimes occur which require explanation these are mss cotton vitellius f   mss strype and mss f wise  in the year   0  that

those pages mentioned were taken from the volume vitellius f   in the cotton library which is a certain brief journal of funeral and as well of diverse other occurrences beginning at the year    0 written as it seems by some herald or other diligent observer of his own times there the writer sets down all the particular ceremonies the solemnities and mourners at that knights interment which if you have any desire to know i will transcribe out of my notes and send you this is an original then follows the letter before referred to which is not the original but a transcript by the late mr rawlins of pophills in gloucestershire who became possessed of charletts extensive correspondence see append p     infr  soon afterward it appears that strype sent to charlett perhaps at his request a few other notices relating to sir thomas pope extracted from the same manuscript the late learned mr francis wise keeper of the archives radclivian librarian and fellow of trinity college at oxford copied all the transcripts about four or five in number which strype on this occasion had made from the cotton manuscript by permission of charlett among whose curious and numerous papers they were kept and by mr wise they were thus communicated to me fortunately for the present undertaking the extracts had been made by strype before the fire happened in the cotton library then placed in ashburnham house at westminster by which fatal accident this valuable volume was particularly damaged and as far as i can judge from a cursory inspection most of the leaves if not all containing strypes extracts were either destroyed or obliterated but see append numb xxviii  the reader is therefore desired to observe that the reference viz mss cotton vitell f   mss strype signifies strypes transcripts from thence see pp              but whenever this cotton manuscript is cited without the addition of mss strype the reader will remember that such citations were faithfully transcribed by myself from that manuscript volume now belonging to the british museum  mr wise also transcribed and communicated to me two or three other papers from doctor charletts collections beside those of

riches and honor  what was the first step to his advancement in life and whether it arose from the friendship of some private patron from any distinguished merit in his profession a peculiar cast for business in general or a lucky concurrence of all these causes cannot be precisely determined although from what follows it may be partly conjectured he was not much more than twentyseven years of age when he had sufficient address or interest to procure an appointment to offices which seem to have been alternately bestowed upon henrys most eminent favorites and the most popular characters of those

present reposited is not the same which was the court of wards and consequently which was the augmentation court will appear by comparing the following passage of stowe who wrote in the reign of queen elisabeth at the upper end of the great westminster hall by the kings bench is a going up to a great chamber called the whitehall wherein is now kept the court of wards and liveries and adjoining thereto is the court of requests survey land p     edit      the chamber therefore within or adjoining to westminster hall at the upper end and called the whitehall was the court of augmentations   it is commonly supposed and it has been said in general terms that sir thomas pope was appointed one of the commissioners or visitors under cromwell for dissolving the religious houses it is indeed true that he was one of those into whose hands the seal of the magnificent and opulent abbey of saint albans was surrendered on the fifth day of december      by the last abbot richard stevenache stevenss monasticon i     weevers fun mon p     edit       this however is the only instance i can find that he was ever concerned in this sort of business his name does not appear among the persons specially appointed by cromwell for this purpose whose names are recited by dugdale warwickshire p  00 seq from an authentic manuscript in the cotton library nor does his name occur in the private commissions which after a diligent search i have seen relating to this matter nor in any instruments of resignation letters of advice to the visitor general memorials or other authentic papers concerning the visitation or suppression of any monastery my opinion is therefore that he was only occasionally employed at saint albans as being one of the principal officers in the court of augmentations as the place was in the neighborhood of london and as the surrender of so famous an abbey was an affair of some importance thus we find that the priory now the dean and chapter of canterbury was not dissolved in the ordinary way it being thought necessary that the archbishop of canterbury the master of the rolls walter henley attorney and nicholas bacon solicitor of the augmentationcourt with four others should be sent thither to take the resignation of the prior and monks somners canterbury by batteley append p     it was    hen viii  however if it can be proved that he was ever engaged on other occasions in these violent proceedings of an avaricious and arbitrary prince it may at the same time be fairly presumed that in an employment which afforded so many obvious temptations to fraud oppression and rapacity he behaved with singular decency moderation and honor of this we have the impartial evidence of a prejudiced historian for fuller who is remarkably severe on the visitors in general and who is seldom sparing of his invectives wherever he can discover the slightest foundation for abuse mentioning sir thomas pope as an agent in these affairs immediately subjoins however by all the printed books of that age he appears one of a candid carriage and in this respect stands sole and single by himself that of the abbeylands which he received he refunded a considerable proportion for the building and endowing trinity college in oxford worthies london p      and in another place he mentions him with honor on the same subject but the most pleasant object to entertain us at this time in england is the beholding of two fair and fresh foundations in oxford the one trinity college built by sir thomas pope principal visitor at the dissolution of abbeys this is a mistake as we have before seen  now as none were losers employed in that service so we find few refunding back to charitable uses and perchance this man alone the thankful samaritane who made a public acknowledgement churchhist b viii p     at the surrender of saint albans abbey he preserved by his interest and particular application to the king the noble conventual church now standing and made parochial from the information of the late sir harry popeblount of tittenhanger in hertfordshire  one of the earliest and most venerable monuments of norman architecture remaining in england it was built by paulin the fourteenth abbot a norman about the year  0 0   on the whole the circumstance of his having received grants of the lands of the monasteries seems to have occasioned the mistaken supposition that he was frequently and professedly concerned as a commissioner in the dissolution of their foundations that his prodigious property was accumulated in consequence of the destruction of the religious houses is not denied and the lucky opportunity of raising an estate from this grand harvest of riches which now lay open before him seems to have diverted his thoughts from making a fortune by the law a profession which he most probably would have otherwise continued to cultivate with the greatest success and in which he might have undoubtedly claimed the most opulent and distinguished stations i could give a minute detail from the most authentic evidences of the grants of abbeyland which he recieved during the reign of henry the eighth but it may suffice to observe in more general terms that before the year      he appears to have been actually possessed of more than thirty manors in oxfordshire gloucestershire warwickshire derbyshire bedfordshire herefordshire and kent beside other considerable estates and several advowsons some of these possessions were given him by henry the eighth but the greatest part was acquired by purchase while he was connected with the court of augmentations see dugdales warwickshire and from the patents  many of his estates were bought of queen mary ex muniment coll praedict and lib prim lez rates ann     phil mar mss harl  0

afterward he made other acquisitions   but let us suppose what indeed cannot be proved that sir thomas pope was one of cromwells visitors in the affair of the monasteries for although i have insinuated above that these visitors were not on all occasions entirely justifiable in their proceedings i am yet inclined to think that their conduct and behavior were in general less blameable than has been commonly represented  it is no wonder that the monks should load those whom they esteemed the instruments of their ruin with many calumnies all which were studiously propagated and heightened by their advocates of the catholic persuasion and it should at the same time be remembered that the kings injunctions under which they acted were extremely severe insomuch that many fraternities desired their houses might be rather entirely suppressed than reformed under such rigorous conditions  with regard to the vices and disorders even in the nunneries where among the softer sex some degree of delicacy at least of decorum might have justly been expected the lowest vices not to insist on the more criminal irregularities were too often practiced in the benedictine convent of rumsey

authority and arbitrary dominion of henry had kept both protestants and papists in subjection under such a government they both acted uniformly and neither party presumed to claim any apparent superiority but upon the decease of that uncontrollable monarch the people discovered their real sentiments without reserve and protestantism manifestly began to be the prevailing religion the protector somerset who had long been a secret partisan of the reformers on the accession of young edward publicly declared his intention of forwarding and establishing the reformation in this scheme he was happily seconded by most of the privy council who after the fall of southampton seem entirely to have deserted the catholic communion the protector wisely took care that all persons to whom he entrusted the education of the young king should be attached to these rational principles and preferred and encouraged those alone that appeared active in this profession  thus most of the courtiers yet more perhaps in general from lucrative views than from real conviction became converts to the predominant party amongst which however i do not find sir thomas pope this at least shows a steadiness and uniformity of mind in those days of change which afford such frequent instances of occasional compliance  nor let it be deemed any inconsistency of character that he though a rigid papist should have been in the preceding reign an agent for suppressing the monasteries and a receiver of their possessions for the demolition of these houses was not an act of the church but of the state it was

account of their loyalty or their riches she firmly confided but that tax not being found sufficient she exacted a general loan of an hundred pounds each on all who possessed an annual income of

than to publish a proclamation obliging their former masters to take them back to their services in order to gratify the city of london for past favors and to engage them to assist her with future supplies she issued an edict at their instance prohibiting for four months the exportation of english clothes into flanders by this iniquitous combination a good market was procured in that country

sacrificed in the flames so many victims but it would be endless and impertinent here to mention at large her multiplied extortions and the various imprudent or fraudulent schemes which her exigencies invented for obtaining money it may be sufficient to add that these expedients were employed not to carry on an expensive war for she was in profound peace with all the world nor to promote the national welfare by any new establishments or improvements but to satisfy the unjust demands of a husband who slighted her love neglected her interests and solely consulted his own convenience  on this occasion one cannot help observing the weakness of the human mind under the most powerful and importunate of passions mary regarded her husband philip with all the fondness and solicitude of an uncertain lover this attachment produced strange contradictions in her sentiments and behavior she was naturally too phlegmatic to be profuse yet from a penurious and economical habit of mind she suddenly became rapacious and expensive she persecuted the reformed with the most barbarous severities yet alienated the riches assigned to support her favorite superstitions in this situation she was at once deserted by that cold and stoical inflexibility which distinguishes her character and the sedate and gloomy queen suffered herself to be betrayed into greater inconsistencies of conduct than even the most unaccountable caprice of her father henry could have dictated  before the reign of queen mary it was the common practice with our english princes to have recourse to the city of antwerp for voluntary loans and we generally find their credit so low that they were obliged to engage the city of london to join in the security but this business seems never to have been so effectually

refused to preach the sacrament of the altar to hear mass to take holy bread or holy water to frequent their respective public churches and to assist in the solemn processions they were likewise privileged to summon what witnesses they judged most proper and to tender oaths to the parties prosecuted for answering such questions as might be deemed most convenient for discovering the truth in this injunction however there is a remarkable clause of restraint upon the commissioners for it is expressly commanded that if any person brought before them for heretical doctrines or opinions should still obstinately persist in his error he should immediately be committed to his ordinary there to be used according to the spiritual and ecclesiastical laws  bishop burnet whose imagination was perpetually haunted with the horrors of popery supposes that something more dreadful was intended by this commission than appears at first sight and that it was undoubtedly designed as the tribunal of an inquisition in england hist ref ii      but a superficial reader may plainly perceive that there is nothing of the form process or power of an inquisition contained in this instrument the commissioners receive no authority to try heterodoxy nor to put the offenders upon making an act of faith on the contrary they are directed to deliver up all delinquents to the ordinary and even here the process is to be regulated by the laws of the church these circumstances seem sufficiently to exclude the idea of an inquisitorial tribunal for the proceedings of the commissioners however rigorously they might have been conducted were not unlimited and arbitrary but finally determinable by the proper ecclesiastical officer who was himself controlled by the spiritual constitutions of the land which did not at least on this occasion receive any degree of extension the zealous bishop makes the matter still more alarming where he tells us that in support of such measures he finds it said that some advised that courts of inquisition like those in france and spain might be set up in england ubi supr p      but he does not inform us by whom this is said nor can i find this advice in any of our historians even fox who omits nothing that can expose the papists who has studiously recorded all the idle reports of the times and who supposed that the papists worshipped one god and the protestants another he thus rallies the devotion of the people for praying for marys happy delivery of a child cry up louder you priests peradventure your god is asleep vol iii p      is silent on this important subject and indeed if we consider the queens late expostulation with the pope in which she declared her resolution of maintaining the prerogative and the constitution when the pope

if we recollect that philips confessor alphonsus expressly declaimed against persecutions in the pulpit by the kings own desire neals hist pur i    strype eccl mem iii     heylin p    burnet ref ii  0   and if to these reasons we add the distinguished lenity moderation and candor of cardinal pope this project of an english inquisition must appear altogether improbable  but whatever was the real state of the case we find that the commissioners sensible that persecution naturally counteracts its own purpose and averse to measures which might probably end in the most inhuman punishments did little or nothing in this business heylin ubi supr  especially as to the detection of prohibited books for so inactive were they that on the sixth of june      the queen was obliged to publish a proclamation heylin ubi supr strype eccl mem iii      in which she complains that not only numberless seditious and treasonable treatises were printed at home and dispersed without control but even imported from abroad as the provocation was great so the proclamation is conceived in the most despotic and unconstitutional terms it sets forth amonst other extraordinary menaces that if those persons who find such unlawful books do not immediately destroy them they shall be reputed rebels and executed accordingly by martial law the queen indeed had some reason for complaint and for substituting somewhat more effectual in the place of her former commission by this recent injunction for during the actual subsistence and authority of that commission knox and goodman printed and imported from geneva a piece entitled the first blast of the trumpet against the monstrous regimen of women genev  vo       in this performance which is full of paradox and enthusiasm they call the

of this reign which occasioned the commission in which sir thomas pope was concerned relating to the suppression of heretics we will allow that the queen and her friends had suffered what they thought the most injurious treatment and no doubt when power returned into their hands were but too naturally disposed to retaliate in their own way these oppressions perhaps injudiciously conducted prepared the way for popery just as the severities of mary at the succession of elisabeth made the protestants more violent against the papists in the reign of henry the eighth the monasteries were destroyed

expiate so no provocation can justify no resentment can excuse that uninterrupted series of deliberate barbarity which marks every page of her unprosperous annals with martyrdoms hardly to be paralleled in the pagan persecutions of primitive christianity if in the two preceding reigns many venerable prelates of marys communion had been injuriously treated or even put to death for conscientious disobedience yet none of them were inhumanly dragged to the flames like the meek latimer or the learned ridley it is also allowed that to burn heretics was an established doctrine of the catholic religion but in what age of the same religion or in what country were these punishments ever executed with so many circumstances of cruelty her attempt to restore the monasteries however conformable to her system was a measure which tended only to bring back national poverty with national superstition for it is certain that henrys distribution of the monastic revenues into private hands although dictated by selfish and fordid motives founded the present greatness of england in the mean time it will be but charitable to grant that her private life was confessedly blameless and unblemished i will not say whether it was her fault or her unhappiness that the constancy of her attachments seldom met with suitable returns of gratitude and affection in this at least some goodness of heart appears that nothing affected her so much as the unkindness of those whom she best loved she possessed a firmness of mind which deserved better times and a vigor of understanding which was impeded by religious prejudices her merits whatever they were seem to have been overlooked in her misfortunes and as the latter were aggravated so the former were obliterated by that blaze of

to walk into the gardens of the palace in this situation says hollingshead no marvel if she hearing upon a time out of her gardin at woodstocke a certain milkmaide singing pleasantly wished herself to be a milkmaide as she was saying that her case was better and life merrier this circumstance has given occasion to an elegant ballad by shenstone   after being confined here for many months she

been a term of royal familiarity than of contempt though i doubt not that he treated the princess with no great compassion or delicacy a circumstance which reslects honor on her forgiveness see blomesields norfolk iii      but this sudden kindness of philip who thought elisabeth a much less obnoxious character than his father charles the fifth had conceived her to have been did not arise from any regular principle of real generosity but partly from an affectation of popularity he affected to treat the princess with much respect in an examination cited by hollingshead it appears that accidenttally passing her in a chamber of the palace he paid her such obeisance as to fall with one knee to the ground notwithstanding his usual state and solemnity chron iii    0 col    and partly from a refined sentiment of policy which made him foresee that if elisabeth was put to death the next lawful heir would be mary queen of scots already betrothed to the dauphin of france whose

this is the same person ascham in some of his epistles complains that he was unjustly driven from his tuition of elisabeth in a consequence of a party formed against him in the family of the princess my principal reason for mentioning these particulars is to show that sir thomas pope could not have been one of aschams enemies on this occasion for had that been the case it is not very probable that he should promote aschams friend he was husband of catharine asteley the governess of the princess see below p    ascham mentions this catharine asteley in very respectable terms in a letter to the

governors or attendants but in what department or capacity i know not however it is evident that he was removed from this charge when the princess notwithstanding her infirm state of health was hurried up to the court by southwell cornwallis and hastings nor do we find that from that time he had the least concern with her during her imprisonment in the tower and at woodstock and the rest of those undeserved persecutions which preceded her enlargement and final removal to hatfield  to this lady sir thomas pope behaved with the utmost tenderness and respect residing with her at hatfield

her such marks of regard and deference as her station and quality demanded this appears from the following anecdote which also marks his character see append numb xv   two of the fellows of trinity college in oxford just founded by him had violated one of it is strictest statutes and were accordingly expelled by the president and society upon this they repaired to their founder then at hatfield with the princess elisabeth humbly petitioning a readmittance into his college sir thomas pope probably was not a little perplexed on this occasion for although disposed to forgiveness yet he was unwilling to be the first who should openly countenance or pardon an infringement of laws which himself had made but perceiving a happy opportunity of adjusting the difficulty by paying at the same time a handsome compliment to the princess with much address he referred the matter to her gracious arbitration and she was pleased to order that they should immediately be restored to their fellowships in consequence of this determination he wrote the following letter to the president of the college master president with my hertie commendations albeit sympson and rudde the two

next day the play of holophernes but the queen percase mysliked these folliries as by her letters to sir thomas pope hit did appear and so their disguisinges were ceased  the princess was notwithstanding sometimes suffered to make excursions partly for pleasure and partly for paying her compliments at court and on these occasions she was attended in a manner suitable to her rank strype tells us from the same manuscript journal of memorable occurrences written about those times strype eccl mem iii          that on february the twentyfifth      the lady elizabeth came riding from her

a curious devise in cookery or confectionary of a pomegranatetree bearing the arms of spain there were many minstrels but no masking or dancing before the banquet the queen was long in consultation

of minute description but these and other particularities insignificant as they seem which he has recorded so carefully are a vindication of queen marys character in the treatment of her sister they prove that the princess during her residence at hatfield lived in splendour and affluence that she was often admitted to the diversions of the court and that her present situation was by no means a state of oppression and imprisonment as it has been represented by most of our historians  we have before seen that sir thomas pope during his attendance on this lady was engaged in the foundation of his college an undertaking of such a nature could not fail of attracting the attention of the young elisabeth whose learned education and present situation naturally interested her in the progress of a work so beneficial to the increase of her favorite pursuits and carried on by one with whom she was so nearly connected accordingly this subject was often matter of conversation between them as appears from part of a letter written by sir thomas pope which also still further proves the friendly terms on which they lived together the princess elisabeth her grace whom i serve here often askyth

under the year    0 among the learned daughters of sir thomas more he says the princess elisabeth saines like a star of distinguished luster deriving greater glory from her virtuous disposition and literary accomplishments than from the dignity of her exalted birth i was her preceptor in latin and greek for two years she was but little more than sixteen when she could speak french and italian with as much fluency and propriety as her native english she speaks latin readily justly and even critically she has often conversed with me in greek and with tolerable facility when she transcribes greek or latin nothing can be more beautiful than her handwriting she is excellently skilled in music although not very fond of it she has read with me all cicero and great part of livy it is chiefly from those two authors alone that she has acquired her knowledge of the latin langnage she begins the day with reading a portion of the greek testament and then studies some select orations of isocrates and the tragedies of sophocles from these authors i was of opinion that she would adorn her style with the most elegant diction enrich her mind with the most suitable precepts and frame her high station of life to every fortune for her religious instruction after the scriptures she adds to the classics saint cyprian and the common places of melancthon with other writers of that school who teach purity of doctrine with elegance of expression in every composition she is very quick in pointing out a farfetched word or affected phrase she cannot endure those absurd imitators of erasmus who mince the whole latin language into proverbial maxims she is much pleased with a latin oration naturally arising from its subject and written both chastely and perspicuously she is most fond of translations not too free and with that agreeable clash of sentiment which results from a judicious comparison of opposite or contradictory passages by a diligent attention to these things her taste is become so refined and her judgment so penetrating that there is nothing in greek latin and english composition either extravagant or exact carless or correct which she does not in the course of reading accurately discern immediately rejecting the one with disgust and receiving the other with the highest degree of pleasure ascham epistol lib i p    a edit land        while sir thomas pope was concerned in this superintendance of the princess he received a letter from heath archbishop of york and lord chancellor the bishops of rochester and ely lord arundel and sir henry jernegan dated july

duke who was an able general in his interests against france with which philip was at this time engaged in open hostilities this proposal of the king of sweden she wisely rejected because it was not

application to herself and that having by this preparatory step obtained her consent he would next as a king mention the affair in form to her majesty but the final answer of princess was an absolute denial and she desired the messenger to acquaint his master that as she could not listen to any proposals of that nature unless made by the queens advice or authority so she could not but declare that if left to her own will she would always prefer a single condition of life the affair soon came to the queens ears who sending for sir thomas pope to court received from him an entire account of this secret transaction ordering sir thomas at the same time to write to the princess and acquaint her how much she was satisfied with this prudent and dutiful answer to the king of swedens proposition sir thomas pope very soon afterward returned to his charge at hatfield when the queen commanded him not only to repeat this approbation of the conduct of the princess relating to the proposed match from sweden but to receive from her own mouth the result of her sentiments concerning it and at the same time to take an opportunity of sounding her affections concerning the duke of savoy without

commands had before hinted at a distance as we have seen in the preceding letter this proposal the princess declined but disguised her refusal with the same earnest professions of her unchangeable devotion to a state of virginity which she had before made to sir thomas pope on account of the swedish match great court was paid to the princess during her abode at somerset house carte iii      her amiable condescension obliging address and agreeable conversation procured her new interests and attachments and even engaged the best part of the lords of the council in her favor  her beauty perhaps

queen would have parted in disgust with the princess at this rejection of a match recommended by philip and so convenient to his purposes but it appears that the queen was extremely backward in promoting her husbands desire of marrying elisabeth to the duke of savoy on this account philip employed alphonsus a franciscan friar his confessor to confer with her majesty on the subject of this marriage she told him that she feared without consent of parliament neither her husband philip nor the nation would be benefited by this alliance she added that she could not in point of conscience press this match upon her sister meaning perhaps that it would be unjust to force the princess to be married after her resolute declarations against wedlock or improper and dishonorable to match her beneath the dignity of a crowned head the theological reasonings of alphonsus were too refined for the understanding or too weak for the conscience of the queen who still remained inflexible in her former opinion upon this philip wrote to her in his usual authoritative style advising her to examine her own conscience and to consider whether her opinion was founded in truth or in obstinacy adding that if the parliament opposed his request he should lay the blame upon her strype eccl mem iii     seq  the queen in her answer begged that he would at least defer the matter till he returned into england and that then he might have a better opportunity of judging what attention her reasons deserved that otherwise she should live in jealousy of his affections a state of mind to her worse than death but which to her great disquietude she had already began to feel she observed with many expressions of deference to his superior judgment and authority that whatever her conscience might have determined the matter could not be possibly brought to any speedy conclusion as the duke would be immediately ordered into the field  this letter which is in french and printed by strype strype eccl mem iii append numb lvi  is no less a specimen of her implicit submission to philip than the whole transaction is at the same time an instance of that unconquerable perseverance which the queen exerted on certain occasions philip persisted in his design and with a view to accomplish it more effectually dispatched into england the duchess of parma and the duchess of lorraine whom he commissioned to bring back with them the princess elisabeth into flanders philip was in love with the duchess of lorain and the splendour of her table and retinue which she was unable to support of herself made the queen extremely jealous she was therefore whatever her companion might have been a very improper suitress on this occasion the queen would not permit the two duchesses to visit the princess at hatfield and every moment of their stay gave her infinite uneasiness but they both soon returned without success carte iii       perhaps the growing jealousy of the queen a passion which often ends in revenge against the beloved object might at least have some share in dictating this opposition to philip philip while abroad had shown her so many marks of indifference and had trifled with her so frequently about his return to england that once in a fit of rage she tore his picture carte ibid      at length the remonstrances of the queen and the repeated disapprobation of the princess prevailed and it is certain whatever marys real motives might be that the proposal was suddenly laid aside but mary so far concurred with philips measures as the next year to declare war

reason for elisabeths obstinate perseverance in a state of virginity  the four last years of queen marys reign which the princess elisabeth passed at hatfield with sir thomas pope were by far the most agreeable part of her time during that turbulent period for although she must have been often disquieted with many secret fears and apprehensions yet she was here perfectly at liberty and treated with a regard due to her birth and expectations in the mean time to prevent suspicions she prudently declined interfering in any sort of business and abandoned herself entirely to books and amusements

mary died on november the seventeenth      it does not appear that sir thomas pope was continued in the privy council this circumstance may justly be interpreted to his honor elisabeth to prevent an alarm among the partisans of the catholic communion had prudently retained thirteen of marys privy counselors these were heathe archbishop of york and lord chancellor the marquis of winchester lord treasurer the earls of arundel shrewsbury pembroke and derby the lords clinton and howard sir thomas cheyney sir william petre sir john mason sir richard sackville and doctor wootton dean of york and canterbury burnet reformat ii      but most of these had complied with all the changes which were made in the national religion since the latter end of henrys reign and were such dexterous adepts in the fashionable art of adapting their principles to the variable complexion of the times that they were still employed in every new revolution  sect iv we have now done with sir thomas popes political character and are entering on that most memorable circumstance of his life before incidentally mentioned by which he secured immortality to his name and conferred a perpetual emolument on his country i mean the foundation of trinity college in oxford his good sense and good disposition led him to reflect that he could not bestow a competent proportion of those riches which he had so largely received with greater propriety utility and generosity than in the service of the public i shall therefore make no apology for delivering at large a history of his proceedings in forming and completing this liberal design  and perhaps there are some of my readers who will be more pleased to view him in the milder and more amiable light of the father of ingenuous education dispensing rewards to science and virtue than in the more active yet turbulent scenes of public life diversified only by the vain vicissitudes of human affairs or fraught with the crimes and misfortunes of mankind  about the year    0 richard de hoton prior and the monks of the cathedral convent of durham erected a college in the northern suburbs of oxford for the education of the novices of their

further appear how much these encouragements were now wanted it will be necessry to look backwards upon the state of learning in england particularly at oxford and from thence to trace its progress and the causes of its decline down to the times with which we are concerned an enquiry not less instructive than entertaining and naturally connected with the present subject  about the close of the fifteenth century a taste for polite letters under the patronage of the popes began to be revived in italy but these liberal pontiffs did not consider at the same time that they were undermining the papal interest and bringing on the reformation this event is commonly called the restoration of learning but it should rather be styled the restoration of good sense and useful knowledge learning there had been before but barbarism still remained the most acute efforts of human wit and penetration had been exerted for some centuries in the dissertations of logicians and theologists yet europe still remained in a state of superstition and ignorance what philosophy could not perform was reserved to be completed by classical literature by the poets and orators of greece and rome who alone could enlarge the mind and polish the manners taste and propriety and a rectitude of thinking and judging derived from these sources gave a new turn to the general system of study mankind was civilized and religion was reformed the effects of this happy revolution by degrees reached england  we find at oxford in the latter end of the fifteenth century that the university was filled with the jargon and disputes of the scotists and thomists and if at that time there were any scholars of better note these were chiefly the followers of wicliffe and were consequently discountenanced and persecuted the latin style then only known in the university was the technical language of the schoolmen of casuists and metaphysicians at cambridge about      nothing was taught but alexanders parva

   and that ancient prejudices were subsiding apace and a national taste for critical studies and the graces of composition began to be diffused appears from this circumstance alone that from the year   0  to the reformation within the space of thirty years there were more grammar schools founded and endowed in england than had been for three hundred years before knight ubi supr p  00  near twenty grammar schools were instituted within this period before which most of your youth were educated at the monasteries it is not to be doubted that william of wykehams ample foundation at winchester formed on a plan perfectly original and that of henry vi at eton its transcript were very conducive although distant instruments in preparing and facilitating this great work and indeed long before the period at which we began william of wainflete sensible of the expediency of grammar learning had founded two considerable schools  john leland or leilont taught grammar in peckwaterinn at oxford of which he was principal about the reign of henry vi he wrote a grammar which i have seen in the black letter entitled grammatica nova prefixed are some recommendatory epigrams  carmeliani poctae one of these is entitled  in reverendum dominum gulielmum episcopun wintoniensem that is william of waynflete it is closed with this distich hoc opus auctor enim te persuadente joannes edidit etc   whence it appears that john leland the author wrote this grammar by the advice and encouragement of william of waynflete probably while the latter was master of winchester school as leland died in the year          in      that wise prelate and bountiful patron richard fox founded his college statut c c c oxon dat jun xx      cap xx fol    bibl bodl mss laud i    at oxford in which he constituted with competent salaries two lectures for the latin and greek languages beside a third in theology  this was a new and noble departure from the narrow plan of academical education it is not however to be forgotten here that at the foundation of christs college in cambridge a lecturer was established who together with logic and philosophy is ordered to read vel ex poetarum vel oratorum operibus cap xxxvii these statutes were given in the year   0  in the statutes of kings at cambridge and new college at oxford both much more ancient an instructor is appointed by the general name of informater

barbarism from the new college lector seu professor artium humaniorum barbariem e nostro alveario extirpet  and at the same time it is to be remarked that fox does not appoint a philosophylecturer in his college as had been the practice in most of the previous foundations perhaps thinking that such an institution would not have coincided with his new system of doctrine and that it would be encouraging that species of science which had hitherto blinded mens understandings and kept them so long in ignorance of more useful knowledge the greek lecturer is ordered to explain the best greek classics and those which the judicious founder who seems to have consulted the most capital scholars of his age prescribes on this occasion are the purest and such as are most esteemed at this day  these happy beginnings were seconded by the munificence of cardinal wolsed about the year      he founded a public chair at oxford for rhetoric and humanity and soon afterward another for the greek tongue endowing both with ample stipends wood hist antiq univ oxon i          but these innovations in the plan of study were greatly discouraged and opposed by the scholastic bigots who called the greek language heresy even bishop fox when he founded the greek lecture abovementioned was obliged to cover his excellent institution under the venerable mantle of the authority of the church lest she should seem to countenance a dangerous novelty for he gives it as a reason or rather as an apology for this new lectureship that the sacred canons had commanded that a knowledge of the greek tongue should not be wanting in public seminaries of education quem praeterea in nostro alveario collocavimus quod sacrosancti canones commodissime pro bonis literis et imprimis christianis instituerunt ac

but encouraged erasm epist ccclxxx ut inf  soon afterward one of the kings chaplains preaching at court took an opportunity to censure the new but genuine interpretations of scripture which the

opposed and sir thomas more defended the use and excellence of the greek tongue the divine instead of answering to the purpose fell upon his knees and begged pardon for having given any offense in the

length ancient absurdities universally gave way to these encouragements and at oxford in particular these united efforts for establishing a new system of rational and manly learning were finally consummated in the magnificent foundation of wolseys college to which all the learned of europe were invited  but these auspicious improvements in the state of learning did not continue long a change of the national religion soon happened and disputes with the lutherans ensued which embroiling the minds of learned men in difference of opinion disunited their endeavors in the cause of literature and diverted their attention to other enquiries  many of the abuses in civil society are attended with some advantages in the beginnings of reformation the loss of these advantages is always felt very sensibly while the benefit resulting from the change is the slow effect of time and not immediately percieved or enjoyed scarce any institution can be imagined less favorable to the interests of mankind than the monastic yet a great temporary check given to the progress of literature at this period was the dissolution of the monasteries for although these seminaries were in general the nurseries of illiterate indolence and undoubtedly deserved to be destroyed yet the still contained invitations and opportunities to studious leisure and literary pursuits on this important event therefore a visible revolution and decline in the state of learning succeeded most of the youth of the kingdom betook themselves to mechanical or other illiberal employments the profession of letters being now supposed to be without support and reward by the abolition of the religious houses many towns and their adjacent villages were utterly deprived of their only means of instruction what was taught in the monasteries was perhaps of no great importance but still it served to keep up a certain degree of necessary knowledge hence provincial ignorance became almost universally established  nor should we forget that several of the abbots were persons of public spirit by their connection with parliament they became acquainted with the world and knowing where and how to choose proper objects and having no other use for the superfluity of their vast revenues encouraged in their respective circles many learned young men  it is generally thought that the reformation of religion the most happy and important event of modern times was immediately succeeded by a flourishing state of learning but this in england at least was by no means the case and for a long time afterward an effect quite contrary was produced yet in      the kings visitors ordered lectures in humanity to be founded in those societies at oxford where they were yet wanting and these injunctions were so warmly seconded and approved by the scholars in the largest colleges that they seized on the venerable volumes of duns scotus and other irrefragable logicians and tearing them in pieces dispersed them in great triumph about their quadrangles or gave them away as useless lumber see dr laytons letter to cromwell strypes eccl mem i   0  the king himself also established some public lectures with large

foundations without all these favors although they did not perhaps produce an immediate improvement the university would still have continued to decay and they were at least a balance at that time on the side of learning against the pernicious effects of returning popery  in the beginning of the reign of elisabeth which soon followed when protestantism might have been expected to produce a speedy change for the better puritanism began to prevail and for some time continued to retard the progress of ingenuous and useful knowledge the english reformed clergy who during the persecutions of queen mary had fled into germany now returned in great numbers and in consideration of their sufferings and learning many of them were preferred to eminent stations in the church they brought back with them those narrow principles about church government and ceremonies which they had imbibed and which did well enough in the petty states and republics abroad where they lived like a society of philosophers but which were inconsistent with the genius of a more extended church established in a great and magnificent nation and requiring a settled system of policy and the observance of external institutions however they were judged proper instruments to be employed at the head of ecclesiastical affairs by way of making the reformation at once effectual but unluckily this measure specious as it appeared at first tended to draw the church into the contrary extreme in the mean time their reluctance or absolute refusal to conform in many instances to the established ceremonies and their speculative theology tore the church into violent divisions and occasioned endless absurd disputes unfavorable to the progress of real learning and productive of an illiterate clergy at least unskilled in liberal and manly science  in fact even the common ecclesiastical preferments had been so much diminished by the seizure and alienation of impropriations in the late depredations of the church which were not yet ended that few persons were regularly bred to the church or in other words received a learned education hence almost any that offered themselves were without distinction admitted to the sacred function insomuch that in    0 an injunction was directed to the bishop of london from his metropolitan ordering him to forbear ordaining any more artificers and other unlearned persons who had exercised secular occupations strypes life of grindal b i chapter   page  0  but as the evil was unavoidable this caution took but little effect about the year      there were only two divines the dean of christ church and the president of magdalene college who were capable of preaching the public sermons at oxford wood ut supr i      many proofs have been mentioned of the extreme ignorance of our clergy at this time to which i shall add one which is curious and new in    0 horn bishop of winchester enjoined the minor canons of his cathedral to get by memory every week one chapter of saint pauls epistles in latin and this task beneath the abilities of an ordinary schoolboy was actually repeated by some of them before the bishop dean and prebendaries at a public episcopal visitation of that church registr horn episcop winton sol  0 b   the taste for latin composition and it was fashionable both to write and speak in that language was much worse than in the reign of henry the eighth when juster models were studied one is surprised to find the learned archbishop grindal in the statutes of a school which he founded and amply endowed prescribing such strange classics as palingenius sedulius and prudentius to be taught in the new seminary strypes life of grindal b ii chapter    page     this was ad       much has been said about the passion for reading greek which prevailed in this reign but this affectation was confined to the queen and a few others and here it went no farther than ostentation and pedantry it was by no means the national study nor do we find that it improved the taste or influenced the writings of that age but i am wandering beyond the bounds which i first prescribed to this necessary digression  yet i must add an observation or two in government many shocks must happen before the constitution is perfected in like manner it was late in the reign of elisabeth before learning after its sinews had been relaxed by frequent changes and commotions recovered its proper tone and rose with new vigor under the genial influence of the protestant religion and it may be further remarked that as all novelties are pursued to excess and the most beneficial improvements often introduce new inconveniences so this influx of polite literature destroyed philosophy on this account sir henry savile in the reign of james the first established professors at oxford for astronomy and geometry because as he declares in the preamble of his statutes mathematical studies had been totally deserted and were then almost unknown in england see rym foed xvii     it is observable that he entirely interdicted the teaching of judicial astrology to his professor of astronomy statut savil cap ii these statutes are dated aug          logic indeed

of the university of oxford for an account of poles visitation of the university i will here add an anecdote relating to that transaction not mentioned by wood the cardinal finding saint marys college where erasmus had studied but which had been dissolved as a seminary for various monasteries of augustine canons although very ruinous a place which might be made convenient for the reception of students ordered it to be repaired and fitted up for that purpose sept         accordingly a principal was appointed to it yet on condition that he should resign his office in case the cardinal should

the family of archbishop parker who not more on account of his former dignity than of his learning candor and affability treated him with due respect and humanity goodwyn ubi supr  white bishop of winchester became the first visitor of trinity college in oxford it is reasonable to suppose that sir thomas popes real motive for appointing the bishops of winchester to be visitors of his college originated from gardener who was the bishop of winchester when the foundation was projected and who moreover had been governor of a college at cambridge was now chancellor of that university a learned civilian a scholar of the first rank an eminent patron of literature gardiners literary character has been commonly overlooked in his political and is rarely regarded or acknowledged he was admirably skilled in the greek language at a time when it was cultivated in england only by a few neglected scholars his ideas of pure latinity were refined to a fault and he carried his notions of the chaste roman phraseology to such a nicety as to be esteemed a ciceronian by his cotemporaries leland the most polite classical writer in england at that period congratulates some of his elegant friends on their being educated in the college over which gardener presided at cambridge and which under such a governor had become the seat of eloquence and of the choir of the muses leland also characterises gardener by the epithet disertus or the master of genuine latinity and calls him the restorer of classical composition and the study of philology at cambridge excom p  00 edit      leland paid these compliments before gardener was a bishop and when there were no temptations to flattery many of aschams terse latin epistles are addressed to this prelate in which his distinguished learning his solicitude for the revival of ancient letters and his general patronage are repeatedly displayed in the highest yet unaffected terms of panegyric in one of these ascham expresses his great satisfaction that gardener who excells all others in critical discernment had so warmly approved his toxophilus then just published and written with a view to teach a just english style and desires that the bishop pro eo amore quo literas et earum cultores unice amplecteris would recommend that book to the king lib ii p    b edit      in another he thanks the bishop for honoring him with so many marks of notice and attention when he came an unknown and obscure academic to court he recommends a tutor to the duke of norfolks nephew and wishes that gardener who is so eminent a judge and protector of literary merit would ratify the choice ibid p    a in a third lamenting the untimely death of king edward the sixth he petitions gardener among other requests to intercede with queen mary for the continuance of his pension originally granted by king henry the eighth as a reward for his toxophilus professing his confidence in the bishops known erudition authority liberality prudence and activity to quiet the distractions which not only the civil but literary state of the kingdom would probably suffer from that unexpected and calamitous event ibid p     b dat      in the next he presents the bishop then just released from imprisonment in the tower at the accession of mary with a greek translation of the psalms probably the metaphrase of apollinarius enforcing the propriety of his present by observing that it was written in a language in which the bishop so much delighted and that poetry had been his chief amusement during the tedious hours of his late confinement ibid p     b see also p    a with the next dated      as a slender remembrance of the numerous favors he had recently received he sends the bishop an ancient golden roman coin ibid p     a in three or four others evidently written during the reign of mary he complains of many unjust taxations and oppressive exactions imposed by some late innovators on the university of cambridge supplicating the assistance of gardener as their chancellor and expatiating largely on his accustomed indefatigable endeavors to support the rights and promote the honor of the university ibid p     b seq in another letter to one of margaret ropers learned daughters dated      ascham speaks of being called from cambridge by the special favor and appointment of bishop gardener to serve the queen in the very liberal office of latin secretary ibid p     b in a letter to the learned sturmius dated at greenwich      he declares i would not exchange the office of latin secretary for any situation in life bishop gardener has treated me with the greatest kindness and indulgence in this affair and i can hardly say whether lord pagett has shown more readiness in naming me to the queen or the bishop in pleading my cause and recommending my character there are some who have endeavored to stop the course of the bishops benevolence on account of my religious principles but without effect i therefore am deeply indebted to his humanity and it is a debt which i willingly owe i am indeed but one among many who have experienced his generosity i have often thought of talking to him about your noble work of the analytics for i well know his predilection to polite letters and think his patronage would be of service on this occasion etc ibid p    b seq it appears also that gardener procured from queen

tyttenhanger or clerkenwell as i collect from a letter from the founder to the vice president dat    jan      in which he says that he shall send by the president an altered and improved copy of his statutes which he had ordered to be forthwith engrossed in parchment in another letter to the president dat    feb      the founder tells him i trust ye will not forget to make an index capitulorum statutorum which we forgott when we were together in this copy corrected by slythurstes hand london the place from which they were originally dated is struck out for tyttenhanger the altered and improved copy mentioned above engrossed on parchment and signed with his own hand throughout with the additament annexed appears to have been delivered to the society but with the original date of      preserved in or soon after april      see his letter append numb xxv under john perte  and regulating other articles of his young society and sometimes relate to the domestic concerns of his own family i find him frequently visiting the founder at clerkenwell and tyttenhanger the sudden revolution however of religion at the accession of queen elizabeth prevents us from knowing much more of his chaaracter and behavior in this situation for in september      he was ejected from his headship by the queens visitors and committed a prisoner to the tower of london where he died of grief    0 partly for the death of his honored friend and munificent patron the founder and partly for the loss of his preferments  sect viii an anecdote equally ridiculous and scandalous has been propagated by antony wood highly injurious to the honor of sir thomas pope which notwithstanding it appears at first sight strongly to confute itself i shall here examine and disprove although possessed of the proper information and evidence i had long ago and for many reasons resolved never to enter into a particular discussion of this idle calumny but as since the appearance of my first edition of this work it has been circulated both in conversation and by more biographers than one as a pleasant ancedote i could no longer forbear using the means in my power of exposing its falsity and futility it originated from henry cuffe the famous secretary of the unfortunate earl of essex who was executed soon after his master in   0   cuffe being a boy of the most promising abilities and uncommon proficiency in literature was sent at fifteen years of age by lady elizabeth powlett often mentioned above from hinton saint george in somersetshire to trinity college in oxford where he was elected scholar on the twentyfifth of may      registr prim fol    b  within five years he was admitted fellow may  0      ibid fol     but even in this situation the same discontented and arrogant spirit which afterward hurried him to an ignominious end could not be suppressed soon after his admission when he was now not more than twenty years of age and in the year of his probation he endeavored to defame his founder by a false insinuation which savored alike of petulance and ingratitude and which had it been true deserved animadversion the matter being reported to lady powlett the foundress she transmitted a mandate to the college ordering him to be instantly removed from his fellowship this we learn from the words of the college register  resignante cuffo et locum litteris fundatricis dante ibid fol    b  the cause of his amotion is twice mentioned by the oxford antiquary in the athenae he says that cuffe was forced to resign his fellowship of trinity college for speaking certain matters though true which redounded to the great discredit of the founder athen oxon vol i col  0  edit    in another place however he tells the whole story without reserve and produces his authority doctor bathurst told me that our cuffe was of trinity college and expelled from thence upon this account the founder sir thomas pope would whersoever he he went visiting his friend steal one thing or other he could lay his hands on put it in his pocket or under his gown this was supposed rather an humor than of dishonesty now cuffe upon a time with his fellows being merry said a pox this is a poor beggarly college indeed the plate that our founder stole would build such another which coming to the presidents ears he was thereupon ejected see hearnes lib nig scac p      the reader must have already noticed the glaring inconsistency of these two curious narratives in the first sir thomas pope is by implication at least represented as a thief in the next his dishonesty is softened into humor and jocularity that the whole is a misrepresentation and a jumble of circumstances appears from an original paper in the handwriting of doctor bathurst secretary cuffe was expelled from a fellowship of trinity college on this account our founder when upon a visit would often carry away a silver cup under his gown for the jokesake sending it back the next day to laugh at his friend cuffe being merry at another college with some of his boon companions said a pox this is a beggarlie college indeed the plate that our founder stole would build another as good these words being told to the president he was ejected this i have often heard from my predecessor doctor president kettell who was contemporarie with cuffe bathurst papers mss in the possession of the late mr pain canon of wells  in the margin bathurst has recorded the name of the other college which cuffe was pleased to treat in such terms of contempt and which needs not here to be mentioned indeed it was no part of the accusation against cuffe that as woods context insinuates his pleasantry led him to depreciate the buildings of his founder but that he wantonly converted one of his practical jokes a species of humor not uncommon among our festive ancestors into a petty larceny on the whole we now perceive that wood has inaccurately related this story from a casual conversation with bathurst which he remembered as imperfectly as to cuffe i know not whether he still continued at oxford after this ejection but having great address and much real merit about three years afterward that is in the year      he was chosen fellow of merton college being an admirable grecian he was about the same time made professor of greek in the university it was in this department that he assisted columbanius in the first edition of longuss elegant pastoral romance which was printed at florence in      coll mss t hearne vol xiii p     columbanius says in the dedication p ii qua in re operam mihi suam non ingratam iliam quidem navarunt viri omnium literatissimi atque officiosissimi herricus cuffus anglus etc  he was no less eminent as a logician and a disputant his intimate friend camden to whose britannia at its first appearance he prefixed an excellent greek epigram characterizes cuffe as a man of exquisite learning and genius but of a factious and perverse temper camd eliz p     edit hearn  notwithstanding the severe check he received at trinity college he generously presented to the library there several volumes perhaps some readers will be candid enough to think that his expulsion from this society was rather owing to an unguarded vivacity of disposition than to any malignity of mind our historians say that the earl of essex who began after a tedious confinement to feel the dangers of his situation dismissed cuffe from his service and family for turbulence and insolence camden ubi supr p          essex was unfortunate in not having before perceived these qualities in a man who shared so much of his confidence  sect ix from a recapitulation of what has been said the following character of sir thomas pope arises he appears to have been a man eminently qualified for business and although not employed in the very principal departments of state he possessed peculiar talents and address for the management and execution of public affairs his natural abilities were strong his knowledge of the world deep and extensive his judgment solid and discerning his circumspection and prudence in the conduct of negociations entrusted to his charge were equalled by his fidelity and perseverance he is a conspicuous instance of one not bred to the church who without the advantages of birth and patrimony by the force of understanding and industry raised himself to opulence and honorable employments he lived in an age when the peculiar circumstances of the times afforded obvious temptations to the most abject desertion of principle and few periods of our history can be found which exhibit more numerous examples of occasional compliance with frequent changes yet he remained unbiassed and uncorrupted amid the general depravity under henry the eighth when on the dissolution of the monasteries he was enabled by the opportunities of his situation to enrich himself with their revenues by fraudulent or oppressive practices he behaved with disinterested integrity nor does a single instance occur upon record which impeaches his honor in the succeeding reign of edward the sixth a sudden check was given to his career of popularity and prosperity he retained his original attachment to the catholic religion and on that account lost those marks of favor or distinction which were so liberally dispensed to the sycophants of somerset and which he might have easily secured by a temporary submission to the reigning system at the accession of mary he was restored to favor yet he was never instrumental or active in the tyrannies of that queen which disgrace our annals he was armed with discretionary powers for the suppression of heretical innovations yet he forbore to gratify the arbitrary demands of his bigoted mistress to their utmost extent nor would he participate in forwarding the barbarities of her bloody persecutions in the guardianship of the princess elizabeth the unhappy victim of united superstition jealousy revenge and cruelty his humanity prevailed over his interest and he less regarded the displeasure of the vigilant and unforgiving queen than the claims of injured innocence if it be his crime to have accumulated riches let it be remembered that he consecrated a part of those riches not amid the terrors of a deathbed nor in the dreams of old age but in the prime of life and the vigor of understanding to the public service of his country that he gave them to future generations for the perpetual support of literature and religion  finis appendix containing original evidences and papers never before printed  contents of the appendix

practitioners properly qualified to assist at the solemnities of the mass under these circumstances in order to facilitate and secure so precarious an acquisition sir thomas pope found it necessary to provide in his statutes that there should be constantly one person admitted into the society competently skilled in music who might be able to execute the office of organist to the college that this

stipends of singingmen who are commonly great drunkards buffoons and chosen from the lowest of the people these fooleries are become so agreeable that the monks especially in england think of nothing else to this end even in the benedictine monasteries of england many youths boys and other vocal performers are sustained who early every morning sing to the organ the mass of the virgin mary with the

0   thus by the death of male issue and marriage of the female this family and name at least in this branch became extinct soon after the restoration of charles the second  for from what is here collected on this subject it must appear that our great poet alexander pope was related to this family only by some collateral branch i have mentioned all the male issue and their marriages except the marriages of john and william two younger sons of sir william pope knight of cogges both which i suspect died young but if ever married either of them may reasonably be supposed rather too young the eldest of them john was born nov        if it can be proved that he was the father of the elder alexander pope it will follow that thomas pope second earl of down was his uncle and consequently that sir thomas pope the founder of trinity college was the poets uncle to a high degree it may perhaps be trifling to mention that alexander pope occurs twice as a name in this family in and about temp edw iii  mss pedigr penes honoratiss com de guildford to have been the father of the elder alexander pope who was born      ex epitaphio  besides had the poet been descended from either of these two younger sons the title of earl of down could not have failed during his own and his fathers lifetime mr pope tells us that his father alexander was of a gentlemans family in oxfordshire the head of which was the earl of down whose sole heiress married the earl of lindsey his mother was the daughter of w turnor of york she had three brothers one of whom was killed anothes died in the service of

following lines of gentle blood part shed in honors cause while yet in britain honor had applause each parent sprung warb pope iv    ed         and on the whole from my researches on this head i am
