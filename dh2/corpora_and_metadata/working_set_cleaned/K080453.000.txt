the life of hugh latimer bishop of worcester section i hugh latimer was born at thirkesson in leicestershire about the year    0 his father was a yeoman of good reputation had no land of his own but rented a small farm on which in those frugal times he maintained a large family six daughters and a son mr larimer in one of his court sermons in king edwards time inveighing against the oppression then exercised in the country by the nobility and gentry and speaking of the moderation of landlords a few years before and the plenty in which their tenants lived tells his audience in his familiar way that upon a farm of four pounds a year at the utmost his father tilled as much ground as kept half a dozen men that he had it stocked with an hundred sheep and thirty cows that he found the king a man and horse himself remembering to have buckled on his fathers harness when he went to black heath that he gave his daughters five pounds apiece at marriage that he lived hospitably among his neighbors and was not backward in his alms to the poor  an entertaining picture of an old english yeoman  we meet with nothing about mr latimer worth relating till we find him a master of arts in priests orders at cambridge here his youth had been wholly employed on the divinity of the times he read the schoolmen and the scriptures with the same reverence and held thomas a becket and the apostles in equal honor in a word he was a zealous papist  many of the reformed opinions which were then fermenting in germany had by this time discovered themselves in england the legistature had not yet interfered but the watchful priests had taken the alarm and the danger of the church was already become the popular cry mr latimer among others heard with high indignation these novel teachers zeal wrought the same effect in him that interest did in the many and while others were apprehensive that their temporals might be in danger he was concerned for the souls of men the last times he thought were now approaching impiety was gaining ground apace what lengths might not men be expected to run when they began to question even the infallibility of the pope  as his wellmeant zeal was thus inflamed it of course broke out into all the effects of bigotry he inveighed publicly and privately against the reformers if any read lectures in the schools suspected of their tenets mr latimer was sure to be there to drive out the scholars and having an opportunity when he commenced bachelor of divinity to give an open testimony of his dislike to their proceedings he made an oration against melancthon whom he treated with great severity for his impious innovations in religion his zeal was so much taken notice of in the university that he was elected into the office of crossbearer in all public processions an employment which he accepted with reverence and discharged with becoming solemnity  among those in cambridge who at this time favored the reformation the most considerable was thomas bilney he was a man of a most holy life and having long observed the scandalous state of monkery in the nation and the prevailing debauchery of the clergy he was led to doubt whether their principles might not be as corrupt as their practice and whether the new opinions then gaining ground might not be more than plausible time increased his suspicions he read luthers writings and approved them he conversed with protestants and found them men of temper and learning he talked with papists and observed a bitterness and rancour in their style which ill became a good causs in few words he began to see popery in a very disagreeable light and made no scruple to own it  it was mr latimers good fortune to be well acquainted with this religious person mr bilney had long indeed conceived very favorable sentiments of him he had known his life in the university a life strictly moral and devout he ascribed his failings to the genius of his religion and notwithstanding his more than ordinary zeal in the profession of that religion he could not but observe in him a very candid temper prejudiced by no finister views and an honesty of heart which gave him great hopes of his reformation  induced by these favorable appearances mr bilney failed not as opportunities offered to suggest many things to him about corruptions in religion and would frequently drop a hint that in the romish church in particular there were perhaps some things which rather deviated from apostolic plainness he would instance some of it is grosser tenets and ask whether the scriptural authority alleged for them was wholly sufficient if not whether tradition were a safe vehicle for doctrines of such importance thus starting cavils and infusing suspicions he prepared the way for his whole creed which at length he opened concluding with an earnest persuasion that mr latimer would only endeavor to divest himself of his prejudices and place the two sides of the question before him with an honest heart for his guide  how mr latimer at first received these free declarations and by what steps he attained a settlement in his religious opinions i meet with no account this only i find in general that mr bilneys friendship toward him had its effect  mr latimer no sooner ceased from being a zealous papist than he became such was his constitutional warmth a zealous protestant he had nothing of that neutral coolness in his temper which the athenian lawgiver discouraged in a commonwealth accordingly we soon find him very active in supporting and propagating the reformed opinions he endeavored with great assiduity to make converts both in the town and in the university preaching in public exhorting in private and every where pressing the necessity of a holy life in opposition to those outward performances which were then thought the essentials of religion  a behavior of this kind was immediately taken notice of cambridge was then the seat of ignorance bigotry and superstition every new opinion was watched with the utmost jealousy and mr latimer soon perceived how obnoxious he had already made himself  the first remarkable opposition he met with from the popish party was occasioned by a course of sermons he preached during the holidays of christmas before the university in which he spoke his sentiments with great freedom upon many opinions and usages maintained and practiced in the romish church in these sermons he showed the impiety of indulgences the uncertainty of tradition and the vanity of works of supererrogation he inveighed against that multiplicity of ceremonies with which true religion was incumbered and the pride and usurpation of the romish hierarchy but what he most insisted upon was that great abuse of locking up the scripture in an unknown tongue giving his reasons without any reserve why it ought to be put in every ones hands  few of the tenets of popery were then questioned in england but such as tended to a relaxation of morals transubstantiation and other points rather speculative still held their dominion mr latimer therefore chiefly dwelt upon those of immoral tendency he showed what true religion was that it was seated in the heart and that in companison with it external appointments were of no value  great was the outcry occasioned by these discourses mr latimer was then a preacher of some eminence and began to display a remarkable address in adapting himself to the capacities of the people the orthodox clergy observing him thus followed thought it high time to oppose him openly this task was undertaken by dr buckenham prior of the black friars who appeared in the pulpit a few sundays after and with great pomp and prolixity showed the dangerous tendency of mr latimers opinions particularly he inveighed against his heretical notions of having the scriptures in english laying open the ill effects of such an innovation if that heresy said he should prevail we should soon see an end of every thing useful among us the ploughman reading that if he put his hand to the plough and should happen to look back he was unfit for the kingdom of god would soon lay aside his labor the baker likewise reading that a little leaven will corrupt his lump would give us very insipid bread the simple man likewise finding himself commanded to pluck out his eyes in a few years we should have the nation full of blind beggars  mr latimer could not help listening with a secret pleasure to this ingenious reasoning perhaps he had acted as prudently if he had considered the priors arguments as unanswerable but he could not resist the vivacity of his temper which strongly inclined him to expose this solemn trifler  the whole university met together on sunday when it was known mr latimer would preach that vein of pleasantry and humor which ran through all his words and actions would have here it was imagined full scope and to say the truth the preacher was not a little conscious of his own superiority to complete the scene just before the sermon began prior buckenham himself entered the church with his coul about his shoulders and seated himself with an air of importance before the pulpit  mr latimer with great gravity recapitulated the learned doctors arguments placed them in the strongest light and then rallied them with such a flow of wit and at the same time with so much good humor that without the appearance of ill nature he made his adversary in the highest degree ridiculous he then with great address appealed to the people descanted upon the low esteem in which their holy guides had always held their understandings expressed the utmost offense at their being treated with such contempt and wished his honest countrymen might only have the use of the scripture till they showed themselves such absurd interpreters he concluded his discourse with a few observations upon scripturemetaphors a figurative manner of speech he said was common in all languages representations of this kind were in daily use and generally understood thus for instance said he addressing himself to that part of the audience where the prior was seated when we see a fox painted preaching in a friers hood nobody imagines that a fox is meant but that craft and hypocrisy are described which are so often found disguised in that garb  thus was a wise man led away by the impulses of vanity and highly delighted with the little glory of having made a dunce ridiculous  but it is probable mr latimer thought this levity unbecoming for when one venetus a foreigner not long after attacked him again upon the same subject and in manner the most scurrilous and provoking we find him using a graver strain he answers like a scholar what is worth answering and like a man of sense leaves the absurd part to confute itself whether he ridiculed however or reasoned with so much of the spirit of true oratory considering the times were his harangues animated that they seldom failed of their intended effect his raillery shut up the prior within his monastery and his arguments drove venetus from the university  these advantages increased the credit of the protestant party in cambridge of which bilney and latimer were at the head the meekness gravity and unaffected piety of the former and the cheerfulness good humor and eloquence of the latter wrought much upon the junior students  these things greatly alarmed the orthodox clergy of this sort were all the heads of colleges and indeed the senior part of the university frequent convocations were held tutors were admonished to have a strict eye over their pupils and academical censures of all kinds were inflicted  but academical censures were found insufficient mr latimer continued to preach and heresy to spread the true spirit of popery therefore began to exert itself and to call aloud for the secular arm  dr west was at that time bishop of ely to him as their diocesan the heads of the popish party applied but the bishop was not a man for their purpose he was a papist indeed but moderate he came to cambridge however examined the state of religion and at their entreaty preached against heretics but he would do nothing farther only indeed he silenced mr latimer which as he had preached himself was an instance of his prudence  this gave no great check to the reformers there happened at that time to be a protestant prior in cambridge dr barnes of the austin friars his monastery was exempt from episcopal jurisdiction and being a great admirer of mr latimer he boldly licenced him to preach there hither his party followed him and the late opposition having greatly excited the curiosity of the people the friars chapel was soon unable to contain the crowds that attended among others it is remarkable that the bishop of ely was often one of his hearers and had the ingenuity to declare that mr latimer was one of the best preachers he had ever heard  the credit to his cause which mr latimer had thus gained by preaching he maintained by a holy life mr bilney and he did not satisfy themselves with acting unexceptionably but were daily giving instances of goodness which malice could not scandalize nor envy misinterpret they were always together concerting their schemes the place where they used to walk was long afterward known by the name of the heretics hill cambridge at the time was full of their good actions their charities to the poor and friendly visits to the sick and unhappy were then common topics  but their good lives had no merit with their adversaries with them it mattered not what a mans life was if his opinions were orthodox they could give great allowances for the former but the least mistake in the latter was unpardonable such is the true spirit of bigotry and priestcraft that pharisaical spirit which inverting the tables of the law places points of least importance uppermost  more of this spirit never reigned than at this time in cambridge the popish party among whom every spark of charity seemed extinguished were now inflamed to the uttermost the good actions of their adversaries served only as fuel to increase the heat of persecution impotent themselves and finding their diocesan either unable or unwilling to work their purposes they determined at length upon an appeal to the higher powers here at least they expected countenance heavy complaints were accordingly carried to court of the increase of heresy and formal depositions against the principal abettors of it  but as a new scene will here open and different characters make their appearance it will be necessary to give some account of the times and of the most considerable persons then in action  section ii protestantism which was now spreading itself apace in germany and many other parts of europe had yet met with no public countenance in england there superstition still held its reign the regular clergy encroaching more and more had at length engrossed one third of the kingdom a large share of temporal power was the consequence of this wealth and the gross ignorance of the times established them as fully in a spiritual dominion from the days of wicliff who flourished in the reign of richard the second many began to speak with some freedom and to think with more of the prevailing corruptions of popery but severe laws purchased of needy kings and executed by cruel priests held these sectaries in awe the inclinations of the people however through this whole period of time ran strong against the clergy and luther was more than a little obliged to wicliff for his reception in england  as soon therefore as the opinions of the reformers were introduced they were warmly espoused the generality of the people were disposed for them and protestants in many places began to form parties but in those intolerant times when kings thought it incumbent upon them to think for their subjects private opinion and the inclinations of the people were little consulted reasons of state prevailed and henry the eighth who then reigned in england had yet his motives for holding fair with the court of rome  the great cause which at this time held the nation attentive was the kings divorce a suit of law one of the most famous in history after cohabiting near twenty years with his brothers wife this religious prince was suddenly seized upon the appearance of ann boleyn at court with scruples of conscience about the legality of his marriage and not only schoolmen and canonists but kings popes and emperors were interested in this affair  at that time one of the most wily prelates held the sea of rome he had interests to manage with charles the fifth who was averse to the divorce he had interests likewise to manage with henry these cross circumstances called for all his subtility and indeed he showed himself a master of address he amused each in his turn and meant honestly to neither perplexing affairs palliating explaining and perplexing again that he might thouroughly deliberate before he chose his party the emperor in the mean time was thoroughly satisfied with his conduct and henry thought him tardy indeed but still never doubted his disposition to serve him a legantine court was erected in england and the affair went on with all the dispatch that two solemn cardinals could make  while the king thus expected an end of his business in a regular way which of all things he desired he was careful in observing all forms of civility with the pope the poor protestants in many instances felt the effects of his complaisance he even went so far as to use his own princely pen against them and as the courtiers of his time used to say wrote incomparably well no new laws indeed were enacted the old ones against wicliffs heresy were thought sufficient these statutes were revived and the bishops in several parts of the kingdom took very effectual pains to make those under their care acquainted with them  the principal persons at this time concerned in ecclesiastical affairs were cardinal woolsey warham archbishop of canterbury and tunstal bishop of london  woolsey had certainly as few virtues to qualify as many vices as most men abilities indeed he had the abilities of a statesman but his chief merit was a very artful application to his masters foibles and the address to make himself thought useful he could condescend even to serve his pleasures where his princes humors did not interfere the principal springs of his conduct were ambition pride and avarice all which vices he found the means to gratify in a manner unparalleled in english story it was humourously said he held the church of england in commendam as to matters of faith he was easy and was therefore indeed no zealot in practice he scarce observed decency yet he was a great advocate for the reformation of the clergy and contributed every way toward it but by setting a good example he even went so far as to countenance the protestants because he found that the best means of rousing the clergy to a sense of shame  warham was now an old man he had been the favorite of the last reign and was practiced in all the artifices of harry the sevenths policy an able statesman and an artful courtier but he had outlived his capacity for business had withdrawn himself from all court dependencies and led at this time a very retired life indulging a polite indolence among learned men of whom he was a very great patron himself a man of letters the duties of his function he thought consisted chiefly in opposing heretics and the severest kind of opposition he thought the best in other respects he was a good man would have been no disgrace to a better religion and was an ornament to popery  but of all the prelates of those times cuthbert tunstal bishop of london was most deservedly esteemed he was a papist only by profession no way influenced by the spirit of popery but he was a good catholic and had true notions of the genius of christianity he considered a good life as the end and faith as the means and never branded as an heretic that person however erroneous his opinions might be in points less fundamental who had such a belief in christ as made him live like a christian he was just therefore the reverse of warham and thought the persecution of protestants one of the things most foreign to his function for parts and learning he was very eminent his knowledge was extensive and his taste in letters superior to that of most of his contemporaries the great foible of which he stands accused in history was the pliancy of his temper like most of the bishops of those times he had been bred in a court and was indeed too dextrous in the arts there practiced  such was the situation of things and such the persons in power when complaints came from cambridge of the daily increase of heresy tunstal with an air of sanctity shook his head declaring it was shameful indeed very shameful warham raged loud and talked of nothing but fire and extirpation root and branch while the cardinal treated the whole as a jest attributing it to the envy of a few illiterate priests against men of superior merit  but complaints from cambridge increasing daily and warham of course growing more importunate the cardinal was at length obliged to shake off his indifference and begin to act he erected a court therefore consisting of bishops divines and canonists tunstal was made president and bilney latimer and one or two more were called upon to answer for their conduit bilney was considered as the heresiarc and against him chiefly the rigor of the court was levelled his examination was accordingly severe every witness was heard with so much attention and every deposition enlarged upon with so much bitterness that tunstal despaired of mixing any temper with the proceedings of his colleagues the process came to an end and the criminal declaring himself what they called an obstinate heretic was found guilty here tunstal had an opportunity to show the goodness of his heart he could not interfere in mr bilneys favor in a judicial way but he labored to save him by all the means in his power he first set his friends upon him to persuade him to recant and when that would not do he joined his entreaties to theirs had patience with him day after day and with all the tenderness of humanity begged he would not oblige him contrary to his inclinations to treat him with severity the good bishop in the end prevailed bilney could not withstand the winning rhetoric of tunstal though he had withstood all the menaces of the inflamed warham he recanted bore his faggot and was dismissed  as for mr latimer and the rest they had easier terms tunstal omitted no opportunities of showing mercy and was dextrous in finding them though it is probable that among so many voices he would hardly have prevailed if the cardinal had not countenanced his proceedings  the heretics upon their dismission returned to cambridge where they were received with open arms by their friends amidst this mutual joy bilney alone seemed unaffected he shunned the fight of his acquaintance and received their officious congratulations with confusion and blushes reflection had now brought him to himself and remorse of conscience had seized him for what he had done restless nights frightful dreams and other effects of a mind that preys upon itself in a short time disturbed his reason and it was feared he might have committed something horrid if those about him had not closely attended him in the agonies of his despair his pathetic and eager accusations of his friends of the bishop of london and above all of himself were very affecting thus he continued for some time one of the most shocking spectacles that human nature can exhibit his passion having had its course at length subsided and by degrees gave place to a profound melancholy in this state he continued about three years reading much avoiding company and in all respects observing the severity of an ascetic during this time and especially toward the latter part of it he would frequently be throwing out obscure hints of his meditating some extraordinary design he would say that he was now almost prepared  that he would shortly go up to jerusalem  and that god must be glorified in him after keeping his friends awhile in suspense by this mysterious language he told them at last that he was fully determined to expiate his late shameful abjuration by his death what they could oppose had no weight he had taken his resolution and breaking at once from all his attachments in cambridge he set out for norfolk which was the place of his nativity and which for that reason he chose to make the scene of his death when he came there he went about the country confessing his guilt in abjuring a faith in which he was now determined to die popery he told the people was a most diabolical religion and exhorted them to beware of idolatry and to trust no longer in the cowl of st francis in prayers to saints in pilgrimages penances and indulgences but rather to believe in jesus christ and to lead good lives which was all that god required of them  the report of this very extraordinary preacher soon reached the ears of the bishop of norwich who watched over those parts with the zeal of an inquisitor mr bilney was soon apprehended and secured in the countygaol while he lay there waiting the arrival of the writ for his execution he gave very surprising instances of a firm and collected mind he began now to recover from that abject state of melancholy which had for these last three years oppressed him and like an honest man who had long lived under a difficult debt he began to resume his spirits when he thought himself in a situation to discharge it some of his friends found him eating a hearty supper the night before his execution and expressing their surprise he told them he was but doing what they had daily examples of in common life he was only keeping his cottage in repair while he continued to inhabit it the same composure ran through his whole behavior and his conversation was that evening more agreeable than his friends almost ever remembered it he dwelt much upon a passage in isaiah which he said gave him much comfort fear not for i have redeemed thee thou art mine when thou walk in the fire it shall not burn thee i am the lord thy god with equal constancy he went through his last trial his death which mr fox relates at large was as noble an instance of christian courage as those times fruitful of such examples afforded the popish party would have had it afterward believed he died in their faith and great pains were taken by many of them to propagate the story particularly by sir thomas moore whose opinions in religion were as confined as his sentiments upon all other subjects were enlarged but mr fox bishop burnet and others have sufficiently refuted the many idle things which were said upon that occasion  the following account of him mr latimer has left us in a letter to a friend  i have known bilney says he a great while and to tell you what i have always thought of him i have known few so ready to do every man good after his power noisome wittingly to none and toward his enemy charitable and reconcilable to be short he was a very simple good soul nothing meet for this wretched world whose evil state he would lament and bewail as much as any man that i ever knew as for his singular learning as well in the holy scriptures as in other good letters i will not now speak of it how he ordered or misordered himself in judgment i cannot tell nor will i meddle withal but i cannot but wonder if a man living so mercifully so charitably so patiently so continently so studiously and so virtuously should die an evil death  section iii mr bilneys sufferings instead of checking the reformation at cambridge inspired the leaders of it with new courage and illustrated a common observation that persecution is always an unadvised measure in opposing religious innovations mr latimer began now to exert himself more than he had yet done and succeeded to that credit with his party which mr bilney had so long supported among other instances of his zeal and resolution in this cause he gave one which was indeed very remarkable he had the courage to write to the king against a proclamation then just published forbidding the use of the bible in english and other books on religious subjects the affair was this  ever since the reformation had any footing in the kingdom great care had been taken by the promoters of it to propagate among the people a variety of tracts some on the points then in controversy others and the greater part on the corruptions of the clergy these books were printed abroad and sent over in great quantities among other works of this kind a translation of the new testament was dispersed great were the clamours of the orthodox against these malignant and pestiferous writings as they were then called but as the government did not interfere the bishops could only use the authority of the laws then in force in guarding each his diocese from these invasions of heresy episcopal injunctions were accordingly published and all possible care was taken but the laws then in force did not entirely touch the case none of them were particularly pointed against heretical books something more therefore must be obtained from the government  it happened that among other tracts then dispersed there was one written in a warmer language than ordinary it was entitled the supplication of the beggars and contained a very severe invective against the regular clergy whose exorbitant exactions upon the people were there represented as the chief source of all the poverty in the nation this piece roused the whole body of the clergy and the cardinal being at their head a successful application was made to the king who immediately issued out a most severe proclamation against heretical books commanding that all such books should be delivered up within fifteen days and impowering the bishops to imprison at pleasure all persons suspected of having them till the party had purged himself or abjured it empowered the bishops likewise to set an arbitrary fine upon all persons convicted it farther forbad all appeals from ecclesiastical courts and obliged all civil officers by oath to use their utmost endeavors to extirpate heresy and assist the bishops justices were to inquire at their quarterly sessions into the state of religion in their counties and sheriffs were to arrest all suspected persons and deliver them to the bishops  the sword thus put into the hands of the bishops was presently unsheathed the effects of this proclamation and in that reign proclamations had the force of law were indeed very dreadful it would surprise the good people of england at this day to hear that many of their forefathers were then burnt for reading the bible and teaching their children the ten commandments and the lords prayer in english such things were then called heresy  on this occasion mr latimer took upon him to write to the king he had preached before him once or twice at windsor and had been taken notice of by him in a more affable manner than that monarch usually indulged toward his subjects but whatever hopes of preferment his sovereigns favor might have raised in him he chose to put all to the hazard rather than to omit what he thought his duty he was generally considered as one of the most eminent of those who favored protestantism and therefore thought it became him to be one of the most forward in opposing popery his letter is the picture of an honest sincere heart it was chiefly intended to point out to the king the bad intention of the bishops in procuring the proclamation the substance of it is as follows  st augustine in an epistle to casulanus tells us that he who through fear hides the truth provokes the wrath of heaven as a person who fears man more than god and st chrysostom to the same effect gives it as his opinion that a person may betray the truth as well by concealing it as disguising it these sentences great king occurred to me very lately and have had such an effect upon me that i must either open my conscience to your majesty or rank myself among such persons as these two holy fathers censure  the latter i cannot think of  but alas there are men upon whom such severe censures have no effect there are men who pretending to be guides and teachers in religion not only conceal the truth but prohibit others to set it forth blind guides who shut up the kingdom of heaven from men and will neither enter in themselves neither suffer them that would to enter and not content with obstructing the word of god to the utmost of their own authority they have contrived by their subtle practices to draw in to their assistance the civil power in almost all the states of christendom in this nation especially they have long imposed upon their subjects by their delusions and kept them in awe by their spiritual censures and when they saw the truth likely to prevail and gather strength from their opposition they have at length obtained your majestys proclamation in their favor and have got it declared treason to read the scripture in english  hear me i beseech your majesty a few words and let me entreat you to call to mind the example of christ and his apostles their manner of life their preaching and whole behavior that comparing them with the spiritual guides of these days your majesty may the better judge who are the true followers of christ  and first it is evident that simplicity of manners and hearts sequestered from the world were the striking characteristics of the first preachers of the gospel and of our blessed lord himself poverty in spirit was then practiced as well as preached alas it is since those days that christian teachers masking their worldly hearts under a pretense of voluntary poverty and an exclusion from carnal things have wormed themselves into more than regal wealth and have wickedly kept what they have craftily obtained by fomenting foreign or domestic strife in all places as their purposes were best served and by blasphemously dealing out even the punishments of heaven against all who had resolution enough to make any stand against their corruptions by what arts they have evaded a late act of parliament against their encroachments your majesty well knows  think not gracious sovereign that i exceed the bounds of charity in what i say i only offer to your majestys consideration a rule which was once prescribed by a greater master by their fruits you shall know them  another mark of the true disciples of christ is their being at all times exposed to persecution it would be endless to quote all the passages of scripture in which this burden is universally laid upon good christians contempt and reproach is their common lot and often the most violent persecutions even to death itself wherever therefore the word of god is truly preached you must expect to see persecution in one shape or other on the contrary wherever you see ease and luxury and a quiet possession of worldly pleasures there the truth cannot possibly be for the world loves only such as are worldly and the favorers of the gospel can expect nothing in it from reason and are promised nothing in it by scripture but vexation and trouble  from this distinction again your majesty by the assistance of the abovementioned rule by their fruits you shall know them will be able to judge who are the true followers of christ wherever you observe persecution there is more than a probability that the truth lies on the persecuted side  as for a notion which has been infused into your majesty that the scriptures in the hands of the people might move them to rebellion your majesty may judge of the falsehood of this likewise by the same rule by their fruit you shall know them how is it possible that a book which inculcates obedience to magistrates with the greatest earnestness can be the cause of sedition the thing speaks itself and discovers only how much their malice is at a loss for topics of invective  when king david sent ambassadors to the young king of the ammonites to condole with him upon the death of his father your majesty may remember what unadvised counsel was given to that rash prince his counselors put it into his head contrary to all reason that davids messengers came only as spies and that david certainly meant  invasion the young king upon this without farther ceremony wantonly shaved the heads of the ambassadors and treated them with other instances of contempt but the following verses inform us how the affair ended the destruction of the whole land we read was the consequenee of the kings listening to imprudent counsel  let not great king this fact find its parallel in english story the ambassadors of a great prince are now making suit to you the holy evangelists and apostles of christ be upon your guard and believe not the idle tales of those who would persuade you that these messengers of peace are coming to foment sedition in your land would your majesty know the true cause of this confederacy as i may well call it against the word of god examine the lives of those who are the leaders of it and consider whether there may not be some private reasons inducing such persons to keep a book in concealment which cries out loudly against all kinds of vice and if your majesty wants to know the source of rebellions i think a much fairer one may be conjectured at than the use of an english bible for my own part i have long been of opinion that a greater encouragement of all kinds of civil disorder could hardly have been invented than the churchtrade of pardons and indulgences to which may be added the bad examples of the clergy and the little care they are generally thought to take in the discharge of their duty  as for those who are now in question about your majestys late proclamation i am credibly informed there is not one among them who has not in every respect demeaned himself as a peaceable and good subject excepting only this one case in which they thought their religion and consciences concerned in this particular however i excuse them not nor will i take upon me entirely to defend the books for which they suffer for indeed many of them i have never read only this your majesty must give me leave to say that it is impossible the many inconveniences can follow from these books and especially from the scripture which they would persuade mankind will follow  accept gracious sovereign without displeasure what i have written i thought it my duty to mention these things to your majesty no personal quarrel as god shall judge me have i with any man i wanted only to induce your majesty to consider well what kind of persons you have about you and the ends for which they counsel indeed great prince many of them or they are much slandered have very private ends god grant your majesty may see through all the designs of evil men and be in all things equal to the high office with which you are entrusted  he concludes his letter with these very emphatical words  wherefore gracious king remember yourself have pity upon your own soul and think that the day is at hand when you shall give account of your office and of the blood that has been shed by your sword in the which day that your grace may stand steadfastly and not be ashamed but be clear and ready in your reckoning and have your pardon sealed with the blood of our savior christ which only serves at that day is my daily prayer to him who suffered death for our sins the spirit of god preserve you  with such freedom did this true minister of the gospel address his sovereign but the influence of the popish party was then so great that his letter produced no effect the king however no way displeased received it not only with temper but with great condescension graciously thanking him for his wellintended advice this monarch notwithstanding his many vices would frequently indulge a very generous manner of thinking he was himself generally open in his behavior and was a great lover of sincerity in others plainness and honesty were commonly sure of his attention and though no man was more impatient of control or naturally more hasty upon most occasions and violent than he was yet he would often hear the truth and the truth indeed spoken with great freedom from those of whose sincerity he was thoroughly convinced i make these remarks chiefly because mr latimer was a person whose plain and simple manner had made a favorable impression upon him which good opinion this letter contributed not a little to strengthen  section iv the kings divorce was not yet brought to an issue the pope terrified by an imperial army hovering over him and yet afraid of the defection of england was still endeavoring as was said to hold the balance even between charles v and henry the legantine court therefore under the influence of rome was not hasty in its determinations but the tediousness of the suit at length got the better of the king of englands patience his incontroulable spirit broke out and finding himself duped by the pope he disclaimed his authority in the affair took it into his own hands and had it determined within his own realm having gone thus far in defiance of the sea of rome and finding his throne yet unshaken by any of its efforts he was proceeding farther but the pope beginning to temporize a reconciliation was thought at hand the imperial faction however once again prevailed henrys measures were traversed and himself in the person of his ambassador treated with indignity  hitherto henry was secretly inclined to a reconciliation with rome but his resentment of this usage took such entire possession of him that from this time he determined absolutely to throw off the papal yoke upon such slender pivots as even the passions of men do the grand schemes of providence often turn  soon after henry had taken this resolution the affair was brought into parliament and the kings supremacy was every where the popular topic  the usurpations of the pope had before this time been the subject of a parliamentary inquiry through many preceding reigns the exactions of the holy see had been so oppressive that the legislature was often applied to for redress and many laws breathing a noble spirit of freedom had been enacted by which the roman power was much abridged of these the most famous were the statute against the popes taxgatherers commonly called the stature against provisors and the statute of praemunire prohibiting bulls and other instruments from rome the word praemunire which gave name to the statute was one of the capital words in the writ upon which it was executed  but notwithstanding these and many other bold laws were enacted no effect was produced they were promulged and laid aside the influence of the vatican was indeed yet too considerable to suffer any very spirited attacks upon its power  neglected however as these statutes were they served as precedents for henrys parliament which concurred entirely with the kings inclinations luthers exceptions were now growing popular every year brought something to light which prejudiced men more against the doctrine or the discipline or the priesthood of the church of rome the parliament therefore wanted little inducement to turn their councils upon any thing which tended to reformation thus the king with less difficulty than commonly attends such important revolutions got the popes power abrogated in england and his own supremacy established in its stead  the part which mr latimer acted in this affair was one of the first things which brought him forward in life  whatever motives in earnest influenced king henry he had always policy enough to pay an outward regard at least to those of conscience he took care therefore to resolve his scruples before he gratified his passions thus he had the opinion of all the divines in europe before he ventured upon his divorce and thus in the present case he durst not assert his supremacy till he had consulted with the ablest canonists of his realm and fully satisfied himself that what he did was agreeable to the old and new testament  among those who served him in this business was dr butts his physician who from the slender accounts preserved of him in history appears to have been a person of great honesty learning and humanity mr fox calls him a singular good man and a special favourer of good proceedings  this gentleman being sent to cambridge upon the occasion mentioned began immediately to pay his court to the protestant party from whom the king expected most unanimity in his favor among the first he made his application to mr latimer as a person most likely to serve him begging that he would collect the opinions of his friends in the case and do his utmost to bring over those of most eminence who were still inclined to the papacy mr latimer who was a thorough friend to the cause he was to solicit undertook it with his usual zeal and discharged himself so much to the satisfaction of the doctor that when that gentleman returned to court he took mr latimer along with him with a view no doubt to procure him something answerable to his merit  about this time a person was rising into power who became afterward mr latimers chief friend and patron the great lord cromwell a person in all respects so formed for command that we admire him through history as something more than human as one of those great instruments which providence often raises up and seems to inspire for some grand purpose his descent was mean but his enterprising genius soon raised him above the obscurity of his birth we first find him abroad leading a wild romantic life in various capacities in holland he was a hackney writer in italy a foot soldier after spending a very dissipated youth in this vague way he returned home and was taken into the service of cardinal woolsey who in a short time made him his secretary under this sagacious minister he began to methodize the large fund of knowledge he had been treasuring up and was soon valued by the cardinal who was by no means illserved as one of the ablest of his servants the cardinals fall was his rise but he rose not like most favorites by betraying but by defending his master woolsey had arrived at the full meridian of his glory that critical point at which human grandeur begins to decline the distressed minister was now at bay pressed hard by a parliamentary inquiry the king had withdrawn his favor from him and all his dependents those summerflies of a great mans sunshine began to shrink and die away cromwell alone with a generosity almost unparalleled in history boldly maintained his cause and pleaded for him so forcibly before the commons that if his ruin had not been a thing resolved on he bid fair to avert it woolsey fell but cromwells generosity was rewarded the king was pleased with his behavior marked his abilities from that time favored and soon employed him his great talents quickly recommended him to the highest trusts and his sovereign used his services almost implicitly  as this eminent person was a friend to the reformation he encouraged of course such churchmen as were inclined toward it among others mr latimer was one of his favorites to whom he took all opportunities of showing his regard and as mr latimer had at this time no employment in london his patron very soon obtained a benefice for him  this benefice was in wiltshire whither mr latimer resolved as soon as possible to repair and keep a constant residence his friend dr butts surprised at his resolution did what he could to persuade him from it he was deserting he told him the fairest appearances of making his fortune the prime minister says he intends this only as an earnest of his future favors and will certainly in time do great things for you but it is the manner of courts to consider those as provided for who seem to be satisfied and take my word for it an absent claimant stands but a poor chance among rivals who have the advantage of being present thus the old courtier advised but mr latimer was not a man on whom such arguments had any weight he had no other notion of making his fortune than that of putting himself in a way of being useful great and good were with him words of the same meaning and though he knew his friends advice was well meant yet he knew at the same time that a man may as easily be deceived by the kindness of his friend as by the guile of his enemy besides he was heartily tired of a court he had yet seen little of the world and was shocked to be introduced at once to a place where he saw vice in every shape triumphant where factions raged where all the arts of malice were practiced where vanity and folly prevailed debauchery of manners dissimulation and irreligion where he not only saw these things but what most grieved him where he found himself utterly unable to oppose them for he had neither authority nor as he thought talents to reclaim the great he left the court therefore and entered immediately upon the duties of his parish hoping to be of some use in the world by faithfully exerting in a private station such abilities as god had given him  his behavior was suitable to his resolutions he thoroughly considered the office of a clergyman and discharged it in the most conscientious manner nor was he satisfied with discharging it in his own parish but extended his labors throughout the county where he observed the pastoral care most neglected having for this purpose obtained a general license from the university of cambridge  his preaching which was in a strain wholly different from the preaching of the times soon made him acceptable to the people among whom in a little time he established himself in great credit he was treated likewise very civilly by the neighboring gentry and at bristol where he often preached he was countenanced by the magistrates  the reputation he was thus daily gaining presently alarmed the orthodox clergy in those parts their opposition to him appeared first on this occasion the mayor of bristol had appointed him to preach there on an eastersunday public notice had been given and all people were pleased when suddenly there came out an order from the bishop of bristol prohibiting any one to preach there without his license the clergy of the place waited upon mr latimer informed him of the bishops order and knowing that he had no such license were extremely sorry that they were by that means deprived of the pleasure of hearing an excellent discourse from him mr latimer received their civility with a smile for he had been apprized of the affair and well knew that these were the very persons who had written to the bishop against him  their opposition to him became afterward more public some of them ascended the pulpit in their zeal and inveighed against him there with great indecency of language of these the most forward was one hubberdin an empty impudent fellow who could say nothing of his own but any thing that was put into his mouth through this instrument and others of the same kind such liberties were taken with mr latimers character that he thought it proper at length to justify himself and accordingly called upon his maligners to accuse him publicly before the mayor of bristol and with all men of candor he was justified for when that magistrate convened both parties and put the accusers upon producing legal proof of what they had said nothing of that kind appeared but the whole accusation was left to rest upon the uncertain evidence of some hearsay information  his enemies however were not thus silenced the party against him became daily stronger and more inflamed it consisted in general of the country priests of those parts headed by some divines of more eminence  these person after mature deliberation drew up articles against him extracted chiefly from his sermons in which he was charged with speaking lightly of the worship of saints with saying that there was no material fire in hell and that he would rather be in purgatory than in lollards tower these articles in the form of an accusation were laid before stokesley bishop of london this prelate immediately cited mr latimer to appear before him but mr latimer instead of obeying the citation appealed to his own ordinary thinking himself wholly exempt from the jurisdiction of any other boshop stokesley upon this making a private cause of it was determined at any rate to get him in his power he applied therefore to archbishop warham whose zeal was nearly of a temper with his own malice the archbishop being easily persuaded cited mr latimer to appear forthwith in his own court where the bishop of london and some other bishops were commissioned to examine him an archiepiscopal citation brought mr latimer at once to a compliance his friends would have had him leave the country but their persuasions were in vain before he set out for london he wrote the following letter to a friend  i marvel not a little that my lord of london having so large a diocese committed to his care and so peopled as it is can have leisure either to trouble me or to trouble himself with me so poor a wretch a stranger to him and nothing pertaining to his cure methinks it were more comely for my lord if it were comely for me to say so to be a preacher himself than to he a disquieter of preachers if it would please his lordship to take so great labor and pain as to come and preach in my little bishopric at westkington whether i were present or absent i would thank his lordship heartily for helping to discharge me in my cure as long as his predication was fruitful and to the edification of my parishioners but he may do as he pleases i pray god he may do as well as i would wish him to do and as to my preaching i trust in god my lord of london cannot justly reprove it if it be taken as i spoke it else it is not my preaching  quem recitas meus est o fidentine libellus sed male cum recitas incipit esse tuus either my lord of london will judge mine outward man or mine inward man if he will have to do only with mine outward man how i have ordered my life i trust i shall please both my lord god and also my lord of london for i have taught but according to the scriptures and the ancient interpreters of scriptures and with all diligence moved my auditors to faith and charity and as for voluntary things i reproved the abuse without condemning the things themselves but if my lord will needs invade my inward man and break violently into my heart i fear then indeed i may displease my lord of london finally as you say the matter is weighty even as weighty as my life is worth and ought to be well looked to how to look well to it i know not otherwise than to pray to my lord god night and day that as he has boldened me to preach his truth so he will strengthen me to suffer for it and i trust that god will help me which trust if i had not the ocean sea should have divided my lord of london and me by this time  in this christian temper mr latimer set out for london it was in the depth of winter and he was at this time laboring under a severe fit both of the stone and cholic these things were hard upon him but what most distressed him was the thought of leaving his parish so exposed where the popish clergy would not fail to undo in his absence what he had hitherto done  when he arrived in london he found a court of bishops and canonists assembled to receive him where instead of being examined as he expected about his sermons the following paper was offered to him which he was ordered to subscribe   i believe that there is a purgatory to purge the souls of the dead after this life  that the souls in purgatory are helped with the masses prayers and alms of the living  that the saints do pray as mediators for us in heaven  that it is profitable for christians to call upon the saints that they may pray as mediators for as unto god  that pilgrimages and oblations done to the sepulchers and relics of saints are meritorious  that they which have vowed perpetual chastity may not break their vow without the dispensation of the pope  that the keys of binding and loosing delivered to peter do still remain with the bishops of rome his successors although they live wickedly and are by no means nor at any time committed to laymen  that men may merit at gods hand by fasting prayer and other works or piety  that they which are forbidden of the bishop to preach as suspected persons ought to cease until they have purged themselves before the said bishop  that the fast which is used in lent and other fasts prescribed by the canons are to be observed  that god in every one of the seven sacraments gives grace to a man rightly receiving the same  that consecrations sanctifyings and blessings by custom received into the church are profitable  that it is laudable and profitable that the venerable images of the crucifix and other saints should be had in the church as a remembrance and to the honor and worship of jesus christ and his saints  that it is laudable and profitable to deck and clothe those images and to set up burning lights before them to the honor of the said saints  this paper being offered to mr latimer he read it over and returned it again refusing to sign it the archbishop with a frown begged he would consider what he did we intend not says he mr latimer to be hard upon you we dismiss you for the present take a copy of the articles examine them carefully and god grant that at our next meeting we may find each other in better temper  at the next meeting and at several succeeding ones the same scene was acted over again both sides continued inflexible  the bishops however being determined if possible to make him comply began to treat him with more severity of one of these examinations he gives us the following account  i was brought one says he to be examined in a chamber where i was wont to be examined but at this time it was somewhat altered for whereas before there wae a fire in the chimney now the five was taken away and an arras hanged over the chimney and the table stood near the chimneys end there was among these bishops that examined me one with whom i have been very familiar and whom i took for my great friend an aged man and he sat next the tableend then among other questons he put forth one a very subtle and crafty one and when i should make answer i pray you mr latimer said he speak out i am very thick of hearing and here be many that sit far off i marvelled at this that i was bidden to speak out and began to misdeem and gave an ear to the chimney and there i heard a pen plainly scratching behind the cloth they had appointed one there to write all my answers that i should not start from them god was my good lord and gave me answers i could never else have escaped them  thus the bishops continued to distress mr latimer three times every week they regularly sent for him with a view either to elicit something from him by captious questions or to teaze him at length into a compliance  and indeed at length he was tired out his spirit could no longer bear the usage he met with accordingly when he was next summoned instead of going himself he sent a letter to the archbishop in which with great freedom he tells him that the treatment he had of late met with had fretted him into such a disorder as rendered him unfit to attend them that day  that in the mean time he could not help taking this opportunity to expostulate with his grace for detaining him so long from the discharge of his duty  that it seemed to him most unaccountable that they who never preached themselves should hinder others  that as for their examination of him he really could not imagine what they aimed at they pretended one thing in the beginning and another in the progress  that if his sermons were what gave offense which he persuaded himself were neither contrary to the truth nor to any canon of the church he was ready to answer whatever might be thought exceptionable in them  that he wished a little more regard might be had to the judgment of the people and that a distinction might be made between the ordinances of god and man  that if some abuses in religion did prevail as was then commonly supposed he thought preaching was the best means to discountenance them  that he wished all pastors might be obliged to perform their duty but that however liberty might be given to those who were willing  that as for the articles proposed to him he begged to be excused from subscribing them while he lived he never would abet superstition  and that lastly he hoped the archbishop would excuse what he had written  he knew his duty to his superiors and would practice it but in that case he thought a stronger obligation laid upon him  what particular effect this letter produced we are not informed the bishops however still continued their persecution but by an unexpected accident their schemes were suddenly frustrated the king being informed of the ill usage mr latimer met with most probably by the lord cromwells means interposed in his behalf and rescued him out of the hands of his enemies mr fox leaves it in doubt whether he was not at length prevailed upon to subscribe the bishops articles but i think it past dispute that he did not for if he had what occasion had the king to interpose  the unfortunate ann boleyn was at that time the favorite wife of henry she had imbibed from her youth the principles of the reformation and continued still inclined to it whether she had been acquainted with mr latimer before she met with him now at court does not appear she was extremely taken however with his simplicity and apostolic appearance and mentioned him to her friends as a person in her opinion as well qualified as any she had seen to forward the reformation one of her friends and as much her favorite as any was the lord cromwell who failed not with his usual address to raise mr latimer still higher in her esteem in short the queen and the minister agreed in thinking that he was a man endowed with too many public virtues to be suffered to live obscure in a private station and joined in an earnest recommendation of him to the king for a bishopric such suitors would have carried an harder point nor indeed did the king want much solicitation in his favor  it happened that the sees of worcester and salisbury were at that time vacant by the deprivation of ghinuccii and campegio two italian bishops who fell under the kings displeasure upon his rupture with rome the former of these was offered to mr latimer as he had been at no pains to procure this promotion he looked upon it as the work of providence and accepted it without much persuasion indeed he had met with so very rough a check already as a private clergyman and saw before him so hazardous a prospect in his old station that he thought it necessary both for his own safety and for the sake of being of more service in the world to shroud himself under a little temporal power  how he discharged his new office may easily be imagined an honest conscience which was his rule of conduct in one station might be supposed such in another but we are not left to conjecture all the historians of these times mention him as a person remarkably zealous in the discharge of his duty in overlooking the clergy of his diocese which he thought the chief branch of the episcopal office exciting in them a zeal for religion and obliging them at least to a legal performance of their duty he was uncommonly active warm and resolute with the same spirit he presided over his ecclesiastical court and either rooted out such crimes as were there cognizable or prevented their becoming exemplary by forcing them into corners in visiting he was frequent and observant in ordaining strict and wary in preaching indefatigable in reproving and exhorting severe and persuasive  thus far he could act with authority but in other things he found himself under difficulties the ceremonies of the popish worship gave him great offense and he neither durst in times so dangerous and unsettled lay them entirely aside nor on the other hand was he willing entirely to retain them in this dilemma his address was admirable he inquired into their origin and when he found any of them as some of them were derived from a good meaning he took care to inculcate the original meaning though itself a corruption in the room of a more corrupt practice thus he put the people in mind when holy bread and water were distributed that these elements which had long been thought endowed with a kind of magical influence were nothing more than appendages to the two sacraments of the lords supper and baptism the former he said reminded us of christs death and the latter was only a simple representation of our being purified from sin by thus reducing popery to its principles he improved in some measure a bad stock by lopping from it a few fruitless excrescences  section v while his endeavors to reform were thus confined within his own diocese he was called upon to exert them in a more public manner having received a summons to attend the parliament and convocation  this session which was in the year      was thought a crisis by the protestant party the renunciation of the popes authority was a great step a free inquiry into principles and practices it was hoped would follow and a thorough reformation could not then it was thought be at a great distance  on the other hand the papists well knew the kings attachment to popery and though they never imagined they should be able to close up the breach they were sanguine enough to believe they could easily prevent its widening farther  these opposite hopes animated two powerful parties and indeed it is hard to say whether the papists or the protestants during this reign had the greater influence henry was governed entirely by his passions and to these sometimes one minister and sometimes another made the most dextrous address  at the head of the protestant party was first the lord cromwell whose favor with the king was now in its meridian and who was the soul of every thing that was done  next to him in power was cranmer archbishop of canterbury to which dignity he had been promoted upon the death of warham for his services in the matter of the divorce he was a sincere promoter of reformation and had abilities admirably adapted to such a work he was a calm dispassionate man had a sound judgment and a very extensive knowledge but he had conversed little in the world was very open to the attacks of malice and knavery and was unacquainted with any methods but those of gentleness and persuasion which indeed went a considerable way to promote his ends  after him the bishop of worcester was the most considerable man of the party to whom were added the bishops of ely rochester hereford salisbury and st davids  on the other hand the popish party was headed by lee archbishop of york gardener stokesly and tunstal bishops of winchester london and durham  lee was considerable chiefly on account of the eminency of his station gardener had the acutest parts stokesley the most zeal and tunstal the best heart but they were all a kind of courtbarometers and discerning men could judge of the temper of the times by their elevations and depressions yet gardener was a most dextrous whisperer when he could get privately to his sovereigns ear to which he had but too frequent access though his abilities had not yet that scope which succeeding times allowed them  these persons thus disposed now met together in convocation their meeting was opened in the usual form by a sermon or rather an oration spoken by the bishop of worcester whose eloquence was at this time every where famous this task was assigned him by the archbishop of canterbury who knew no man so well qualified to lay before the clergy the corruptions of their order and to rouse them if possible into a sense of their duty what he said was to this effect  we are met together it seems here brethren to consult the settlement of religion a very important trust is committed to us and i hope each of us has brought with him a resolution to discharge it properly and indeed great need is there that something should be done superstition has had a long reign amongst us nor can i yet believe its tyranny at an end while i see our clergy still immersed in the corruptions of their forefathers while i see even mitred advocates it becomes me to speak plainly still espousing this cause what an inundation of folly to give it the lightest appellation is daily flowing from our pulpits is there an absurdity in the whole popish creed is there a corruption in their whole ritual which is not countenanced even at this very day amongst us purgatory is still believed images are still worshipped and what is most grievous when external observances abound men begin to lay a stress upon them and of course the necessity of a good life is superceded  rouse yourselves my brethren rouse yourselves at these things consider that an amendment of all these evils is looked for at our hands if the priest is remiss what can be expected from the people imagine you hear at the last day the almighty judge thus rebuking us a cry against you comes up into my ears a cry against your avarice your exactions your tyranny i commanded you with industry and painstaking to feed my sheep instead of which you do nothing but gluttonize from day to day wallowing in indolence and pleasure i commanded you to preach my commandments and seek my glory instead of which you preach your own fantasies and seek your own profit i commanded that all people should diligently search my word instead of which it is your care to shut up the books of knowledge  too much reason have you to fear that reading the people may understand and understanding they may learn to rebuke your slothfulness  since then my brethren the corruptions of the clergy are so manifest and since so strict an account will be demanded of our conduct let us at this time do something to show that we have the interest of religion at heart let us do something to wipe off prejudices which i know have been conceived against some of us withoutdoors and as our stations in life add a dignity to our characters so let them inspire us with holiness and a zeal for the salvation of souls in which alone consists the real dignity of a christian bishop all men know that we are here assembled and with ardent looks expect the fruit of our consultation oh my brethren let us not disappoint their hopes  lift up your heads therefore my lords look round and examine what things want reformation in the church of england is it so hard a matter to find out corruption and abuses among us what is done in the arches is there nothing there that wants amendment is business speedily dispatched or are suitors entangled in forms disappointed vexed and rifled or if all things be well there what think you of the bishops consistories is vice sought out and corrected or is it made a shameful handle for bribery and extortion  what think you my brethren of the ceremonies of the church are they simple and significant or are they rather calculated to offend weak consciences and to encourage superstition among the vulgar  do you see nothing amiss in that multiplicity of holidays with which our calendar abounds is true religion think you more promoted by them or idleness and debauchery  what think you of images and relics to which so many painful pilgrimages are made from every corner of the kingdom do you observe no priestcraft in these things no gainful frauds no profitable impositions  what think you of our liturgy is it unexceptionable in all its parts or if it was is it defensible by scripture that the offices of the church should be performed in an unknown tongue  lastly my brethren what think you of masses and of that beneficial commerce in this commodity which has been carried on for so many years  consider these things i beg of you my lords and if there be nothing to be corrected abroad let each of us make one better if there be nothing either abroad or at home that wants amendment be cheerful my lords and merry and as we have nothing else to do let us at least reason the matter how we may grow richer let us fall to some pleasant conversation and then go home with a full resolution to live merrily here for we have nothing to expect hereafter let us not say with st peter our end approaches this is a melancholy note but let us say with the evil servant my lord delayeth his coming and let us begin to beat our fellows and eat and drink with the drunken and what can be interpreted beating our fellows if not allowing their corruptions what can be interpreted eating and drinking with the drunken if not spending our lives in indolence and pleasure but god will come on a day when we look not for him and in an hour when we are not aware he will call us to a severe account and all our worldly policy will end in despair  let us then my brethren in time be wise let us be wise if not for others at least for ourselves let us wean our hearts from worldly things let us divest ourselves of each selfinterested thought and let every man in this assembly resolve to aim at nothing in his counsels but the glory of god and the happiness of man  with such language did the good bishop endeavor to work upon the assembly but his speech rather showed the goodness of his own heart than wrought any change in the counsels of his audience for eloquence has seldom influence but in questions of sudden determination  the forms of their meeting were scarce settled when the two parties began to attack each other with great bitterness the papist was the aggressor in the lower house a bill was drawn up the result of much secret caballing which contained a catalogue of sixty seven heretical opinions many of these were the tenets of wicliffe the rest of modern reformers this bill was sent up into the higher house where it met with many zealous advocates here it was agitated with animosity enough on both sides each party resolving in the first contest to make the other acquainted with its full strength  in the midst of the debate which had now lasted many days each day growing warmer than the last the lord cromwell entered the house and addressing himself to the popish bishops required them in the kings name to put an end to their opposition this message instantly quenched the flame and gave the reformers the first intimation of the kings good intentions toward them  among other foreign protestants who were at this time entertained by the archbishop of canterbury there was a very ingenious scotsman whose name was alesse a person who had made himself very acceptable to the archbishop by his learning and solid judgment and who was at all times without any reserve consulted by the heads of the protestant party  this learned man cromwell brought with him to the convocationhouse where he spoke largely against the sacraments of the roman church and proved that two only were of gospel institution this speech produced a warm debate and of long continuance which was managed by the bishops of york and london on the part of the papists and of canterbury and hereford on that of the protestants the latter retorting many things with great freedom against tradition and monkery and the ignorance of the popish clergy  the result was that four sacraments out of the seven were concluded to be insignificant  but as the bishop of worcester did not distinguish himself in the debates of this convocation for debating was not his talent it is beside my purpose to enter into a detail of the several transactions of it i shall only add that an animated attempt was at this time made to get him and cranmer stigmatized by some public censure but through their own and cromwells interest they were too well established to fear any open attack from their enemies  for the rest of what was now done let it suffice to say that no very hasty steps were taken in favor of reformation the cool heads which managed that revolution thought it sufficient at this time to accustom the people to see religious matters brought into question and judged it more prudent to loosen prejudices by degrees than to attempt in a violent manner to root them up  when it was imagined that these alterations were tolerably digested others and these still more subversive of popery were the same year published in the kings name the first act of pure supremacy which this prince attempted the articles which contained these alterations were drawn up as is generally supposed by the archbishop of canterbury and if so it is more than probable that bishop latimer had a hand in them they were levelled chiefly against relics images pilgrimages and superfluous holy days  in a few months after this a still more considerable advance was made the bible was translated into english and recommended to a general perusal the people were ordered to be instructed in the principles of religion in their mother tongue and the invocation of saints was left as a thing indifferent  thus reformation was daily gaining ground the more glaring parts of the romish superstition were now abolished a way was opened for free inquiry men ventured to harbor doubts and suspicions and it was thought rational to bring the doctrines of the church to the test of reason  as for the papists they gave up every thing for lost they had made their last effort by exciting the people to rebellion exclaiming loudly against the dissolution of monasteries which was indeed the most unpopular act of those times but the flames which they had blown up were now every where dying away the country enriched with the spoils of the priests grew plentiful and satisfied and men began to view the venerable ruins of an abbey only as they contributed to enliven a landscape  in the mean while the bishop of worcester highly satisfied with the prospect of the times repaired to his diocese having made no longer stay in london than was absolutely necessary he had no talents and he knew that he had none for state affairs and therefore he meddled not with them the settlement of religion could not he assured himself be in abler hands than in those of the lord cromwell and while it was so he wisely judged it would be thought presumption in him who could not be supposed to know what men and times would bear to concern himself with it his talents were those of a private station and within that he was determined to confine them if he behaved in his diocese like a true christian bishop and did all in his power to root out superstition and encourage the practice of piety and virtue he was satisfied in his conscience that he did all toward the settlement of religion that could be expected from him i make these remarks the rather because bishop burnet speaks in a very slight manner of his public character at this time whereas it is certain that he never desired to appear in any public character at all his whole ambition was to discharge the pastoral functions of a bishop neither aiming to display the abilities of the statesman nor those of the courtier how very unqualified he was to support the latter of these characters will sufficiently appear from the following story  it was the custom in those days for the bishops upon the coming in of the new year to make presents to the king and many of them would present very liberally proportioning their gifts to their expectances among the rest the bishop of worcester being at this time in town waited upon the king with his offering but instead of a purse of gold which was the common oblation he presented a new testament with a leaf doubled down in a very conspicuous manner to this passage whoremongers and adulterers god will judge  the bishop of worcester being again settled in his diocese went on with his usual application in the discharge of his duty but i meet with no particulars of his behavior at this time except only in one instance  a gentleman of warwickshire in a purchase had done some hard things to a poor man in his neighborhood yet he had kept within the limits of the law taking the advantage of some unguarded expression in a statute having a brother a justice of peace and enough acquainted with the law to do mischief who had negotiated the affair for him as these two brothers were men of great fortune in the country and overawed the neighboring gentlemen the poor man had nothing to do but to sit quietly under his oppression but while he was reconciling himself to what had happened some of his friends put him upon applying in the way of a complaint to the bishop of worcester whose character as the common patron of the poor and oppressed was every where much spoken of the poor man approved the advice and taking a journey to the bishop acquainted him with the whole affair the bishop heard his story pitied his case and sent him home with a promise of his protection accordingly he soon after wrote to the justice who had been the chief agent in the affair and endeavored by proper arguments to raise in him a sense of the injury he had been guilty of speaking his mind very freely both of him and his brother yet treating them at the same time with proper civility the two gentlemen were greatly incensed at this letter and answered it in the spirit of detected guilt they had done only what was right and would abide by it that as for the sufferer the law was open and as for him they could not but think he interfered very impertinently in an affair which did not concern him but in the bishop of worcester they had not to do with a person who was easily shaken from an honest purpose he acquainted them in few words that if the cause of his complaint was not forthwith removed he certainly would himself lay the whole affair before the king and he had been without doubt as good as his word but his adversaries did not care to put him to a trial  having now been about two years resident in his diocese he was called up again to town in the year      to attend the business of parliament a parliament which was productive of great events  but as a new spirit had now infused itself into the counsels of those times it will be necessary to trace it from its first efforts into those violent workings and agitations which it soon produced  section vi king henry viii made as little use of a good judgment as any man ever did he had no fixed principles his whole reign was one continued rotation of violent passions through the means of which secret springs he was all his life a mere machine in the hands of his ministers and he among them who could make the most artful address to the passion of the day carried his point  gardener was just returned from germany having successfully negotiated some commissions which the king had greatly at heart this introduced him with a good grace at court where observing with his usual sagacity the temper and situation of men and things and finding that room was left him to do mischief by the death of the queen who exceedingly favored the protestant interest he collected every art he was master of and with the subtilty of a bad spirit beset the king hoping in some weak part to infuse his malice under the semblance of state policy  it was imagined by many at that time and has since that time been confirmed by circumstances which came out afterward that gardener had begun thus early to entertain very ambitious designs that he had been in treaty with the pope and that for expected favors he was under secret engagements with him to introduce popery again into england  with this view therefore he took frequent occasions to alarm the king with apprehensions of foreign and domestic danger he would dwell upon the intrigues of the court of rome the power of the emperor the watchfulness of the scots to take every advantage and above all the seditious spirit of his own subjects he would then insinuate that something should be done in opposition to these threathing dangers and that for his part he knew nothing that could be more effectual than for his majesty to show a zeal for the old religion that as for his throwing off the papal yoke he said it was a noble effort of his magnanimity and was esteemed such by all sober men for the tyranny of the court of rome was become intolerable the suppression of monasteries was likewise in his opinion wholly justifiable and his majesty well knew that none of his counselors had been more sanguine in that affair than himself but then he thought it was the part of wisdom to consider these things only in a political light and for himself he could not but greatly apprehend the bad consequences of making any alterations in the established religion at least he would advise his majesty to stop where he was and by some vigorous act to show the world that he was not that patron of novel opinions which he was generally esteemed by this means he would make those only his enemies who were blind devotees to the papal power and these were not one fourth part of christendom  by such infusions as these which he knew very well how to dress into the form of arguments and could render plausible by an artful display of the situation of europe and by showing how the interests of courts and factions coincided entirely with his schemes the wily prelate so wrought upon the fears the ambition or vanity of the king for he could show his argument in all lights that by degrees he drew attention and at length made such an impression as he thought would serve his purpose having gone thus far he next began to propose expedients and as the king was about to call a parliament at this time to confirm and finish what he had done with relation to monasteries he persuaded him to take this opportunity of doing something in the business he had counseled in the mean time nothing of these designs transpired at least so little that the opposite party could make no use of their intelligence for of all the wicked ministers that have infested the councils of princes perhaps none was ever more deep and secret than the bishop of winchester  this was the state of affairs when the bishop of worcester was called up to london to attend the business of parliament  soon after his arrival in town he was accused before the king of preaching a seditious sermon the sermon was preached at court and the preacher according to his custom had been unquestionably severe enough against whatever he observed amiss his accuser who is said to have been a person of great eminence about the king was most probably the bishop of winchester for this prelate was known to make use of what arts he could to remove all those from the national councils of those times who were most likely to thwart his measures the king had called together several of the bishops with a view to consult them upon some points of religion when they had all given their opinions and were about to be dismissed the bishop of winchester if it was he kneeled down before the king and accused the bishop of worcester in the abovementioned manner showing how his sermon which he called a libel against the king and his ministers tended to alienate the people from their prince the bishop being called upon by the king with some sternness to vindicate himself was so far from denying or even palliating what he had said that he boldly justified it and turning to the king with that noble unconcern which a good conscience inspires made this answer i never thought myself worthy nor i never sued to be a preacher before your grace but i was called to it and would be willing if you mislike me to give place to my betters for i grant there be a great many more worthy of the room than i am and if it be your graces pleasure to allow them for preachers i could be content to bear their books after them but if your grace allow me for a preacher i would desire you to give me leave to discharge my conscience and to frame my doctrine according to my audience i had been a very dolt indeed to have preached so at the borders of your realm as i preach before your grace the greatness of this answer baffled his accusers malice the severity of the kings countenance changed into a gracious smile and the bishop was dismissed with that obliging freedom which this monarch never used but to those whom he esteemed  the parliament which had been summoned to meet on the   th of april having now sat a week and being ready to enter upon business the lord chancellor on the  th of may informed the lords from the king that his majesty had with extreme uneasiness observed the distracted condition of his subjects with regard to religion that he had nothing so much at heart as to establish an uniformity of opinion amongst them and that he therefore desired the lords would immediately appoint a committee to examine the several opinions that prevailed and to fix upon certain articles for a general agreement it was the manner it seems of those times to use no ceremony in fixing a standard for men to think by and to vary that standard with as little ceremony as new modes of thinking prevailed the parliament therefore without any difficulty complied and named for a committee the lord cromwell the two archbishops and the bishops of worcester ely durham bath and wells carlisle and bangor  men of so opposite a way of thinking were not likely to agree after eleven days therefore spent in warm debates nothing was concluded this was no more than was expected and made room for the farce which followed  on the twelfth day the duke of norfolk according to the plan which had been without doubt laid down acquainted the lords that he found the committee had yet done nothing that eleven days had been already spent in wrangling and that he saw no possibility of coming to an agreement in that way he begged leave therefore to offer to their lordships consideration some articles which he himself had drawm up and which he desired might be examined by a committee of the whole house he then read the articles which were these    that in the sacrament of the altar after the consecration there remained no substance of bread and wine but the natural body and blood of christ    that vows of chastity ought to be observed    that the use of private masses should be continued    that communion in both kinds was not necessary    that priests might not marry    that auricular confession should be retained in the church  the first of these articles was against the sacramentaries as they were called who denied transubstantiation the second was designed to keep the ejected clergy dependent on the pope for gardener could not hope at this time to establish them the rest were opinions of the greatest weight in popery  the protestant party began now plainly enough to see a concerted scheme and could trace it without much difficulty to its source they resolved however to collect what strength they were able and at least to make one struggle each of them therefore did the utmost he could but the noble stand made by the archbishop of canterbury deserves particularly to be remembered this prelate disputed in the military phrase every inch of ground and with such force of reason that if reason had been his adversaries weapon too he had carried his point  against the first article indeed he said nothing for at that time he held all the opinions of the lutherans among which transubstantiation was one but against the second he was extremely earnest it was very hard he said to force religious men from their houses and not allow them that common intercourse with the world which the rest of his majestys subjects enjoyed that the parliament had already absolved them from their vow of poverty and he could see no reason why they should be absolved from one vow more than another besides he added that in his opinion such a treatment of them was very impolitic for while they continued in a state of coelibacy they were still in a capacity if a fair occasion should offer to reenter their monasteries  against the third article which enjoined the use of private masses he said it was a plain condemnation of the kings proceedings against religious houses for if masses did benefit departed souls it was surely an unjustifiable step to destroy so many noble foundations which were dedicated to that only purpose  with equal spirit the archbishop opposed the rest of the articles and like a wise statesman who knew the temper of the times drew his arguments when he could from policy rather than religion but all his eloquence was ineffectual the affair had been resolved on in the cabinet and the parliament was consulted only for form the act therefore passed without much opposition and was guarded with such penalties as made it indeed justly dreadful  the act of the six articles for so it was named was no sooner published than it gave an universal alarm to all the favorers of reformation the protestants every where cried out their prospect of happiness was now over they could not now expect a toleration for they plainly saw that a sword was put into the hands of their enemies to destroy them while both papists and protestants joined in exclaiming that it was difficult to say what the king intended for it was neither safe to be of one profession nor the other the act of supremacy condemned the papist and the act of the six articles the protestant  the bishop of worcester was among those who first took offense at these proceedings and as he could not give his vote for the act he thought it wrong to hold any office in a church where such terms of communion were required he resigned his bishopric therefore and retired into the country  it is related of him that when he came from the parliament house to his lodgings he threw off his robes and leaping up declared to those who stood about him that he thought himself lighter than ever he found himself before the story is not unlikely as it is much in character a vein of pleasantry and good humor accompanying the most serious actions of his life  in the mean time vigilant emissaries were sent abroad articles of accusation were gathered up from all parts and in london only more than  00 persons in a very short time were imprisoned cromwell and cranmer saw with concern the misery of the times but could not prevent it they stood alone and were besides enough engaged in stemming a torrent which ran strong against themselves cromwell was almost borne down though his enemies carried on their designs with great secresy as for cranmer more than one open attempt had been made against him but his sovereigns favor sheltered him and indeed king henrys care for this excellent prelate to the end of his reign is almost the only striking instance we have either of his steadiness or his goodnature  during the heat of this persecution bishop latimer resided in the country where he thought of nothing for the remainder of his days but a sequestered life he knew the storm which was up could not soon be appeased and he had no inclination to trust himself in it but in the midst of his security an unhappy accident carried him again into the tempestuous weather that was abroad he received a bruise by the fall of a tree and the contusion was so dangerous that he was obliged to seek out for better assistance than could be afforded him by the unskilful surgeons of those parts with this view he repaired to london  here he found the prospect still more glopmy the popish party had now triumphed over all their obstacles and he had the mortification to see his great patron the lord cromwell in the hands of his enemies  of all the severe acts of that reign the dissolution of monasteries gave most offense the clamours of the expelled religious were still loud and menacing and these clamours were with great assiduity carried to the ears of the king where they were represented as the effects of a general seditious spirit capable of breaking out into any rebellious act this industry in showing the king the odiousness of his government was used to blacken cromwell who was the chief agent in the suppression of the religious houses and had indeed been more instrumental than any other man in laying open the priestcraft and detecting the impostures of the popish clergy who were universally incensed against him the king listened with a cruel attention to these whispers against his minister and taking the hint as it should seem from the jewish law he thought it no ill policy to make him the scapegoat of his own offenses  other causes no doubt conspired in the ruin of this great patriot and historians guess at many but the truth is this affair as well as many others which were directed by the dark counsels of the bishop of winchester are still involved in the same obscurity it is certain however that without even the form of a judicial trial he was condemned to lose his head  thus perished this excellent statesman than whom a greater man perhaps no times have produced he had a high sense of public good a noble disinterested and generous heart his parts were equal to any perplexity of government nor was his private character inferior to his public he was pious and charitable in a great degree humble patient of injury and such an example of gratititude as we seldom meet with his death was such a stain upon the memory of those times that if there had been no other it had been enough to mark them with infamy  upon cromwells fall the persecution against the protestants broke out in earnest the duke of norfolk and the bishop of winchester who were the principal instruments in the rain of the late minister were now at the head of the popish party and the authority of the former giving credit to the crafty counsels of the latter together they had the management of all things in their hands under the direction of these zealots the sword was presently unsheathed and such a scene of blood was opened as england had not yet seen  mr latimer among others felt the loss of his great patron gardiners emissaries soon found him out in his concealment for he was still in london and something that somebody had somewhere heard him say against the six articles being alleged against him he was sent to the tower into what particulars his accusation was afterward digested or whether into any i meet with no account it is rather probable that nothing formal was brought against him for i do not find he was ever judicially examined he suffered however through one pretense or other a cruel imprisonment during the remainder of king henrys reign  section vii in the spring of the year      king henry died and was succeeded by his son edward vi this prince came a minor to the crown and was left by his fathers will in the hands of sixteen governors these were at first equal in power but dividing as men commonly do in such circumstances into factions the earl of hertford soon after created duke of somerset being the kings uncle was raised above the rest with the title of protector of the kingdom this revolution was matter of great joy to the protestant party for the protector was generally known to be a favourer of reformation he was besides a wise and an honest man and his want of spirit and resolution was thought to be amply recompensed by his moderation and extreme popularity  as for the young king he is extolled in history as a miracle of human nature but though we make allowances for the exaggerated accounts of protestant writers whose gratitude may be supposed to have broken out into high strains of encomium such an assemblage of great and good qualities will still be left him as have seldom discovered themselves in so young a person and much seldomer in one subject to the temptations of royalty among his other virtues piety was conspicuous with him the settlement of religion was an end with his father it had been a mean and as he had been bred up from his infancy either among moderate men or professed protestants he had imbibed early prejudices in favor of the reformed doctrines the protector therefore found no obstacle in his designs from the young king  the protestant interest was still farther strengthened by the addition of archbishop cranmers counsels which had now all that weight which the protectors authority could give them  on the other hand gardener tunstal and bonner who was now bishop of london set themselves at the head of the popish party and opposed the protector as much as they durst not indeed openly and directly for they presently observed the turning of the wind and had shifted their sails with great nimbleness but thwarting the means rather than the measures they opposed him with that plausible dissimulation which men dextrous in business can easily assume their common language was that however necessary these alterations were they were certainly at this time highly improper  that a minority was not a season for innovations  that it was enough to keep things quiet till the king came of age and that abuses might then be inquired into and remedies applied with all that authority which the full regal power could give  their opposition however had little effect and many changes in religion were projected and some carried into execution with as much dispatch as affairs of such importance would admit the act of the six articles was repealed images were removed out of churches the liturgy was amended and all ministers were confined to their parishchurches this last was an excellent means to prevent the spreading both of popery and sedition while special licenses were granted to approved men to preach where they pleased and what recommended these changes to sober men of all distinctions was the great moderation and spirit of candor which accompanied them throughout two acts of blood indeed stand upon record almost shameful and indelible stain upon the annals of that administration  at the close of the last section we left mr latimer in the tower where he had now lived above six years in the constant practice of every christian virtue that becomes a suffering state immediately upon the change of the government he and all others who were imprisoned in the same cause were set at liberty and bishop latimer whose old friends were now in power was received by them with every mark of affection  heath who had succeeded him in the bishopric of worcester observing his credit at court and fearing lest it should be thought proper to reinstate him was in a great dilemma how to conduct himself as he was a man of no principle he had only to observe the temper of the times and to manage accordingly but unhappily he was as bad a courtier as a bishop making false judgments therefore and being drawn in by artful men he applied to the papists instead of the protestants his party and his folly for he was in every respect an insignificant man laid him so exceedingly open that mr latimer would have found no difficulty in dispossessing him but he had other sentiments age coming upon him he thought himself now unequal to the weight of a bishopric and had no inclination to incumber himself with one perhaps too he might think there was something of hardship and injustice in the case whatever were his reasons it is certain he would make no suit himself nor suffer his friends to make any for his restoration  but the parliament which was now sitting having settled every thing of national concern and applying itself to private business sent up an address to the protector begging him to restore mr latimer to the bishopric of worcester the protector was very well inclined to gratify the commons and proposed the resumption of his bishopric to mr latimer as a point he had very much at heart but the other persevered in his negative alleging his great age and the claim he had from thence to a private life  the report of the parliaments interposition reaching heaths ears terrified him to such a degree that taking it for granted his popery had been complained of be immediately deserted his party and became an orthodox protestant and thus showing a conscientious regard for neither he became contemptible to both parties  mr latimer having rid himself entirely of all entreaty on this head accepted an invitation from his friend archbishop cranmer and took up his residence at lambeth where he led a very retired life i call it retired because he saw little company and never interfered in public affairs though he had always as crowded a levee as a minister of state his chief employment was to hear the complaints and to redress the injuries of poor people and his character for services of this kind was so universally known that strangers from every part of england would resort to him vexed either by the delays of public courts and offices which were surely at that time exceedingly out of order or harassed by the oppressions of the great i cannot go to my book says he giving an account of these avocations for poor folks that come unto me desiring that i will speak that their matters may be heard now and then i walk in my lord of canterburys garden looking in my book but i can do but little good at it for i am no sooner in the garden and have read a little while but by and by comes some one or other knocking at the gate anon comes my man and says sir there is one at the gate would speak with you when i come there then it is some one or other that desires me that i will speak that his matter may be heard or that tells me he has lain this long time at great costs and charges or that he cannot once have his matter come to an hearing  and sure no one was better qualified to undertake the office of redressing injuries for his free reproofs joined to the integrity of his life had a great effect upon those in the highest stations while his own independence and backwardness in asking any favor for himself allowed him greater liberty in asking for others  in these employments he spent more than two years interfering as little as possible during that whole time in any public transaction though no doubt if he had pleased he might have had great weight at least in ecclesiastical affairs but besides the distrust he had of his own judgment he was a man of such exactness in his principles and practice that he could scarce have made those allowances for men and measures which prudent counselors must make in corrupt times and was backward therefore in drawing upon himself such engagements as might lead him more or less into a deviation from truth i find him however at this time engaged in assisting archbishop cranmer to compose the homilies which were set forth by authority in the first year of king edward a useful work this was intended to supply the want of preaching which was now at a very low ebb  the clergy of the old persuasion chose to have themselves considered as a sort of factors who were to transact the spiritual business of the people while the people in the mean time having paid their agents had no further concern about their salvation thus religion was turned into a trade and the priests having gotten the monopoly of it maintained themselves in this monopoly by their preaching in which they proposed no other end churchendowments private masses and such gainful topics were insisted on and these things superseded faith and good morals  this universal corruption in the priesthood was a melancholy prospect to all who wished well to reformation and it was the more melancholy as it was an evil which could not in many years admit a cure what seemed best however was to keep the clergy as much as possible out of the pulpits and to this end the book of homilies was composed and put into the hands of all ministers of parishes who were injoined by authority to read one every sunday instead of preaching in these homilies the people were shown the insignificance of outward observances and were taught to believe that their salvation depended upon themselves  section viii i have had frequent occasion to mention mr latimer as a preacher as indeed he was of the most eloquent and popular of the age in which he lived but at this time he appeared in that character in a more advantageous light than he had yet done having been appointed during the three first years of king edward to preach the lent sermons before the king the choice of such a preacher was approved by all good men great irregularities were known to prevail and mr latimer was acknowledged to be as fit a man as any in the nation to detect and censure them  the court of king edward vi and indeed the whole frame of his government was in as great disorder as almost any court or any government could be in the worst of times the example of the young king was noble and instructive and would by degrees no doubt have had its influence but as he was now only a boy and in the hands of others he had little weight nor was the protector a man qualified to curb licentious spirits he was of an easy nature and though he wished to see things in order yet he could contribute little more than a good example to keep them so as the principal springs were thus weak it is no wonder if the inferior movements were irregular a minority was thought the season for every one to make his claim and such claims were made by all who had any pretensions to courtfavours as equally surprised and scandalized all sober observers the spoils of an hundred and sixty monasteries instead of satisfying had increased the avarice of the courtiers having already pruned away all the superfluous parts and much superfluity there was from the revenues of the church they began now to lop off those vital branches which were necessary for its support insomuch that there was scarce a benefice in the nation of any considerable value on which some greedy courtier was not pensioned to this insatiable avarice was added a licentiousness of manners beyond the example of former times  a court thus corrupt produced its necessary consequence corruption in every order of the state never was justice worse administered never were the dispensers of it more venal the public offices too were equally corrupt especially those of the revenue where most scandalous depredations were made nor did the country retain its innocence here the gentry practiced those arts of avarice and rapine which they had learned at court and taught the people all those vices to which indigence gives birth while the clergy instead of qualifying in some degree this corrupt mass by a mixture of piety and devotion incorporated with it and even increased its malignity by an addition of as bad if not of worse ingredients  this was the state of practical religion in the nation when mr latimer was called to the office of a courtpreacher as to his sermons which are still extant they are far from being exact pieces of composition elegant writing was then little known some polite scholars there were cheek ascham and a few others who from an acquaintance with classical learning of which they were the restorers began to think in a new manner and could treat a subject with accuracy at least if not with elegance but in general the writers of that age and especially the churchmen were equally incorrect in their composition and slovenly in their language we must not therefore expect that mr latimers discourses will stand a critical inquiry they are at best loose incoherent pieces yet his simplicity and low familiarity his humor and gibing drollery were well adapted to the times and his oratory according to the mode of eloquence at that day was exceeding popular his manner of preaching too was very affecting and no wonder for he spoke immediately from his heart  his abilities however as an orator made only the inferior part of his character as a preacher what particularly recommends him is that noble and apostolic zeal which he exerts in the cause of truth and sure no one had an higher sense of what became his office was less influenced by any sinister motive or durst with more freedom reprove vice however dignified by worldly distinctions  it is in this light then in which i would particularly recommend him and shall therefore in the following pages give the reader some instances in his own words of that spirit with which he lashed the courtly vices of his time  in his first sermon which is addressed chiefly to the king he opens his commission the preacher says he cannot correct the king if he be a transgressor with the temporal sword but with the spiritual fearing no man setting god only before his eyes under whom he is a minister to root up vice let the preacher therefore never fear to declare the message of god and if the king will not hear then let the preacher admonish him pray for him and so leave him unto god he then proceeds to point out to the king his duty in several instances  in his second sermon he lashes the clergy it is a marvel says he if any mischief be in hand if a priest be not at one end of it  i will be a suitor to your grace to give your bishops charge ere they go home upon their allegiance to look better to their flock and if they be found negligent out with them i require it in gods behalf make them quondams all the pack of them your majesty has diverse of your chaplains well learned men and of good knowledge to put in their place and yet you have some that are bad enough hangers on of the court i mean not these but if your majestys chaplains and my lord protectors be not able to furnish their places there is in this realm thanks be to god a great sight of laymen welllearned in the scriptures and of a virtuous and godly converstion better learned than a great sight of us the clergy this i move of conscience to your grace and let them not only do the function of bishops but live of the same and not as in many places that one should have the name and another the profit what an enormity is this for a man to serve in a civility and have the profit of a provostship and a deanery and a parsonage but i will tell you what is like to come of it it will bring the clergy shortly into very slavery  but i fear one thing that for saving a little money you will put chantrypriests into benefices christ bought souls with his blood and will you sell them for gold arid silver i would not have you do with chantrypriests as was done with abbots for when their enormities were first read in the parliament they were so abominable that there was nothing but down with them but within a while after the same abbots were made bishops as there be some of them yet alive to save their pensions o lord think you that god is a fool and sees it not  afterward warning the king against flatterers he tells him that god says if the king shall do his will he shall reign long he and his children wherefore says he i would have your grace remember this and when any of these flatterers and flibbergibbers another day shall come and claw you by the back and say sir trouble not yourself what should you study for why should you do this or that your grace may answer them thus what sirrah i perceive you are weary of us does not god say in such a place that a king should fear god that he may reign long i perceive now that thou art a traitor tell him this tale once and i warrant you he will come no more to you  he then speaks of the delay of justice and the abuses in the law i hear of many matters says he before my lord protector and my lord chancellor that cannot be heard i must desire my lord protectors grace to hear me in this matter and that your grace would likewise hear poor mens suits yourself put them to none other to be heard let them not be delayed the saying is now that money is heard every where if a man be rich he shall soon have an end of his matter others are fain to go home with tears for any help they can obtain at any judges hand hear mens suits yourself i require you in gods behalf and put them not to the hearing of these velvetcoats and upskips now a man can scarce know them from ancient knights of the country  a gentlewoman came to me and told me that a certain great man keeps some lands of hers from her and that in a whole year she could but get one day for the hearing of her matter and on that day the great man brought on his side a sight of lawyers for his counsel and that she had but one man of the law and the great man so shakes him that he cannot tell what to do so that when the matter came to the point the judge was a mean to the gentlewoman that she would let the great man have a quietness in her land i beseech your grace that you will look to these matters hear them yourself view your judges and hear poor mens causes and you proud judges hearken what god says in his holy book hear the poor says he as well as the rich mark that saying thou proud judge the devil will bring this sentence at the day of doom hell will be full of such judges if they repent not and amend they are worse than the wicked judge christ speaks of for they will neither hear men for gods sake nor fear of the world nor importunity nor any thing else yea some of them will command them to ward if they be importunate i heard say that when a suitor came to one of them he said what fellow is it that gives these folks counsel to be so importunate he should be committed to ward marry sir commit me then it is even i that gave them that counsel and if you amend not i will cause them to cry out upon you still even as long as i live  in this third sermon he lashes the judges again nowadays says he the judges are afraid to hear a poor man against the rich they will either pronounce against him or drive off the suit that he shall not be able to go through with it but the greatest man in the realm cannot so hurt a judge as a poor widow such a shrewd turn can she do him the cries of the poor ascend to heaven and call down vengeance from god  cambises was a great emperor such another as our master is he had many lord presidents lord deputies and lieutenants under him it chanced he had under him in one of his dominions a briber a gifttaker a gratifier of rich men the cry of a poor widow came to the emperors ears upon which be layed the judge quick and laid his skin in the chair of judgment that all judges that should give judgment afterward should sit in the same skin surely it was a goodly sign the sign of the judges skin i pray god we may once see the sign of the skin in england  before he concludes he speaks of the progress of the reformation it was yet he said but a minglemangle and a hotchpotch i cannot tell what says he partly popery and partly true religion mingled together they say in my country when they call their hogs to the swinetrough come to thy minglemangle come pur come even so do they make minglemangle of the gospel they can clatter and prate of it but when all comes to all they joined popery so with it that they marred all together  in this sermon too he inveighs against debasing the coin and shows the bad consequences of it the passage is quoted at length by mr folks in his treatise upon english coins  in his fourth sermon he again taxes the bishops thou shall not says he addressing himself to the king be partaker of other mens sins so says st paul and what is it to be a partaker of other mens sins if it be not so to make unpreaching prelates and to suffer them to continue still in their unpreaching prelacy if the king should suffer these things and look through his fingers and wink at them should not the king be a partaker of other mens sins and why is he not supreme head of the church what is the supremacy a dignity and nothing else is it not accountable i think verily it will be a chargeable dignity when account shall be asked of it  if the salt is unsavory it is good for nothing by this salt is understood preachers and if it is good for nothing it should be cast out out with them then cast them out of their office what should they do with cures that will not look to them  oh that a man might have the contemplation of hell that the devil would allow a man to look into it and see its state as he showed all the world when he tempted christ in the wilderness on yonder side would the devil say are punished unpreaching prelates i think verily a man might see as far as a kenning as far as from calais to dover i warrant you and see nothing but unpreaching prelates  as for them i never look to have their good words as long as i live yet will i speak of their wickedness as long as i shall be permitted to speak no preacher can pass it over in silence it is the original root of all mischief as for me i owe them no other ill will but to pray god to amend them i would have them do their duty i owe them no other malice than this and this is none at all  in his fifth sermon he again lashes the judges and patrons of livings if a judge ys he should ask me the way to hell i uld show him this way first let him be covetous man then let him go a little rther and take bribes and lastly let him pervert judgment lo here is the mother and the daughter and the daughters daughter  avarice is the mother she brings i the bribetaking and bribetaking perverting of judgment there lacks a fourth thing to make up the mess which so god help  if i were judge should be a tyburn tippit were it the judge of the kings bench my lord chief judge of england yea were it my lord chancellor himself to tyburn with him   one will say peradventure you speak unmly so to be against the officers for taking of rewards you consider not the matter to the bottom their offices be bought for great sums now how should they receive their money again but by bribing you would not have them undone some of them give two hundred pounds some five hundred some two thousand and how can they gather up this money again but by helping themselves in their office  and is it so trow ye are civil offices bought for money lord god who would have thought it it oh that your grace would seek through your realm for men meet for offices yea and give them liberally for their pains rather than that they should give money for them this buying of offices is a making of bribery for he that buyeth must needs sell you should seek out for offices wise men and men of activity that have stomachs to do their business not milksops nor whitelivered knights but fearers of god for he that fears god will be no briber  but perhaps you will say we touch no bribes no marry but my mistress your wife has a fine finger she touches it for you or else you have a servant who will say if you will offer my master a yoke of oxen you will fare never the worse but i think my master will not take them when he has offered them to the master then comes another servant and says if you will carry them to the clerk of the kitchen you will be remembered the better this is a frierly fashion they will receive no money in their hands but will have it put upon their sleeves  speaking of venal patrons he cries but o lord in what case are we i marvel the ground gapes not and devours us surely if they used their religion so in turkey the turk used not to suffer it in his commonwealth patrons are charged to see the office done not to get lucre by his patronship there was a patron in england that had a benefice fallen into his hand and a good brother of mine came unto him and brought him thirty apples in a dish which he gave to his man to carry to his master having presented them he said sir such a man has sent you a dish of fruit and desires yon to be good to him for such a benefice tush quoth he this is no apple matter i will have hone of his apples i have as good as these in my own orchard the man came to the priest again and told him what his master said then quoth the priest desire but to prove one of them for my sake he shall find them better than they look for upon this he cut one of them and found ten pieces of gold in it marry quoth he this is a good apple the priest standing not far off hearing what the gentleman said cried out they all grow on one tree i warrant you sir and have all one taste well this is a good fellow let him have the benefice quoth the patron get you but a graft of this tree and it will serve you in better stead i warrant you than all st pauls learning but let patrons take heed for they shall answer for all the souls that perish through their default and yet this is taken for a laughing matter  i desire your majesty to remedy these matters and see redress in this realm in your own person although my lord protector i doubt not and the rest of the council do in the mean time all that lies in their power to redress things  he begins his sixth sermon with taxing the fashionable vices of the age he begins with duelling and exclaims against the remissness of the law in punishing it i do not know says he what you call chancemedley in the law the law is not my study i am a scholar in scripture in gods book i study that and i know what is murder in the sight of god i fall out with a man he is angry with me and i with him and lacking opportunity and place we put it off for that time in the mean season i prepare my weapon and sharp it against another time i swell and boil in my mind against my adversary i seek him we meddle together it is my chance by reason my weapon is better than his and so forth to kill him i give him his death stroke in my vengeance this i call voluntary murder from scripture what it is in the law i cannot tell  a searcher in london executing his office displeased a merchant they had words and the merchant kills him they that told me this tale say it is winked at they look through their fingers and will not see it whether it is taken up with a pardon or not i know not but this i am sure of that if you bear with such matters the devil will bear you away to hell  o lord what whoredom is used nowadays it is marvel that the earth gapeth not and swalloweth us up god has suffered long of his great mercy but he will punish sharply at length if we do not repent  there are such dicinghouses also they say as have not been wont to be where young gentlemen dice away their thrift and where dicing is there are other follies also for the love of god let remedy be had men of england in time past when they would exercise themselves were wont to go abroad in the fields a shooting the art of shooting has been in times past much esteemed in the realm in which we excel all other nations in my time my poor father was as diligent to teach me to shoot as to learn me any other thing and so i think other men did their children he taught me how to draw how to lay my body in my bow and to draw not with strength of arm as other nations do but with strength of body but now we have taken up whoring in towns instead of shooting in fields i desire you my lords even as you have the honor of god at heart and intend to remove his indignation let there be sent forth some proclamation some sharp proclamation to the justices of peace for they do not their duty justices now be no justices  in the following part of his discourses he ridicules an argument for the popes supremacy made use of by cardinal pool in his book against king henry jesus comes says he to simons boat now come the papists and they will make a mystery of it they will pick out the supremacy of the bishop of rome in peters boat we may make allegories enough of every part of scripture but surely it must needs be a simple matter that stands on so weak a ground if you ask why to simons boat rather than to any other i will answer as i find by experience in myself i came hither today from lambeth in a wherry and when i came to take my boat the watermen came about me as the manner is and he would have me and he would have me i took one of them now you will ask me why i came in that boat rather than any other why because it was next me and stood more commodiously for me and so did christ by simons boat it stood nearer to him or mayhap he saw a better seat in it  it follows in the text that he taught sitting preachers belike were sitters in those days i would our preachers would preach either sitting or standing  the text does not tell us what he taught if i were a papist now i could tell you what he said as pope nicholas and bishop lanfrank did who tell us that christ said thus peter i do mean by thus sitting in thy boat that thou go to rome and be bishop there five and twenty years after mine ascension and that all thy successors shall be rulers of the universal church after thee  well it follows in the text launch out into the deep here peter was made a great man and all his successors after him say the papists and their argument is this he spoke to peter only and in the singular number therefore he gave him preeminence above the rest a goodly argument i wene it to be a syllogismus well i will make a like argument our savior christ said to judas when he was about to betray him what thou do do quickly he spoke in the singular number to him therefore he gave him preeminence  belike he made him a cardinal and it might full well be for they have followed judas ever since  in this sermon likewise he again attacks the clergy christ tells us says he it behoved him to preach the gospel for therefore was he sent is it a mavelous thing that our unpreaching prelates can read this place and yet preach so little as they do i marvel that they can go quietly to bed  the devil has set up a state of unpreaching prelacy these seven hundred years and has made unpreaching prelates  i heard of a bishop of england that went on a visitation and when he should have been rung into the town as the custom is the great bells clapper was fallen down there was a great matter made of this and the chief of the parish were much blamed for it in the visitation and the bishop was somewhat quick with them they made their answers and excused themselves as well as they could it was a chance they said and it should be amended as shortly as it might be among them there was one wiser than the rest who comes up to the bishop why my lord says he does your lordship make so great a matter of the bell that lacks a clapper here is a bell says he and pointed to the pulpit that has lacked a clapper these twenty years i warrant you this bishop was an unpreaching prelate he could find fault with the bell that wanted a clapper to ring him into town but he could find no fault with the parson that preached not at his benefice  i came once myself to a place riding on a journey and sent word overnight into the town that i would preach there in the morning because it was a holiday the church stood in my way and i took my horse and rode thither thinking i should have found a great company at church when i came there the churchdoor was fast locked i tarried there half an hour and more at last one of the parish comes to me and says sir this is a busy day with us we cannot hear you it is robin hoods day the parish are gone abroad to gather for robin hood i pray you hinder them not and so i was fain to give place to robin hood and all this comes of unpreaching prelates if the bishops had been preachers there should never have been any such thing  they upbraid the people with ignorance when they were the cause of it themselves  he concludes his sermon with an address to the king i know no man says he that has greater labor than the king what is his labor to study gods book to see that there be no unpreaching prelates in his realm nor bribing judges to see to all estates to provide for the poor to see that victuals are good and cheap and is not this a labor trow ye  christ teaches us by his example that he abhors all idleness when he was a carpenter he did the work of his calling and when he was a preacher he did the work of that calling he was no unpreaching prelate  his seventh sermon was preached upon good friday and is adapted to the day it affords little opportunity therefore of dwelling upon the corruptions of the age he begins with recapitulating the subjects of his former discourses i have entreated says he of such matters as i thought fit for this auditory i have had ado with many estates even with the highest of all i have entreated of the duty of kings of the duty of magistrates and judges and of the duty of prelates and i think there is none of us neither preacher nor hearer but may be amended and redress our lives we may all say yea all the pack of us we have sinned with our fathers and done wickedly  you that be of the court and especially the sworn chaplains beware of a lesson which a great man taught me upon my first coming to court he told it me for good will and thought it well you must beware said he however you do not to contrary the king let him have his sayings and go with him marry out upon this counsel shall i say as he says ay your conscience or else what a worm shall you feel gnawing what remorse shall you have when you remember how you have slacked your duty  in this sermon he gives his opinion of the fathers having found fault with an interpretation which origin has given of a passage of scripture these doctors says he we have great cause to bless god for but i would not have them always allowed they have handled many points of our faith very godly and we may have a great stay upon them in many things we might not well lack them but yet i would not have men to be sworn to them and so addict as to take hand over head whatsoever they say it were a great inconvenience so to do  in his last sermon which he acquaints his audience shall be the last be will ever preach in that place he touches upon all the particular corruptions of the age he begins it thus take heed and beware of covetousness take heed and beware of covetousness take heed and beware of covetousness take heed and beware of covetousness and what if i should say nothing else these three or four hours but these words  great complaints there are of it and much crying out and much preaching but little amendment that i can see  covetousness is the root of all evil then have at the root out with your swords ye preachers and strike at the root stand not ticking and toying at the branches for new branches will spring out again but strike at the root and fear not these great men these men of power these oppressors of the needy fear them not but strike at the root  in this sermon he addresses himself frequently and with great freedom to the king i come now says he rather as a suitor to your majesty than a preacher for i come to take my last farewell in this place and here i will ask a petition for the love of god take an order for marriages here in england there is much adultery nowadays not only in the nobility but among the inferior sort i could wish therefore that a law might be provided in this behalf and that adulterers might be punished with death if the husband or wife should become suitor they might be pardoned the first time but not the second  and here i have another suit to your majesty when you come to age beware what persons you have about you for if you be set on pleasure or disposed to wantonness you shall have ministers enough to be fartherers and instrumentss of it  fear not foreign princes and foreign powers god shall make you strong enough fear him fear not them peradventure you shall have that shall move you and say unto you oh sir such a one is a mighty prince and a king of great power you cannot be without his friendship agree with him in religion or else you shall have him your enemy well fear them not cleave to god and he shall defend you though you should have that would turn with you yea even in their white rochets  beware therefore of two affections fear and love and i require you look to your office yourself and lay not all on the officers backs receive bills of supplication yourself i do not see you do nowadays as you were wont to do last year poor men put up bills every day and never the nearer begin therefore doing of your office yourself now when you are young and sit once or twice in the week in council among your lords it will cause things to have good success and matters will not be so lingered from day to day  with equal spirit he taxes the inferior orders of men ye noblemen says he i wot not what rule ye keep but for gods sake hear the complaints of the poor many complain against you that ye lie in bed till eight nine or ten oclock i cannot tell what revel ye have over night whether banqueting dicing carding or how it is but in the morning when poor suitors come to your houses ye cannot be spoke with they are kept sometimes without your gates or if they be let into the hall or some outer chamber out comes one or other sir you cannot speak with my lord yet he is asleep and thus poor suitors are driven from day to day that they cannot speak with you for gods love look better to it speak with poor men when they come to your houses and dispatch poor suitors i went one day myself betimes in the morning to a great mans house to speak with him of business and methought i was up betimes but when i came thither the great man was gone forth about such affairs as behoved him well thought i this is well i like this this man does somewhat regard his duty i came too late for my own matter and lost my journey but i was glad to be so beguiled for gods sake ye great men follow this example rise in the mornings be ready for suitors that resort to you and dispatch them out of hand  in the city of corinth one had married his stepmother he was a jolly fellow a great rich man belike an alderman of the city and so they winked at it and would not meddle with the matter but st paul hearing of it wrote unto them and in gods behalf charged them to do away such abomination from among them nor would he leave them till he had excommunicated that wicked person if ye now should excommunicate all such wicked persons there would be much ado in england but the magistrates show favor to such and will not suffer them to be rooted out or put to shame oh he is such a mans servant we may not meddle with him oh he is a gentleman we may not put him to shame and so lechery is used throughout all england and such lechery as is used in no other part of the world and yet it is made a matter of sport a laughing matter not to be heeded but beware ye magistrates for gods love beware of this leaven i would wish that mosess law might be restored for punishment of lechery  fear not man but god if there be a judgment between a poor man and a great man what must there be a corruption of justice oh he is a great man i dare not displease him fie upon thee art thou a judge and wilt be afraid to give right judgment fear him not be he never so great a man but uprightly do true justice likewise some pastors go from their cure they are afraid of the plague they dare not come nigh any sick body but hire others and they go away themselves out upon thee the wolf comes upon thy flock to devour them and when they have most need of thee thou runnest away from them the soldier also that should go to war will draw back as much as he can oh i shall be slain oh such and such went and never came back such men went into norfolk and were slain there but if the king commands thee to go thou art bound to go follow thy occupation in serving the king thou shall serve god  ye bribers that go secretly about taking bribes have in your minds when ye devise your secret fetches how elizeuss servant was served and was openly known for gods proverb will be true there is nothing hid that shall not be revealed he that took the silver basin and ewer for a bribe thinks that it will never come out but he may now know that i know it and not only i but there be many more that know it it will never be merry in england till we have the skins of such for what needs bribing where men do their business uprightly i have to lay out for the king three thousand pounds well when i have laid it out and bring in mine account i must give three hundred marks to have my bills warranted if i have done truly and uprightly what need i give a penny to have my bills warranted if i do bring in a true account wherefore should one groat be given smell ye nothing in this what need any bribes be given except the bills be false  well such practice has been in england but beware it will out one day  and here now i would speak to you my masters minters augmentationers receivers surveyors and auditors ye are known well enough what ye were before ye came to your offices and what lands ye had then and what ye have purchased since and what buildings ye make daily well i doubt not but there be some good officers among you but i will not swear for all  and for the love of god let poor workmen be paid they make their moan that they can get no money the poor laborers gunmakers powdermen bowmakers arrowmakers smiths carpenters and other crafts cry for their wages they be unpaid some of them three or four months some of them half a year yea some of them put up bills this time twelve month for their money and cannot be paid yet  the first lent i preached here i preached of restitution restitution quoth some what should he preach of restitution let him preach of contrition and let restitution alone we can never make restitution then say i if thou will not make restitution thou shall go to the devil now choose thee either restitution or damnation there be two kinds of restitution secret and open and whether of the two be used if restitution be made it is well enough at my first preaching of restitution one man took remorse of conscience and acknowledged to me that he had deceived the king and was willing to make restitution so the first lent twenty pounds came to my hands for the kings use i was promised twenty pounds more the same lent but it could not be made up so that it came not well the next lent came three hundred and twenty pounds more i received it myself and paid it to the kings council there i was asked what he was that had thus made restitution but should i have named him nay they should as soon have had this wesand of mine well now this lent came one hundred and eighty pounds more which i have paid this present day to the kings council and so this man has made a goodly restitution if every one who has beguiled the king said i to a certain nobleman who is one of the kings council should make restitution after this sort it would cough up the king i warrant you twenty thousand pounds yea quoth the other a whole hundred thousand pounds alack alack make restitution for gods sake make restitution you will cough in hell else that all the devils will laugh at your coughing there is no remedy restitution or hell now this is of secret restitution some examples have been of open restitution i am not afraid to name one it was master sherington an honest gentleman and one that god loves he openly confessed that he had deceived the king and made open restitution oh what an argument may he have against the devil  i will conclude these extracts with his own apology for his free speaking england says he cannot abide this geer it cannot hear gods minister and his threatening against sin though the sermon be never so good and never so true strait he is a seditious fellow he makes trouble and rebellion in the realm he lacks discretion the ninevites rebuked not jonas that he lacked discretion or that he spoke out of time but in england if gods preacher be any thing quick or speak sharply then he is a foolish fellow and lacks discretion nowadays if they cannot reprove the doctrine they will reprove the preacher what preach such things now he should have respect to the time and the state of things it rejoiceth me when my friends tell me that people find fault with my discretion for by likelihood think i the doctrine is true for if they could find fault with the doctrine they would not charge me with the lack of discretion or the inconveniency of the time i will ask you a question i pray you when should jonas have preached against the covetousness of nineveh if the covetous men should have appointed him his time i know that preachers ought to have discretion in their preaching and that they ought to have a consideration and respect to the place and the time where and when they preach and i say here what i would not say in the country for no good but what then sin must be rebuked sin must be plainly spoken against  thus far mr latimer superior to all corruption himself he kept in awe a licentious court nor will the reader take offense at my multiplying upon him so many large quotations i not only thought them very valuable remains but a very necessary ornament likewise to this part of my history for it would have been impossible to have given a true idea in any words but his own of that noble zeal in the cause of truth which upon all occasions he exerted and which makes so principal a part of his character nor can we wonder at the effect of his preaching when we consider its freedom he charged vice so home upon the consciences of the guilty that he left no room for selfdeceit or misapplication it being a more necessary part in his opinion of the preachers office to rouse men into a sense of their guilt than to discourse them merely in the didactic strain inasmuch as most men know more than they practice  section ix while mr latimer was thus discharging the duty of a court preacher a slander past upon him which being taken up by a low historian of those times has found its way into these the matter of it is that after the lord high admirals attainder and execution which happened about this time mr latimer publicly defended his death in a sermon before the king that he aspersed his character and that he did it merely to pay a servile compliment to the protector the first part of the charge is true but the second and third are false  as for his aspersing the admirals character his character was so bad there was no room for aspersion a more debauched person has rarely infested a court than he was during the last reign but years growing upon him and his appetite for pleasure abating his passions took a new course and from a voluptuous he became an ambitious man the pravity of his disposition however continued the same though the object of his pursuit was altered having married the queen dowager of england he began to raise his expectations to great heights but enlarging his views still farther as he rose and finding his marriage an encumbrance to him he eased himself of it as is generally suspected by unfair means this was done to make way for the princess elizabeth to whose bed he aspired and by her means to the crown but being disappointed of this he entered into cabals against his brother the protector set himself at the head of a party and went so far as even to coin money and raise troops threatening to take the king and the government out of his brothers hands for these treasonable actions and after frequent and fruitless admonitions from his brother he was sentenced to lose his head having been prosecuted according to the usual but inequitable practice of those times by a bill in parliament though there was matter enough to have condemned him in a fairer trial  but though the lord sudley paid only so due a forfeit to the laws of his country and had indeed been used with much greater tenderness than his offenses deserved yet his death occasioned great clamor and was made use of by the lords of the opposition for he left a very dissatisfied party behind him as a handle to raise a popular odium against the protector  mr latimer had always a high esteem for the protector he thought him an honest and a good man and of better intentions toward the public than any of the lords at that time about the king he was mortified therefore to see so invidious and base an opposition thwarting the schemes of so publicspirited a man and endeavored to lessen the odium by showing the admirals character in its true light from some anecdotes not commonly known  since therefore mr latimers behavior in this instance may be so fairly accounted for and since his whole character was so contradictory to any sinister practice i persuade myself that i have said enough to wipe this reproach from his memory what could induce that man to flatter the great who for the sake of truth had voluntarily resigned one of the highest offices in his profession and which when voluntarily offered to him again he had refused a man too who had taken all opportunities of inveighing against the vices of the greatest personages with a freedom which in the strictest times would have been admired so improbable indeed the slander is that i should not have taken the pains i have taken to confute it if it had not been credited at least recorded as credible by so great a man as our countryman john milton who being a warm partywriter in the republican times of the oliverian usurpation suffers his zeal against episcopacy in more instances than this to bias his veracity or at best to impose upon his understanding  but though the protector had thus triumphed over the wicked practices of his brother he did not long survive him the opposition soon revived under another and a more formidable head the duke of northumland  this nobleman was the son of that infamous dudley who in the days of henry vii drew upon himself the odium of the nation by the invidious employment he held under that avaricious prince when henry viii came to the crown he sacrificed the father to the resentment of the people and raised the son to be a peer of the realm but during the reign of this prince he never appeared of prime consideration in the public eye in king edwards reign he showed himself with distinction enough he was a man of unlicenced pleasure and unbounded ambition more debauched if possible and more aspiring than even the lord sudley and by far more dangerous inasmuch as he was more artful than he more deep more specious and more prudent he was at the same time so resolute and daring that nothing arduous or dangerous ever checked him in a word he had more mischievous designs and better abilities to do mischief than any man of his time excepting only the bishop of winchester  this person had long viewed the protector with an eye of jealousy and hatred he was agitating great schemes for the agrandizement of his family and knew that while the protector lived he could but little advance them resolving therefore to rid himself of this obstacle he laid a train with equal malice and dexterity which in the end effected his design the protector entangled in his contrivances lost his life and left an open field for the machinations of his enemy  from this time i meet with no accounts of mr latimer during the remainder of king edwards reign it seems most probable that upon this revolution at court he retired into the country and made use of the kings license as a general preacher in those parts where he thought his labors might be most useful i shall however for the sake of connection sketch out the intervening history of those times till we meet with mr latimer again in the order of them  after the protectors death the duke of northumberland became allpowerful at court and soon began to execute the wicked projects he had planned his first step was to bring about a marriage between his son guilford dudley and the eldest daughter of the house of suffolk a house nearly related to the crown  about the time when this alliance was concluded the king fell sick and his distemper increasing though the symptoms were not yet violent the duke advised the settlement of the succession great objections were made to the princess mary on the account of her religion and objections were made both to her and her sister on the account of their illegitimacy but though they had an act of parliament in their favor by the dukes management they were both set aside and the crown was settled upon his daughterinlaw the lady jane gray who upon the kings death which happened soon after was proclaimed queen of england the world observing how aptly the kings death coincided with the dukes designs had little reason to doubt of its being a projected part of a regular plan  thus far the duke succeeded to his wish and found a more general concurrence in the officers of state and judges than he could have expected but in the midst of this tranquillity a sudden storm arose  the princess mary of whom he fatally thought himself too secure found adherents in many parts of the nation most of whom nothing but their great aversion to the dukes government could have drawn to her party her power daily increasing the duke led an army against her but his efforts were vain while his forces were continually diminishing by revolts he was thunderstruck with news from london that the council had deserted him and had proclaimed queen mary thus forsaken of all his friends like other disappointed villains he forsook himself and agonizing for some time under the pangs of baffled guilt and ambition he gave at last a temporary case to his distracted thoughts by submitting himself to the queens mercy and if every servile compliance even to the abjuring the religion he had all his life professed could have saved him he had been saved but his crimes exceeded forgiveness he was given up therefore to justice and ended his life upon a scaffold  with him fell his new creation queen jane an incomparable lady endowed with every virtue unfortunate only in having been made the tool of a practiced villain  queen mary having thus obtained the crown began next to think of settling her government religion was her first care as to her own principles they were well known though she had temporized under her father with a good share of compliance and had made promises too upon her advancement to the crown that she would introduce no public change in the established religion but promises of this kind met with easy dispensations she resolved therefore as soon as she could to restore popery and reconcile the nation to the sea of rome  her chief ministers in this design were stephen gardener now made lord chancellor and edmund bonner bishop of london  the former of these persons has already been often mentioned in a disadvantageous light he was a man indeed formed by nature as it should seem to do mischief he had a bad heart a clear head quick parts improved by long practice in the world and a dark inscrutable mind in which he treasured up every thing that passed by him and laying things together with wonderful sagacity formed the deepest schemes these he could with great judgment adapt to circumstances as they arose and what cunning and dissimulation could not effect in which he excelled all men of his time he went through with by a cool and yet dauntless resolution he was naturally fierce and cruel and this temper was inflamed by the usage he had met with which was indeed but indifferent under king edward so that he bent himself to persecution in the full spirit of retaliation  the bishop of london had formerly maintained an interest with henry viii by means of the lowest adulation to which that prince was very open and though he went along with the innovations of that reign yet when queen mary began to look among her friends his sufferings under king edward were accepted as an atonement hitherto he had acted in disguise but finding himself now free from all restraint the whole man appeared and sure the genius of popery had never a more proper subject to work on he was a man of violent passions and those of the sanguine kind of little observation and knowledge and without any judgment as if just prepared for the infusions of blind zeal and prejudice  these were the persons from whose counsels upon the present revolution of government the settlement of religion was expected bonner was indeed little more than an agent in the hands of gardener who on many occasions chose rather to sit concealed and work mischief by proxy it suited the darkness of his disposition and he found in bonner an instrument entirely adapted to his purpose open ears an impetuous temper raging zeal a hardened heart and an obstinate perseverance so that gardener had only to wind him up occasionally and give him a proper direction and the zealot moved with the regularity of a machine and with what impetuosity his director impressed  the introduction of popery being thus resolved on the first step which was taken was to prohibit all preaching throughout the kingdom and to license only such as were known to be popishly inclined  the queens designs being now every where apparent the reformed clergy presently took the alarm they saw their parishes about to be corrupted by romish preachers who spread themselves over the nation in great numbers and thinking in the primitive manner that it was right to obey god rather than man they resolved to endure the worst for the sake of their religion many of them therefore preached with great freedom in their accustomed manner against the doctrines of popery and to set them an example archbishop cranmer drew up a very free paper by way of protestation against the mass which got abroad before he published it upon this he was sent for by the council and being questioned about it he boldly answered the paper was his and he was only sorry that he had not fixed it as he intended with his hand and seal upon st pauls gate most men wondered that he was suffered to escape but it was thought more prudent to begin with the inferior clergy accordingly a strict inquiry was made after the more forward and popular preachers and many of them were taken into custody some without any cause alleged particularly rogers and bradford who had used their popularity in no instance since the late change of government but in rescuing a popish priest from an enraged multitude after these others of more distinction were imprisoned and in a little time the archbishop himself  section x while this severe inquiry was carrying on in london mr latimer was in the country where he continued preaching in his usual manner unaffected by the danger of the times but he did not long enjoy this liberty the bishop of winchester who had proscribed him with the first sent a messenger to cite him before the council he had notice of this design some hours before the messengers arrival but he made no use of the intelligence like other eminent reformers of that time he chose rather to meet than avoid a question thinking that he could not give a nobler testimony to the uprightness of his conscience than by showing the world it was a sufficient security to him in whatever dangers it might involve him  the messenger therefore found him equipped for his journey at which expressing his surprise mr latimer told him that he was as ready to attend him to london thus called upon to answer for his faith as he ever was to take any journey in his life and that he doubted not but that god who had already enabled him to stand before two princes would enable him to stand before a third the messenger then acquainting him that he had no orders to seize his person delivered a letter and departed from which it is plain they chose rather to drive him out of the kingdom than to bring him to any public question they well knew the firmness of his mind and were afraid as mr fox observes lest his constancy should deface them in their popery and confirm the godly in the truth  mr latimer however opening the letter and finding it to contain a citation from the council resolved to obey it he set out therefore immediately for london as he passed through smithfield where heretics were usually burnt he said cheerfully this place has long groaned for me the next morning he waited upon the council who having loaded him with many severe reproaches sent him to the tower  this was but a repetition of a former part of his life only he now met with harsher treatment and had more frequent occasion to exercise his resignation which virtue no man possessed in a larger measure nayeven the usual cheerfulness of his disposition did not now forsake him of which we have one instance still remaining  a servant leaving his apartment mr latimer called after him and bid him tell his master that unless he took better care of him he would certainly escape him upon this message the lieutenant with some discomposure in his countenance came to mr latimer and desired an explanation of what he had said to his servant why you expect i suppose sir replied mr latimer that i should be burned but if you do not allow me a little fire this frosty weather i can tell you i shall first be starved  in the mean time the bishop of winchester and his friends held frequent councils on public affairs and endeavored to impose upon the world by making it believe that reason as well as power was on their side with this view it was resolved that when the convocation met the argument between the papists and protestants should be handled but gardener was a better politician than to commit a matter of such consequence to a fair debate he had provided for the success therefore by modelling a convocation to his mind in which only six protestant divines got admittance by this junto points of divinity and articles of faith were settled  the protestants as they very well might were loud in their clamor against such manifest partiality and made so fair a representation of the disingenuous treatment they had received that gardener found his cause rather injured by what he had done than promoted he resolved therefore to do something in the same way less liable to exception and soon after it was given out that the controversy between the papists and protestants should be finally determined in a solemn disputation to be held at oxford between the most eminent divines on each side and so far the papists acted honestly for cranmer ridley and latimer who were confessedly the most eminent divines of their party and were designed for this employment by the expectation of all men who wished well to truth were appointed to manage the dispute on the part of the protestant accordingly they were taken out of the tower where they had all been imprisoned and were sent to oxford  of these three ridley was generally esteemed the most eminent for parts and learning as indeed he was superior in these points to most men of the age in which he lived he possessed likewise in a great degree all those valuable qualities which make a man amiable in society all the virtues of humanity were kneaded in his composition through cranmers recommendation in king edwards time he was promoted to the bishopric of london over which he presided with that exemplary luster which piety and virtue add to eminence of station in the beginning of queen mary he was involved with the first in the troubles of the times which no man endured with greater constancy  the protestant disputants being thus appointed proper persons were next thought on to oppose them at length it was determined to assign this office to dr weston prolocutor of the convocation and an assembly of divines chosen out of both universities letters therefore were dispatched to oxford to put all things in readiness and soon after to cambridge where commissioners were immediately appointed  in the mean time mr latimer and his companions were closely confined at oxford in the common prison deprived of every comfort but what their own breasts could administer how free the disputation was likely to be they might easily imagine when they found themselves denied the use even of books and pen and ink their prisonhours however were not spent in vain lamentations their religion raised them above all human sufferings and all mortal fears  their chief resource was in prayer in which exercise they spent great part of every day mr latimer particularly would often continue kneeling till he was not able to rise without help the principal subject of his prayers was that god would enable him to maintain the profession of his religion to the last that god would again restore his gospel to england and preserve the princess elizabeth to be a comfort to this land  mr fox has preserved a conference afterward put into writing which was held at this time between bishop ridley and bishop latimer as it is worth the readers notice and may without any great interruption be inserted in this place i shall take such passages from it as i shall think worth preserving  the two bishops are represented fitting in their prison ruminating upon the solemn preparations then making for their trial of which probably they were now first informed bishop ridley first broke silence the time said he is now come we are now called upon either to deny our faith or to suffer death in its defense you mr latimer are an old soldier of christ and have frequently withstood the fear of death whereas i am raw in the service and unexperienced with this preface he introduces a request that mr latimer whom he calls his father would hear him propose such arguments as he thinks it most likely his adversaries would urge against him and assist him in providing himself with proper answers to them to this mr latimer in his usual strain of good humor answered that he fansied the good bishop was treating him as he remembered mr bilney used formerly to do who when he wanted to teach him would always do it under color of being taught himself but in the present case says he my lord i am determined for myself to give them very little trouble i shall just offer them a plain account of my faith and shall say very little more for i know any thing more will be to no purpose they talk of a free disputation but i am well assured their grand argument will be as it was once their forefathers we have a law and by our law ye ought to die however upon mr ridleys pressing his request they entered upon the examination he desired  this part of their conference contains little of curious only the common arguments against the tenets of popery when they had finished this exercise ridley breaks out in this pathetic strain  thus you see good father how i would prepare myself for my adversary and how i would learn by practice to be expert in those weapons which i shall presently be obliged to wield in tinedale upon the borders of scotland the place of my nativity i have known my countrymen watch night and day in arms especially when they had notice of any intended inroad from the scots and though by such bravery many of them lost their lives yet they defended their country died in a good cause and intailed the love of the neighborhood upon their posterity and shall not we watch in the cause of christ and in the defense of our religion whereon depend all our hopes of immortality shall we not go always armed ever ready to receive a watchful foe let us then awake and taking the cross upon our shoulders let us follow our captain christ who by his own blood has hallowed the way that leads to god  thus good father i have opened my heart freely unto you and now methinks i see you just about to lift up your eyes to heaven in your accustomed manner and turning your prophetical countenance upon me thus to speak trust not my son i pray you vouchsafe me the honor of this name for in it i shall think myself both honored by you and loved trust not i say my son to these wordweapons but remember what our lord says it shall be given you in that same hour what you shall speak pray for me o father pray for me that i may throw my whole care upon god and may trust in him only in my distresses  of my prayers replied the old bishop you may be well assured nor do i doubt but i shall have yours in return and indeed prayer and patience should be our great resources for myself had i the learning of st paul i should think it ill laid out upon an elaborate defense yet our case my lord admits of comfort our enemies can do no more than god permits and god is faithful who will not suffer us to be tempted above our strength be at a point with them stand to that and let them say and do what they please to use many words would be vain yet it is requisite to give a reasonable account of your faith if they will quietly hear you for other things in a wicked judgmenthall a man may keep silence after the example of christ as for their sophistry you know falsehood may often be displayed in the colors of truth but above all things be upon your guard against the fear of death this is the great argument you must oppose  poor shaxton it is to be feared this argument had the greatest weight in his recantation but let us be steadfast and unmovable assuring ourselves that we cannot be more happy than by being such philippians as not only believe in christ but dare suffer for his sake  with such noble fortitude and such exalted sentiments were these two great reformers of religion inspired  but we must now leave them in their prison and introduce a scene of a different kind  section xi we left the cambridge commissioners setting out in great pomp for oxford where they arrived on the   th of april      here they were received with a profusion of academical compliments conferring of degrees speeches feasts and processions forms were then adjusted and a method in their proceedings agreed on by the commissioners  in this commission were joined thirtythree persons to run over a catalogue of their names would be needless as the greater part of them were men of no note it is no breach of charity to say they were only distinguished from each other by different degrees of bigotry and ignorance  some among them were of more consequence weston smith tresham and chedsey  weston was a man of considerable learning which gave him great reputation with his party in all points of divinity his judgment was esteemed decisive and none was thought more worthy to preside over the convocation his religion however was only in his head it made no impression upon his heart yet he maintained a decent outside and had the address to pass off in the world a great share of spiritual pride for sanctity of manners till having at length the misfortune to be taken in adultery he was generally known he was at this time however in the meridian of his credit  smith was a mere temporizer and had all his life taken his creed from the establishment he had been bred a papist and had written with some credit against priests marriage but when protestantism took the lead he got himself recommended through cranmers means to the reigning powers and to establish himself the better promised to confute his own book but before his treatise was finished the times changed and his faith changing with them he was again taken notice of by the heads of the prevailing religion his pen recommending him which was easy and elegant while the story of his having agreed to confute his own book which was indeed a fact was imputed only to the malice of the adverse party  tresham was an orthodox divine but one of those heavy mortals who have great learning and no sense he was a bigot in the last degree but the following story will give a just idea of his character when queen mary began to think of restoring the old religion at oxford dr tresham then subdean of christchurch was among those who were trusted by her in this business calling together therefore the members of his college he recommended popery to them in a set oration and having talked over all the commonplace arguments with sufficient prolixity he emphatically concluded with telling them that a parcel of very fine copes had been made to go to windsor but that the queen had been so gracious as to send them to christchurch and that if they would go to mass they should each have one that upon that condition he would moreover procure for them the ladybell at bampton which would make christchurch bells the sweetest of any in england and that lastly he would give them as fine a watersprinkle as eyes ever beheld  but among them all chedsey was by far the most considerable he was indeed a very able man for parts and learning few of his time went beyond him but he too had a ductile faith which had been wholly guided by that of his superiors he made atonement however for his temporising under king edward by his zeal in persecuting under queen mary  these persons having now received all the civilities which the zeal of oxford could express and having settled all previous punctilios proceeded to business arraying themselves therefore in scarlet they met at st marys church where seating themselves before the altar and placing the prolocutor in the midst they sent for the prisoners  the crowd soon made way for archbishop cranmer who was brought in by a guard of armed men when the tumult was a little composed the prolocutor made a short oration to his audience in praise of religious unity and then turning to the archbishop he reminded him of the pious education he had received in an orthodox seminary of the eminent station he had held under a catholic king and of his long attachment to popery he then spoke with an affected concern of his shameful apostasy and of the several errors which had crept into the church while he presided over it lastly he acquainted him with the design of their present meeting informing him that the convocation by her majestys order taking into consideration his apostasy and that of his brethren had commissioned them to endeavor to bring them back to their mother church that for this end certain articles had been drawn up which the convocation had signed and which it was expected that he too and his brethren would either subscribe or confute  the prolocutor then ordered the articles to be read aloud which were these  the natural body of christ is really in the sacrament after the words spoken by the priest  in the sacrament after the words of consecration no other substance does remain than the substance of the body and blood of christ  in the mass is a sacrifice propitiatory for the sins of the quick and dead  the articles being read the archbishop desiring leave read them over to himself three or four times and then asking a few pertinent questions with regard to the import of some of the terms with some earnestness denied them all i am as great a friend said he gentlemen to unity as any of you but i can never think of making falsehood the bond of peace the prolocutor making no reply ordered a copy of the articles to be delivered to him and fixed a day on which he told him he expected he would publicly maintain his negative  dr ridley was next brought in who without any hesitation denied the articles upon which the prolocutor appointed him likewise a disputationday and dismissed him  bishop latimer was brought in last like a primitive martyr in his prison attire he had a cap upon his head buttoned under his chin a pair of spectacles hanging at his breast a new testament under his arm and a staff in his hand he was almost spent with pressing through the crowd and the prolocutor ordering a chair to be brought for him he walked up to it and saying he was a very old man sat down without any ceremony the articles were then tendered to him which he denied the prolocutor upon this telling him that he must dispute on the wednesday following the old bishop with as much cheerfulness as he would have shown upon the most ordinary occasion shaking his palsied head answered smiling indeed gentlemen i am just as well qualified to be made governor of calais he then complained that he was very old and very infirm and said that he had the use of no book but of that under his arm which he had read seven times over deliberately without finding the least mention made of the mass in this speech he gave great offense by saying in his humourous way alluding to transubstantiation that he could find neither the marrowbones nor the sinews of the mass in the new testament upon which the prolocutor cried out with some warmth that he would make him find both and when mr latimer recollecting himself was going to explain his meaning in that expression he was not suffered to speak  thus the assembly broke up having observed upon the whole more decency and goodmanners than was generally expected  at length the appointed day came for the archbishops disputation you might have known something very uncommon was in agitation for the whole university was in motion almost at daybreak the schools were thronged about eight the commissioners took their seats and presently afterward the archbishop was brought in guarded  but i will not delay the reader with the particulars of this day nor of that on which bishop ridley disputed i shall only say in general for the sake of truth that the papists do not seem to have justice done them by their protestant adversaries let these put what gloss upon the affair they please the papists certainly had the better of the argument on both those days the case was this they drew their chief proofs in favor of transubstantiation from the fathers many of whom and foam of the more esteemed writers among them speak on this subject in a language by no means evangelical the two bishops accordingly being thus pressed by an authority which they durst not reject were not a little embarrassed and indeed how could a protestant divine defend such a passage as this from st chrysostom what a miracle is this he who sits above with the father at the very same instant of time is handled with the hands of men or such a passage as this from the same writer that which is in the cup is the same which flowed from the side of christ or this from theophilact because we would abhor the eating of raw flesh and especially human flesh therefore it appears as bread though it is indeed flesh or this from st austin christ was carried in his own hands when he said this is my body or this from justin martyr we are taught that when this nourishing food is consecrated it becomes the flesh and blood of christ or this from st ambrose it is bread before it is consecrated but when that ceremony has passed upon it of bread it becomes the flesh of christ of all these passages and many others of the same kind the papists with not a little dexterity made their avail the two bishops in the mean time instead of disavowing an insufficient authority weakly defended a good cause evading and distinguishing after the manner of schoolmen ridleys defense indeed was very animated for he had great quickness of parts as well as learning cranmers was no way extraordinary through his great modesty he seems to have been overawed by his audience and yet ridley would have acted as wise a part if he had taken his friend bishop latimers advice and contented himself with giving a reasonable account of his faith i shall only add that these disputations were very tumultuous and accompanied with great indecency both of language and behavior on the part of the papist  the day after the bishop of london disputed bishop latimer was called into the schools of this day i shall be more particular  section xii the commissioners being now seated the audience formed and the tumult of a crowd in some degree subsided dr weston the prolocutor rising up acquainted his hearers that the cause of their meeting was to defend the orthodox doctrine of transubstantiation and to confute certain novel opinions which had been lately propagated with great zeal in the nation and of you father said he turning to the old bishop i beg if you have any thing to say that you will be as concise as possible this was spoken in latin upon which the bishop answered i hope sir you will give me leave to speak what i have to speak in english i have been very little conversant in the latin tongue these twenty years the prolocutor consented and the bishop having thanked him replied i will just beg leave then sir to protest my faith indeed i am not able to dispute i will protest my faith and you may then do with me just what you please  upon this he took a paper out of his pocket and began to read his protestation but he had not proceeded many minutes when a murmur arose on every hand increasing by degrees into a clamor which the prolocutor was so far from checking that in a very indecent manner he patronized it calling out with some circumstances of rudeness upon the bishop to desist  the old man surprised with this sudden tumult of illmanners paused in admiration at it but presently recovering himself he turned to the prolocutor and said with some vehemence in my time i have spoken before two kings and have been heard for some hours together without interruption here i cannot be permitted one quarter of an hour  dr weston i have frequently heard of you before but i think i never saw you till now i perceive you have great wit and great learning god grant you may make a right use of these gifts other things he said but these are the principal his speech had its effect the prolocutor took his paper and said he would read it himself but whether he could not read it or would not he presently laid it down and called out to the bishop since you refuse to dispute will you then subscribe upon his answering in the negative weston artfully leads him by a train of familiar questions into an argument and when he thought he had raised him to a proper pitch he gave a sign to dr smith the opponent to begin who being prepared immediately rises up and in a pompous manner prefaces the disputation and gives out the question when he had done the old bishop gravely answered i am sorry sir that this worshipful audience must be disappointed in their expectation  i have already spoken my mind  the prolocutor observing this begins again in his artful manner to draw mr latimer into an argument pray said he sir how long have you been in prison  about nine months sir  but i was imprisoned said weston six years  i am heartily sorry for it sir  i think you were once mr latimer of our way of thinking  i was sir  i have heard too that you have said mass in your time  i have sir  he then asked him why he altered his opinion and thus by degrees led him to answer the chief arguments brought from scripture in favor of transubstantiation they then began to ply him with the fathers and first a passage from hillary was quoted as he was about to answer one of the commissioners called out to him on account of the populace most probably mr latimer speak in latin speak in latin i know you can do it if you please but the bishop saying he had the prolocutors leave went on in english and told them that as for the passage from hillary which they had quoted he really could not see that it made much for them but he would answer them by another quotation from melancthon who says that if the fathers had foreseen how much weight their authority was to have in this controversy they would have written with more caution  but the opponent not being satisfied with this begs leave to reduce the words of hillary into a syllogistic argument and begins thus such as is the unity of our flesh with christs flesh such nay greater is the unity of christ with the father  but the unity of christs flesh with our flesh is true and substantial  therefore the unity of christ with the father is true and substantial  here he paused expecting that the bishop would deny his major or his minor as the logicians speak but instead of that he answered gravely you may go on sir if you please but upon my word i do not understand you  the jargon of this learned doctor being silenced others attacked him but with equal success he answered their questions as far as civility required but none of them could engage him in any formal disputation and when proofs from the fathers were multiplied upon him he at length told them plainly that such proofs had no weight with him that the fathers no doubt were often deceived and that he never depended upon them but when they depended upon scripture then you are not of st chrysostoms faith replied his antagonist nor of st austins i have told you said mr latimer i am not except when they bring scripture for what they say  little more was said when the prolocutor finding it was impossible to urge him into a controversy rose up and dissolved the assembly crying out to the populace here you all see the weakness of heresy against the truth here is a man who adhering to his errors has given up the gospel and rejected the fathers the old bishop made no reply but wrapping his gown about him and taking up his new testament and his staff walked out as unconcerned as he came in  thus he maintained to the last his resolution of not disputing a resolution which he had not hastily taken mr addison in his    th spectator greatly admires his behavior on this occasion though he does not assign it to its true cause this venerable old man says he knowing how his abilities were impaired by age and that it was impossible for him to recollect all those reasons which had directed him in the choice of his religion left his companions who were in the full possession of their parts and learning to baffle and confound their antagonists by the force of reason as for himself he only repeated to his adversaries the articles in which he firmly believed and in the profession of which he was determined to die  the truth is he knew it would answer no end to be more explicit  these solemn disputations being thus at an end nothing now remained but to pass sentence on the friday following therefore the commissioners seated in their accustomed form sent for the three bishops to st marys church where after some affected exhortations to recant the prolocutor first excommunicated and then condemned them as soon as the sentence was read bishop latimer lifting up his eyes cried out i thank god most heartily that he has prolonged my life to this end to which the prolocutor replied if you go to heaven in this faith i am thoroughly persuaded i shall never get there  the next day a grand procession was made in which the host by way of triumph was carried in state under a canopy  these eminent persons being thus convicted of heresy and delivered over to the secular arm various were the opinions of men concerning them some thought the queen was inclined to mercy and it was confidently reported that the three bishops would be removed indeed from interfering publicly with religion but that very liberally pensioned they should in other respects have no cause to complain while some again as positively affirmed their measure would be very hard as the queen it was well known would never forgive the hand they had had in her mothers divorce and the separation from the church of rome but these were only the popular conjectures of the time none of them founded on truth for the councils which determined the fates of these great men had not yet birth  section xiii queen mary how zealous soever in the cause of popery was not yet at leisure to attend the settlement of it she had in general schemed it but had laid out no measures civil affairs were at this time more her concern than ecclesiastical the tower was full of state prisoners yet undisposed of her title to the crown was not yet confirmed nor her cabinet formed a dangerous insurrection had been moved in essex and a seditious spirit was still at work in many parts of the nation particularly in the capital discovering itself in riots and loud murmurs to these things the queens marriage succeeded as another obstacle to the immediate settlement of religion  at length however an area was cleared for the scene of blood about to be exhibited and from this time to the conclusion of the queens reign the establishment of popery was the single point in view every national concern in the mean time both at home and abroad being either made subservient to it or neglected  the first effort of the ministry was to gain a parliamentary concurrence king edwards laws against popery were still in force and the nation of course in a state of separation from rome but in those days when prerogative ran high the parliament was little more than an echo to the cabinet the queen therefore found it an easy matter to arm herself with what powers she wanted one act cancelled a whole reign statutes against heresy were revived and england was again prepared for the popish yoke  an account of these happy events was presently dispatched to rome where it created the face of a jubilee the pope laid aside his longconceived displeasure accepted the penitent nation and easily consented to send over cardinal pool into england to make up the breach in quality of his legate  cardinal pool of the blood royal of england was as much known in the world as any churchman of his time and as generally esteemed he might have been at the head of the reformation under henry viii but he chose rather to court the favors of the pope with whom to ingratiate himself he treated henry then beginning to innovate in a manner which drew upon him a bill of attainder but as rome was the situation he chose his exile was the less grievous here his influence was so great that he aspired to the papacy and he would have carried his point if his honesty had permitted him to have engaged thoroughly in the intrigues of the conclave this disappointment awaked his philosophy and he retired from the world into a monastery of benedictines near verona here he was contemplating the vanity of all earthly things when he received a gracious letter from the queen of england pressing his return to his native country with all assurances of favor immediately his eyes were opened and he found that instead of sound philosophy he had been indulging only a reverie of melancholy as soon as possible therefore he set out for england where he was received in great form and placed at the head of ecclesiastical affairs and to do him justice he became his station he was a great and a good man moderate in his opinions and prudent in his behavior and would certainly have prevented those reproaches on his religion which this reign occasioned had his resolution been equal to his judgment  the parliament having with all obsequiousness done beyond what was expected toward the introduction of popery and being now no longer wanted was at length dissolved about the beginning of the year       the cardinal immediately began to act calling a council therefore of bishops he proposed to their consideration the settlement of religion and when many things had been said on that subject and some things agreed on they fell next on the treatment of heretics for mv own part said the cardinal i think we should be content with the public restoration of religion and instead of irritating our adversaries by a rigorous execution of the revived statutes i could wish that every bishop in his diocese would try the more winning expedients of gentleness and persuasion he then urged the example of the emperor charles v who by a severe persecution of the lutherans involved himself in many difficulties and purchased nothing but dishonor  to this the bishop of winchester answered that in his opinion it was the same thing not to have a law and not to execute one that some blood must be shed that he was not an advocate for a general massacre to shake the leaves he said was of little avail he would have the ax laid to the root of the tree the bishops and most forward preachers ought certainly to die the rest were of no consequence  he had scarce sat down when the bishop of london who always took his temper from winchester starting up vehemently prosecuted the same subject and having said many things with great fierceness of language concluded with freely offering himself to be the minister of the severest measures they could propose i cannot said he my lords act canonically any where but in my own diocese and there i shall desire no mans help or countenance and for those who are not in my jurisdiction let them only be sent up to me and lodged in any of my prisons and when i have got them there god do so to bonner and more also if one of them escape me  others spoke in the council but all in the same violent strain the result was a commission was issued out by the cardinal impowering winchester london and other bishops to try and examine heretics agreeably to the laws which were now revived  then followed times unparalleled in english story dreadful times which might well take for their motto that verse in homer  through the dusky air the pyres thickflaming shot a dismal glare pope   times when all sober men beheld with horror furious bigots dragging away with horrid zeal men women and children guilty of no civil offense by companies together and delivering them up to tortures and cruel deaths when they saw a religion breathing peace and charity propagated by such acts of blood as would have disgraced even the rites of an heathen moloc the whole nation stood aghast fear and distrust and jealousy were spread through every part and forced men into retirements where they mourned in secret a parent a brother a son the hopes of their family singled out for their conspicuous piety  happy were they who escaping the inquisition of those times fled naked and destitute into foreign countries where they found a retreat even in exile  section xiv the rage of this persecution had now continued yet unabated near three quarters of a year the archbishop of canterbury and the two bishops ridley and latimer were still in prison unmolested and they who were acquainted with the bishop of winchesters maxims and knew that he had the direction of affairs were surprised at this lenity and at a loss for the reason of it  in answer to this popular inquiry it was given out that an oversight had been committed in condemning these bishops before the statutes on which they were condemned had been revived that a commission therefore from rome was necessary for a new trial that this had been sent for but the delays of that court were notorious and in part this was fact for they had indeed been too hasty in condemning the three bishops however afterward the whole truth appeared when it was found that these delays which had been charged upon the court of rome were really occasioned by the bishop of winchester himself  it was the secret grief of that ambitious prelate that there was one still higher than himself in ecclesiastical affairs the cardinals hat on the head of pool and the popes authority had long been the objects of his envy with all his subtilty and address therefore he was now secretly working the cardinals ruin he had his agents in rome who were throwing out hints in the conclave that the bishop of winchester wanted an associate of equal spirit with himself that the legate was not hearty in the business and that his lenity to the protestants only too much showed his inclination toward them  the circumstances of the time likewise favored gardiners ambition for he knew that cardinal carraffa who had just obtained the pontificate had no friendship for pool with whom formerly he had sharp disputes the designing prelate therefore was in great hopes that his scheme would take effect and when pool was removed he made no doubt but he had interest to succeed him  but this was only an under part in his scheme he knew and was distressed in knowing that the archbishopric of canterbury upon the death of cranmer was intended for the legate this dignity his heart was set on of which he made himself sure upon the removal of pool with this view he did what he could to delay the execution of cranmer till the legate was recalled and his own head ready for the mitre  these delays however at length grew notorious and occasioned some clamor among the warmer papists and winchester finding himself pressed by the curiosity of some and the zeal of others was obliged in part at least to abandon his scheme it was his original design as less liable to suspicion to have treated the three bishops in the same way however now to wipe off the offense that had been taken he resolved to give up ridley and latimer to their immediate fate and to delay cranmers execution by procuring a different form of process against him  the chief obstacle therefore being now removed a commission soon came from rome directed to the cardinal who immediately named the bishops of lincoln gloucester and bristol his commissioners to execute it  the rumor of this commission spread an universal alarm for with regard to the fates of these eminent persons the expectation of men had now almost totally subsided and being renewed held them doubly attentive while the exulting papist on one side and the desponding protestant on the other stood prepared to see in this stroke the completion of their hopes and fears  great were the preparations in the mean time at oxford to receive the commissioners for as this was the first judicial act since the restoration of popery in which the pope interfered the utmost respect which the university could pay was deemed only a proper testimony of its zeal these compliments being sufficiently discharged on the  0th of september      the commissioners seating themselves in great state in the divinityschool the two bishops were called before them the bishop of london was first questioned then bishop latimer was brought in to whom lincoln who was a polite and very eloquent man spoke to this effect  this parchment mr latimer contains a commission from my lord cardinal under his holiness directed to me and these two reverend prelates by which we are enjoined to examine you upon some points of faith in which your orthodoxy is doubted we are required to press you to revoke your errors if you still hold these pernicious opinions and to cut you off from the church if you persist and give you up to the civil power  confider mr latimer it is not more than twenty years since these novel opinions got footing amongst us till then the authority of the church of rome was universally acknowledged by what means it was first questioned in england and on what unjustifiable motives a schism was occasioned i might easily show at large  but i spare the dead let it suffice that the nation having long sought rest in a multiplicity of new inventions and found none has again submitted itself to its mother church and by one unanimous act the result of penitence and contrition has atoned for its apostasy why then should you oppose the unanimity of a whole people confess your fault and unite your penitence with theirs it has been a common error let it be a general humiliation among such numbers the shame of each individual will be lost come then in peace for we will kindly receive you into the bosom of that church whose authority derived from the first apostle depends on scriptures fathers and councils that church within which there can be no error and without which there can be no salvation  let me then in the spirit of charity beseech you to accept this offered mercy let me even implore you not to reduce us to the fatal necessity of cutting you off from the church and leaving you to the vengeance of the civil power spare yourself accelerate not your death consider the condition of your soul remember it is the cause not the death that makes the martyr humble yourself captivate your understanding subdue your reason submit yourself to the determination of the church and for gods sake force us not to do all we may do but let us rest in what we have done  here the bishop pausing mr latimer stood up and thanked him for his gentle treatment of him but at the same time assured him how vain it was to expect from him any acknowledgment of the pope he did not believe he said that any such jurisdiction had been given to the sea of rome nor had the bishops of rome behaved as if their power had been from god he then quoted a popish book which had lately been written to show how grossly the papists would misrepresent scripture and concluded with saying that he thought the clergy had nothing to do with temporal power nor ought ever to be entrusted with it and that their commission from their master in his opinion extended no farther than to the discharge of their pastoral functions  to this the bishop of lincoln replied that he thought his style not quite so decent as it might be and that as to the book which he quoted he knew nothing of it  at this the old bishop seemed to express his surprise and told him that although he did not know the author of it yet it was written by a person of name the bishop of gloucester  this produced some mirth among the audience as the bishop of gloucester sat then upon the bench that prelate finding himself thus publicly challenged rose up and addressing himself to mr latimer paid him some compliments upon his learning and then spoke in vindication of his book but his zeal carrying him too far the bishop of lincoln interrupting him said we came not here my lord to dispute with mr latimer but to take his answer to certain articles which shall be proposed to him  these articles were much the same as those on which he had been brought to dispute the year before they were accordingly read and mr latimer answered them all as he then did at the same time protesting which protestation he begged might be registered that notwithstanding his answers to the popes commissioners he by no means acknowledged the authority of the pope the notaries having taken down his answers and protestation the bishop of lincoln told him that as far as he could he would show lenity to him that the answers which he had now given in should not be prejudicial to him but that he should be called upon the next morning when he might make what alterations he pleased and that he hoped in god he would then find him in a better temper to this the old bishop answered that he begged they would do with him then just what they pleased and that he might not trouble them nor they him another day that as to his opinions he was fixed in them and that any respite would be needless the bishop however told him that he must appear the next morning and then dissolved the assembly  accordingly the next morning the commissioners sitting in the same form he was brought in and when the tumult was composed the bishop of lincoln told him that although he might justly have proceeded to judgment against him the day before especially as he himself had required it yet he could not help postponing it one day longer in hopes said he sir that you might reason yourself into a better way of thinking and at length embrace what we all so much desire that mercy which our holy church now for the last time offers to you  alas my lord answered mr latimer your indulgence is to no purpose when a man is convinced of a truth even to deliberate is unlawful i am fully resolved against the church of rome and once for all my answer is i never will embrace its communion if you urge me farther i will reply as st cyprian did on a like occasion he stood before his judges upon a charge of heresy and being asked which were more probably of the church of christ he and his party who were every where despised or they his judges who were every where in esteem he answered resolutely that christ had decided that point when he mentioned it as a mark of his disciples that they should take up their cross and follow him if this then my lords be one of the characteristics of the christian church whether shall we denominate by that name the church of rome which has always been a persecutor or that small body of christians which is persecuted by it  you mention sir replied lincoln with a bad grace your cause and st cyprians together they are wholly different  no my lord answered the old bishop his was the word of god and so is mine  but the bishop of lincoln not caring to have this argument moved any farther replied that he exceeded his commission in giving leave for any reasoning or debates that he had granted this indulgence in hopes of its success but observing a contrary effect he would not he said trespass any longer upon the patience of his audience by these unprofitable altercations he proceeded therefore immediately to take mr latimers final answer to the articles which he gave as he had done before and accompanied with the same protestation  the notaries having now closed the books the bishop of lincoln who through the whole of this cruel business had acted with as much humanity rather than decency as was possible once more pressed mr latimer in a very pathetic manner to retract his opinion but being answered by a steady negative he at length passed sentence upon him  mr latimer then asked him whether there laid any appeal from this judgment to whom said the bishop of lincoln would you appeal to the next general council answered mr latimer that shall be regularly assembled it will be a long time replied the bishop before europe will see such a council as you mean having said this he committed mr latimer to the custody of the mayor and dissolved the assembly  on the same day likewise sentence was passed on the bishop of london  the   th of october about a fortnight from this time was fixed for their execution  in the mean time as it was feared this affair might occasion some disturbance the queen wrote to the lord williams of them a popular nobleman in those parts and ordered him to arm a body of the militia and repair immediately to oxford  these preparations and what others were necessary being made the last scene of this tragedy was opened  section xv on the northside of the town near baliolcollege a spot of ground was chosen for the place of execution hither on the sixteenth the vice chancellor of oxford and other persons of distinction appointed for that purpose repaired early in the morning and the lord williams having drawn his guard round the place the prisoners were sent for  the bishop of london first entered this dreadful circle accompanied by the mayor soon after bishop latimer was brought in the former was dressed in his episcopal habit the latter as usual in his prisonattire this difference in their dress made a moving contrast and augmented the concern of the spectators the bishop of london showing what they had before been bishop latimer what they were now reduced to  while they stood before the stake about to epare themselves for the fire they were informed they must first hear a sermon and soon after dr smith of whom mention has already been made ascended a pulpit prepared for that purpose and preached on these words of st paul though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profits me nothing in his discourse he treated the two bishops with great inhumanity aspersing both their characters and tenets  the sermon being ended the bishop of london was beginning to say something in defense of himself when the vice chancellor starting up suddenly from his seat ran toward him and stopping his mouth with his hand told him that if he was going to recant he should have leave but he should be permitted in nothing farther the bishop thus checked looking round with a noble air cried out we commit our cause then to almighty god  immediately an officer stepped up and acquainted them that at their leisure they might now make ready for the stake  the attention of the spectators at length burst into tears when they saw these two venerable men now preparing for death when they considered as mr fox observes their preferments the places of honor they held in the commonwealth the favor they stood in with their princes their great learning and greater piety they were overwhelmed with sorrow to see so much dignity so much honor so much estimation so many godly virtues the study of so many years and so much excellent learning about to be consumed in one moment  mr latimer having thrown off the old gown which was wrapped about him appeared in a shroud prepared for the purpose and whereas before says mr fox he seemed a withered and crooked old man he now stood bolt upright as comely a father as one might lightly behold  being thus ready he recommended his soul to god and delivered himself to the executioner saying to the bishop of london we shall this day my lord light such a candle in england as shall never be extinguished  but i will draw a veil over the conclusion of this shocking scene and only add that he went through his last sufferings with that composure and firmness of mind which nothing but a sound faith and a good conscience could produce  such was the life of hugh latimer bishop of worcester one of the leaders of that glorious army of martyrs who introduced the reformation in england he had a happy temper formed on the principles of christian philosophy such was his cheerfulness that none of the accidents of life could discompose him such was his fortitude that not even the severest trials could unman him he had a collected spirit and on no occasion wanted a resource he could retire within himself and hold the world at defiance  and as danger could not daunt so neither could ambition allure him though conversant in courts and intimate with princes he preserved to the last a rare instance moderation his primeval plainness  in his profession he was indefatigable and that he might bestow as much time as possible on the active part of it he allowed himself only those hours for his private studies when the busy world is at rest constantly rising at all seasons of the year by two in the morning  how conscientious he was in the discharge of the public parts of his office we have many examples no man could persuade more forcibly no man could exert on proper occasions a more commanding severity the wicked in whatever station he rebuked with censorian dignity and awed vice more than the penal laws he was not esteemed a very learned man for he cultivated only useful learning and that he thought laid in a very narrow compass he never engaged in worldly affairs thinking that a clergyman ought to employ himself only in his profession thus he lived rather a good than what the world calls a great man he had not those commanding talents which give superiority in business but for honesty and sincerity of heart for true simplicity of manners for apostolic zeal in the cause of religion and for every virtue both of a public and private kind that should adorn the life of a christian he was eminent and exemplary beyond most men of his own or of any other time well deserving that evangelical commendation with the testimony of a good conscience in simplicity and godly sincerity not with fleshly wisdom but by the grace of god he had his conversation in the world  index a alesse a scotsman of that name brought by
