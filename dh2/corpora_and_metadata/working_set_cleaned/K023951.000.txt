the case of the apothecaries to prevent the mischiefs arising from ignorance or temerity in the administration of medicines king henry the viiith by his charter established the college of physicians excluding all persons who should not be lisenced by them from the practice of physic within london and seven miles thereof which charter was soon afterward confirmed by parliament and the said exclusion from practice extended all over england  and to prevent the like mischiefs in the preparation of medicines the said college were by subsequent acts directed to elect yearly four of their fellows who after taking an oath of office were empowered with the assistance of the wardens of the company of grocers and apothecaries to visit all apothecaries houses within london only and to destroy such drugs and medicines as they should find defective which power of visitation was afterward by a charter of king james the is it extended to the distance of seven miles round london  but the exercise of this last power being limited to four persons the same appeared to sir theodore de mayerne and henry atkins physicians to king james the is it and who being the then most illustrious members of the college may be supposed to declare the sense of the whole body so very insufficient for suppressing the variety of abuses intended to be remedied that at their desire and for the more effectually preventing those abuses the said king very soon after by another charter formed the apothecaries of london into a distinct society with the like powers of visitation and expressly prohibited all persons from exercising the business of an apothecary within seven miles of london unless first examined approved and licensed by the said society  true it is that the validity of the said charter being doubtful and the extent of the powers thereby granted uncertain and there being no provision for rectifying any abuse of those powers the said society have ever been very cautious in the exercise thereof and of late years especially have kept up the form only of a visitation whence it has happened that several ignorant and illiterate persons have been encouraged to enter upon the business of an apothecary whilst others of perhaps a more regular education and better knowledge have in order to engross the trade by underselling the fair apothecary ventured to compound their medicines of damaged stale and counterfeit ingredients so that upon the whole great quantities of pernicious medicines have been sold in the neighborhood of london and transmitted into all parts of the kingdom  these practices being notorious the college in      procured the act of parliament now proposed to be revived to establish their power of visitation agreeable to their charter but a clause having upon their attempt to obtain a bill for reviving the said act in      been added by a committee of the house of commons for granting an appeal from the judgment of the censors to six physicians and six apothecaries to be determined upon oath and in case of equality of voices by the opinion of the president or vice president of the college the said bill was dropped and the college have not since thought proper to apply for any bill of that kind notwithstanding the continuance and daily increase of the bad practices abovementioned  at length several apothecaries whose profession affords them but too frequent opportunities of observing the extent and mischievous effects of those bad practices thought it their duty as well in regard to the public as themselves to represent the same to the legislature  in consequence of this application the house of commons have been pleased to order in a bill to revive explain and amend the said act passed in      from which order the said petitioners conceive that honorable house was satisfied of the insufficiency of a mere revival of the said act and therefore they submit the following amendments or alterations as what they humbly apprehend will render the said act most effectual on the one hand and prevent any abuse of the powers thereby granted on the other viz  i that the court of assistants of the apothecaries shall yearly elect ten sufficiently skillful persons to be called examiners of apothecaries and fortyeight or any other competent number to be called examiners of medicines who shall all be sworn to the due execution of their respective offices ii that for the future no person except the present members of the society who have been already examined shall within seven miles of london exercise the art of an apothecary unless first examined and approved by three or more of the said examiners of apothecaries and licensed to exercise the same by letters testimonial under the seal of the said society iii that any person rejected by the said examiners may have an appeal to the president and censors of the college and if approved by them shall be licenced by the said society iv that there shall be paid to the said society for every examination and license  and no more and that every such licensed person shall during his continuance in the business pay as the freemen of the said society do the yearly sum of six shillings to be appropriated to the supporting the botannical garden at chelsea to which he and his apprentices shall have liberty to resort for their instruction in botany v that in lieu of the said censors the said examiners of medicines or any four of them shall have power whenever they shall think fit and be obliged as often as the court of assistants shall think proper to go upon the visitation and thereupon to enter any house etc of any person within the limits aforesaid who shall prepare or keep for sale any compound medicines and to examine the same and destroy such as they shall adjudge bad vi that any person shall have liberty to appeal from the judgment of the said examiners to the said president or vice president and censors whose determination shall be final the medicine complained of to be in the mean time conveyed to the college vii that in all cases of appeal the said examiners as well as the parties appellant may produce witnesses to be examined upon oath either as to their knowledge or opinion of the preparation in question viii that every person convicted by the said examiners unless their judgment is reversed within  of selling or keeping for sale any adulterated or pernicious medicine shall forfeit the sum of  ix that persons obstructing the said examiners in the execution of their office shall forfeit the sum of  x that all penalties shall go one half to any person who will sue for the same and the other half to the poor of the parish where the offender shall reside these amendments the petitioners humbly conceive will appear to be proper and necesary for the following reasons viz  that the four censor who must be presumed to be as the law requires the best learned est and most  of their profession and consequently most employed cannot spare sufficient leisure to attend the visitation so diligently and frequently as they ought without great loss to themselves and to the public who may want their assistance in another way  that their number even if they were to give their utmost attention and dedicate their whole time to this duty would not be sufficient to visit all apothecaries shops within london and seven miles thereof which upon a fair computation will appear to be upwards of a thousand  that the original jurisdiction and the determination on the appeal ought not to be in the same body the members of which may be supposed tender of each others reputation and the general character of their community  that neither the censors in the  instance nor the president and fellows upon the appeal are by the said act put under the restriction of any particular oath  that by the said act no provision is made for preventing persons from entering upon the business of pharmacy who have not been properly instructed therein and who consequently require a much stricter and more frequent visitation than any reasonable number of visitors can possibly attend  that the only punishment provided by the said act for keeping any adulterated or pernicious medicine for sale is the destroying it which in most instances as medicines are principally adulterated for the sake of saving the expensive ingredients is a very trifling punishment by no means adequate to the offense  these alterations in the act it is humbly conceived will answer all the salutary intentions of the honorable house of commons and yet preserve to the society of apothecaries the privileges granted to them by their charter privileges so far from being unreasonable in their own nature that parliament has thought proper to grant or confirm the like to the college of physicians and company of surgeons and that without any of those guards against the abuse of power which the petitioners propose and desire may be provided in their case nor can the said college and company but approve in the society of apothecaries a constitution which in their own respective bodies they have by long experience found to be highly beneficial to the public  with respect to the college it is true the power of visitation which has hitherto been exercised by their censors and the wardens of the society of apothecaries in conjunction is by these alterations proposed to be wholly vested in sworn examiners of the said society but then in lieu thereof the said college are intended to be vested with a superior jurisdiction and control which the petitioners humbly conceive is more suitable not only to the convenience but dignity of that learned body and from the abovementioned testimony of sir theodore de mayerne and dr atkins as well as from the nature of the thing itself it appears that the apothecaries are very properly qualified for the visitation hereby proposed to be entrusted with them  as to the persons who will be immediately affected by the examination intended by these amendments  it is submitted whether it can be thought an hardship to oblige those who will engage in a profession of so much consequence to the public to give a test of their ability and fitness for it and as they will become entitled to several of the privileges without being subject to the many burdensome and expensive offices of the said society it is but reasonable that they should contribute something toward defraying the additional expenses which these new duties will occasion  the application of the yearly sum of six shillings it is likewise hoped will be thought so very useful to the public that no objection can be made to so trifling a demand  the said society do at an expense too great for their present circumstances endeavor to maintain a botanical garden which the munificence of that great patron of natural and useful knowledge sir hans sloane has enabled them to establish a matter in several foreign cities thought worthy of the public care at this garden at present furnished with as great a number of plants as perhaps any in europe a demonstrator is appointed by the society to instruct their members and pupils in this necessary branch of pharmacy and to superintend at proper times herborizations in the neighborhood of london of all which advantages the said licentiates and their apprentices will be entitled to partake  upon the whole the petitioners humbly hope the public will by these proposals be satisfied that they have no unreasonable views of enriching the society of which they are members or of procuring any particular advantage to themselves their sole intention in offering to take this burden upon them being that they may contribute as much as in them lies to the preventing frauds in their profession and as a proof that they have no oppressive views they decline no appeal to any jurisdiction the legislature shall think proper not desiring to be trusted with a power over others which they would be sorry to see granted to any over themselves neither do they wish for more than a temporary probation of their scheme that so if it shall be found hurtful or ineffectual it may not be intailed upon posterity  the case of the apothecaries
