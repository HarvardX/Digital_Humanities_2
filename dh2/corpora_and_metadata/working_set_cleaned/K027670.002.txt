letters of the late rev mr laurence stern to his most intimate friends  with a fragment in the manner of rabelais  to which are prefixed memoirs of his life and family written by himself and published by his daughter mrs medalle  in three volumes  vol ii  london printed for t becket the corner of the adelphi in the strand       letters letter xxvii to lady d paris july        i will not send your ladyship the trifles you bid me purchase without a line i am very well pleased with paris  indeed i meet with so many civilities amongst the people here that i must sing their praises  the french have a great deal of urbanity in their composition and to stay a little time amongst them will be agreeable  i splutter french so as to be understood  but i have had a droll adventure here in which my latin was of some service to me  i had hired a chaise and a horse to go about seven miles into the country but shandean like did not take notice that the horse was almost dead when i took him  before i got half way the poor animal dropped down dead  so i was forced to appear before the police and began to tell my story in french which was that the poor beast had to do with a worse beast than himself namely his master who had driven him all the day before jehu like and that he had neither had corn or hay therefore i was not to pay for the horse  but i might as well have whistled as have spoke french and i believe my latin was equal to my uncle tobys lilabulero  being not understood because of it is purity but by dint of words i forced my judge to do me justice  no common thing by the way in france  my wife and daughter are arrived  the latter does nothing but look out of the window and complain of the torment of being frizled  i wish she may ever remain a child of nature  i hate children of art  i hope this will find your ladyship well  and that you will be kind enough to direct to me at toulouse which place i shall set out for very soon i am with truth and sincerity  your ladyships most faithful l stern  letter xxviii to mr e paris july         dear sir my wife and daughter arrived here safe and sound on thursday and are in high raptures with the speed and pleasantness of their journey and particularly of all they see and meet with here but in their journey from york to paris nothing has given them a more sensible and lasting pleasure than the marks of kindness they received from you and mrs e  the friendship good will and politeness of my two friends i never doubted to me or mine and i return you both all a grateful man is capable of which is merely my thanks i have taken however the liberty of sending an indian taffety which mrs e must do me the honor to wear for my wifes sake who would have got it made up but that mr stanhope the consul of algiers who sets off tomorrow morning for london has been so kind i mean his lady as to take charge of it and we had but just time to procure it and had we missed that opportunity as we should have been obliged to have left it behind us at paris we knew not when or how to get it to our friend  i wish it had been better worth a paragraph if there is any thing we can buy or procure for you here intelligence included you have a right to command me  for i am yours with my wife and girls kind love to you and mrs e  lau stern  letter xxix to t h s esquire toulouse august         my dear h by the time you have got to the end of this long letter you will perceive that i have not been able to answer your last till now  i have had the intention of doing it almost as often as my prayers in my head  it is thus we use our best friends  what an infamous story is that you have told me  after some little remarks on it the rest of my letter will go on like silk   is a good natured old easy fool and has been deceived by the most artful of her sex and she must have abundance of impudence and charlatanery to have carried on such a farce i pity the old man for being taken in for so much money  a man of sense i should have laughed at  my wife saw her when in town and she had not the appearance of poverty but when she wants to melt  heart she puts her gold watch and diamond rings in her drawer  but he might have been aware of her i could not have been mistaken in her character  and it is odd she should talk of her wealth to one and tell another the reverse  so good night to her  about a week or ten days before my wife arrived at paris i had the same accident i had at cambridge of breaking a vessel in my lungs it happened in the night and i bled the bed full and finding in the morning i was likely to bleed to death i sent immediately for a surgeon to bleed me at both arms  this saved me and with lying speechless three days i recovered upon my back in bed the breach healed and in a week after i got out  this with my weakness and hurrying about made me think it high time to haste to toulouse  we have had four months of such heats that the oldest frenchman never remembers the like  twas as hot as nebuchadnezzars oven and never has relaxed one hour  in the height of this twas our destiny or rather destruction to set out by way of lions montpellier etc to shorten i trow our sufferings  good god  but it is over  and here i am in my own house quite settled by ms aid and goodnatured offices for which i owe him more than i can express or know how to pay at present  it is in the prettiest situation in toulouse with near two acres of garden  the house too good by half for us  well furnished for which i pay thirty pounds a year  i have got a good cook  my wife a decent femme de chamber and a good looking laquais  the abbe has planned our expenses and set us in such a train we cannot easily go wrong  though by the bye the d  is seldom found sleeping under a hedge mr trotter dined with me the day before i left paris  i took care to see all executed according to your directions  but trotter i dare say by this has wrote to you  i made him happy beyond expression with your crazy tales and more so with its frontispiece  i am in spirits writing a crazy chapter  with my face turned toward thy turret  it is now i wish all warmer climates countries and every thing else at  that separates me from our paternal seat  ce sera la ou reposera ma cendre  et ce sera la ou mon cousin viendra repondre les pleurs dues a notre amity  i am taking asses milk three times a day and cows milk as often  i long to see thy face again once more  greet the col kindly in my name and thank him cordially from me for his many civilities to madame and mademoiselle shandy at york who send all due acknowledgments the humor is over for france and frenchmen but that is not enough for your affectionate cousin l s  a year will tire us all out i trow but thank heaven the post brings me a letter from my anthony  i felicitate you upon what messrs the reviewers allow you  they have too much judgment themselves not to allow you what you are actually possessed of talents wit and humor  well write on my dear cousin and be guided by thy own fancy  oh how i envy you all at crazy castle  i could like to spend a month with you  and should return back again for the vintage  i honor the man that has given the world an idea of our parental seat  it is well done  i look at it ten times a day with a quando te aspiciam  now farewell  remember me to my beloved col  greet panty most lovingly on my behalf and if mrs c and miss c etc are at g greet them likewise with a holy kiss  so god bless you  letter xxx to mr f  at paris toulouse august         my dear f after many turnings  alias digressions to say nothing of downright overthrows stops and delays we have arrived in three weeks at toulouse and are now settled in our houses with servants etc about us and look as composed as if we had been here seven years  in our journey we suffered so much from the heats it gives me pain to remember it  i never saw a cloud from paris to nismes half as broad as a twentyfour sols piece  good god we were toasted roasted grilld stewed and carbonaded on one side or other all the way  and being all done enough assez cuits in the day we were eat up at night by bugs and other unswept out vermin the legal inhabitants if length of possession gives right of every inn we lay at  can you conceive a worse accident than that in such a journey in the hottest day and hour of it four miles from either tree or shrub which could cast a shade of the size of one of eves fig leaves  that we should break a hind wheel into ten thousand pieces and be obliged in consequence to sit five hours on a gravelly road without one drop of water or possibility of getting any  to mend the matter my two postillions were two doughhearted fools and fell a crying  nothing was to be done by heaven quoth i pulling off my coat and waistcoat something shall be done for i will thrash you both within an inch of your lives  and then make you take each of you a horse and ride like two devils to the next post for a cart to carry my baggage and a wheel to carry ourselves  our luggage weighed ten quintals  twas the fair of baucaire  all the world was going or returning  we were asked by every soul who passed by us if we were going to the fair of baucaire  no wonder quoth i we have goods enough vous avez raison mes amiss   well here we are after all my dear friend  and most deliciously placed at the extremity of the town in an excellent house well furnished and elegant beyond any thing i looked for  it is built in the form of a hotel with a pretty court toward the town  and behind the best gardens in toulouse laid out in serpentine walks and so large that the company in our quarter usually come to walk there in the evenings for which they have my consent  the more the merrier  the house consists of a good salle a manger above stairs joining to the very great salle a compagnie as large as the baron dholbachs three handsome bedchambers with dressing rooms to them  below stairs two very good rooms for myself one to study in the other to see company  i have moreover cellars round the court and all other offices  of the same landlord i have bargained to have the use of a country house which he has two miles out of town so that myself and all my family have nothing more to do than to take our hats and remove from the one to the other  my landlord is moreover to keep the gardens in order  and what do you think i am to pay for all this neither more or less than thirty pounds a year  all things are cheap in proportion  so we shall live for very very little  i dined yesterday with mr h  he is most pleasantly situated and they are all well  as for the books you have received for d  the bookseller was a fool not to send the bill along with them  i will write to him about it  i wish you was with me for two months it would cure you of all evils ghostly and bodily  but this like many other wishes both for you and myself must have its completion elsewhere  adieu my kind friend and believe that i love you as much from inclination as reason for  i am most truly yours l stern my wife and girl join in compliments to you  my best respects to my worthy baron dholbach and all that society  remember me to my friend mr panchaud    letter xxxi to j h s esquire toulouse oct         my dear h i received your letter yesterday  so it has been traveling from crazy castle to toulouse full eighteen days  if i had nothing to stop me i would engage to set out this morning and knock at crazy castle gates in three days less time  by which time i should find you and the colonel panty etc all alone  the season i most wish and like to be with you  i rejoice from my heart down to my reins that you have snatched so many happy and sunshiny days out of the hands of the blue devils  if we live to meet and join our forces as heretofore we will give these gentry a drubbing  and turn them for ever out of their usurped citadel  some legions of them have been put to flight already by your operations this last campaign  and i hope to have a hand in dispersing the remainder the first time my dear cousin sets up his banners again under the square tower  but what art thou meditating with axes and hammers   i know thy pride and the naughtiness of thy heart and thou love the sweet visions of architraves friezes and pediments with their tympanums and thou have found out a pretense a raison de cinq cent livres sterling to be laid out in four years etc etc so as not to be felt which is always added by the d  as a bait to justify thyself unto thyself  it may be very wise to do this  but it is wiser to keep ones money in ones pocket whilst there are wars without and rumors of wars within  st  advises his disciples to sell both coat and waistcoat  and go rather without shirt or sword than leave no money in their scrip to go to jerusalem with  now those quatre ans consecutifs my dear anthony are the most precious morsels of thy life to come in this world and thou will do well to enjoy that morsel without cares calculations and curses and damns and debts  for as sure as stone is stone and mortar is mortar etc twill be one of the many works of thy repentance  but after all if the fates have decreed it as you and i have some time supposed it on account of your generosity  that you are never to be a monied man the decree will be fulfilled whether you adorn your castle and line it with cedar and paint it within side and without side with vermilion or not  et cela etant having a bottle of frontiniac and glass at my right hand i drink dear anthony to thy health and happiness and to the final accomplishments of all thy lunary and sublunary projects  for six weeks together after i wrote my last letter to you my projects were many stories higher for i was all that time as i thought journeying on to the other world  i fell ill of an epidemic vile fever which killed hundreds about me  the physicians here are the errantest charlatans in europe or the most ignorant of all pretending fools  i withdrew what was left of me out of their hands and recommended my affairs entirely to dame nature  she dear goddess has saved me in fifty different pinching bouts and i begin to have a kind of enthusiasm now in her favor and in my own that one or two more escapes will make me believe i shall leave you all at last by translation and not by fair death i am now stout and foolish again as a happy man can wish to be  and am busy playing the fool with my uncle toby who i have got soused over head and ears in love  i have many hints and projects for other works all will go on i trust as i wish in this matter  when i have reaped the benefit of this winter at toulouse  i cannot see i have any thing more to do with it therefore after having gone with my wife and girl to bagnieres i shall return from whence i came  now my wife wants to stay another year to save money and this opposition of wishes though it will not be as sour as lemon yet twill not be as sweet as sugar candy  i wish t  would lead sir charles to toulouse it is as good as any town in the south of france  for my own part it is not to my taste  but i believe the ground work of my ennui is more to the eternal platitude of the french characters  little variety no originality in it at all  than to any other cause  for they are very civil  but civility itself in that uniform wearies and bodders one to death  if i do not mind i shall grow most stupid and sententious  miss shandy is hard at it with music dancing and french speaking in the last of which she does a marveille and speaks it with an excellent accent considering she practices within sight of the pyrenean mountains  if the snows will suffer me i propose to spend two or three months at barege or bagnieres but my dear wife is against all schemes of additional expenses  which wicked propensity though not of despotick power yet i cannot suffer  though by the bye laudable enough  but she may talk  i will do my own way and she will acquiesce without a word of debate on the subject  who can say so much in praise of his wife few i trow  m  is out of town vintaging  so write to me monsieur stern gentilhomme anglois  twill find me  we are as much out of the road of all intelligence here as at the cape of good hope  so write a long nonsensical letter like this now and then to me  in which say nothing but what may be shown though i love every paragraph and spirited stroke of your pen others might not for you must know a letter no sooner arrives from england but curiosity is upon her knees to know the contents  adieu dear h believe me  your affectionate l stern we have had bitter cold weather here these fourteen days  which has obliged us to sit with whole pagells of wood lighted up to our noses  it is a dear article  but every thing else being extreme cheap madame keeps an excellent good house with soupe boulli roti  etc etc for two hundred and fifty pounds a year    letter xxxii to mr f at paris toulouse

london the week after but i have some thoughts of adapting it to our situation  and making it the journey to toulouse which with the change of half a dozen scenes may be easily done  thus my dear f for want of something better we have recourse to ourselves and strike out the best amusements we can from such materials  my kind love and friendship to all my true friends  my service to the rest h

piece to go to market with in case he has changed his last guinea  you will not envy my situation  god bless you  remit me the balance due upon the receipt of this  we are all at h  s practicing a play we are to act here this christmas holidays  all the dramatis personae are of the english of which we have a happy society living together like brothers and sisters  your banker here has just sent

and believe me dear f  y truly yours  l stern  letter xxxv to the same toulouse march         dear f   though that is a mistake i mean the date of the place for i write at mr h  s in the country and have been there with my people all the week  how does tristram do you say in yours to him  faith but soso  the worst of human maladies is poverty  though that is a second lie  for poverty of spirit is worse than poverty of purse by ten thousand per cent  i enclose you a remedy for the one a draught of a hundred and thirty pounds for which i insist upon a rescription by the very return  or i will send you and all your commissaries to the d  l  i do not hear they have tasted of one fleshy banquet all this lent  you will make an excellent grille  p  they can make nothing of him but bouillon  i mean my other two friends no ill  so shall send them a reprieve as they acted out of necessity  not choice  my kind respects to baron d holbach and all his household  say all that is kind for me to my other friends  you know how much dear f  i am yours  l stern i have not five louis to vapor with in this land of coxcombs  my wifes compliments    letter xxxvi to the same toulouse april         dear f  i thank you for your punctuality in sending me the rescription and for your box by the courier which came safe by last post  i was not surprised much with your account of lord  being obliged to give way  and for the rest all follows in course  i suppose you will endeavor to fish and catch something for yourself in these troubled waters  at least i wish you all a reasonable man can wish for himself  which is wishing enough for you  all the rest is in the brain  mr woodhouse who you know is also here  he is a most amiable worthy man and i have the pleasure of having him much with me  in a short time he proceeds to italy  the first week in june i decamp like a patriarch with my whole household to pitch our tents for three months at the foot of the pyrenean hills at bagnieres where i expect much health and much amusement from the concourse of adventurers from all corners of the earth  mrs m  sets out at the same time for another part of the pyrenean hills at coutray  from whence to italy  this is the general plan of operation here  except that i have some thoughts of spending the winter at florence and crossing over with my family to leghorn by water  and in april of returning by way of paris home  but this is a sketch only for in all things i am governed by circumstances  so that what is fit to be done on monday may be very unwise on saturday  on all days of the week believe me yours  with unfeigned truth l stern ps all compliments to my parisian friends    letter xxxvii to the same toulouse april         my dear f  last post my agent wrote me word he would send up from york a bill for fourscore guineas with orders to be paid into mr selwins hands for me this he said he would expedite immediately so it is possible you may have had advice of it  and it is possible also the money may not be paid this fortnight therefore as i set out for bagnieres in that time be so good as to give me credit for the money for a few posts or so and send me either a rescription for the money or a draught for it  at the receipt of which we shall decamp for ten or twelve weeks  you will receive twenty pounds more on my account which send also  so much for that  as for pleasure  you have it all amongst you at paris  we have nothing here which deserves the name  i shall scarce be tempted to sojourn another winter at toulouse  for i cannot say it suits my health as i hoped  it is too moist  and i cannot keep clear of agues here  so that if i stay the next winter on this side of the water  twill be either at nice or florence  and i shall return to england in april  wherever i am believe me dear f  that i am  yours faithfully l stern madame and mademoiselle present their best compliments  remember me to all i regard particularly messrs p  d and the rest of your household    letter xxxviii to the same toulouse may         dear sir i took the liberty three weeks ago to desire you would be so kind as to send me fourscore pounds having received a letter the same post from my agent that he would order the money to be paid to your correspondent in london in a fortnight  it is some disappointment to me that you have taken no notice of my letter especially as i told you we waited for the money before we set out for bagnieres  and so little distrust had i that such a civility would be refused me that we have actually had all our things packed up these eight days in hourly expectation of receiving a letter  perhaps my good friend has waited till he heard the money was paid in london  but you might have trusted to my honor  that all the cash in your iron box and all the bankers in europe put together could not have tempted me to say the thing that is not  i hope before this you will have received an account of the money being paid in london  but it would have been taken kindly if you had wrote me word you would transmit me the money when you had received it but no sooner for mr r  of montpellier though i know him not yet knows enough of me to have given me credit for a fortnight for ten times the sum  i am dear f  your friend and hearty wellwisher l stern i saw the family of the h  yesterday and asked them if you was in the land of the living  they said yea  for they had just received a letter from you  after all i heartily forgive you  for you have done me a signal service in mortifying me and it is this i am determined to grow rich upon it  adieu and god send you wealth and happiness  all compliments to  before april next i am obliged to revisit your metropolis in my way to england    letter xxxix to the same toulouse june        my dear f  i this moment received yours  consequently the moment i got it i sat down to answer it  so much for a logical inference  now believe me i had never wrote you so testy a letter had i not both loved and esteemed you  and it was merely in vindication of the rights of friendship that i wrote in a way as if i was hurt  for neglect me in your heart i knew you could not without cause which my heart told me i never had  or will ever give you  i was the best friends with you that ever i was in my life before my letter had got a league and pleaded the true excuse for my friend that he was oppressed with a multitude of business go on my dear f and have but that excuse so much do i regard your interest that i would be content to suffer a real evil without future murmuring  but in truth my disappointment was partly chimerical at the bottom having a letter of credit for two hundred pounds from a person i never saw by me  but which out of a nicety of temper i would not make any use of  i set out in two days for bagnieres but direct to me to brousse who will forward all my letters  dear f  adieu  believe me  yours affectionately l stern  letter xl to the same toulouse june         dear f  luckily just before i was stepping into my chaise for bagnieres has a strayed fifty pound bill found its way to me so i have sent it to its lawful owner enclosed  my noodle of an agent instead of getting mr selwin to advise you he had received the money which would have been enough has got a bill for it and sent it rambling to the furthest part of france after me and if it had not caught me just now it might have followed me into spain for i shall cross the pyreneans and spend a week in that kingdom which is enough for a fertile brain to write a volume upon  when i write the history of my travels  memorandum i am not to forget how honest a man i have for a banker at paris  but my dear friend when you say you dare trust me for what little occasions i may have you have as much faith as honesty  and more of both than of good policy  i thank you however ten thousand times  and except such liberty as i have lately taken with you  and that too at a pinch  i say beyond that i will not trespass upon your good nature or friendliness to serve me  god bless you dear f   i am yours whilst l stern  letter xli to the same montpellier oct        dear f i am ashamed i have not taken an opportunity of thanking you before now for your friendly act of civility in ordering brousse your correspondent at toulouse in case i should have occasion to pay me fifteen hundred livres  which as i knew the offer came from your heart i made no difficulty of accepting  in my way through toulouse to marseilles where we have been but neither liking the place nor aix particularly the latter it being a parliament town of which toulouse has given me a surfeit we have returned here where we shall reside the winter  my wife and daughter purpose to stay a year at least behind me  and when winter is over to return to toulouse or go to montaubon where they will stay till they return or i fetch them  for myself i shall set out in february for england where my heart has been fled these six months  but i shall stay a fortnight with my friends at paris though i verily believe if it was not for the pleasure of seeing and chattering with you i should pass on directly to brussels and so on to rotterdam for the sake of seeing holland and embark from thence to london  but i must stay a little with those i love and have so many reasons to regard  you cannot place too much of this to your own score  i have had an offer of going to italy a fortnight ago  but i must like my subject as well as the terms neither of which were to my mind  pray what english have you at paris where is my young friend mr f  we hear of three or four english families coming to us here  if i can be serviceable to any you would serve you have but to write  mr h has sent my friend w  s picture  you have seen the original or i would have sent it you  i believe i shall beg leave to get a copy of my own from yours when i come in propria persona  till when god bless you my dear friend and believe me  most faithfully yours l stern  letter xlii to the same montpellier jan        my dear friend you see i cannot pass over the fifth of the month without thinking of you and writing to you  the last is a periodical habit  the first is from my heart and i do it oftener than i remember  however from both motives together i maintain i have a right to the pleasure of a single line  be it only to tell me how your watch goes  you know how much happier it would make me to know that all things belonging to you went on well  you are going to have them all to yourself i hear and that mr s  is true to his first intention of leaving business  i hope this will enable you to accomplish yours in a shorter time that you may get to your long wished for retreat of tranquillity and silence  when you have got to your fireside and into your armchair and by the by have another to spare for a friend and are so much a sovereign as to sit in your furred cap if you like it though i should not for a mans ideas are at least the cleaner for being dressed decently why then it will be a miracle if i do not glide in like a ghost upon you  and in a very unghostlike fashion help you off with a bottle of your best wine  january     it does not happen every day that a letter begun in the most perfect health should be concluded in the greatest weakness  i wish the vulgar high and low do not say it was a judgment upon me for taking all this liberty with ghosts  be it as it may  i took a ride when the first part of this was wrote toward perenas  and returned home in a shivering fit though i ought to have been in a fever for i had tired my beast and he was as unmovable as don quixotes wooden horse and my arm was half dislocated in whipping him  this quoth i is inhuman  no says a peasant on foot behind me i will drive him home  so he laid on his posteriors but twas needless  as his face was turned toward montpellier he began to trot  but to return this fever has confined me ten days in my bed  i have suffered in this scuffle with death terribly  but unless the spirit of prophecy deceive me  i shall not die but live  in the mean time dear f let us live as merrily but as innocently as we can  it has ever been as good if not better than a bishopric to me  and i desire no other  adieu my dear friend and believe me yours  l s please to give the enclosed to mr t  and tell him i thank him cordially from my heart for his great goodwill    letter xliii to the same montpellier jan  0 my dear friend hearing by lord r who in passing through here in his way to madrid has given me a call that my worthy friend mr fox was now at paris  i have enclosed a letter to him which you will present in course or direct to him  i suppose you are full of english  but in short we are here as if in another world where unless some strayed soul arrives we know nothing of what is going on in yours  lord gr i suppose is gone from paris or i had wrote also to him i know you are as busy as a be and have few moments to yourself  nevertheless bestow one of them upon an old friend and write me a line  and if mr f is too idle and has ought to say to me pray write a second line for him  we had a letter from miss p  this week who it seems has decamped for ever from paris  all is for the best  which is my general reflection upon many things in this world  well i shall shortly come and shake you by the hand in st sauveur  if still you are there  my wife returns to toulouse and purposes to spend the summer at bagnieres  i on the contrary go and visit my wife the church in yorkshire  we all live the longer  at least the happier  for having things our own way  this is my conjugal maxim  i own it is not the best of maxims  but i maintain it is not the worst adieu dear f  and believe me  yours with truth l stern  letter xliv to mrs f montpellier feb        i am preparing my dear mrs f to leave france for i am heartily tired of it  that insipidity there is in french characters has disgusted your friend yorick  i have been dangerously ill and cannot think that the sharp air of montpellier has been of service to me  and so my physicians told me when they had me under their hands for above a month  if you stay any longer here sir it will be fatal to you  and why good people were you not kind enough to tell me this sooner  after having discharged them i told mrs s that i should set out for england very soon but as she chooses to remain in france for two or three years i have no objection except that i wish my girl in england  the states of languedoc are met  it is a fine rareeshew with the usual accompanyments of fiddles bears and puppetshews  i believe i shall step into my postchaise with more alacrity to fly from these sights than a frenchman would to fly to them  and except a tear at parting with my little slut i shall be in high spirits and every step i take that brings me nearer england will i think help to set this poor frame to rights now pray write to me directed to mr f at paris and tell me what i am to bring you over  how do i long to greet all my friends few do i value more than yourself  my wife chooses to go to montauban rather than stay here in which i am truly passive  if this should not find you at bath i hope it will be forwarded to you as i wish to fulfill your commissions  and so adieu  accept every warm wish for your health and believe me ever yours  l stern ps my physicians have almost poisoned me with what they call bouillons refraichissants  it is a cock flead alive and boiled with poppy seeds then pounded in a mortar afterward passed through a sieve  there is to be one crawfish in it and i was gravely told it must be a male one  a female would do me more hurt than good    letter xlv to miss s paris may l       my dear lydia by this time i suppose your mother and self are fixed at montauban and i therefore direct to your banker to be delivered to you  i acquiesced in your staying in france  likewise it was your mothers wish  but i must tell you both that unless your health had not been a plea made use of i should have wished you both to return with me  i have sent you the spectators and other books particularly metastasio but i beg my girl to read the former and only make the latter her amusement  i hope you have not forgot my last request to make no friendships with the frenchwomen  not that i think ill of them all but sometimes women of the best principles are the most insinuating  nay i am so jealous of you that i should be miserable were i to see you had the least grain of coquettry in your composition  you have enough to do  for i have also sent you a guittar  and as you have no genius for drawing though you never could be made to believe it pray waste not your time about it  remember to write to me as to a friend  in short whatever comes into your little head and then it will be natural  if your mothers rheumatism continues and she chooses to go to bagnieres  tell her not to be stopped for want of money for my purse shall be as open as my heart i have preached at the ambassadors chapel  hezekiah  an odd subject your mother will say there was a concourse of all nations and religions too  i shall leave paris in a few days  i am lodged in the same hotel with mr t they are good and generous souls  tell your mother that i hope she will write to me and that when she does so i may also receive a letter from my lydia  kiss your mother from me and believe me  your affectionate l stern  letter xlvi york august        my dear f  there is a young lady with whom i have sent a letter to you who will arrive at paris in her way to italy  her name is miss tuting a lady known and loved by the whole kingdom  if you can be of any aid to her in your advice etc as to her journey etc your good nature and politeness i am sure need no spur from me to do it i was sorry we were like the two buckets of a well whilst in london for we were never able to be both resident together the month i continued in and about the environs  if i get a cough this winter which holds me three days you will certainly see me at paris the week following for now i abandon every thing in this world to health and to my friends  for the last sermon that i shall ever preach was preached at paris  so i am altogether an idle man or rather a free one which is better i sent last post twenty pounds to mrs s which makes a hundred pounds remitted since i got here  you must pay yourself what i owe you out of it  and place the rest to account  betwixt this and lady day next mrs s will draw from time to time upon you to about the amount of a hundred louis  but not more  i think i having left her a hundred in her pocket  but you shall always have money beforehand of mine  and she purposes to spend no further than five thousand livres in the year  but twenty pound this way or that makes no difference between us  give my kindest compliments to mr p  i have a thousand things to say to you and would go half way to paris to tell them you in your ear  the messrs t  h  etc and many more of your friends with whom i am now send their services  mine to all friends  yours dear f most truly  l stern  letter xlvii to j h s esquire september        now my dear dear anthony  i do not think a week or ten days playing the good follow at this very time at scarborough so abominable a thing  but if a man could get there cleverly and every soul in his house in the mind to try what could be done in furtherance thereof i have no one to consult in this affair  therefore as a man may do worse things the english of all which is this that i am going to leave a few poor sheep here in the wilderness for fourteen days  and from pride and naughtiness of heart to go see what is doing at scarborough  steadfastly meaning afterward to lead a new life and strengthen my faith  now some folks say there is much company there  and some fay not  and i believe there is neither the one or the other  but will be both if the world will have but a months patience or so  no my dear h i did not delay sending your letter directly to the post  as there are critical times or rather turns and revolutions in  humors i knew not what the delay of an hour might hazard  i will answer for him he has seventy times seven forgiven you  and as often wished you at the d  l  after many oscillations the pendulum will rest firm as ever   i send all kind compliments to sir c d and g  s  i love them from my soul  if gt is with you him also  i go on not rapidly but well enough with my uncle tobys amors  there is no sitting and cudgeling ones brains whilst the sun shines bright  twill be all over in six or seven weeks and there are dismal months enough after to endure suffocation by a brimstone fireside  if you can get to scarborough do  a man who makes six tons of alum a week may do any thing  lord g  y is to be there  what a temptation  yours affectionately l stern  letter xlviii to mr f at paris york september         my dear friend i have just had the honor of a letter from miss t  full of the acknowledgments of your attention and kind services to her i will not believe these arose from the d of as letters nor mine surely she needed no recommendation  the truest and most honest compliment i can pay you is to say they came from your own good heart only you was introduced to the object  for the rest followed in course  however let me cast in my mite of thanks to the treasury which belongs to good natured actions i have been with lord g  y these three weeks at scarborough  the pleasures of which i found somewhat more exalted than those of bagnieres last year  i am now returned to my philosophical hut to finish tristram which i calculate will be ready for the world about christmas at which time i decamp from hence and fix my head quarters at london for the winter  unless my cough pushes me forwards to your metropolis  or that i can persuade some gros my lord to take a trip to you  i will try if i can make him relish the joys of the tuileries opera comique etc  i had this week a letter from mrs s  from montauban in which she tells me she has occasion for fifty pounds immediately  will you send an order to your correspondent at montauban to pay her so much cash  and i will in three weeks send as much to becket  but as her purse is low for gods sake write directly  now you must do something equally essential  to rectify a mistake in the mind of your correspondent there who it seems gave her a hint not long ago  that she was separated from me for life  now as this is not true in the first place and may give a disadvantageous impression of her to those she lives amongst  twould be unmerciful to let her or my daughter suffer by it so do be so good as to undeceive him  for in a year or two she proposes and indeed i expect it with impatience from her to rejoin me  and tell them i have all the confidence in the world she will not spend more than i can afford and i only mentioned two hundred guineas a year  because twas right to name some certain sum for which i begged you to give her credit  i write to you of all my most intimate concerns as to a brother so excuse me dear f  god bless you  believe me  yours affectionately l stern compliments to mr panchaud dholbach etc    letter xlix to j h s esquire coxwould  thursday my dear cousin i am but this moment returned from scarborough where i have been drinking the waters ever since the races and have received mavelous strength had i not debilitated it as fast as i got it by playing the good fellow with lord g  y and co too much i rejoice you have been encamped at harrowgate from which by now i suppose you are decamped  otherwise as idle a beast as i have been i would have sacrificed a few days to the god of laughter with you and your jolly set  i have done nothing good that i know of since i left you except paying off your guinea and a half to k  in my way through york hither  i must try now and do better  go on and prosper for a month  your affectionate l stern  letter l to mr f at paris york november         my dear friend i sent ten days ago a bank bill of thirty pounds to mr becket and this post one of sixty  when i get to london which will be in five weeks you will receive what shall always keep you in bank for mrs s  in the mean time i have desired becket to send you fourscore pounds and if my wife before i get to london should have occasion for fifty louis let her not wait a minute and if i have not paid it a week or a fortnight i know will break no squares with a good and worthy friend  i will contrive to send you these two new volumes of tristram as soon as ever i get them from the press  you will read as odd a tour through france as ever was projected or executed by traveller or travelwriters since the world began  it is a laughing good tempered satyr against traveling as puppies travel panchaud will enjoy it  i am quite civil to your parisians  et pour cause you know  it is likely i may see them in spring  is it possible for you to get me over a copy of my picture any how if so i would write to mademoiselle n  to make as good a copy from it as she possibly could  with a view to do her service here  and i would remit her the price  i really believe it would be the parent of a dozen portraits to her if she executes it with the spirit of the original in your hands  for it will be seen by many  and as my phiz is as remarkable as myself if she preserves the true character of both it will do her honor and service too  write me a line about this and tell me you are well and happy  will you present my kind respects to the worthy baron  i shall send him one of the best impressions of my picture from mr reynoldss  another to monsieur p  my love to mr s  n and p  d  i am most truly yours l stern  letter li to j h s esquire november         my dear cousin it is a church militant week with me full of marches and countermarches  and treaties about stillington common which we are going to enclose  otherwise i would have obeyed your summons  and yet i could not well have done it this week neither having received a letter from c  who has been very ill and is coming down to stay a week or ten days with me  now i know he is ambitious of being better acquainted with you and longs from his soul for a sight of you in your own castle  i cannot do otherwise than bring him with me  nor can i gallop away and leave him an empty house to pay a visit to from london as he comes half express to see me  i thank you for the care of my northern vintage  i fear after all i must give it a fermentation on the other side of the alps which is better than being on the lees with it  but nous verrons  yet i fear as it has got such hold of my brain and comes upon it like an armed man at nights  i must give way for quietness sake or be hagridden with the conceit of it all my life long  i have been missridden this last week by a couple of romping girls bien mises et comme il faut who might as well have been in the house with me though perhaps not my retreat here is too quiet for them but they have taken up all my time and have given my judgment and fancy more airings than they wanted  these things accord not well with sermon making  but it is my vile errantry as sancho says and that is all that can be made of it  i trust all goes swimmingly on with your alum that the works amuse you and call you twice out at least a day  i shall see them i trust in ten days or thereabout  if it was any way possible i would set out this moment though i have no cavalry   except a she ass give all friendly respects to mrs c and to col hs and the garrison both of guisbro and skeleton  i am dear anthony affectionately  yours l stern  letter lii to mr f at p york november         my dear friend three posts before i had the favor of yours which is come to hand this moment i had wrote to set mrs s right in her mistake  that you had any money of mine in your hands  being very sensible that the hundred pounds i had sent you through beckets hands was but about what would balance with you  the reason of her error was owing to my writing her word i would send you a bill in a post or two for fifty pounds  which my finances falling short just then i deferred  so that i had paid nothing to any one  but was however come to york this day and i have sent you a draught for a hundred pounds  in honest truth a fortnight ago i had not the cash  but i am as honest as the king as sancho panca says only not so rich  therefore if mrs s should want thirty louis more let her have them  and i will balance all which will not be much with honor at christmas when i shall be in london having now just finished my two volumes of tristram  i have some thoughts of going to italy this year  at least i shall not defer it above another  i have been with lord granby and with lord shelburne but am now sat down till december in my sweet retirement  i wish you was sat down as happily and as free of all worldly cares  in a few years my dear f i hope to see you a real country gentleman though not altogether exiled from your friends in london  there i shall spend every winter of my life in the same lap of contentment where i enjoy myself now  and wherever i go  we must bring three parts in four of the treat along with us  in short we must be happy within  and then few things without us make much difference  this is my shandean philosophy  you will read a comic account of my journey from calais through paris to the garonne in these volumes  my friends tell me they are done with spirit  it must speak for itself  give my kind respects to mr selwin and my friend panchaud  when you see baron dholbach present him my respects and believe me dear f  yours cordially l stern  letter liii to d g esquire london march         dear g i threatened you with a letter in one i wrote a few weeks ago to foley but to my shame be it spoken i lead such a life of dissipation i have never had a moment to myself which has not been broke in upon by one engagement or impertinence or another  and as plots thicken toward the latter end of a piece i find unless i take pen and ink just now i shall not be able to do it till either i am got into the country or you to the city you are teized and tormented too much by your correspondents to return to us and with accounts how much your friends and how much your theater wants you  so that i will not magnify either our loss or yours  but hope cordially to see you soon  since i wrote last i have frequently stepped into your house  that is as frequently as i could take the whole party where i dined along with me  this was but justice to you as i walked in as a wit  but with regard to myself i balanced the account thus  i am sometimes in my friend  s house but he is always in tristram shandys  where my friends say he will continue and i hope the prophecy true for my own immortality even when he himself is no more  i have had a lucrative winters campaign here  shandy sells well  i am taxing the public with two more volumes of sermons which will more than double the gains of shandy  it goes into the world with a prancing list of de toute la noblesse  which will bring me in three hundred pounds exclusive of the sale of the copy  so that with all the contempt of money which ma facon de penser has ever impressed on me i shall be rich in spite of myself but i scorn you must know in the high ton i take at present to pocket all this trash  i set out to lay a portion of it in the service of the world in a tour round italy where i shall spring game or the duce is in the dice  in the beginning of september i quit england that i may avail myself of the time of vintage when all nature is joyous and so saunter philosophically for a year or so on the other side the alps  i hope your pilgrimages have brought mrs g and yourself back a la fleur de jeunesse  may you both long feel the sweets of it and your friends with you  do dear friend make my kindest wishes and compliments acceptable to the best and wisest of the daughters of eve  you shall ever believe and ever find me affectionately yours  l stern  letter live to d g esquire bath april        i scalp you  my dear g  my dear friend  foul befall the man who hurts a hair of your head  and so full was i of that very sentiment that my letter had not been put into the post office ten minutes before my heart smote me and i sent to recall it  but failed  you are sadly to blame shandy for this quoth i leaning with my head on my hand as i recriminated upon my false delicacy in the affair  g  s nerves if he has any left are as fine and delicately spun as thy own  his sentiments as honest and friendly  thou know shandy that he loves thee  why will thou hazard him a moments pain puppy fool coxcomb jackass etc etc  and so i balanced the account to your favor before i received it drawn up in your way  i say your way  for it is not stated so much to your honor and credit as i had passed the account before  for it was a most lamented truth that i never received one of the letters your friendship meant me except whilst in paris  o how i congratulate you for the anxiety the world has and continues to be under for your return  return return to the few who love you and the thousands who admire you  the moment you set your foot upon your stage  mark i tell it you  by some magic irresisted power every fiber about your heart will vibrate afresh and as strong and feelingly as ever  nature with glory at her back will light up the torch within you  and there is enough of it left to heat and enlighten the world these many many many years  heaven be praised i utter it from my soul that your lady and my minerva is in a condition to walk to windsor  full rapturously will i lead the graceful pilgrim to the temple where i will sacrifice with the purest incense to her  but you may worship with me or not  twill make no difference either in the truth or warmth of my devotion  still after all i have seen i still maintain her peerless  p  good heaven  give me some one with less smoke and more fire  there are who like the pharisees still think they shall be heard for much speaking  come  come away my dear g  and teach us another lesson  adieu  i love you dearly  and your lady better  not hobbihorsically  but most sentimentally and affectionately  for i am yours that is if you never say another word about  with all the sentiments of love and friendship you deserve from me  l stern  letter lv bath april         my dear f my wife tells me she has drawn for one hundred pounds and it is fit that you should be paid it that minute  the money is now in beckets hands  send me my dear f  my account that i may discharge the balance to this time and know what to leave in your hands  i have made a good campaign of it this year in the field of the literati  my two volumes of tristram and two of sermons which i shall print very soon will bring me a considerable sum  almost all the nobility in england honor me with their names and it is thought it will be the largest and most splendid list which ever pranced before a book since subscriptions came into fashion  pray present my most sincere compliments to lady h  whose name i hope to insert with many others  as so many men of genius favor me with their names also i will quarrel with mr h  e and call him deist and what not unless i have his name too  my love to lord w  your name f i have put in as a free will offering of my labors  your list of subscribers you will send  it is but a crown for sixteen sermons  dog cheap but i am in quest of honor not money  adieu adieu  believe me dear f  yours truly l stern  letter lvi to mr w coxwould may         at this moment am i sitting in my summer house with my head and heart full not of my uncle tobys amors with the widow wadman but my sermons  and your letter has drawn me out of a pensive mood  the spirit of it pleases me  but in this solitude what can i tell or write to you but about myself  i am glad that you are in love  twill cure you at least of the spleen which has a bad effect on both man and woman  i myself must ever have some dulcinea in my head  it harmonises the soul  and in those cases i first endeavor to make the lady believe so or rather i begin first to make myself believe that i am in love  but i carry on my affairs quite in the french way sentimentally   lamour say they  nest rien sans sentiment  now notwithstanding they make such a pother about the word they have no precise idea annexed to it  and so much for that same subject called love  i must tell you how i have just treated a french gentleman of fortune in france who took a liking to my daughter  without any ceremony having got my direction from my wifes banker he wrote me word that he was in love with my daughter and desired to know what fortune i would give her at present and how much at my death  by the bye i think there was very little sentiment on his side  my answer was sir i shall give her ten thousand pounds the day of marriage  my calculation is as follows  she is not eighteen you are sixtytwo  there goes five thousand pounds  then sir you at least think her not ugly  she has many accomplishments speaks italian french plays upon the guittar and as i fear you play upon no instrument whatever i think you will be happy to take her at my terms for here finishes the account of the ten thousand pounds  i do not suppose but he will take this as i mean that is  a flat refusal  i have had a parsonage house burnt down by the carelessness of my curates wife  as soon as i can i must rebuild it i trow  but i lack the means at present  yet i am never happier than when i have not a shilling in my pocket  for when i have i can never call it my own adieu my dear friend  may you enjoy better health than me though not better spirits for that is impossible  yours sincerely l stern my compliments to the col    letter lvii to mr f at paris york july         my dear sir i wrote some time in spring to beg you would favor me with my account i believe you was set out from paris and that mr garrick brought the letter with him  which possibly he gave you in the hurry of your business you might forget the contents of it and in the hurry of mine in town though i called once i could not get to see you i decamp for italy in september and shall see your face at paris you may be sure  but i shall see it with more pleasure when i am out of debt  which is your own fault for becket has had money left in his hands for that purpose  do send mrs stern her two last volumes of tristram they arrived with yours in spring and she complains she has not got them  my best services to mr panchaud  i am busy composing two volumes of sermons  they will be printed in september though i fear not time enough to bring them with me your name is amongst the list of a few of my honorary subscribers  who subscribe for love  if you see baron dholbach and diderot present my respects to them  if the baron wants any english books he will let me know and i will bring them with me  adieu  i am truly yours l stern  letter lviii to mrs m  d  s coxwould july         the first time i have dipped my pen into the inkhorn for this week past is to write to you and to thank you most sincerely for your kind epistle  will this be a sufficient apology for my letting it be ten days upon my table without answering it  i trust it will  i am sure my own feelings tell me so because i felt it impossible to do any thing that is ungracious toward you  it is not every hour or day or week of a mans life that is a fit season for the duties of friendship  sentiment is not always at hand  pride and folly and what is called business oftentimes keep it at a distance  and without sentiment what is friendship  a name a shadow  but to prevent a misapplication of this though why should i fear it from so kind and gentle a spirit as yours  you must know that by carelessness of my curate or his wife or his maid or some one within his gates the parsonagehouse at sutton was burnt to the ground with the furniture that belonged to me and a pretty good collection of books the loss three hundred and fifty pounds  the poor man with his wife took the wings of the next morning and fled away  this has given me real vexation for so much was my pity and esteem for him that as soon as i heard of this disaster i sent to desire he would come and take up his abode with me till another habitation was ready to receive him  but he was gone  and as i am told through fear of my persecution  heavens how little did he know of me to suppose i was among the number of those wretches that heap misfortune upon misfortune  and when the load is almost insupportable still to add to the weight god who reads my heart knows it to be true  that i wish rather to share than to increase the burden of the miserable  to dry up instead of adding a single drop to the stream of sorrow  as for the dirty trash of this world i regard it not  the loss of it does not cost me a sigh for after all i may say with the spanish captain that i am as good a gentleman as the king only not quite so rich  but to the point shall i expect you here this summer  i much wish that you may make it convenient to gratify me in a visit for a few weeks  i will give you a roast fowl for your dinner and a clean tablecloth every day  and tell you a story by way of desert  in the heat of the day we will sit in the shade  and in the evening the fairest of all the milkmaids who pass by my gate shall weave a garland for you  if i should not be so fortunate contrive to meet me the beginning of october  i shall stay a fortnight after and then seek a kindlier climate  this plaguey cough of mine seems to gain ground and will bring me to my grave in spite of me  but while i have strength to run away from it i will  i have been wrestling with it for these twenty years past  and what with laughter and good spirits have prevented its giving me a fall  but my antagonist presses closer than ever upon me  and i have nothing left on my side but another journey abroad  apropos  are you for a scheme of that sort if not perhaps you will accompany me as far as dover that we may laugh together on the beach to put neptune in a good humor before i embark  god bless you my dear madam  and believe me ever yours  l stern  letter lix to mr w coxwould december  0      thanks my dear w for your letter  i am just preparing to come and greet you and many other friends in town  i have drained my ink standish to the bottom and after i have published shall set my face not toward jerusalem but toward the alps  i find i must once more fly from death whilst i have strength  i shall go to naples and see whether the air of that place will not set this poor frame to rights  as to the project of getting a bear to lead i think i have enough to do to govern myself  and however profitable it might be according to your opinion i am sure it would be unpleasurable  few are the minutes of life and i do not think that i have any to throw away on any one being  i shall spend nine or ten months in italy and call upon my wife and daughter in france at my return  so shall be back by the kings birthday  what a project  and now my dear friend am i going to york not for the sake of society  nor to walk by the side of the muddy ouse but to recruit myself of the most violent spitting of blood that ever mortal man experienced because i had rather in case it is ordained so die there than in a postchaise on the road  if the amor of my uncle toby do not please you i am mistaken  and so with a droll story i will finish this letter  a sensible friend of mine with whom not long ago i spent some hours in conversation met an apothecary an acquaintance of ours  the latter asked him how he did why ill very ill  i have been with stern who has given me such a dose of atticsalt that i am in a fever  attic salt sir attic salt i have glauber salt  i have epsom salt in my shop etc  oh i suppose it is some french salt  i wonder you would trust his report of the medicine he cares not what he takes himself  i fancy i see you smile  i long to be able to be in london and embrace my friends there  and shall enjoy myself a week or ten days at paris with my friends particularly the baron

from thence for a fortnight to florence  and then by leghorn to marseilles directly home  but am diverted from this by the repeated proposals of accompanying a gentleman who is returning by venice vienna saxony berlin and so by the spaw and thence through holland to england  it is with mr e i have known him these three years and have been with him ever since i reached rome and as i know him to be a good hearted young gentleman i have no doubt of making it answer both his views and mine  at least i am persuaded we shall return home together as we set out with friendship and good will  write your next letter to me at rome and do me the following favor if it lies in your way which i think it does  to get me a letter of recommendation to our ambassador lord stormont at vienna i have not the

letter of credit upon some one at venice to the extent of fifty louis  but i am persuaded i shall not want half of them  however in case of sickness or accidents one would not go so long a rout without money in ones pocket  the bankers here are not so conscientious as my friend p they would make me pay twelve per cent if i was to get a letter here  i beg your letters etc may be enclosed to mr watson at venice  where we shall be in the ascension  i have received much benefit from the air of naples  but quit it to be at rome before the holy week  there are about five and twenty english

franche comte  poor woman she was very cordial etc and begs to stay another year or so  my lydia pleases me much  i found her greatly improved in every thing i wished her  i am most unaccountably well

in my hand but i shall live these ten years my antony notwithstanding the fears of my wife whom i left most melancholy on that account  this is a delicious part of the world most celestial weather and

sought you with more zeal than c sought the lord in order to deliver you the books you bad me purchase for you at paris  i was forced to pay carriage for them from london down to york  but as i shall

yours cordially l stern  letter lxxvii to d g esquire thursday eleven oclock  night dear sir twas for all the world like a cut across my finger with a sharp penknife  i saw the blood  gave it a suck  wrapped it up  and thought no more about it  but there is more goes to the healing of a wound than this comes to  a wound unless it is a wound not worth talking of but by the bye mine is must give you some pain after  nature will take her own way with it  it must ferment  it must digest  the story you told me of tristrams pretended tutor this morning  my letter by right should have set out with this sentence and then the simile would not have kept you a moment in suspense  this vile story i say  though i then saw both how and where it wounded  i felt little from it at first  or to speak more honestly though it ruins my simile i felt a great deal of pain from it but affected an air usual on such accidents of less feeling than i had  i have now got home to my lodgings since the play you astonished me in it and have been unwrapping this selfsame wound of mine and shaking my head over it this half hour  what the devil  is there no one learned blockhead throughout the many schools of misapplied science in the christian world to make a tutor of for my tristram  ex quovis ligno non fit  are we so run out of stock that there is no one lumberheaded muddleheaded mortarheaded puddingheaded chap amongst our doctors  is there no one single wight of much reading and no learning amongst the many children in my mothers nursery who bid high for this charge  but i must disable my judgment by choosing a w  n vengeance have i so little concern for the honor of my hero  am i a wretch so void of sense so bereft of feeling for the figure he is to make in story that i should choose a praeceptor to rob him of all the immortality i intended him o dear mr g  malice is ingenious  unless where the excess of it outwits itself  i have two comforts in this stroke of it  the first is that this one is partly of this kind and secondly that it is one of the number of those which so unfairly brought poor yorick to his grave  the report might draw blood of the author of tristram shandy  but could not harm such a man as the author of the divine legation  god bless him though by the bye and according to the natural course of descents the blessing should come from him to me  pray have you no interest lateral or collateral to get me introduced to his lordship  why do you ask  my dear sir i have no claim to such an honor but what arises from the honor and respect which in the progress of my work will be shown the world i owe to so great a man  whilst i am talking of owing  i wish my dear sir that any body would tell you how much i am indebted to you  i am determined never to do it myself or say more upon the subject than this that i am yours  l stern  end of vol ii
