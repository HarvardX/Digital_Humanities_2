remarks on a play called the conscious lovers a comedy  for changing rules of late as if men writ in spite of reason nature art and wit our poets make us laugh at tragedy and with their comedies they make us cry prologue to the rehearsal it appears from consideration of ancient as well as modern time that the cause and interest of critics is the same with that of wit learning and good sense the late earl of shaftsburys characteristicks vol   p   0  by mr dennis  london printed for t warner at the blackboy in paternoster row mdccxxiii price one shilling  to the right honorable robert walpole esquire first lord commissioner of the treasury chancellor of the exchequer and one of his majestys most honorable privy council sir i take the liberty of addressing the following sheets to you without the formality of asking your leave i have for a long time thought that such a formality proposes an implicit bargain which is very liable to be turned into ridicule this was the opinion of the late earl of hallifax who had received more addresses of this nature than any man of his time the end of this epistle is to return you my humble thanks for obligations past for obligations laid not only upon me but upon my country when you endeavored to serve it so warmly by opposing that desperate scheme which had like to have proved so fatal to it and by advising after the mischief was done the use of lenitives rather than of corrosives which might have thrown all things into confusion another intention of this address is to implore your protection for the expiring arts for those noble arts in which you have been educated and which have raised you to this envied height as it were on purpose that you may prove their protector and preserver you are not to be told sir and it would be easy to prove it to the rest of the world that the studies of humanity in great britain have flourished with the stage and that with the stage they must in time decline i speak not only of every other branch of poetry but even of that manly eloquence which appears so conspicuous in you whenever you are pleased to display its charms to an august assembly but the stage is just upon the point of sinking unless an arm so powerful as yours shall vouchsafe to support it a wat tyler a jack straw and a jack cade of parnassus have by encroachments got the entire direction of it from its easy patentee and seem resolved like their namesakes of old to advance the rabble and scum of parnassus and to oppress or demolish all whom god and nature have placed above them the dramatick piece on which i have writ the following remarks has with a thousand faults and a thousand weaknesses been palmd upon the world by shameful artifices for a wonder of art and nature and that no one may presume to detect the fraud the author has insolently dared to fly for protection to the king himself but the author ought to have known that it can never be the design of so good and so wise a king to shelter error from the attacks of reason he ought to have known that the king has declared his intention to encourage real merit that learning and arts may flourish by which glory may accrue to his reign and honor to great britain  you know very well sir that there has not been in europe these thousand years a prince more haughty than lewis xiv a prince more jealous of his authority and more ambitious of glory you know sir that almost all his poetical subjects who knew the darling passion of his soul addressed some of their works to him you know very well sir that most of them had been rewarded by him and yet when boileau in a discourse addressed to that king himself and afterward prefixed to his works exposed and ridiculed the greatest part of those pieces you know very well sir that that discerning prince who saw that his true interest and his solid glory depended upon the advancement of arts and upon the encouraging real merit was so far from being offended with boileau for the liberty he took in that discourse that it recommended him to his favor  i do believe from my very soul that it is the intention of so wise a prince as the king to encourage arts and learning and i should have believed it though the king had never told us so because i know it to be his true interest and therefore i can never believe that it is the kings intention any more to patronize ignorance and error in the writings of his subjects than to protect their vices and follies of any other kind for ignorance and error and vice and folly must estrange the hearts of his subjects from him only ignorance and error and vice and folly can favor and indulge that superstition and that false religion which are his mortal enemies and yet it has happened by i know not what sort of caprice of fortune or of fate that arts and learning have of late sensibly if not precipitately declined never did such a crowd of ill plays and miserable poems appear in so short a time we have hardly seen one good one and what is yet more surprising the most stupid of all those plays and poems have been addressed to the king himself one would swear that the authors were wild enough to expect that pensions gratuities and salaries should be appointed to encourage stupidity and to mortify sense and merit the very boast and glory of the british muse is comedy in which great britain excels every other country nay we can show more good and more entertaining comedies than all the rest of europe together during the whole reigns of king charles king james and king william there hardly passed a year without one or two and sometimes three during the reign of king william alone we had seven or eight very agreeable ones only from two gentlemen sir john vanbrugh and mr congreve but since that pernicious license was granted to four sordid players during the late queens time we have hardly had one that has been worth one farthing  sir as the king upon his accession to the crown came a stranger among us and as the ministry had then and have had almost ever since affairs of greater and more immediate importance than those of the theater the aforesaid grant of the late queen was unhappily renewed since which the stage has yearly declined and does decline daily and every branch of human learning daily declines with it etenim omnes arts quae ad humanitatem pertinent habeant quoddam commune vinculum and quasi cognatione quadam inter se continentur thus all the branches of human learning are like to be lost or very much impaired unless you generously undertake to support them if the condition in which they are were but known to the king i am confident he would not suffer them to be driven from among us during his reign as he regards either his own interest and glory or the interest and glory of the nation which he governs nor is it beneath the greatest and the wisest minister to take care of arts and letters two of the greatest that ever were in the world maecenas and cardinal richlieu are chiefly famous for the protection they gave to them whenever in any nation human learning has been diligently and impartially cultivated at that time that nation has flourished its king has been glorious and beloved and his ministers renowned and happy i am  sir your most humble most obliged and most obedient servant john dennis  the preface when sometime before the acting of sir richards play i observed the scandalous artifices that were practiced to procure success to it and was acquainted with the double cheat which was to be imposed on the town upon their pockets and upon their understandings i thought i should deserve the favor of the public if i discovered and prevented so gross an imposition and so palpable an affront but instead of meeting with the thanks which i expected and which i thought i had merited by the service i intended them i found myself in the same situation that surly was upon discovering the cheat in the alchymist for not only face and subtle who were joyntpartners in carrying on this poetical cheat made vehement outcries and spread various slanders and engaged several of their bubbles to believe them and disperse them but they obliged the most senseless of all their bubbles to repeat the scurrility which they dictated to them this immediately not only recalled butlers verses to my remembrance  doubtless the pleasure is as great of being cheated as to cheat as lookerson feel most delight that least perceive a jugglers slight and still the less they understand the more the admire his slight of hand but made me suspect that butler in this hardly came up to the full truth because the foolish part of the world loves more to be cheated than the knavish part does to cheat the generality of mankind are sure to love him who imposes on them and to hate him who opens their eyes for he who cheats them does it by entertaining some pleasing passion but he who undeceives them holds the glass to them and shows them truth and themselves a mortifying sight now whenever you put a man out of conceit with himself you put him out of humor with you likewise all the time the grand cheat of the south sea was carrying on by the first directors i constantly observed that if any one at any time was so hardy as to tell any one of the subcribers that he was cheated it made him terribly out of humor with him who told him so and augmented his implicit faith in the directors who cheated him and redoubled his respect and esteem for them  the double cheat abovementioned which was contrived by face and subtle in concert but executed chiefly by subtle was perhaps the most audacious that ever was imposed on the capital of a great people by persons who pretended at the same time to act by public authority and i know not which is the more impudent part of it the using such scandalous methods to make the most absurd and most insipid entertainment that ever came upon the english stage pass for the very best or the raising the prices for a humdrum representation which they had nicknamed a comedy and the raising them on the account of the scenes forsooth sir william davenant was the first who brought scenes upon the stage toward the middle of the last century and to defray the expense of them from time to time raised the theatrical receipt above a third part higher than it was before the pit which was before but eighteen pence was raised to half a crown the boxes which were half a crown before were advanced to four shillings the first gallery from a shilling to eighteen pence and the upper gallery from sixpence to a shilling so that as i said before there is above a third part of each nights receipt even at the common prices allowed for the scenes now what shall we say of these most sordid wretches whose avarice is no more to be satisfied than the barren womb or the grave they are not contented it seems with getting even at common prices each of them a thousand or fifteen hundred pounds a year which enables them to live in shameful luxury disgraceful to great britain they are not contented to loll each of them in his gilded chariot as often as they vouchsafe at their own expense to give the public a farce without doors and to look down upon the transitory bubles who support them they are not contented to enjoy their unmerited gains without paying any thing out of them either to poor or publi and that at a time when offices salaries pensions when every mortal every thing is taxed they are not content to be thus unaccountably indulged but at the same time they must impose upon the public and wrong their audiences of twelve hundred pounds as they certainly did during what in their theatrical cant they call the run of their last rhapsody  some people take success to be a proof of merit in writers whereas in the degeneracy of taste if it is attended with a cabal it is a certain proof of the want of it all the roman satirists were out of humor with the successful scriblers of their times because as it appears by what they say of them they owed their success to cabals and to the repeating their works to assemblies witness what horace says of fannius in the  th satire of the first book   beatus fannius ultro delatis capsis and imagine cum mea nemo scripta legate vulgo recitare timentis  and what juvenal says in the beginning of his first satire  semper ego auditor tantum nunquamne reponam vexatus toties rauci theseide codri ergo impune mihi recitaverit ille togatas hic elegos but besides undeserved success the roman satirists had another provocation to satire and that was hypocrisy when persons who were void of all morality pretended to a more rigid virtue than all the rest of the world and it was this chiefly that moved the spleen of lucilius as horace tells us in the first satire of his second book   est lucilius ausus primus in hunc operis componere carmina morem detrahere and pellem nitidus qua quisque per ora cederet introrsum turpis but if such vile wretches ever arrived to such a height of impudence as to pretend to teach virtue to the rest of the world the provocation then became insupportable and the satirist began with fury  ultra sauromatas fugere hinc libet and glacialem oceanum quoties aliquid de moribus audent qui curios simulant and bacchanalia vivunt juv sat   as i make no doubt but that upon the publishing this little treatise there will be the same outcries against critics and criticism which have been formerly so often raised i shall lay before the reader what the late earl of shaftsbury writ in defense of them with a great deal of good sense and address and penetration the passage is in the   0th page of the first volume of the characteristicks  nor should i suspect the genius of our writers or charge them with meanness and insufficiency on the account of this lowspiritedness which they discover were it not for another sort of fear by which they more plainly betray themselves and seem conscious of their own defects the critics it seems are formidable to em thecriticks are the dreadful specter the giants the enchanters who traverse and disturb them in their works these are the persecutors for whose sakes they are ready to hide their heads begging rescue and protection from all good people and flying in particular to the great by whose favor they hope to be defended from this merciless examining race for what can be more cruel than to be forced to submit to the rigorous laws of wit and write under such severe judges as are deaf to all courtship and can be wrought upon by no insinuation or flattery to pass by faults and pardon any transgression of art  to judge indeed of the circumstances of a modern author by the pattern of his prefaces dedications and introductions one would think that at the moment when a piece of his was in hand some conjuration was forming against him some diabolical powers drawing together to blast his work and cross his generous design he therefore rouzes his indignation hardens his forehead and with many furious defiances and avauntsatans enters on his business not with the least regard to what may justly be objected to him in a way of criticism but with an absolute contempt of the manner and art itself  odi profanum vulgus and arceo was in its time no doubt a generous defiance the avaunt was natural and proper in its place especially where religion and virtue were the poets theme but with our moderns the case is generally the very reverse and accordingly the defiance or avaunt should run much after this manner as for you vulgar souls mere naturals who know no art were never admitted into the temple of wisdom nor ever visited the sanctuaries of wit or learning gather yourselves together from all parts and hearken to the song or tale i am about to utter but for you men of science and understanding who have ears and judgment and can weigh sense scan syllables and measure sounds you who by a certain art distinguish false thought from true correctness from rudeness and bombast and chaos from order and the sublime away hence or stand aloof whilst i practice upon the easiness of those mean capacities and apprehensions who make the most numerous audience and are the only competent judges of my labors  accuracy of workmanship requires a criticks eye it is lost upon a vulgar judgment nothing grieves a real artist more than that indifference of the public which suffers work to pass uncriticizd nothing on the other side rejoices him more than the nice view and inspection of the accurate examiner and judge of work it is the mean genius the slovenly performer who knowing nothing of true workmanship endeavors by the best outward gloss and dazzling show to turn the eye from a direct and steady survey of his piece  what is there which an expert musician more desires than to perform his part in in the presence of those who are knowing in his art it is to the ear alone he applies himself the critical the nice ear let his hearers be of what character they please be they naturally austere morose or rigid no matter so they are critics able to censure remark and sound every accord and symphony what is there mortifies the good painter more than when amidst his admiring spectators there is not one present who has been used to compare the hands of different masters or has an eye to distinguish the advantages or defects of every style through all the inferior orders of mechanics the rule is found to hold the same in every science every art the real masters or proficients rejoice in nothing more than in the thorough search and examination of their performances by all the rules of art and nicest criticism why therefore in the muses name is it not the same with our pretenders to the writing art our poets and prose authors of every kind why in this profession are we found such critickhaters and indulged in this unlearned aversion unless it be taken for granted that as wit and learning stand at present in our nation we are still upon the foot of empiricks and mountebanks  from these considerations i take upon me absolutely to condemn the fashionable custom of inveighing against critics as the common enemies the pests and incendiaries of the commonwealth of wit and letters i assert on the contrary that they are the props and pillars of this building and that without the encouragement and propagation of this race we should remain as gothic architects as ever  thus far the late most ingenious and most judicious earl of shaftsbury has gone in the defense of critics and criticism i shall desire to say a little in my own particular defense i have been long since represented by persons who have never read what i have writ as one who likes nothing and one who makes it his business to find out faults and never discovers beauties upon my publishing lately the defense of sir fopling flutter this accusation was renewed though it was a contradiction in terms it being impossible that any one can write a defense of a dramatick poem which he does not like or commend a comedy in which he finds no beauties the truth of this affair is that no english author of any note has commended so many english poets as i have i shall give a list of some of them shakespeare ben johnson milton butler roscomon denham waller dryden wycherly otway etherege shadwell crown congreve phillips these are some of those whom i have occasionally commended and in some of them too have found out beauties which every one could not discover  if any one believes that in some places of the following sheets i have been too harsh and too severe i desire such a one to consider that i have been basely wronged and barbarously used by the persons upon whom i may be thought to be too severe and as the wrongs which have been done me do not come within the cognizance of the national law nor under the usual forms of the national equity i am as to this matter in a state of nature with those persons and am authorized by the law of nature to do myself justice as far as it may be done without offending the laws of my country or impartial equity  remarks on the preface to the conscious lovers the author tells us in the beginning of his preface that this comedy has been received with universal acceptance whether he is in the right or not i appeal to the world the reason which he gives for this universal acceptance is very extraordinary it has been received says he with universal acceptance for it was in every part excellently performed is it not a pleasant humility in a dramatick writer to affirm that he is indebted for his whole success to the actors i was apt to believe at the first sight that this was an affected modesty and a counterfeit humility but when i went a little further i began to think i was mistaken and that the author was in earnest for he seems to be apprehensive that the applause of the reader would hardly be so general as was that of the spectator and he does his endeavor to induce the reader not to pass a judgment of the play till he has seen it acted it must be remembered says he that a play is to be seen and is made to be represented with the advantage of actors nor can appear but with half the spirit without it now there have been several plays writ in several languages which were never designed to be seen there are two of our own the tragedy of sampson by milton and the state of innocence by dryden it is true indeed most plays are designed by their authors to be seen but that is not the chief design of a dramatick writer who has a good genius for such an author writes to all countries and to all ages and writes with the lively hope that his great masterpieces shall outlive the very language in which they are composed when sir richard says that a play can appear but with half the spirit unless we see it acted i would fain ask on whom he designs to impose this if he who reads a play is qualified to read and to judge he reads it with a truer and juster spirit than can be supplied by any company of actors if such a reader happens at any time to be better pleased with the representation of a play than the reading it it is an infallible sign that such a play is a very wretched performance  but let us see how sir richard goes on the greatest effect says he of a play in reading it is to excite the reader to go see it and when he does so it is then a play has the effect of precept and example good god is it possible that this could come from any one but a man who is resolved to show that he takes all his readers to be idiots when we read the tragedies of sophocles or euripides or the comedies of aristophanes plautus or terence is the greatest effect they have upon us the exciting us to go to see them acted when sir richard read the andria of terence was the exciting him to go to see it acted the greatest effect that it had upon him no the greatest effect that it had upon him was the desire to see another play acted and that was his own deplorable imitation of the andria  but a play says he has only in the representation the effect of example and precept so that it is not the dramatick persons it seems it is not timoleon scipio bontus who are to be the examples of virtue to us no it is the players i warrant who represent them it is mr booth mr robert wilks and mr colley cibber whose heroic virtue we are to imitate and by whose actions we are to be instructed  but sir richard goes on and tells us that the chief design of the conscious lovers was to be an innocent performance now there are a hundred innocent performances upon the british stage but perhaps he meant a performance that should have nothing but its innocence to recommend it and should by consequence be thought the only play of its kind but in that he is mistaken for there is one more and that is the performance of bays in the rehearsal which is indeed incoherent incongruous impertinent insipid and ridiculous but certainly a very innocent performance i am afraid it will appear by the following sheets that the conscious lovers has no small share of some of these qualities and has nothing valuable but barely the catastrophe and here i cannot but observe that sir richard who has upon so many occasions inveighed against the rules and particularly in that notable paper called the theater owes the only entertaining scene of his play to the observation of a rule of aristotle which is that the discovery should be immediately followed by the change of fortune that is by the catastrophe sir richard indeed without ever dreaming of aristotle had it from terence who took it from menander who had it from the precept of that great philosopher and from the practice of sophocles and euripides for the tragic and comic poets frequently borrowed their hints from one another but at the same time took care to do it with judgment and not to entrench upon each others province and therefore we see that the discovery in terence and the reconciliation of simo to pamphilus is comprehended in a narrow compass and has nothing in it of those violent transports of grief which are inconsistent with comedy  versibus exponi tragicis res comica non vult says horace in his art of poetry which boileau has imitated in the two following lines of his  le comique ennemi des soupirs and des pleurs nadmet point en soi des tragiques douleurs but i beg the readers pardon for this digression and now return to the preface  as to the quarrel in the fourth act i shall speak to it in its place in the mean time i am of the number of those who believe that this incident and the case of the father and daughter are not the proper subjects of comedy when sir richard says that any thing that has its foundation in happiness and success must be the subject of comedy he confounds comedy with that species of tragedy which has a happy catastrophe when he says that it is an improvement of comedy to introduce a joy too exquisite for laughter he takes all the care that he can to show that he knows nothing of the nature of comedy does he really believe that moliere understood the nature of it i say moliere who in the opinion of all europe excepting that small portion of it which is acquainted with ben johnson had born away the prize of comedy from all nations and from all ages if for the sake of his profit he had not descended sometimes too much to buffoonry let sir richard or any one look into that little piece of moliere called la critique de lecole des femmes and he shall find there that in molieres opinion it is the business of a comic poet to enter into the ridicule of men and to expose the blind sides of all sorts of people agreeably that he does nothing at all if he does not draw the pictures of his contemporaries and does not raise the mirth of the sensible part of an audience which says he it is no easy matter to do this is the sense of moliere though the words are not his exactly  when sir richard talks of a joy too exquisite for laughter he seems not to know that joy generally taken is common like anger indignation love to all sorts of poetry to the epick the dramatick the lyrick but that that kind of joy which is attended with laughter is the characteristick of comedy as terror or compassion according as one or the other is predominant makes the characteristick of tragedy as admiration does of epick poetry  when sir richard says that weeping upon the sight of a deplorable object is not a subject for laughter but that it is agreeable to good sense and to humanity he says nothing but what all the sensible part of the world has already granted but then all that sensible part of the world have always denied that a deplorable object is fit to be shown in comedy when sir george etherege in his comedy of sir fopling flutter shows loveit in all the height and violence of grief and rage the judicious poet takes care to give those passions a ridiculous turn by the mouth of dorimant besides that the subject is at the bottom ridiculous for loveit is a mistress who has abandoned her self to dorimant and by falling into these violent passions only because she fancies that something of which she is very desirous has gone beside her makes herself truly ridiculous thus is this famous scene in the second act of sir foppling by the character of loveit and the dextrous handling the subject kept within the bounds of comedy but the scene of the discovery in the conscious lovers is truly tragical indiana was strictly virtuous she had indeed conceived a violent passion for bevil but all young people in full health are liable to such a passion and perhaps the most sensible and the most virtuous are more than others liable but besides that she had kept this passion within the bounds of honor it was the natural effect of her esteem for her benefactor and of her gratitude that is of her virtue these considerations rendered her case deplorable and the catastrophe downright tragical which of a comedy ought to be the most comical part for the same reason that it ought to be the most tragical part of a tragedy  before i take my leave of sir richards preface i cannot help saying a word to his song which he has brought in here by violence to the great surprise of the reader for no other end than to show that he is as notable at meter as he is at prose he seems as much concerned for the omission of it in the representation of his as bays in the third act of the rehearsal is for the neglect of his nay and to have as high an opinion of it as that merry bard discovers that he has of his when he says to johnson what are they gone without singing my last new song s bud would it were in their bellies i will tell you mr johnson if i have any skill in these matters i vow to gad this song is peremptorily the very best that ever yet was written you must know it was made by tom thimble s first wife after she was dead  so that this song of mr bays too as well as his brother sir richards is a lovesong designed just as judiciously expressed just as passionately but more harmoniously more freely and better contrived for melody and yet from the omission of this song of his does sir richard take an occasion to affront the finest artist of his kind in the world and to treat signor carbonelli like a country fiddler who sings john dory at wakes and fairs to hobnaild peasants and milkmaids  i thought here to take my leave but the sight of terence and cibber together provokes me to go a little farther  jungentur jam gryphes equis aevoque sequenti cum canibus timidi venient ad pocula damae virg sir richard says that he is extremely surpised to find what cibber told him prove a truth that what he valued himself so much upon the translation of terence should be imputed to him as a reproach sir richard knew very well that cibber had said so many false things with relation to this play that he might be very well surpised to find truth come from him especially upon that subject but sir richard is mistaken cibber is constant to himself and does not deviate from falsehood upon this occasion no mortal reproaches sir richard with his translation of terence he has shown clearly that he is not capable of translating any one scene of him but though he had been never so capable he ought to have known that a translation of terence by the best hand in the world would not succeed upon the english stage he ought to have known the defect that the romans themselves who lived some time after him and especially caesar found in that comic poet the great objection to him was that he wanted the comic force that is to say that he had not in his comedies that humor and pleasantry which are so agreeable to the nature of comedy for the force of any kind of writing consists chiefly in that which distinguishes it from all other kinds now the ridicule being that which distinguishes comedy from every other kind of poetry the comic force must consist in that but how came it to pass then that five of the six comedies of terence succeeded upon the roman stage the answer is plain because the generality of the romans at the time they were writ knew no better the roman comedy in general had but little of that agreeable pleasantry that is fit to divert men of sense which occasioned the following censure of quintilian in comaedia maxim claudicamus licet varro dicat musas aelii stolonis sententia plautino sermon locuturas fuisse si latin loqui vellent licet caecilium veteres laudibus ferant licet terentii scripta ad scipionem africanum referantur quae tamen sunt in hoc genere elegantissima and plus adhuc habitura gratiae si intra versus trimetros stetissent vix levem consequimur umbram adeo ut mihi sermo ipse romanus non recipere videatur illam solis concessam atticis venerem quando eam ne graeci quidem in alio genere linguae obtinuerint and therefore when shadwell undertook to write a comedy upon the plan of the adelphi he who very well knew the nature of his art and by consequence knew what was defective in the roman comedy took particular care to supply from his own invention the ridicule that was wanting in that and it was by using that method that he made the squire of alsatia a very good and very entertaining comedy moliere who writ upon the same plan has done the very same thing in his lecole des maris he has done the very same in his fourberies de scapin which is writ upon the plan of the phormio but in the latter he has gone too far and shamefully to use the expression of boileau coupled terence with jackpudding a conjunction as scandalous as sir richard had made of terence and his friend cibber i heartily congratulate both of them upon this their mutual friendship they are par nobile fratrum a pair so pious so good so human so virtuous so religious that they are perfectly secured even in the midst of a treacherous world of each others mutual fidelity because there is not in the world that third person who is fit to be a friend to either the knight was too humble when he attributed the great success of his play to the players in general the success is only due to himself and to his virtuous friend that is to that cabal which was so industriously convened by them and to those artifices which were with so much skill conducted by them they have done greater services than this for each other and have secured the stage to themselves alone which they regard as their proper domain and therefore every stranger who for the future comes upon their ground is to be esteemed a trespasser in the mean time they have resolved between themselves to make the town swallow any entertainment which they shall think fit to provide for them and they seem agreed to vouch for each other cibber is to make affidavit that the knights gudgeons are codfish and seacarp that arrived by the last fishpool and the knight is to give it upon his immaculate honor that cibbers stricklebats and millersthumbs are either mullets or turbuts and they seem to have made a formal order that the town shall believe them under the penalty of being treated with the same anathemas that martin and john were treated by peter in the tale of a tub that is if you will not give credit to what we tell you rather than believe your senses gd eternally damn you cibber indeed has received some transitory rebukes upon taking this resolution but he still keeps firm to his point and is resolved to carry it  remarks on the conscious lovers i have determined to make some remarks with brevity and impartiallity upon a late dramatick performance called the conscious lovers a comedy that i may be then certainly able to determine whether the great success of it is owing to uncommon merit or to those extraordinary infamous methods which i have lately taken notice of in a former treatise and which if there is not a sudden stop put to them will occasion the utter downfall of the stage and of all the arts dependent on it  it is an observation of aristotle in the sixteenth chapter of his poeticks that there should be no incident in the action of a tragedy which should be without its reason because the absurdity of the incidents would destroy the probability of the action and turn poetical fiction into downright falsehood now if upon this account it is required that all the incidents should be reasonable in tragedy it is still more requisite in comedy where the probable is more necessary and the wonderful less tolerable but now this whole dramatick performance seems to me to be built upon several things which have no foundation either in probability or in reason or nature the father of indiana whose name is danvers and who was formerly an eminent merchant at bristol upon his arrival from the indies from whence he returns with a great estate carries on a very great trade at london unknown to his friends and relations at bristol under the name of sealand now this fiction without which there could be no comedy nor any thing called a comedy is not supported by probability or by reason or nature it is true he tells his daughter in the fifth act toward the top of the   d page that when his misfortunes drove him to the indies for reasons too tedious to be mentioned at the time he spoke he changed his name of danvers into sealand when his misfortunes drove him out of his country those misfortunes were reasons sufficient to account for the changing his name but is it probable that at his arrival in the indies or at his return to england with a vast estate he should still retain the name of sealand is it natural to believe that under that borrowed name he should conceal himself from his family and all his relations as it appears by what his daughter says act ii page  0 that he does is it credible that he could be such a monster as never to send to bristol after his arrival from the indies to enquire after his wife his sister and his daughter and that he should feloniously marry a second wife without ever knowing what was become of the first is it reasonable to believe that if he could be absurd enough to design this he could ever possibly effect it is it possible that a man can return from the indies with a vast estate and the world should not know either what he is or what he was when he went thither especially when he traded to every part of the globe is there so much as one man in england with a vast estate whose original is not known or was there ever any one great merchant of london whose family and original was not known to the merchants at bristol when betwixt the one and the other there is always so strict and constant a communication  but secondly the filial obedience of young bevil is carried a great deal too far he is said to be one of a great estate and a great understanding and yet he makes a promise to his father not to marry without his consent which is a promise that can do his father only a vain imaginary good and may do him real hurt a young man of a great understanding cannot but know that if he makes such a promise he may be obliged to break it or perish or at least be unhappy all the rest of his life such a one cannot but know that he may possibly be seized with a passion so resistless and so violent that he must possess or perish and consequently if the woman who inspires this passion be a woman of strict virtue he must marry or perish or at least be mortally uneasy for the rest of his life children indeed before they come to years of discretion are obliged to pay a blind obedience to their parents but after they are come to the full use of their reason they are only bound to obey them in what is reasonable indeed if a son is in expectation of an estate from his father he is engaged to a good deal of compliance even after he comes to years of discretion but that was not bevils case he enjoyed a very good one of his mothers by virtue of a marriage article and therefore it was unreasonable in him to make such a promise to his father as it was unreasonable in his father to urge him to it especially upon so sordid a motive as the doubling a great estate this is acting in a manner something arbitrary and it ill becomes an author who would be thought a patron of liberty to suppose that fathers are absolute when kings themselves are limited if he had not an understanding of his own to tell him this he might have learned from mr lock in his sixth chapter of his admirable essay on government that every man has a right to his natural freedom without being subjected to the will or authority of any other man children i confess says that great man are not born in this full state of equality though they are born to it their parents have a sort of rule and jurisdiction over them when they come into the world and for some time after but it is says he but a temporary one the bonds of this subjection are like the swaddling clothes which they are wrapped up in and supported by in the weakness of their infancy age and reason as they grow up loosen them till at length they drop quite off and leave a man at his own free disposal  the same author a little after adds that god having given man an understanding to direct his actions has allowed him a freedom of will and liberty of acting as properly belonging thereunto within the bounds of that law he is under but while he is in an estate wherein he has no understanding of his own to direct his will he is not to have any will of his own to follow he that understands for him must will for him too he must prescribe to his will and regulate his actions but when he comes to the estate that made his father a freeman the son is a freeman too  this holds says that great man in all the laws a man is under whether natural or civil is a man under the law of nature what made him free of that law what gave him a free disposing of his property according to his own will within the compass of that law i answer a state of maturity wherein he might be supposed capable to know that law that so he might keep his actions within the bounds of it when he has acquired that state he is presumed to know how far that law is to be his guide and how far he may make use of his freedom and so comes to have it till then some body else must guide him who is presumed to know how far the law allows a liberty if such a state of reason such an age of discretion made him free the same shall make his son free too is a man under the law of england what made him free of that law that is to have the liberty to dispose of his actions and possessions according to his own will within the permission of that law a capacity of knowing that law which is supposed by that law at the age of twenty one and in some cases sooner if this made the father free it shall make the son free too till then we see the law allows the son to have no will but he is to be guided by the will of his father or guardian who is to understand for him and if the father die and fail to substitute a deputy in this trust if he has not provided a deputy to govern his son during his minority during his want of understanding the law takes care to do it some other must govern him and be a will to him till he has attained to a state of freedom and his understanding be fit to take the government of his will but after that the father and son are equally free as much as a tutor and pupil after nonage equally subjects of the same law together without any dominion left in the father over the life liberty or estate of the son whether they be only in the state and under the law of nature or under the positive laws of an established government  i am sensible that this quotation has been a great deal too long and yet to set the unreasonableness of bevils promise in a full light i am obliged to add what the same author says a little lower in the very same chapter viz the power of the father extends not to the laws or goods which either his childrens industry or anothers bounty has made theirs nor to their liberty neither when they are once arrived to the enfranchisement of the years of discretion the fathers empire then ceases and he can from thenceforwards no more dispose of the liberty of his son than of any other man and it must be far from an absolute or perpetual jurisdiction from which a man may withdraw himself having license from divine authority to leave father and mother and cleave to his wife  from what i have quoted from so judicious and so penetrating an author i think it is pretty plain that young bevil who disposed of part of his estate without nay and as he might reasonably suppose against the consent of his father might a fortiori have disposed of his person too if it had not been for his unreasonable promise and that it is highly improbable that one of the estate and understanding which he is said to have should absurdly make a promise which might possibly endanger the happiness of his whole life it is said indeed in more than one place of the play that the son has uncommon obligations to his father but we are neither told nor are we able to guess what those obligations are what uncommon obligations can a son who has a great estate in possession have to a father of so sordid a nature as sir john bevil shows himself act   page    besides what obligations can be binding enough to make a man of a great estate part with liberty with the very liberty of his choice in the most important action of his life upon which the happiness of all the rest depends  but as unreasonable as this promise is which young bevil made to his father by which he gave away his birthright his liberty yes the very liberty of his choice in an affair upon which his happiness most depended his behavior to indiana is still more unaccountable he loves her and is beloved by her makes constant visits and profuse presents to her and yet conceals his passion from her which may be perhaps a clumsy expedient for the authors preparing the discovery but is neither agreeable to nature nor reason for it is impossible that any young man in nature in health and vigor and in the height of a violent passion can so far command himself by the mere force of reason i am willing indeed to allow that he may be able to do it by the assistance of the true religion but the business of a comic poet is only to teach morality grace is not taught but inspired the dreadful mysteries of christianity are but ill compatible with the lightness and mirth of comedy or with the obscenity and profaneness of a degenerate stage or with the dispositions of an assembly composed of persons who have some of them no religion and some of them not the true one besides that nothing but a doctrine taken from the moral law can be a just foundation of a fable which every true comedy is  nor is such a behavior any more agreeable to reason than it is to nature bevil loves indiana and is beloved by her she adores him she dies for him and he knows it he observes it and observes at the same time that so violent a passion is attended with equal anxiety and that anxiety is entirely caused by the perplexing doubt she is in whether she is beloved or not as appears by what he says himself act   p    why then does he not declare himself and by that declaration compose her mind and qualify her to expect with patience the benefit of time it is indeed true that he had promised his father never to marry without his consent while his father lived but he had not promised him never to love without his consent for that would have been a ridiculous promise a promise the performance of nonperformance of which was not in his own power and would depend entirely on what the people call chance and what philosophers call providence what could he mean then by not declaring himself as the love he had conceived for indiana was no breach of the promise he had made to his father so neither could he violate it by any declaration of that passion what then once more can he mean by his silence his only reasonable way of proceeding had been to acquaint not only his mistress but his father and all the world with the passion which he felt for her and with the necessity he was in to marry her or to be for ever miserable such a declaration was not at all inconsistent with his duty and if his father had either reason or compassion would have caused him to relent and to release his son from a promise the persevering in which must prove unhappy or fatal to him if it should be said that such a concealment of his passion was necessary that he might make a retreat with honor in case his father should still be obstinate to this i answer that there was no retreat for him unless he would at the same time retreat from virtue and honor that his behavior had fixed and determined him that by his generosity and constant visits he had raised the passion of indiana to such a height that his leaving her would in all likelihood be followed by madness or by selfmurder or by dreadful hysterical symptoms as deplorable as either of which what passes between her father and her in the fifth act is a sufficient proof beside that such a retreat would prove as fatal to her honor as to her person he had for some time made constant visits he had made very extravagant presents to her he had made no declaration of the affection he had for her either to her or to her aunt isabella or acquainted any one with his design to marry her if he could obtain his fathers consent now can any thing be more plain than that such a behavior if he left her would ruin the reputation of the poor lady and cause all the world to entertain such thoughts of her as sealand and myrtle had already expressed and thus i have endeavored to show that the behavior of bevil to indiana in his concealing his passion from her is as ridiculously whimsical as that of cimberton to her sister lucinda  the catastophre i must confess is very moving but it would be more so if it were rightly and reasonably handled because it would be much more surprising for the surprise is in a good measure prevented by the behavior of isabella upon the first appearance of sealand which if it had not been out of all probability and nature would have prevented it more it was highly in nature and probability that isabella upon the first discovering her brother should fly into an excessive transport of joy and have run to embrace him for when she is made to say that her brother must not know her yet she is made to give no reasons for it nor can the audience imagine any it is not isabella who says that but the author who clumsily uses it to serve a turn for if she had discovered herself to her brother at his first appearance it had prevented the audiences sorrow and compassion for the imaginary distress of indiana and consequently their return to joy but as aristotle and all the great critics after him have taught us that there is to be no incident in a dramatick poem but what must be founded on reason it happens as we observed above very unluckily here that there is no incident in the conscious lovers but what is attended by some great absurdity for the action of indiana in throwing away her bracelet is of the same stamp and is entirely the authors and not the dramatick persons for it was neither necessary nor profitable that indiana in the height of her agony should so much as think of her bracelet or if she did think of it should resolve to throw away the greatest token that she had to remember her dead mother for whose memory her grief and distress ought naturally to renew and redouble her tenderness but the author is obliged to have recourse to this as an awkard expedient though the best he could find to bring on the discovery but had he known any thing of the art of the stage he would have known that those discoveries are but dully made which are made by tokens that they ought necessarily or probably to spring from the whole train of the incidents contrary to our expectation and how easy was it to bring that about here for such a discovery had been very well prepared by what young bevil says to humphrey in the first act and by the hint indiana gives to sealand in the fifth act which hint the old gentleman readily takes for when she tells him she had been made an infant captive on the seas he immediately cries out an infant captive and after some interruption given by indiana he says dear lady o yet one moments patience my heart grows full with your affliction but yet there is something in your story that  she answers as if she were at cross purposes my portion here is bitterness and sorrow to which he replies do not think so pray answer me does bevil know your name and family so that a few questions more pertinently answered would have brought on the discovery now if the discovery had been made this way and isabella had not known her brother at her first seeing him but had come in to sealand and indiana just after the discovery had been made there would have been two surprises both greater and more agreeable than now they are and both of them without absurdity  but now the mention of the infant captive brings to my remembrance the circumstances of that captivity which are to use mr cimbertons expression pregnant with absurdity indiana it seems with her mother and her aunt are taken in their passage to the indies by a privateer from toulon and carried into that place now where were they taken it must be either in the channel or on the ocean now in the first place i never heard that toulon set out any privateers secondly suppose they did it is improbable that a privateer from toulon should cruize in the ocean and much more improbable that they should rove as far as the channel thirdly it is highly improbable that an east india vessel which had force enough to venture without a convoy should be taken by a privateer fourthly it is not a jot more probable that supposing a privateer from toulon should have taken such a vessel it should choose to carry it into toulon rather than into breast or st malo for how long must a privateer be carrying an east india vessel from the channel to toulon which is above a thousand miles from the channel and little less distant from that part of the ocean over which our east india ships pass now in so long a voyage the privateer might very well be taken and the prize be retaken whereas the latter might be carried to breast or st malo with a hundred times less danger  well but let us suppose the privateer got safely with his prize into toulon does sir richard believe that toulon is situate under one of the poles that neither ship nor passengers were heard of in so many years if indiana was an infant isabella was old enough to write and if she was so indifferent or stupid as to omit it the captain of the ship and his mate would not fail to write to their owners to let them know the fate of their ship if there was no passage for letters directly through france yet the way of holland was open and upon the arrival of those letters not only the whole east india company but all london would have known what was become of the ship at a time when so many newswriters contended which could furnish the town with most and the freshest news so that if sealand upon his coming from the indies had made but never so little enquiry he would have found that his sister and daughter had been at toulon if he had made no enquiry he must have shown himself a fine gentleman indeed who would marry a second wife before he was certain the first was dead and it is impossible he could know that the first was dead without knowing that his sister and his daughter were at toulon  i shall now compare the relation that old bevil makes to his man humphrey in the first scene of the conscious lovers to that which simo makes to sosia in the beginning of the andria but i shall only compare them at present with relation to the incidents i shall take an opportunity afterward to consider the sentiments and expressions by themselves  the beginning of the andria is perfectly in nature simo begins the relation which he makes to sosia with a grave and a solemn air suitable to the disposition of mind he is in and the great concern he is under old bevil who is supposed to be in the same disposition of mind and to lie under the same concern begins the relation which he makes to humphrey with an impertinence dully gay and therefore the beginning of the conscious lovers is entirely out of nature  in the andria chremes a rich old athenian citizen offers to bestow his only daughter philumena with a great dowry on pamphilus the son of simo who accepts that offer for his son the match breaks off upon the discovery which pamphilus makes at the funeral of chrysis of his passion for glycerium simo the father pretends that it still goes on that he may take an opportunity from his sons refusal of giving him a severe reprimand  si propter amorem uxorem nolit ducere ea primum ab illo animadvertenda injuria est et nunc id operam do ut per falsas nuptias vera objurgandi causa sit si deneget in the beginning of the conscious lovers there is a very absurd imitation of this passage in terence where old bevil speaks thus to his man humphrey concerning his son  if there is so much in this amor of his that he denies upon my summons to marry i shall have cause enough to be offended and then by insisting upon his marrying to day i shall know how far he is engaged to the lady in masquerade and from thence only shall be able to take my measures  now it seems plain to me that simo would have reason to be angry at his sons refusal and that old bevil would have none pamphilus would refuse a wife with a great dowry which he wanted having nothing but what his father supplied him with who perhaps might not be very easy in his own circumstances besides glycerium passed for a courtezan which was not the case of indiana because she was believed to be the sister of chrysis who was publicly known to be one and it would provoke any father of a good family and who had all along lived with reputation in the world to find to the ruin and disgrace of that family his only son married to a whore or living with her as if he were married to her which was against both law and custom at athens and a great deal more scandalous there than it is in this blessed town as is evident from what simo says in that admirable scence which is between him and his son and chremes in the fifth act of this comedy where nature is drawn with such masterly strokes and in such lively and glowing colors  adeo nimpotentiesse animo ut praeter civium morem atque legem and sui voluntatem patris tamen hanc habere studeat cum summo probro but it is downright ridiculous in old bevil to pretend to be offended in case his son who is in possession of a great estate and entirely independent on his father and one whom the father himself calls a sober and discreet gentleman should refuse to marry at a minutes warning a woman whom he does not like and whom the father chooses only with the sordid view of doubling a great estate when what they had already was more than sufficient because the father is sordid must the son be unhappy must the son who has bespoke a dish for himself take up with another that is his aversion only because his father chooses it the passion which young bevil had for another is a just cause of his refusal and if his father is unreasonably offended the son who has no dependence upon him may very reasonably be comforted as the father knew very well that the son had no occasion for the wealth which would come from the marrying lucinda so he did not believe his frequenting indiana whether he supposed her an honorable or a kept mistress would bring any scandal either upon himself or his family witness what he says to sealand in act   page    concerning this very affair viz sir i cannot help saying that what might injure a citizens credit may be no stain to a gentlemans honor so that it is plain simo had two important reasons to be offended at his sons refufal which old bevil apparently had not because he rejected wealth which he wanted and courted infamy for which no one can have an occasion  the relation of what passed between young bevil and indiana at the masquerade is a very absurd imitation of what passed between pamphilus and glycerium at the funeral of chrysis pamphilus attends glycerium to the funeral of chrysis who passed for her sister while the body was burning glycerium in the agony of her grief ran to the fire and was about to throw herself into it when pamphilus half dead with fear runs to her catches hold of her throws his arms about her and by that action and his tender expostulation discovers the violence of that passion which he had hitherto concealed upon which glycerium by an action which manifested her habitual love weeping reclined her head upon his breast with a most moving tenderness this is the sense of that celebrated passage but is but barely the sense for no pen no tongue can express the elegance and the grace of terence  but now let us see the imitation of this in the conscious lovers it is in the first scene of the play where old bevil relates to his man humpey what passed at the last masquerade  sir j bevil you know i was last thursday at the masquerade my son you may remember soon found us out he knew his grandfathers habit which i then wore and though it was the mode in the last age yet the maskers you know followed us as if we had been the most monstrous figures in the whole assembly   humphrey i remember indeed a young man of quality in the habit of a clown that was particularly trouble some   sir j bevil right he was too much what he seemed to be   humphrey i knew he had a mind to come to that particular aside   sir j bevil ay he followed us till the gentleman who led the lady in the indian mantle presented that gay creature to the rustic and bid him like cymon in the fable grow polite by falling in love and let that worthy old gentleman alone meaning me the clown was not reformed but rudely persisted and offered to force off my mask with that the gentleman throwing off his own appeared to be my son and in his concern for me tore off that of the nobleman at this they seized each other the company called the guards and in the surprise the lady swooned away upon which my son quitted his adversary and had now no care but of the lady when raising her in his arms art thou gone cried he for ever  forbid it heaven  she revives at his known voice  and with the most familiar though modest gesture hangs in safety over his shoulder weeping but wept as in the arms of one before whom she could give herself a loose were she not under observation while she hides her face in his neck he carefully conveys her from the company   now there is this remarkable difference between what passed at the funeral and what passed at the masquerade that every thing that relates to the former seems to be either necessary or profitable and almost every thing that relates to the latter appears to be improbable how injudicious an imitation is the behavior of indiana at the masquerade of the behavior of glycerium at the funeral nothing can be more natural than the freedom which glycerium takes with pamphilus she loved him and was beloved by him she was betrothed to him she had no reserve for him the utmost familiarities had passed between them she was with child by him and expected every day that the time of her being delivered was come  the case of indiana is very different and her behavior is very inconsistent with her character it is true she was in love with young bevil but doubted very much whether that love was reciprocal he had been so far from taking the same liberty with her that pamphilus had done with glycerium that his behavior had been always very respectful and yet indiana uses the same familiarity upon this occasion with him that glycerium at the funeral does with pamphilus she revives at his known voice which she heard it seems after she had lost all her senses and comes from death to life upon it like the dead men in the rehearsal at the voice of poet bays and with the most familiar though modest gesture hangs in safety over his shoulder weeping but wept as in the arms of one before whom she could give herself a loose were she not under observation and while she hides her face in his neck he carefully conveys her from the company  now this behavior is by no means consistent with the character of indiana familiar and modest are not in this case very compatible and then what does sir richard mean by wept as in the arms of one before whom she could give herself a loose if these words have any meaning i would fain know what it is  in this first scene there is another very ridiculous imitation of what simo says to sosia in the first scene of the andria  simo et nunc id operam do ut per falsas nuptias vera objurgandi causa sit si degenet simul sceleratus davus si quid consili habet ut consumat nunc cum nihil obsint doli quem ego credo manibus pedibusque obnixe omnia facturum magis id adeo mihi ut incommodet quam ut obsequatur gnato sos quapropter si rogas mala mens malus animus  nunc tuum est officium has been ut adsimules nuptias perterrefacias davum observes filium quid agat quid cum illo consilii captet  thus have i gone through the whole train of incidents which are a heap of absurdities and inconsistences i have partly likewise gone through the character of young bevil who is made up of contradictions he is one who differs from himself as much as from the rest of the world this man of conscience and of religion is as arrant an hypocrite as a certain author it is indeed a pleasant religion that never seizes a man but when he is upon the point either of love or battle this man of conscience and of religion dissembles with his father most vilely which religion does by no means allow and so chooses rather to offend heaven than an old sordid blockhead who pretends to treat one who is independent of him and at years of discretion like an arrant boy yet this the son calls an honest dissimulation as he calls breach of trust the getting over a false point of honor in the first scene of the second act this man of religion is putting myrtle upon a fraud and palming two counterfeit lawyers upon old mrs sealand a practice which religion and morality both abhor  the character of young bevil therefore is made up of qualities either incoherent and contradictory as religion and dissimulation morality and fraud or most ridiculously consistent as circumspection and folly for one may say the same thing of young bevil that scandal in love for love says of and to foresight that if ever he commits an error it is not without a great deal of consideration circumspection and caution the character therefore of young bevil is not an image of any thing in life and especially in common life as every thing in comedy ought to be but the phantom of a feverish authors brain as several of the other characters likewise are  as young bevil is the character of such a young man as is not to be found in the world upon the foot of nature of which all true poetry is a just imitation cimberton is a creature who is set as much below humanity as bevil appears to be drawn above it he is an animal that is nothing so like a man as a monkey is nor is he near so well qualified to entertain a lady agreeably he is so very monstrous that one would not think he could be produced by any thing that had human shape and for the credit of human nature ought like a sooterkin to be demolished as soon as he appears  most of the other characters are faintly and coarsly drawn which is very strange if we consider the admirable patterns that terence has laid before him the characters of that comic poet i must confess are in no great compass but though they are few they are excellent they are so strong in nature that they may be taken for the life may be taken for persons rather than pictures and for real rather than dramatick persons sir richard seems to be wholly ignorant of what boileau has said of this matter who is one of the greatest of the french poets and one of the justest of their critics  aux depens du bon sens gardez de plaisanter jamais de la nature il ne faut secarter contemplez de quel air un pere dans terence vient dun fills amoreux gourmander limprudence de quel air cet amant ecoute ses lecons et court chez sa maistresse oublier ces chansons ce nest pas un portrait une image semblable cest un amant un fills un pere veritable that is  beware of being pleasant at the expense of good sense and take care that you never go out of nature observe with what an air a father in terence reprimands his amorous son for his imprudent conduct with what air the lover hearkens to his grave remonstrances then runs away to his mistress to laugh at these musty morals you would swear that you had before you the things themselves instead of a good picture and a just resemblance you would swear you had before you a real lover a real son and a real father the very character of simo in the andria is admirable and the relation he makes to sosia a masterpiece i never read it but i see the old athenian before my eyes in the very same colors that davus paints crito the andrian in the same comedy  cum faciem videas videtur esse quantivis pretii tristis severitas inest in voltu atque in verbis fides whatever he says goes to my heart whereas old bevil is an old fribling blockhead and that which comes from him scarce touches my lips  but if in this imitation of that relation which simo makes to sosia sir richard falls so very much short of terence in his incidents and his characters he is inexpressible degrees below him in his sentiments and his dialogue  the sentiments of terence are always true are always just and adapted to the characters his dialogue is the most charming that is to be found among the roman authors where is there that purity that elegance that delicacy that grace that harmony if it has any fault it is too uniform a politeness the servant speaking always with the same grace and the same elegance that his master does setting that aside it is every way accomplished it has particularly for its purity the authorities of two of the best and greatest of the roman judges caesar and cicero cicero says of this comic poet that he is optimus author latinitatis and all the world has seen the verses that julius caesar made upon the same author  tuque etiam in summis o diidiate menander poneris and merito pri sermonis amator etc but now the sentiments in the conscious lovers are often frivolous false and absurd the dialogue is awkard clumsy and spiritless the diction affected impure and barbarous and too often hibernian who that is concerned for the honor of his country can see without indignation whole crowds of his countrymen assembled to hear a parcel of teagues talking tipperary together and applauding what they say i know very well that what i now say will alarm some people and for that reason i shall shortly bring examples of the sentiments and the diction in the conscious lovers so palpable and so flagrant that they shall justify me in spite of the obstinacy and the clamours of his most foolish admirers  finis
