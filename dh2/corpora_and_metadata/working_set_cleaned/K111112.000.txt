pile of ruins   in the full prospect yonder hill commands over forests fields and vernalcoated plains the vestige of an ancient abbey stands close by a ruined castles rude remains ii half buried there lie many a broken bust and obelisk and urn overthrown by time and many a cherub here descends in dust from the rent roof and portico sublime iii the rivulets often frighted at the sound of fragments tumbling from the towers on high plunge to their source in secret caves profound leaving their banks and pebbly bottoms dry iv where reverend shrines in gothic grandeur stood the nettle or the noxious nightshade spreads and ashlings wafted from the neighboring wood through the worn turrets wave their trembling heads v there contemplation to the crowd unknown her attitude composed and aspect sweet sits musing on a monumental stone and points to the memento at her feet vi soon as sage evening checked days sunny pride i left the mantling shade in moral mood and seated by the maids sequestered side thus sighed the mouldering ruins as i viewed vii inexorably calm with silent pace here time has passed  what ruin marks his way this pile now crumbling over its hallowed base turned not his step nor could his course delay viii religion raised her supplicating eyes in vain and melody her song sublime in vain philosophy with maxims wise would touch the cold unfeeling heart of time ix yet the hoar tyrant though not moved to spare relented when he struck its finished pride and partly the rude ravage to repair the tottering towers with twisted ivy tied x how solemn is the cell oergrown with moss that terminates the view yon cloistered way in the crushed wall a timecorroded cross religion like stands mouldering in decay xi where the mild sun through saintencypherd glass illumd with mellow light that brownbrowd isle many rapt hours might meditation pass slow moving twixt the pillars of the pile xii and piety with mysticmeaning beads bowing to saints on every side inurnd trod often the solitary path that leads where now the sacred altar lies oerturnd xiii through the gray grove between those withering trees amongst a rude group of monuments appears a marbleimagd matron on her knees half wasted like a niobe in tears xiv low levelled in the dust her darlings laid death pitied not the pride of youthful bloom nor could maternal piety dissuade or soften the fell tyrant of the tomb xv the relics of a mitred saint may rest where mouldering in the niche his statue stands now nameless as the crowd that kissed his vest and craved the benediction of his hands xvi near the brown arch redoubling yonder gloom the bones of an illustrious chieftain lie as traced upon the timeunletterd tomb the trophies of a broken fame imply xvii ah what avails that over the vassal plain his rights and rich demesnes extended wide that honor and her knights composed his train and chivalry stood marshalled by his side xviii though to the clouds his castle seemed to climb and frowned defiance on the desperate foe though deemed invincible the conqueror time levelled the fabric as the founder low xix where the light lyre gave many a softening sound ravens and rooks the birds of discord dwell and where society sat sweetly crowned eternal solitude has fixed her cell xx the lizard and the lazy lurking bat inhabit now perhaps the painted room where the sage matron and her maidens sat sweetsinging at the silverworking loom xxi the travellers bewildered on a waste and the rude winds incessant seem to roar where in his groves with arching arbours graced young lovers often sighed in days of yore xxii his aqueducts that led the limpid tide to pure canals a crystal cool supply in the deep dust their barren beauties hide times thirst unquenchable has drained them dry xxiii though his rich hours in revelry were spent with comus and the laughterloving crew and the sweet brow of beauty still unbent brightened his fleecy moments as they flew xxiv fleet are the fleecy moments fly they must not to be stayed by masque or midnight roar nor shall a pulse amongst that mouldering dust beat wanton at the smiles of beauty more xxv can the deep statesman skilled in great design protract but for a day precarious breath or the tuned follower of the sacred nine sooth with his melody insatiate death xxvi no  though the palace bar her golden gate or monarchs plant ten thousand guards around unerring and unseen the shaft of fate strikes the devoted victim to the ground xxvii what then avails ambitions wide stretched wing the schoolmans page or pride of beautys bloom the crapeclad hermit and the richrobd king levelled lie mixed promiscuous in the tomb xxviii the macedonian monarch wise and good bade when the mornings rosy reign began courtiers should call as round his

where mortals mix in undistinguished dust xxx so saladin for arts and arms renowned egypt and syrias wide domains subdued returning with imperial triumphs crowned sighed when the perishable pomp he viewed xxxi and as he rode high in his regal car in all the purple pride of conquest dressed conspicuous over the trophies gained in war placed pendent on a spear his burial vest xxxii while thus the herald cried  this son of power this saladin to whom the nations bowed may in the space of one revolving hour boast of no other spoil but yonder shroud xxxiii search where ambition raged with rigor steeled where slaughter like the rapid lightning ran and say while memory weeps the bloodstained field where lies the chief and where the common man xxxiv vain are the pyramids and mottod stones and monumental trophies raised on high for time confounds them with the crumbling bones that mixed in hasty graves unnoticd lie xxxv rests not beneath the turf the peasants head soft as the lords beneath
