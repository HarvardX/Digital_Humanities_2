the siege of aquileia a tragedy act i scene i the palace court enter paulus and titus this is no time to strive for vain renown the fate of rome remember that my brother depends on the defense of aquileia titus paulus i know  paulus but thou do not consider the importance of this war we fight not now as often since freedom fell our fathers fought when latian chiefs contended who should reign with half the senate listed on each side the victor still was roman and revered the gods and temples of immortal rome but over yon mighty host that girds our walls fierce maximin commands whether of thrace or wild dalmatia so obscure his birth himself scarce knows but sure barbarian born this savage soldier nursed in blood and war whom military frenzy has set up to trample on mankind abhors a roman and marks for death the noble and the brave his yoke at last the indignant senate scorns the slumbering genius of our country wakes and rouses slothful italy to arms the furious tyrant from the frontier hastes like a wild beast galled by the hunters spear and breathing vengeance rushes upon rome here first opposed tenfold his fury burns here in the pass of fate our father stands defies and stops the monster in his rage till romes last legions come to give him battle now when a soldiers life is of such moment when destiny hangs on a single day to fight for glory titus were a crime  titus no paulus no it is not fame alone that titus seeks to purchase from the foe though such a crime the gods and men would pardon i know the peril that over rome impends and know the hated cause of all our ills that army only brave against their country i mean to smite them and their giant leader whom nature for a gladiator formed to be the sport and not the lord of rome the blow once struck our foe must raise the siege or waste his veterans in vain attacks and give to gordianus easy conquest  paulus were this a frontier city far from rome and yon huge host composed of foes remote german or parthian i would say to thee lead on my brother shield to shield wed go and fire yon turret or together perish but now when conquest by delay is gained when aquileia guards the walls of rome dread of the great event has so possessed me that like the persian soldier i could stay my arm uplifted patient to the call of cautious duty  titus and renouncing fame oh paulus you have gained long since the prize that i contend for every martial palm thy sword has won when i like thee am great in deeds of arms like thee i may be wary now to my brother i lay bare my breast this famous siege approaches to its end whatever end the ruling gods ordain yet no distinguished action graces me i have done my duty that i reckon nothing the meanest soldier has not shrunk from duty son of aemilius and thy brother paulus i must do more and by the gods i will here i have found a path that leads to glory do not oppose me else  we are friends no more  our father comes speak not against my purpose and i shall move the consuls noble mind enter aemilius aemilius health to my sons paulus and titus heaven guard our fathers life  aemilius and bless my children ha your looks are keen yours chiefly titus what has stirred your spirit how points the enemy this quiet night in preparation past portends a storm  paulus on that attack which threats the eastern gate the enemy has labored all night long repairing what the rivers rage had ruined  aemilius it was a friendly flood the river god with all his waters guards his native walls on that strong quarter they can never prevail the north i fear where yon stupendous tower our works commands  titus it shall not long command let but the consul grant me my desire  aemilius what would my son  titus their tower is weakly guarded at break of day a soldier from yon camp fled to my post hollow and gaunt he was his shrivelled limbs scarce bore his sounding arms like him he said with toil and famine worn were half the tyrants host for maximin mad with delay and fiercer from repulse reviles his soldiers drives them to the trench with whips and sharp reproach this day overcome by strong necessity he breathes a while and sends his legions forth to gather in whatever this exhausted region yields i saw the busy foragers in troops march and disperse themselves on every side like playful children on a summer day secure and careless for no martial band of late has sallied from our guarded gates this is the time permit me o my father now to attack their ill defended lines and fire that mighty tower in which they trust  aemilius well have thou spoke my son thy zeal i love nor must thy skill and judgment pass unpraisd be thus attentive still and trust me titus in future sieges and in other wars swift execution shall thy purpose honor  titus never shall i see another siege like this never draw my sword in such a glorious cause alas my lord check not my spring of thought nor nip the only bud it yet has borne  aemilius riper occasions will thy valor claim danger comes on typhaeuslike it comes whose fabled stature every hour increased  titus o judge not of the counsel by the weight of him that gives it would to heaven my lord that i could now divest me of that youth which mars my credit cheerfully i would step far into age to gain but for a day the grave authority which years bestow  paulus what brings the brave numidian gartha hither enter gartha gartha hail to the general  aemilius hail valiant gartha how has the morning past where you command  gartha it has been busy the presumptuous foe in loose disordered squadrons ranged the fields i watched the time and sudden as the blast that rises in the desert out we rushed and swept them from the plain safe in our speed we urged the chase far as the rising ground and unmolested viewed the camp below this worthy of your notice i observed their wondrous tower the work of many a day stands now protected by a feeble guard  titus thanks for thy welcome tidings noble gartha the guardian gods of rome bend from their skies and point this action out hear me my father if ever since my birth i gave thee joy if ever thou did as parents often are wont interpret large the promise of my childhood o hear and grant my chief and dear request let me go forth be this my first exploit to wrap in fire the tyrants boasted tower that rome who glories in the aemilian line may join your titus to his kindred names  aemilius in thee the spirit of thy fathers speak or some superior power thy bosom fires whom i oppose no more go and fulfill thy destiny brave gartha too shall add his troops to thine prepare what else   titus it is done destructive instruments and balls of fire are ready at the gate  aemilius farewell my son if you prevail urge not too far your fortune remember still my words that when we meet i may have cause to praise thy conduct then as now thy courage titus  titus gartha come exeunt titus and gartha aemilius paulus lead thou thy legion to the gate and favor their retreat it may be needful but mix not in the fight for mighty cities have been by such temerity surpised  paulus would there was no roman breast more prone to rash attempts than mine i wish my lord that i had led and titus had sustained me enter an officer officer consul of rome this arrow thus inscribed fell on the green slopd bank fast by my post and as it bears your name myself have brought it aemilius reads in three days hence even with the ides of june the roman army comes to your relief be sparing of your troops protract the siege thou art the shield of rome and gordianus  aemilius soldier return and publish to the legions the welcome tidings of a near relief  officer gladly my lord much have the troops endured and with unshaken constancy they suffer exit officer paulus had this advice arrived ere titus went i think he hardly had obtained permission though maximin should raise an hundred towers and like the giants when they warred with jove pile mountains on each other high as heaven for three short days his fury we may scorn  aemilius go and prevent the sally tell thy brother what the imperial mandate here contains it is the emperors command recalls him  paulus with pleasure i obey exit paulus aemilius alone i must reserve my sons my soldiers for a nobler service and in the battle aid the roman arms the hour approaches that must give to rome a legal lord by her own suffrage chosen or fix a barbarous master over mankind that barbarous master i shall never own if i could stoop to drag the servile chain and live the vassal of a vile dalmatian yet i could not conceal me in the crowd of prostrate romans i that stood aloft and bore through italy the senates standard fast by that standard will i plant my foot there with my boys a glorious conquest gain or end at once the long aemilian line cornelia appears behold the only object that can shake one moment my resolve what will become of thee cornelia doomed perhaps to live like priams wretched queen the slave of those by whom her sons her husband country fell enter cornelia and priest cornelia why is my lord alone where are my sons  aemilius this day cornelia brings us welcome tidings the emperor approaches with his host  cornelia thanks to the gods but say where are my children  aemilia this instant i expect them to return  cornelia from whence aemilius  aemilius from the northern gate titus had formed a brave a great design but when assurance of relief arrived my paulus hastened to recall his brother  cornelia it is as i feared paulus will come too late the omens of the gods must be fulfilled  aemilius what evil omens has cornelia seen  cornelia it is strange to tell but as i slumbering lay about that hour when glad aurora springs to chase the lagging shades methought i was in rome and full of peace the city seemed my mind oblivious too had lost it is care serene i stepped along the lofty hall imbellishd with the statues of our fathers when suddenly an universal groan issued at once from every marble breast aghast i gazed around when slowly down from their high pedestals i saw descend the murdered gracchi hand in hand the brothers stalked toward me as they approached more near they were no more the gracchi but my sons paulus and titus at that dreadful change i shrieked and waked but never from my mind the spectacle shall part their rueful eyes their cheeks of stone the look of death and woe so strange a vision never from fancy rose the rest my lord this holy priest can tell  aemilius why this is nothing but a common dream for often when the waking mind is charged with apprehension of uncertain ills imagination in the hour of rest presents wild fantastic combinations that have a shade and tincture of the past but it is the weakness of the human mind that joins the vain assemblage to futurity  priest men reason thus my lord who think their reason can grasp and measure all presumptuous thought sounds more than human have been often heard and shapes celestial seen by mortal man but yet most frequent in the silent night are warnings given by strange portentuous dreams the history of mighty rome abounds in awful instances the old republic by them has often been swayed and often prefervd  aemilius but tell me priest of jove what do the gods by their more certain omens now declare  priest consul with the most venerable rites that our religion knows i have performed a sacrifice to capitolian jove this pious matron present never yet since at the altars of the gods i stood did i behold such omens of calamity yet they were intricate ambiguous dark and though some parts i might interpret fair even these were mixed and full of dire perplexity no further can i see into the cloud that veils the will of heaven but this i say and by the scepter of the god i serve it is the truth some dreadful danger hangs over thee thyself this city or thy race shout cornelia ha what means that shout  aemilius it is a joyful shout behold the cause see where that dusky smoke darkens the air and now the flame bursts out their turret blazes and my titus conquers  cornelia o heaven and earth o son too well beloved why do these cruel omens check my joy enter an officer officer consul your valiant son has fired the tower but whilst he urged too far the flying foe a band that lay concealed beyond the height has gained the plain between him and the city  aemilius o rashly brave whom i forewarned in vain  retire cornelia yet he may be rescued lucius  enter another officer lucius the northern gate unguarded stands for when brave paulus saw his brothers peril he with his legion rushed upon the foe and furious is the fight  cornelia both both are lost  aemilius unhappy youths my steady paulus too where is our discipline obedience where  i have no leisure now for words cornelia implore the gods to guard you and your children exit with his attendants manent cornelia and priest cornelia perhaps ere this cornelia has no children they both are fallen into the fatal snare tremendous oracle too late revealed  priest abandon not thy soul to such despair the sword of war devouring as it is consumes not all the destined number die and from the bloodiest field still some return  cornelia my sons will never return i know them well the noble heart of titus if he lives this instant swells with grief and pride and shame will he the author of this fatal combat forsake the soldiers whom he led to slaughter return discomfited and saved by flight to bear reproach and blush in aquileia he will not holy flamen nor will paulus calm as he is and master of himself my generous paulus will not leave his brother alas i never shall behold them more this is the evil that the gods foretold ye constant matrons of romes former days alas i have no fortitude like yours mine were no public cares in the mild shade of sweet domestic happiness i lived till this fierce tempest rose the storm of war whose rage has burst on the aemilian race  priest lady retire i to the walls will go and learn what has befallen remember thou how often in human life the great conclusion of feared and wished events mocks all conjecture exeunt end of the first act act ii scene i enter priest priest too soon thy omens are accomplished jove o wretched parents o devoted race enter lucius lucius cornelia comes impatient of thy stay  priest how shall my tongue perform a faithful office and tell cornelia what my eyes beheld her sons i saw surrounded by the foe and their small troops seemed like a bank of fand which by the flowing tide encompassed round each moment wastes and lessens to the view their wretched father saw and could not save them for full opposed to him the tyrant stood with half his host embattled thrice aemilius came to the front of his remaining troops as if he meant to rush upon the foe and thrice the consul pulled the father back then looking down and leaning on his sword the tears fast trickling down the warriors cheeks he paused a while and turned him to the city  enter cornelia cornelia thou bringst no comfort terror and dismay are written on thy brow haste tell me flamen  priest behold a soldier bleeding from the field enter gartha wounded cornelia it is the numidian chief  gartha lady these wounds which bleed to death make gartha not ashamed that he alone revisits aquileia involuntary messenger am i of tidings harsh to tell my fiery steed galled with an arrow bore me from the plain where still your valiant sons maintain the fight and with amazing actions fate suspend the boldest soldiers of the tyrants host shrink from their rage lady i speak with pain this to the consul i advised the sally and fell into the ambush i rejoice that i shall not survive it  priest help he faints  gartha ch would i had fallen at the feet of titus enter attendants priest support and bear him hence  cornelia o generous gartha too dearly have thou proved thy constant faith exit gartha supported no more i hear the shouts of distant war it is horrid silence all the work of death is over doubt and fear are at an end now certain anguish and despair prevail enter aemilius attended my husband  aemilius oh cornelia wretched dame look not to me i bring no consolation i cannot comfort thee i could not save my children from destruction rigid duty made me spectator of their overthrow o fatal ensigns of unhappy power o had aemilius been a poor centurion he might unheeded have forsook his station and perished with his children  cornelia they are dead paulus and titus dead their mother lives ye all directing gods whom we adore whom i with spotless hands have ever served is misery like this my just reward your dearest gifts are to destruction turned had i not been the fond the happy mother of sons for whom all mothers envied me i had not been above all women wretched  priest great are thy woes cornelia great indeed yet not unfrequent in this changeful world are woes like thine and greater still than thine the famous matron of thy name and blood the first cornelia saw her godlike sons in rome betrayed and slain by roman hands and often in every age have wretched mothers survived their families their countrys ruin and lived sad captives in a foreign land no kindred ear to hear no eye to weep in pity of their woes no human face for them to look on but the hateful face of foes who made them childless widows slaves to thee remain thy husband and thy country in whose defense thy sons so greatly died thee rome shall honor and revere in thee the sacred memory of her heroes slain  aemilius it is the right the birthright of our house for rome to die in every signal strife in every struggling period of the state my sires have bled my sons have chose their time bravely they fought and nobly were they slain rome still shall stand though the aemilii fall the tyrants works are levelled with the ground and his proud tower yet smokes upon the plain our ramparts now his fierce assaults desy the roman army like a gathered storm rolls toward him my sons shall be revenged my eyes shall see my sword shall share the vengeance  cornelia mean while unburied on the bloody field amidst the common heap my children lie majestic paulus and my lovely titus is this the end of all your mothers care some fierce barbarian now insults the dead adding dishonest wounds o might not gold their dear remains redeem alas alas it is the sole consolation i can hope for to save them from the beasts and birds of prey that howl and scream around these fatal walls to fold once more their bodies in my arms to lay them decent on the funeral pile and over their ashes pour a parents heart  aemilius mindful of that sad duty i sent forth a herald to the tyrant and expect each moment his return the trumpet sounds enter herald with an officer of maximins it is he and with him one whose lofty port and splendid arms bespeak his high command  cornelia forgive o chief unknown a mothers grief which shortning the respect thy presence claims hastes to enquire if maximin will give the bodies of her children to the tomb  officer far be its dismal honors from your offspring lady your valiant sons survive the field  cornelia are they not dead were not the aemilii slain on yonder field their father saw them fall  officer faint with long fighting and encompast round oppressed with numbers and borne down they fell not slain nor greatly wounded captives now in their behalf from maximin i come  cornelia o sire of gods and men eternal jove for ever praised be thy protecting arm  officer upon their father now depends their fate it is his to grant what maximin requires  cornelia let his demands be boundless as the wish of avarice itself they shall be granted treasures there are from age to age preserved the acquisition of our frugal sires well are the treasures of our house bestowed if they redeem their lives who should possess them  officer it is not gold that maximin requires to thee aemilius i address my words imperial maximin lord of mankind charges the senate and the roman people with breach of vows and unprovoked rebellion but chiefly thee who first withstood thy sovereign and stopped the progress of his just revenge the righteous gods he says to thee averse have made thy sons the captives of his arms them he has doomed to death and will this day the sentence execute unless their father before the sun shall set give up the city  cornelia relentless tyrant o allseeing gods how dire a prospect opens to cornelia  aemilius i stand now not in equal lists with maximin nor mean i here to plead the cause of rome twould but offend thine ear yet tell thy lord he knows aemilius not and therefore wrongs him by this unworthy trial of his faith unhappy most unhappy he may make me but he and fortune cannot make me base  officer is this the answer i must bear to maximin  aemilius what other answer could he hope from me  officer think of the consequence of this defiance  aemilius i will meet it when it comes now i must think of trust reposed in me by injured rome  officer stout are thy words but will this pride of spirit sustain thee through the horrors that surround thee thy lips have now pronounced thy childrens doom which executed as it soon must be will move the sternest soldier of our camp to tender pity never yet were seen so brave a pair as thy unhappy sons nature on them has poured out all her gifts and dressed their virtue in the fairest form  cornelia o thou whose tongue in roman accents speaks whose gentle aspect shows a mind humane take pity on the most unhappy parents that ever bore the name this fatal day has proved too well the worth of these my sons whom nature though they less deserved would love o soften to the tyrant this refusal  i know not what to say i have no right but that which signal misery confers to beg from thee assistance if thou have at home an anxious mother or sad spouse who daily trembles for thy noble life think of her state and listen to cornelia whose tongue till now did never plead for favor  aemilius o generous stranger our misfortunes touch thy manly mind  officer no stranger i behold a roman and a friend this helmet off perhaps cornelia may remember varus  cornelia varus my friend companion of my youth o heavy change of times on other terms in rome delightful rome we wont to meet  varus most true cornelia  cornelia and is varus come to aid the tyrants arms against his country come the fierce herald of his kinsmens doom  varus with the same heart the same unaltered mind to all that ever he loved is varus come  aemilius permit me gallant varus still to claim thy friendship though i stand the tyrants foe  varus aemilius fortune rules the lives of men had i been consul and possessed in rome of civil dignity perhaps like thee i should have armed me in the senates cause whilst thou a soldier on the distant frontier perhaps like me had fought thy leaders quarrel the armies of the north acknowledge maximin i lead the british legions to the war but more of this hereafter thou have heard my horrid message and have made such answer as well becomes a roman and a consul  aemilius barbarian as he is  forgive me varus he cannot mean this threatening to fulfill  varus o trust not the humanity of maximin if he is not cruel why art thou in arms besides his temper ever fierce and savage is now incensed enraged almost to madness by the wide wasing havoc of this day his works are levelled his best legions thind his nephew algar slain by titus hand in the first transport of his furious wrath he did devote to the infernal gods and algars shade the prisoners of the field an old ligurian captain of his guards stepped in and interposed this crafty counsel  your answer i will bear but give it colors that may denote the dawning of submission and so retard  enter an officer officer an herald from the camp requires the tribune forthwith to return impatient maximin stands on the plain known by his purple and gigantick stature  cornelia dreadful impatience most inhuman rage by the dear sympathy of roman blood which in our veins from the same fountain flows let me entreat thee varus to appease the angry tyrant represent aemilius disposed to yield all that his honor can and if stern maximin prefers revenge to proferd gold yet try if wealth can win his friends and favorites to be more gentle  varus he has no friends nor favorites from fear his soldiers serve his officers obey i must be gone for maximin brooks not his orders slighted trust my zeal cornelia had i but equal power your sons were free consul  aemilius let me conduct thee to the gate and tell thee as we go what yet remains untold of our condition exeunt aemilius and varus cornelia interpreter of heavens mysterious will angur revered how will the evening close of this distressful day haste to repeat the sacred rites and prove thy art divine  priest such is my purpose soon as phoebus bows from his meridian height lady my mind has pondered maximins abhorred demand one only course there is to end the strife the dreadful strife of nature and of duty in great aemilius mind and reconcile the childrens safety with the fathers honor  cornelia it is that i wish for but of that despair  priest the roman host by gordianus led in three days hence reach aquileias walls their near approach to maximin unknown therefore the consul without breach of honor without injustice to the roman state may stipulate with maximin to yield the city on the fourth returning day if not relieved ever that the chance of war raises the siege or makes resistance vain  cornelia wise are thy words and now the dawn of hope breaks on my darksome mind believe me priest the loss of my dear sons in battle slain as once i thought them was less terrible than the dire apprehension of that death to which the tyrant dooms them worse to me and worse far worse to them alas my sons uncertain is your fate who can foretell the savage motions of the tyrants will and yet this counsel seems the only means of preservation minister of heaven let us retire and at the altar bow of jove eternal who thy heart inspired exeunt end of the second act act iii scene i enter aemilius and from the other side of the stage lucius lucius to every post and station round the wall your orders have been borne and each commander with zeal obeyed  aemilius the soldiers countenance how seems it lucius  lucius determined to the death strong indignation at their leaders fate with grief and pity over their visage gleams but every passion settles to revenge  aemilius lucius it is well see that my steed be led accoutrd to the gate i know not lucius how soon i may bestride him exit lucius aemilius alone this distress grows heavier every hour like a green wound at first i felt it not it rankles now would i had listened to the urgent voice of nature when she called me to the field who could have blamed the passions of a father if rome had blamed me in the silent tomb her voice had not been heard  enter cornelia cornelia why tarries varus  aemilius he will return cornelia doubt not that the tyrant knows the snare in which we are caught and to the uttermost will prove our souls before he breaks it  cornelia by the gods inspired the priest has found the means to set us free if you consent  aemilius if i consent alas that doubt implies suspicion of the means  cornelia hear me and judge capitulate with maximin in three days hence to yield up aquileia if not relieved before that time expires the arms of rome victorious raise the siege or if defeated make resistance vain bend not thine eye aemilius on the ground the strictest law of duty is fulfilled if thou rejectst this counsel i will say not maximin the tyrant slew my children but their own cruel father  aemilius oh forbear my soul is racked my heart asunder torn the eyes of all the world on me are fixed rome and mankind from me expect their fate i must consider this applauded counsel ere i embrace  cornelia this city is not rome nor your small garrison the roman host a part a little part a very grain of public interest in your mind outweighs your children all your children oh aemilius alike the father and the mother bear the name of parent but a parents love lives only in the tender mothers heart  aemilius first let us learn what answer varus brings enter varus he comes and various passions dim his face  cornelia o varus varus  varus oh too just thy fears of my loved kinsmen unrevokd the doom varus has kneeled in vain hard as the rocks of wild dalmatia is the tyrants heart incensed at the refusal which i bore his fury rages like a fire confined and threatens every quarter hear aemilius and tremble now for rome as for thy children  aemilius for rome  varus the tyrant lend me patience heaven to speak with calmness i who serve him still this day has vowed to raze imperial rome  aemilius barbarian why  varus to fix his wavering host to glut his legions with the mighty spoil disease and famine prey upon his troops and rumor cries that a relief is near the soldiers faint and murmur at the length and havoc of this siege the crafty tyrant with sound of trumpet through the camp proclaimed that he will give the city to be sacked raze her proud walls and change the seat of empire the glad barbarians shouted to the skies and mixed with their applause unheard of oaths to die with maximin  aemilius what said the romans  varus in number few but scattered through the bands they grieved and carefully suppressed their sorrow  aemilius was there no roman near enough to plant a dagger in the heart of maximin  varus before the tyrant reach the walls of rome that roman may be found  aemilius above the name of godlike scaevola his fame shall rise  varus the righteous gods whom maximin contemns have in their vengeance urged his frantic mind by this decree to work his own perdition long honored rome though thou have lost so much of thy primaeval splendour still my heart thy image worships still for thee i fought and from siluria to the savage shore of caledonia i thy trophies reared and shall thy soldier draw his sword against thee or stand a tame spectator of thy fall no i am thine devoted as of old thy darling sons when first thy glory rose nor shall thy turrets bow imperial rome till low in dust the head of varus lies  aemilius there spoke a roman  cornelia i rejoice to hear the voice of varus thus declare for rome her distant danger may thy arm avert but who defends my sons whose sudden fate this day decides  varus o were it possible to gain a short delay time presses me for strong in troops and terrible is maximin nor am i yet prepared to rise in arms in a few days  nay if the roman host were near at hand   cornelia my husband speak  aemilius o varus the fates are merciful peruse these lines  varus in three days hence then tyrant i shall meet thee but what can sheath this day the naked sword  aemilius a truce i will offer bind myself by vow nor is the practice new or strange in war within a certain time to yield the city if not relieved the time this scroll directs the fourth revolving day  varus i see their aim ere that the blow is struck by gordianus ere that shall varus spread his roman eagle and chase the raven of dalmatia home  aemilius thou think the tyrant will accept those terms  varus i hold it certain he can wish no more unknown to him the approach of gordianus by mars the father of the roman race whose spear omnipotent in battle rules my life shall stand betwixt your sons and death  cornelia o best of friends this is the work of heaven whose awful purposes unconscious man promotes and fondly thinks he serves his own thus from remotest britains frozen shore the tyrant to his aid the warrior calls who comes a weapon in the hand of jove to smite the proud usurper and preserve my children  aemilius yea his country and mankind  varus may the event these pleasing hopes fulfill i that have been a soldier from my youth and fought out many a hard unequal conflict with tribes and nations who no mercy know yet never felt my bosom thus alarmed  aemilius for us for rome thy roman mind is moved  varus in a new path i tread i that never used dissimulation must a while dissemble soon may the hour of nobler action come when in the front of my brave troops i stand and dare the hateful tyrant with my sword my heart shall beat no more my friends farewell  cornelia the gods protect thee varus  varus consul it is meet you hold your troops prepared and from the walls each motion watch that rises in our camp  aemilius my vigilance shall equal the occasion exit varus it is as thou said indeed the hand of heaven ye powers supreme who guide the line of fate whose winding course eludes the sense of man who could have thought that from our deep distress my sons captivity and threatened death should spring the ruin of insulting maximin  cornelia him who contemns the gods the gods will punish now or hereafter to the altar i of jove will hasten and his power implore here lucius comes enter lucius aemilius what tidings  lucius good my lord far on the distant heights that close the vale the watchmen have descried a welcome sight eagles and standards glittering in the sun squadrons of horse that move along the hill your faithful soldiers in loud shouts rejoice and hail the van of gordianus host  aemilius too soon great gods they come  lucius too soon my lord that cannot be in a most happy hour relief approaches for in every street the afflicted citizens exclaim against you and as they pass upbraid the patient soldier for tame submission to your rigid will which even your childrens danger cannot bend  aemilius would to the gods their murmurs and reproaches were all i had to bear enter a herald and an officer from maximin now bursts the storm  cornelia this is not varus sternly he comes on this is the dreadful harbinger of death  officer consul i come from maximin that prince whose wrath is terrible now burns with wrath at thee and sends me to denounce his vengeance he has discovered thy unworthy arts the fraudulent proposal of a truce when thou did know the rebel host drew near hither i come to cut all treaties short and to pronounce thy sons immediate death unless without delay thou yieldst this city thyself thy legions freely to his mercy  aemilius a cruel message harshly thou deliverst the dreadful echo of thy threatening lord he grows in his demands  officer it is fit he should when basely dealt with treachery still finds its due reward from him  aemilius ha who art thou who dare presume thus to address the consul  officer i am the slave of maximin if thou have any other name it is a worse one rebel proud roman  aemilius you are protected slave thy character is sacred else  barbarian return to maximin the terms i sent by varus i adhere to and expect another answer by a gentler herald  cornelia thou art no roman will thou deign to tell thy name and country  officer dumnorix my name my country gaul  cornelia and of ligurian race chief of the band pretorian art thou not  officer i am and faithful to the prince i serve  cornelia faithful to evil false to all that is good to nature and humanity a traitor contriver of the murder of my children my soul by strong antipathy divined thee and shudderd at thee as her evil genius  aemilius cornelia beware thou wrongst thyself thus to expose to him thy wounded heart  officer varus your countryman has told you lady what counsel i suggested to my prince this i expected from a roman messenger whose treachery his master soon shall know he told you true from me the counsel came i thought the dames of rome had loved their children exit dumnorix cornelia oh my husband what remedy what hope  aemilius in varus still i trust the troops of rome are near at hand that insolent ligurian has chafed me to the height o awful rome where are thy honors queen of all the earth how art thou fallen when a vile slave like this insults thy consul and decrees the doom of thy patrician race if this must be it is time to die we all have lived too long  cornelia i felt the insult but my feeble anger blazed for a moment only other passions soon quenched my indignation o my children enter an officer officer to arms my lord the enemy

knows how dear to my afflicted heart thou and the pledges of our virtuous love have ever been more dear than ever now but if their danger and thy fears should bend my yielding mind to baseness and to shame remorse would break the concord of our love and hate succeed to criminal affection  cornelia me only hate acquit thy noble sons too like thyself aemilius had thou seen thy sons as i beheld them from the ramparts with head erect and high my paulus stood i knew his stature eminent unmoved and steadfast was his gesture firm he seemed like a strong castle on its rocky base the port of titus showed a mind less calm around he looked and from his scornful eyes threw on his foes defiance and disdain at last in earnest speech the brothers joined i saw them whisper paulus bowed his head the multitude long silent at my presence lamented then the weeping mothers clasped their infants to their breasts and looked at me i left the walls to find thee out my husband and lead thee thither that thou might relent  aemilius relent cornelia o eternal powers that see the anguish of my tortured soul sustain me still let not my duty yield to the strong yearning of a fathers heart  cornelia why speaks not varus has he too conspired against me and my children  varus i have spoke and told the consul that his sons may live and roman arms over maximin prevail  cornelia what would thou more

in battle slain shortsighted mortals let no man repine when fate bereaves him of the child he loves amidst his anguish let him think of mine and that will comfort him  cornelia this is not well nor like my son yet valor cannot change its quality so quickly he has proved his dauntless courage death in terror clad could not dismay him but his noble mind is swayed by pity of his brothers fate in his involved enter titus aemilius gods unabashd he seems nor at his most inglorious purpose blushes aemilius turns from him cornelia dear to thy mother still  titus to his father turn not away nor hold thy titus of one look unworthy  aemilius art thou my titus thou that fear to die and comes a servile suppliant for life with coward prayers to seduce the consul no thou art not my son i had a son

counselor of shame the cause of honor of my fathers honor the cause of rome against myself i plead and in my voice the noble paulus speaks let no man pity us aloft we stand on a high theater objects i

ebbing resolution never returns but still falls farther from its former shore to aid my father in this trying hour did i assume a dastards vile disguise  aemilius and did i meet thee with reproach and anger with scorn encounter my devoted son who came to strengthen and support his sire forgive me last of the aemilian line pure and unstained the current of our blood ends as it long hsa flowed  cornelia o varus speak tell them thou guardian angel of thy country that rome does not this sacrifice demand why should they die in vain  varus thou noble youth whose life more and more precious still

worth like thine can move my steadfast mind there is but one one only path which mortals safely tread the sacred path of rectitude and truth i follow though it leads me to the tomb forgive me noble roman over thy head perhaps this instant dire discovery hangs and thou and rome are lost and basely lost no let the consul as he ought defy the tyrants threatening and rely on heaven for me and paulus

doom from you finis
