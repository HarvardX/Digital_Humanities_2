an appeal to honor and justice though it be of his worst enemies  by daniel de foe  being a true account of his conduct in public affairs  jerem xviii    come and let us smite him with the tongue and let us not give heed to any of his words london printed for j baker at the black boy in paternoster row       an appeal to honor and justice etc i hope the time is come at last when the voice of moderate principles may be heard hitherto the noise has been so great and the prejudices and passions of men so strong that it had been but in vain to offer at any argument or for any man to talk of giving a reason for his actions and this alone has been the cause why when other men who i think have less to say in their own defense are appealing to the public and struggling to defend themselves i alone have been silent under the infinite clamours and reproaches causeless curses unusual threatenings and the most unjust and injurious treatment in the world  i hear much of peoples calling out to punish the guilty but very few are concerned to clear the innocent i hope some will be inclined to judge impartially and have yet reserved so much of the christian as to believe and at least to hope that a rational creature cannot abandon himself so as to act without some reason and are willing not only to have me defend my self but to be able to answer for me where they hear me causlesly insulted by others and therefore are willing to have such just arguments put into their mouths as the cause will bear  as for those who are prepossessed and acding to the modern justice of parties are  to be so let them go i am not  them but against them they act so  to justice to reason to religion  to the rules of christians and of  manners that they are not to be argued  but to be exposed or entirely neglected  a receipt against all the uneasiness which it may be supposed to give me and that is to contemn slander and think it not worth the least concern neither should i think it worth while to give any answer to  if it were not on some other accounts of which i shall speak as i go on  if any  ask me why i am in such have to publish this matter at this time among man other good reasons which i could give these are some   i think i have long enough been made fabula vulgi and born the weight of general slander and i should be wanting to truth to my family and to my self if i did not give a fair and true state of my conduct for impartial men to judge of when i am no more in being to answer for my self   by the hints of mortality and by the infirmities of a life of sorrow and fatigue i have reason to think that i am not a great way off from if not very near to the great ocean of eternity and the time may not be long ere i embark on the last voyage wherefore i think i should even accounts with this world before i go that no actions slanders may lie against my heirs executors administrators and assigns to disturb them in the peaceable possession of their fathers character inheritance   i fear god grant i have not a second sight in it that this lucid interval of temper and moderation which shines though dimly too upon us at this time will be but of short continuance and that some men who know not how to use the advantage god has put into their hands with moderation will psh in spite of the best prince in the world at such extravagant things and act with such an intemperate forwardness as will revive the heats and animosities which wise and good men were in hopes should be allayed by the happy accession of the king to the throne   it is and ever was my opinion that moderation is the only virtue by which the peace and tranquillity of this nation can be preserved even the king himself i believe his majesty will allow me that freedom can only be happy in the enjoyment of the crown by a moderate administration if his majesty should be obliged contrary to his known disposition to join with intemperate councils if it does not lessen his security i am persuaded it will lessen his satisfaction it cannot be pleasant or agreeable and i think it cannot be safe to any just prince to rule over a divided people split into incensed and exasperated parties though a skilful mariner may have courage to master a tempest and goes fearless through a storm yet he can never be said to delight in the danger a fresh fair gale and a quiet sea is the pleasure of his voyage and we have a saying worth notice to them that are otherwise minded qui amat periculum periibat in illo  to attain at the happy calm which as i say is the safety of britain is the question which should now move us all and he would merit to be called the nations physician that could prescribe the specific for it i think i may be allowed to say a conquest of parties will never do it a balance of parties may some are for the former they talk high of punishments letting blood revenging the treatment they have met with and the like if they not knowing what spirit they are of think this the course to be taken let them try their hands i shall give them for lost and look for their downfall from that time for the ruin of all such tempers slumbereth not  it is many years that i have professed my self an enemy to all precipitations in public administrations and often i have attempted to show that hot councils have ever been distructive to those who have made use of them indeed they have not always been a disadvantage to the nation as in king james iis reign where as i have often said in print his precipitation was the safety of us all and if he had proceeded temperately and politickly we had been undone faelix quem faciunt  but these things have been spoken when your ferment has been too high for any thing to be heard whether you will hear it now or not i know not and therefore it was that i said i fear the present cessation of partyarms will not hold long  these are some of the reasons why i think this is the proper juncture for me to give some account of my self and of my past conduct to the world and that i may do this as effectually as i can being perhaps never more to speak from the press i shall as concisely as i can give an abridgment of my own history during the few unhappy years i have employed my self or been employed in public in the world  misfortunes in business having unhinged me from matters of trade it was about the year      when i was invited by some merchants with whom i had corresponded abroad and some also at home to settle at cadiz in spain and that with offers of very good commissions but providence which had other work for me to do placed a secret aversion in my mind to quitting england upon any account and made me refuse the best offers of that kind to be concerned with some eminent persons at home in proposing ways and means to the government for raising money to supply the occasions of the war then newly begun some time after this i was without the least application of mine and being then seventy miles from london sent for to be accomptant to the commissioners of the glass duty in which service i continued to the determination of their commission  during this time there came out a vile abhorred pamphlet in very ill verse written by one mr tutchin and called the foreigners in which the author who he was i then knew not fell personally upon the king himself and then upon the dutch nation and after having reproached his majesty with crimes that his worst enemy could not think of without horror he sums up all in the odious name of foreigner  this filled me with a kind of rage against the book and gave birth to a trifle which i never could hope should have met with so general an acceptance as it did i mean the truebornenglishman how this poem was the occasion of my being known to his majesty how i was afterward received by him how employed and how above my capacity of deserving rewarded is no part of the present case and is only mentioned here as i take all occasions to do for the expressing the honor i ever preserved for the immortal and glorious memory of that greatest and best of princes and who it was my honor and advantage to call master as well as sovereign whose goodness to me i never forgot neither can forget and whose memory i never patiently heard abused nor ever can do so and who had he lived would never have suffered me to be treated as i have been in the world  but heaven for our sins removed him in judgment how far the treatment he met with from the nation he came to save and whose deliverance he finished was admitted by heaven to be a means of his death i desire to forget for their sakes who are guilty and if this calls any of it to mind it is mentioned to move them to treat him better who is now with like principles of goodness and clemency appointed by god and the constitution to be their sovereign least he that protects righteous princes avenges the injuries they receive from an ungrateful people by giving them up to the confusions their madness leads them to  and in their just acclamations at the happy accession of his present majesty to the throne i cannot but advise them to look back and call to mind who it was that first guided them to the family of hanover and to pass by all the popish branches of orleans and savoy recognizing the just authority of parliament in the undoubted right of limiting the succession and establishing that glorious maxim of our settlement viz that it is inconsistent with the constitution of this protestant kingdom to be governed by a popish prince i say let them cell to mind who it was that guided their thoughts first to the protestant race of our own kings in the house of hanover and that it is to king william next to heaven it self to whom we owe the enjoying a protestant king at this time i need not go back to the particulars of his majestys conduct in that affair his journey in person to the country of hanover and the court of zell his particular management of the affair afterward at home perfecting the design by naming the illustrious family to the nation and bringing about a parliamentary settlement to effect it entailing thereby the crown in so effectual a manner as we see has been sufficient to prevent the worst designs of our jacobite people in behalf of the pretender a settlement together with the subsequent acts which followed it and the union with scotland which made it unalterable that gave a complete satisfaction to those who knew and understood it and removed those terrible apprehensions of the pretender which some entertained from the minds of others who were yet as zealous against him as it was possible for any to be upon this settlement as i shall show presently i grounded my opinion which i often expressed viz that i did not see it possible the jacobites could ever set up their idol here and i think my opinion abundantly justified in the consequences of which by and by  this digression as a debt to the glorious memory of king william i could not in justice omit and as the reign of his present majesty is esteemed happy and looked upon as a blessing from heaven by us it will most necessarily lead us to bless the memory of king william to whom we owe so much of it how easily could his majesty have led us to other branches whose relation to the crown might have had large pretenses what prince but would have submitted to have educated a successor of their race in the protestant religion for the sake of such a crown  but the king who had our happiness in view and saw as far into it as any humane sight could penetrate who knew we were not to be governed by unexperienced youths that the protestant religion was not to be established by political converts and that princes under french influence or instructed in french politics were not proper instruments to preserve the liberties of britain fixed his eyes upon the family who now possesses the crown as not only having an undoubted relation to it by blood but as being first and principally zealous and powerful assertors of the protestant religion and interest against popery and secondly stored with a visible succession of worthy and promising branches who appeared equal to the weight of government quallified to fill a throne and guide a nation which without reflection are not famed to be the most easy to rule in the world  whether the consequence has been a credit to king williams judgment i need not say i am not writing panegyricks here but doing justice to the memory of the king my master who i have had the honor very often to hear express himself with great satisfaction in having brought the settlement of the succession to so good an issue and to repeat his majestys own words that he knew no prince in europe so fit to be king of england as the elector of hanover i am persuaded without any flattery that if it should not every way answer the expectations his majesty had of it the fault will be our own god grant the king may have more comfort of his crown than we suffered king william to have  the king being dead and the queen proclaimed the hot men of that side as hot men of all sides do thinking the game in their own hands and all other people under their feet began to run out into those mad extremes and precipitate themselves into such measures as according to the fate of all intemperate councils ended in their own confusions and threw them at last out of the saddle  the queen who though willing to favor the high church party did not thereby design the ruin of those who she did not employ was soon alarmed at their wild conduct and turned them out adhering to the moderate councils of those who better understood or more faithfully pursued her majestys and their countries interest  in this turn fell sir edw seymours party for so the high men were then called and to this turn we owe the converson of several other great men who became whigs upon that occasion which it is known they were not before which conversion afterward began that unkind distinction of old whig and modern whig which some of the former were with very little justice pleased to run up afterward to an extreme very pernicious to both  but i am gone too far in this part i return to my own story in the interval of these things and during the heat of the first fury of highslying i fell a sacrifice for writing against the rage and madness of that high party and in the service of the dissenters what justice i met with and above all what mercy is too well known to need a repetition  this introduction is made that it may bring me to what has been the foundation of all my further concern in public affairs and will produce a sufficient reason for my adhering to those whose obligations upon me were too strong to be resisted even when many things were done by them which i could not approve and for this reason it is that i think it is necessary to distinguish how far i did or did not adhere to or join in or with the persons or conduct of the late government and those who are willing to judge with impartiality and charity will see reason to use me the more tenderly in their thoughts when they weigh the particulars  i will make no reflections upon the treatment i met with from the people i suffered for or how i was abandoned even in my sufferings at the same time that they acknowledged the service it had been to their cause but i must mention it to let you know that while i lay friendless and distressed in the prison of newgate my family ruined and my self without hope of deliverance a message was brought me from a person of honor who till that time i had never had the least acquaintance with or knowledge of other than by fame or by sight as we know men of quality by seeing them on public occasions i gave no present answer to the person who brought it having not duly weighed the import of the message the message was by word of month thus pray ask that gentleman what i can do for him but in return to this kind and generous message i immediately took my pen and ink and writ the story of the blind man in the gospel who followed our savior and to whom our blessed lord put the question what will thou that i should do unto thee who as if he had made it strange that such a question should be asked or as if he had said lord do thou see that i am blind and yet ask me what thou shall do for me my answer is plain in my misery lord that i may receive my sight  i needed not to make the application and from this time although i lay four months in prison after this and heard no more of it yet from this time as i learned afterward this noble person made it his business to have my case represented to her majesty and methods taken for my deliverance  i mention this part because i am no more to forget the obligation upon me to the queen than to my first benefactor  when her majesty came to have the truth of the case laid before her i soon felt the effects of her royal goodness and compassion and first her majesty declared that she left all that matter to a certain person and did not think he would have used me in such a manner perhaps these words may seem imaginary to some and the speaking them to be of no value and so they would have been if they had not been followed with farther and more convincing proofs of what they imported which were these that her majesty was pleased particularly to enquire into my circumstances and family and by my lord treasurer godolphin to send a considerable supply to my wife and family and to send me to the prison money to pay my fine and the expenses of my discharge whether this be a just foundation let my enemies judge  here is the foundation on which i built my first sense of duty to her majestys person and the indelible bond of gratitude to my first benefactor  gratitude and fidelity are inseparable from an honest man but to be thus obliged by a stranger by a man of quality and honor and after that by the sovereign under whose administration i was suffering let any one put himself in my stead and examine upon what principles i could ever act against either such a queen or such a benefactor and what must my own heart reproach me with what blushes must have covered my face when i had looked in and called myself ungrateful to him that saved me thus from distress or her that fetched me out of the dungeon and gave my family relief let any man who knows what principles are what engagements of honor and gratitude are make this case his own and say what i could have done less or more than i have done  i must go on a little with the detail of the obligation and then i shall descend to relate what i have done and what i have not done in the case  being delivered from the distress i was in her majesty who was not satisfied to do me good by a single act of her bounty had the goodness to think of taking me into her service and i had the honor to be employed in several honorable though secret services by the interposition of my first benefactor who then appeared as a member in the public administration  i had the happiness to discharge my self in all these trusts so much to the satisfaction of those who employed me though often times with difficulty and danger that my lord treasurer godolphin whose memory i have always honored was pleased to continue his favor to me and to do me all good offices with her majesty even after an unhappy breach had separated him from my first benefactor the particulars of which may not be improper to relate and as it is not an injustice to any so i hope it will not be offensive  when upon that fatal breach the secretary of state was dismissed from the service i looked upon my self as lost it being a general rule in such cases when a great officer falls that all who came in by his interest fall with him and resolving never to abandon the fortunes of the man to whom i owed so much of my own i quitted the usual applications which i had made to my lord treasurer  but my generous benefactor when he understood it frankly told me that i should by no means do so for said he in the most engaging terms my lord treasurer will employ you in nothing but what is for the public service and agreeable to your own sentiments of things and besides it is the queen you are serving who has been very good to you pray apply your self as you used to do i shall not take it ill from you in the least  upon this i went to wait on my lord treasurer who received me with great freedom and told me smiling he had not seen me along while i told his lordship very frankly the occasion that the unhappy breach that had fallen out had made me doubtful whether i should be acceptable to his lordship that i knew it was usual when great persons fall that all who were in their interest fell with them that his lordship knew the obligations i was under and that i could not but fear my interest in his lordship was lessened on that account not at all mr de foe replied his lordship i always think a man honest till i find to the contrary  upon this i attended his lordship as usual and being resolved to remove all possible ground of suspicion that i kept any secret correspondence i never visited or wrote to or any way corresponded with my principal benefactor for above three years which he so well knew the reason of and so well approved that punctual behavior in me that he never took it ill from me at all  in consequence of this reception my lord godolphin had the goodness not only to introduce me for the second time to her majesty and to the honor of kissing her hand but obtained for me the continuance of an appointment which her majesty had been pleased to make me in consideration of a former special service i had done and in which i had run as much risque of my life as a grenadier upon the counterscarp and which appointment however was first obtained for me at the intercession of my said first benefactor and is all owing to that intercession and her majestys bounty upon this second introduction her majesty was pleased to tell me with a goodness peculiar to her self that she had such satisfaction in my former services that she had appointed me for another affair which was something nice and that my lord treasurer should tell me the rest and so i withdrew  the next day his lordship having commanded me to attend told me that he must send me to scotland and gave me but three days to prepare my self accordingly i went to scotland where neither my business nor the manner of my discharging it is material to this tract nor will it be ever any part of my character that i reveal what should be concealed and yet my errand was such as was far from being unfit for a sovereign to direct or an honest man to perform and the service i did on that occasion as it is not unknown to the greatest man now in the nation under the king and the prince so i dare say his grace was never displeased with the part i had in it and i hope will not forget it  these things i mention upon this account and no other viz to state the obligation i have been in all along to her majesty personally and to my first benefactor principally by which i say i think i was at least obliged not to act against them even in those things which i might not approve whether i have acted with them farther than i ought shall be spoken to by it self  having said thus much of the obligations laid on me and the persons by whom i have this only to add that i think no man will say a subject could be under greater bonds to his prince or a private person to a minister of state and i shall ever preserve this principle that an honest man cannot be ungrateful to his benefactor  but let no man run away now with the notion that i am now intending to plead the obligation that was upon me from her majesty or from any other person to justify my doing any thing that is not otherwise to be justified in it self  nothing would be more injurious than such a construction and therefore i capitulate for so much justice as to explain my self by this declaration viz that i only speak of these obligations as binding me to a negative conduct not to fly in the face of or concern my self in disputes with those to whom i was under such obligations although i might not in my judgment join in many things that were done no obligation could excuse me in calling evil good or good evil but i am of the opinion that i might justly think my self obliged to defend what i thought was to be defended and to be silent in any thing which i might think was not  if this is a crime i must plead guilty and give in the history of my obligation abovementioned as an extenuation at least if not a justification of my conduct suppose a mans father was guilty of several things unlawful and unjustifiable a man may heartily detest the unjustifiable thing and yet it ought not to be expected that he should expose his father i think the case on my side exactly the same nor can the duty to a parent be more strongly obliging than the obligation laid on me but i must allow the case on the other side not the same  and this brings me to the affirmative and to enquire what the matters of fact are what i have done or have not done on account of these obligations which i have been under  it is a general suggestion and is affirmed with such assurance that they tell me it is in vain to contradict it that i have been employed by the earl of od late lord treasurer in the late disputes about public affairs to write for him or to put it into their own particulars have written by his direction taken the materials from him been dictated to or instructed by him or by other persons from him by his order and the like and that i have received a pension or sallery or payment from his lordship for such services as these  if i could put it into words that would more fully express the meaning of these people i profess i would do it  one would think it was impossible but that since these things have been so confidently affirmed some evidence might be produced some facts might appear some one body or other might be found that could speak of certain knowledge to say things have been carried too closely to be discovered is saying nothing for then they must own that it is not discovered and how then can they affirm it as they do with such an assurance as nothing ought to be affirmed by honest men unless they were able to prove it  to speak then to the fact were the reproach upon me only in this particular i should not mention it i should not think it a reproach to be directed by a man to whom the queen had at that time entrusted the administration of the government but as it is a reproach upon his lordship justice requires that i do right in this case the thing is true or false i would recommend it to those who would be called honest men to consider but one thing viz what if it should not be true can they justify the injury done to that person or to any person concerned if it cannot be proved if no vestiges appear to ground it upon how can they charge men upon rumors and reports and join to run mens characters down by the stream of clamor  sed quo rapit impetus undae in answer to the charge i bear witness to posterity that every part of it is false and forged and i do solemnly protest in the fear and presence of him that shall judge us all both the slanderers and the slandered that i have not received any instructions directions orders or let them call it what they will of that kind for the writing any part of what i have written or any materials for the putting together for the forming any book or pamphlet whatsoever from the said earl of od late lord treasurer or from any person by his order or direction since the time that the late earl of gin was lord treasurer neither did i ever show or cause to be showed to his lordship for his approbation correction alteration or for any other cause any book paper or pamphlet which i have written and published before the same was printed worked off at the press and published  if any man living can detect me of the least prevarication in this or in any part of it i desire him to do it by all means and i challenge all the world to do it  and if they cannot then i appeal as in my title to the honor and justice of my worst enemies to know upon what foundation of truth or conscience they can affirm these things and for what it is that i bear these reproaches  in all my writing i ever capitulated for my liberty to speak according to my own judgment of things i ever had that liberty allowed me nor was i ever imposed upon to write this way or that against my judgment by any person whatsoever  i come now historically to the point of time when my lord godolphin was dismissed from his employment and the late unhappy division broke out at court i waited on my lord the day he was displaced and humbly asked his lordships direction what course i should take his lordships answer was that he had the same good will to assist me but not the same power that i was the queens servant and that all he had done for me was by her majestys special and particular direction and that whoever should succeed him it was not material to me he supposed i should be employed in nothing relating to the present differences my business was to wait till i saw things settled and then apply my self to the ministers of state to receive her majestys commands from them  it occurred to me immediately as a principle for my conduct that it was not material to me what ministers her majesty was pleased to employ my duty was to go along with every ministry so far as they did not break in upon the constitution and the laws and liberties of my country my part being only the duty of a subject viz to submit to all lawful commands and to enter into no service which was not justifiable by the laws to all which i have exactly obliged my self  by this i was providentially cast back upon my original benefactor who according to his wonted goodness was pleased to lay my case before her majesty and thereby i preserved my interest in her majestys favor but without any engagement of service  as for consideration pension gratification or reward i declare to all the world i have had none except only that old appointment which her majesty was pleased to make me in the days of the ministry of my lord godolphin of which i have spoken already and which was for services done in a foreign country some years before neither have i been employed or directed or ordered by my lord tr aforesaid to do or not to do any thing in the affairs of the unhappy differences which have so long perplexed us and for which i have suffered so many and such unjust reproaches  i come next to enter into the matters of fact and what it is i have done or not done which may justify the treatment i have met with and first for the negative part what i have not done  the first thing in the unhappy breaches which have fallen out is helping up scandal upon the persons and conduct of men of honor on one side as well  on the other those unworthy methods of falling upon one another by personal calumny and reproach this i have often in print complained of as an unchristian ungenerous and unjustifiable practice not a word can be found in all i have written reflecting on the persons or conduct of any of the former ministry i served her majesty under their administration they acted honorably and justly in every transaction in which i had the honor to be concerned with them and i never published or said any thing dishonorable of any of them in my life nor can the worst enemy i have produce any such thing against me i always regretted the change and looked upon it as a great disaster to the nation in general i am sure it was so to me in particular and the divisions and feuds among parties which followed that change were doubtless a disaster to us all  the next thing which followed the change was the peace no man can say that ever i once said in my life that i approved of the peace i wrote a public paper at that time and there it remains upon record against me i printed it openly and that so plainly as others durst not do that i did not like the peace neither that which was made nor that which was before a making that i i thought the protestant interest was not taken care of in either that the peace i was for was such as should neither have given the spanish monarchy to the house of bourbon or the house of austria but that this bone of contention should have been broken to pieces that it should not have been dangerous to europe on any account and that the protestant powers viz britain and the states should have so strengthened and fortified their interest by their sharing the commerce and strength of spain as should have made them no more afraid either of france or the emperor so that the protestant interest should have been superior to all the powers of europe and been in no more danger of exhorbitant power whether french or austrian this was the peace i always argued for pursuant to the design of king william in the treaty of partition and pursuant to that article of the grand alliance which was directed by the same glorious hand at the beginning of this last war viz that all we should conquer in the spanishwestindies should be our own  this was with a true design that england and holland should have turned their naval power which were eminently superior to those of france to the conquest of the spanishwestindies by which the channel of trade and return of bullion which now enriches the enemies of both had been ours and as the wealth so the strength of the world had been in protestant hands spain whoever had it must then have been dependant upon us the house of bourbon would have found it so poor without us as to be scarce worth fighting for and the people so averse to them for want of their commerce as not to make it ever likely france could keep it  this was the foundation i ever acted upon with relation to the peace it is true that when it was made and could not be otherwise i thought our business was to make the best of it and rather to enquire what improvements were to be made of it than to be continually exclaiming at those who made it and where the objection lies against this part i cannot yet see  while i spoke of things in this manner i bore infinite reproaches from clamouring pens of being in the french interest being hired and bribed to defend a bad peace and the like and most of this was upon a supposition of my writing or being the author of abundance of pamphlets which came out every day and which i had no hand in and indeed as i shall observe again by and by this was one of the greatest pieces of injustice that could be done me and which i labor still under without any redress that whenever any piece comes out which is not liked i am immediately charged with being the author and very often the first knowledge i have had of a books being published has been from seeing my self abused for being the author of it in some other pamphlet published in answer to it  finding my self treated in this manner i declined writing at all and for a great part of a year never set pen to paper except in the public paper called the review after this i was long absent in the north of england and observing the insolence of the jacobite party and how they insinuated fine things into the heads of the common people of the right and claim of the pretender and of the great things he would do for us if he was to come in of his being to turn a protestant of his being resolved to maintain our liberties support our funds give liberty to dissenters and the like and finding that the people began to be deluded and that the jacobites gained ground among them by these insinuations i thought it the best service i could do the protestant interest and the best way to open the peoples eyes to the advantages of the protestant succession if i took some course effectually to alarm the people with what they really ought to expect if the pretender should come to be king and this made me set pen to paper again  and this brings me to the affirmative part or to what really i have done and in this i am sorry to say i have one of the foulest most unjust and unchristian clamours to complain of that any man has suffered i believe since the days of the tyranny of king james the second the fact is thus  in order to detect the influence of jacobite emissaries as above the first thing i wrote was a small tract called a seasonable caution  a book sincerely written to open the eyes of the poor ignorant country people and to warn them against the subtle insinuations of the emissaries of the pretender and that it might be effectual to that purpose i prevailed with several of my friends to give them away among the poor people all over england especially in the north and several thousands were actually given away the price being reduced so low that the bare expense of paper and press was only preserved that every one might be convinced that nothing of gain was designed but a sincere endeavor to do a public good and assist to keep the people entirely in the interest of the protestant succession  next to this and with the same sincere design i wrote two pamphlets one entitled what if the pretender should come the other reasons against the succession of the house of hanover nothing can be more plain than that the titles of these books were amusements in order to put the books into the hands of those people who the jacobites had deluded and to bring the books to be read by them  previous to what i shall farther say of these books i must observe that all these books met with so general a reception and approbation among those who were most sincere for the protestant succession that they sent them all over the kingdom and recommended them to the peoples reading as excellent and useful pieces insomuch that about seven editions of them were printed and they were reprinted in other places and i do protest had his present majesty then elector of hanover given me a thousand pounds to have written for the interest of his succession and to expose and render the interest of the pretender odious and ridiculous i could have done nothing more effectual to those purposes than these books were  and that i may make my worst enemies to whom this is a fair appeal judges of this i must take leave by and by to repeat some of the expressions in those books which were direct and need no explication and which i think no man that was in the interest of the pretender nay which no man but one who was entirely in the interest of the hanover succession could write  nothing can be severer in the fate of a man than to act so between two parties that both sides should be provoked against him it is certain the jacobites cursed those tracts and the author and when they came to read them being deluded by the titles according to the design they threw them by with the greatest indignation imaginable had the pretender ever come to the throne i could have expected nothing but death and all the ignominy and reproach that the most inveterate enemy of his person and claim could be supposed to suffer  on the other hand i leave it to any considering man to judge what a surprise it must be to me to meet with all the public clamor that informers could invent  being guilty of writing against the hanover succession and as having written several pamphlets in favor of the pretender  no man in this nation ever had a more rivd aversion to the pretender and to all the family he pretended to come of than i a m that had been in arms under the duke of monmouth against the cruelty and arbitrary government of his pretended father that for twenty years had to my utmost opposed him king james and his party after his abdication that had served king william to his satisfaction and the friends of the revolution after his death at all hazards and upon all occasions that had suffered and been ruined under the administration of highfiyers and jacobites of whom some are at this day covnterfeit whigs it could not be the nature of the thing could by no means allow it it must be monstrous and that the wonder may cease i shall take leave to quote some of the expressions out of these books of which the worst enemy i have in the world is left to judge whether they are in favor of the pretender or no but of this in its place  for these books i was prosecuted taken into custody and obliged to give eight hundred pound bail  i do not in the least object here against or design to reflect upon the proceedings of the judges which were subsequent to this i acknowledged then and now acknowledge again that upon the information given there was a sufficient ground for all they did and my unhappy entering upon my own vindication in print while the case was before their lordships in a judicial way was an error which i neither understood and which i did not foresee and therefore although i had great reason to reflect upon the informers yet i was wrong in making that defense in the manner and time i then made it and which when i found i made no scruple afterward to petition the judges and acknowledge that they had just ground to resent it upon which petition and acknowledgment their lordships were pleased with particular marks of goodness to release me and not take the advantage of an error of ignorance as if it had been considered and premeditated  but against the informers i think i have great reason to complain and against the injustice of those writers who in many pamphlets charged me with writing for the pretender and the government with pardoning an author who wrote for the pretender and indeed the justice of those men can be in nothing more clearly stated than in this case of mine where the charge in their printed papers and public discourse was brought not that they themselves believed me guilty of the crime but because it was necessary to blacken the man that a general reproach might serve for an answer to whatever he should say that was not for their turn so that it was the person not the crime they fell upon and they may justly be said to persecute for the sake of persecution as will thus appear  this matter making some noise people began to enquire into it and to ask what de foe was prosecuted for seeing the books were manifestly written against the pretender and for the interest of the house of hanover and my friends expostulated freely with some of the men who appeared in it who answered with more truth than honesty that they knew this book had nothing in it and that it was meant another way but that de foe had disobliged them in other things and they were resolved to take the advantage they had both to punish and expose him they were no inconsiderable people who said this and had the case come to a trial i had provided good evidence to prove the words  this is the christianity and justice by which i have been treated and this injustice is the thing that i complain of  now as this was a plot of a few men to see if they could brand me in the world for a jacobite and persuade rash and ignorant people that i was turned about for the pretender i think they might as easily have proved me to be a mohammedan therefore i say this obliges me to state that matter as it really stands that impartial men may judge whether those books were written for or against the pretender and this cannot be better done than by the account of what followed after the first information which in few words is thus  upon the several days appointed i appeared at the queens be bar to discharge my bail and at last had an indictment for high crimes and misdemeanors exhibited against me by her majestys attorney general which as i was informed contained two hundred sheets of paper  what was the substance of the indictment i shall not mention here neither could i enter upon it having never seen the particulars but i was told that i should be brought to trial the very next term  i was not ignorant that in such cases it is easy to make any book a libel and that the jury must have found the matter of fact in the indictment viz that i had written such books and then what might have followed i knew not wherefore i thought it was my only way to cast my self on the clemency of her majesty whose goodness i had had so much experience of many ways representing in my petition that i was far from the least intention to favor the interest of the pretender but that the books were all written with a sincere design to promote the interest of the house of hanover and humbly laid before her majesty as i do now before the rest of the world the books themselves to plead in my behalf representing farther that i was maliciously informed against by those who were willing to put a construction upon the expressions different from my true meaning and therefore flying to her majestys goodness and clemency i entreated her gracious pardon  it was not only the native disposition of her majesty to acts of clemency and goodness that obtained me this pardon but as i was informed her majesty was pleased to express it in the council she saw nothing but private pique in the first prosecution and therefore i think i cannot give a better and clearer vindication of my self than what is contained in the preamble to the pardon which her majesty was pleased to grant me and i must be allowed to say to those who are still willing to object that i think what satisfied her majesty might be sufficient to satisfy them and i can assure them that this pardon was not granted without her majestys being specially and particularly acquainted with the things alleged in the petition the books also being looked in to find the expressions quoted in the petition the preamble to the patent for a pardon as far as relates to the matters of fact runs thus  whereas in the term of the holy trinity last past our artorney general did exhibit an information in our court of queensbench at westminster against daniel de foe late of london gent for writing printing and publishing and causing to be written printed and published three libels the one entitled reasons against the succession of the house of hanover with an enquiry how far the abdication of king james supposing it to be legal ought to affect the person of the pretender one other entitled and what if the pretender should come or some considerations of the advantages and real consequences of the pretender s possessing the crown of great britain and one other entitled an answer to a question that nobody thinks of viz what if the queen should die  and whereas the said daniel de foe has by his humble petition represented to us that he with a sincere design to propagate the interest of the hanover succession and to animate the people against the designs of the pretender whom he always looked on as an enemy to our sacred person and government did publish the said pamphlets in all which books although the titles seemed to look as if written in favor of the pretender and several expressions as in all ironical writing it must be may be wrested against the true design of the whole and turned to a meaning quite different from the intention of the author yet the petitioner humbly assures us in the solemnest manner that his true and only design in all the said books was by an ironical discourse of recommending the pretender in the strongest and most forcible manner to expose his designs and the ruinous consequences of his succeeding therein which as the petitioner humbly represents will appear to our satisfaction by the books themselves where the following expressions are very plain viz that the pretender is recommended as a person proper to amass the english liberties into his own sovereignty supply them with the privileges of wearing wooden shoes easing them of the trouble of choosing parliaments and the nobility and gentry of the hazard and expense of winter journeys by governing them in that more righteous method of his absolute will and enforcing the laws by a glorious standing army paying all the nations debts at once by stopping the funds and shutting up the exchequer easing and quieting their differences in religion by bringing them to the union of popery or leaving them at liberty to have no religion at all that these were some of the very expressions in the said books which the petitioner sincerely designed to expose and oppose as far as in him lies the interest of the pretender and with no other intention nevertheless the petitioner to his great surprise has been misrepresented and his said books misconstrued as if written in favor of the pretender and the petitioner in now under prosecution for the same which prosecution if farther carried on will be the utter ruin of the petitioner and his family wherefore the petitioner humbly assuring us of the innocence of his design as aforesaid files to our clemency and most humbly prays our most gracious and free pardon we taking the premises and the circumstances aforesaid into our royal consideration are graciously pleased etc  let any indifferent man judge whether i was not treated with particular malice in this matter who was notwithstanding this reproached in the daily public prints with having written treasonable books in behalf of the pretender nay and in some of those books as before the queen her self was rereproachd with having granted her pardon to an author who writ for the pretender  i think i might with much more justice say i was the first man that ever was obliged to seek a pardon for writing for the hanover succession and the first man that these people ever sought to ruin for writing against the pretender for if ever a book was sincerely designed to farther and propogate the affection and zeal of the nation against the pretender nay and was made use of and that with success too for that purpose these books were so and i ask no more favor of the world to determine the opinion of honest men for or against me than what is drawn constructively from these books let one word either written or spoken by me either published or not published be produced that was in the least disrespectful to the protestant succession or to any branch of the family of hanover or that can be judged to be favorable to the interest or person of the pretender and i will be willing to wave her majestys pardon and render my self to public justice to be punished for it as i should well deserve  i freely and openly challenge the worst of my enemies to charge me with any discourse conversation or behavior in my whole life which had the least word in it injurious to the protestant succession unbecoming or disrespectful to any of the persons of the royal family of hanover or the least favorable word of the person the designs or friends of the pretender  if they can do it let them stand forth and speak no doubt but they may be heard and i for my part will relinquish all pleas pardons and defenses and cast my self into the hands of justice  nay to go farther i defy them to prove that i ever kept company or had any society friendship or conversation with any jacobite so averse have i been to the interest and to the people that i have studiously avoided their company upon all occasions  as nothing in the world has been more my aversion than the society of jacobites so nothing can be a greater misfortune to me than to be accused and publicly reproached with what is of all things in the world most abhorred by me and which has made it the more afflicting is that this charge arises from those very things which i did with the sincerest design to manifest the contrary  but such is my present fate and i am to submit to it which i do with meekness and calmness as to a judgment from heaven and am practicing that duty which i have studied long ago of forgiving my enemies and praying for them that despitefully use me  having given this brief history of the pardon etc i hope the impartial part of the world will grant me that being thus graciously delivered a second time from the cruelty of my implacable enemies and the ruin of a cruel and unjust persecution and that by the mere clemency and goodness of the queen my obligation to her majestys goodness was far from being made less than it was before  i have now run through the history of my ohligation to her majesty and to the person of my benefactor aforesaid i shall state every thing that followed this with all the clearness i can and leave my self liable to as little cavil as i may for i see my self assaulted by a sort of people who will do me no justice i hear a great noise made of punishing those that are guilty but as i said before not one word of clearing those that are innocent and i must say in this part they treat me not only as i were no christian but as if they themselves were not christians they will neither prove the charge nor hear the defense which is the unjustest thing in the world  i foresee what will be alleged to the clause of my obligation etc to great persons and i resolve to give my adversaries all the advantage they can desire by acknowledging beforehand that no obligation to the qveen or to any benefactor can justify any mans acting against the interest of his country against his principles his conscience and his former profession  i think this will anticipate all that can be said upon that head and it will then remain to state the fact as i am or am not chargeable with it which i shall do as clearly as possible in few words  it is none of my work to enter into the conduct of the queen or of the ministry in this case the question is not what they have done but what i have done and though i am very far from thinking of them as some other people think yet for the sake of the present argument i am to give them all up and suppose though not granting that all which is suggested of them by the worst temper the most censorious writer the most scandalous pamphlet or lampoon should be true and i will go through some of the particulars as i meet with them in public    st that they made a scandalous peace unjustly broke the alliance betrayed the confederates and sold us all to the french  god forbid it should be all truth in the manner that we see it in print but that i say is none of my business  but what hand had i in all this i never wrote one word for the peace before it was made or to justify it after it was made let them produce it if they can nay in a review upon that subject while it was making i printed it in plainer words than other men durst speak it at that time that i did not like the peace nor did i like any peace that was a making since that of the partition and that the protestant interest was not taken care of either in that or the treaty of gertrudinburgh before it  it is true that i did say that since the peace was made and we could not help it that it was our business and our duty to make the best of it to make the utmost advantage of it by commerce navigation and all kind of improvement that we could and this i say still and i must think it is more our duty to do so than the exclamations against the thing it self which it is not in our power to retrieve this is all that the worst enemy i have can charge me with after the peace was made and the dutch and the emperor stood out i gave my opinion of what i foresaw would necessarily be the consequence of that difference viz that it would inevitably involve these nations in a war with one or other of them any one who was master of common sense in the public affairs might see that the standing out of the dutch could have no other event for if the confederates had conquered the french they would certainly have fallen upon us by way of resentment and there was no doubt but the same councils that led us to make a peace would oblige us to maintain it by preventing too great impressions upon the french  on the other hand i alleged that should the french prevail against the dutch unless he stopped at such limitations of conquest as the treaty obliged him to do we must have been under the same necessity to renew the war against france and for this reason seeing we had made a peace we were obliged to bring the rest of the confederates into it and to bring the french to give them all such terms as they ought to be satisfied with  this way of arguing was either so little understood or so much malignd that i suffered innumerable reproaches in print for having written for a war with the dutch which was neither in the expression or ever in my imagination but i pass by these injuries as small and trifling compared to others i suffer under  however one thing i must say of the peace let it be good or ill in its self i cannot but think we have all reason to rejoice in behalf of his present majesty that at his accession to the crown he found the nation in peace and had the hands of the king of france tied up by a peace so as not to be able without the most infamous breach of articles to offer the least disturbance to his taking a quiet and leisurely possession or so much as to countenance those that would  not but that i believe if the war had been at the height we should have been able to have preserved the crown for his present majesty its only rightful lord but i will not say it should have been so easy so bloodless so undisputed as now and all the difference must be acknowledged to the peace and this is all the good i ever yet said of the peace  i come next to the general clamor of the ministry being for the pretender i must speak my sentiments solemnly and plainly as i always did in that matter viz that if it was so i did not see it nor did i ever see reason to believe it this i am sure of that if it was so i never took one step in that kind of service nor did i ever hear one word spoken by any one of the ministry that i had the honor to know or converse with that favored the pretender but have had the honor to hear them all protest that there was no design to oppose the succession of hanover in the least  it may be objected to me that they might be in the interest of the pretender for all that it is true they might but that is nothing to me i am not vindicating their conduct but my own as i never was employed in any thing that way so i do still protest i do not believe it was ever in their design and i have many reasons to confirm my thoughts in that case which are not material to the present case but be that as it will it is enough to me that i acted nothing in any such interest neither did i ever sin against the protestant succession of hanover in thought word or deed and if the ministry did i did not see it or so much as suspect them of it  it was a disaster to the ministry to be driven to the necessity of taking that set of men by the hand who no body can deny were in that interest but as the former ministry answered when they were charged with a design to overthrow the church because they favored joined with and were united to the dissenters i say they answered that they made use of the dissenters but granted them nothing which by the way was too true so these gentlemen answer that it is true they made use of jacobites but did nothing for them  but this by the by necessity is pleaded by both parties for doing things which neither side can justify i wish both sides would for ever avoid the necessity of doing evil for certainly it is the worst plea in the world and generally made use of for the worst things  i have often lamented the disaster which i saw employing jacobites was to the late ministry and certainly it gave the greatest handle to the enemies of the ministry to fix that universal reproach upon them of being in the interest of the pretender but there was no medium the whigs refused to show them a safe retreat or to give them the least opportunity to take any other measures but at the risque of their own destruction and they ventured upon that course in hopes of being able to stand alone at last without help of either the one or the other in which no doubt they were mistaken  however in this part as i was always assured and have good reason still to believe that her majesty was steady in the interest of the house of hanover and that nothing was ever offered to me or required of me to the prejudice of that interest on what ground can i be reproached with the secret reserved designs of any if they had such designs as i still verily believe they had not  i see there are some men who would fain persuade the world that every man that was in the interest of the late ministry or employed by the late government or that served the late queen was for the pretender  god forbid this should be true and i think there needs very little to be said in answer to it i can answer for my self that it is notoriously false and i think the easy and uninterrupted accession of his majesty to the crown contradicts it i see no end which such a suggestion aims at but to leave an odium upon all that had any duty or regard to her late majesty  a subject is not always master of his sovereigns measures nor always to examine what persons or parties the prince he serves employs so be it that they break not in upon the constitution that they govern according to law and that he is employed in no illegal act or have nothing desired of him inconsistent with the liberties and laws of his country if this be not right then a servant of the kings is in a worse case than a servant to any private person  in all these things i have not erred neither have i acted or done any thing in the whole course of my life either in the service of her majesty or of her ministry that any one can say has the least deviation from the strictest regard to the protestant succession and to the laws and liberties of my country  i never saw an arbitrary action offered at a law dispensed with justice denied or oppression set up either by queen or ministry in any branch of the administration wherein i had the least concern  if i have sinned against the whigs it has been all negatively viz that i have not joined in the loud exclamations against the queen and against the ministry and against the measures and if this be my crime my plea is twofold   i did not really see cause for carrying their complaints to that violent degree   where i did see what as before i lamented and was sorry for and could not join with or approve as joining with jacobites the peace etc my obligation is my plea for my silence   i have all the good thoughts of the person and good wishes for the prosperity of my benefactor that charity and that gratitude can inspire me with i ever believed him to have the true interest of the protestant religion and of his country in his view if it should be otherwise i should be very sorry and i must repeat it again that he always left me so entirely to my own judgment in every thing i did that he never prescribed to me what i should write or should not write in my life neither did he ever concern himself to dictate to or restrain me in any kind nor did he see any one tract that i ever wrote before it was printed so that all the notion of my writing by his direction is as much a slander upon him as it is possible any thing of that kind can be and if i have written any thing which is offensive unjust or untrue i must do that justice as to declare he has had no hand in it the crime is my own  as the reproach of his directing me to write is a slander upon the person i am speaking of so that of my receiving pensions and payments from him for writing is a slander upon me and i speak it with the greatest sincerity seriousness and solemnity that it is possible for a christian man to speak that except the appointment i mentioned before which her majesty was pleased to make me formerly and which i received during the time of my lord godolphins ministry i have not received of the late lord treasurer or of any one else by his order knowledge or direction one farthing or the value of a farthing during his whole administration nor has all the interest i have been supposed to have in his lordship been able to procure me the arrears due to me in the time of the other ministry so help me god  i am under no necessity of making this declaration the services i did and for which her majesty was pleased to make me a small allowance are known to the greatest men in the present administration and some of them were then of the opinion and i hope are so still that i was not unworthy of her majestys favor the effect of those services however small are enjoyed by those great persons and by the whole nation to this day and i had the honor once to be told that they should never be forgotten it is a misfortune that no man can avoid to forfeit for his deference to the person and services of his queen to whom he was inexpressibly obliged and if i am fallen under the displeasure of the present government for any thing i ever did in obedience to her majesty in the past i may say it is my disaster but i can never say it is my fault  this brings me again to that other oppression which as i said i suffer under and which i think is of a kind that no man ever suffered under so much as my self and this is to have every libel every pamphlet be it ever so foolish so malicious so unmannerly or so dangerous be laid at my door and be called publicly by my name it has been in vain for me to struggle with this injury it has been in vain for me to protest to declare solemnly nay if i would have sworn that i had no hand in such a book or paper never saw it never read it and the like it was the same thing  my name has been hackneyd about the street by the hawkers and about the coffeehouses by the politicians at such a rate as no patience could bear one man will swear to the style another to this or that expression another to the way of printing and all so positive that it is to no purpose to oppose it  i published once to stop this way of using me that i would print nothing but what i set my name to and i held it for a year or two but it was all one i had the same treatment i now have resolved for some time to write nothing at all and yet i find it the same thing two books lately published being called mine for no other reason that i know of than that at the request of the printer i revised two sheets of them at the press and that they seemed to be written in favor of a certain person which person also as i have been assured had no hand in them or any knowledge of them till they were published in print  this is a flail which i have no fence against but to complain of the injustice of it and that is but the shortest way to be treated with more injustice  there is a mighty charge against me for being author and publisher of a paper called the mercator i will state the fact first and then speak to the subject  it is true that being desired to give my opinion in the affair of the commerce with france i did as i often had done in print many years before declare that it was my opinion we ought to have an open trade with france because i did believe we might have the advantage by such a trade and of this opinion i am still what part i had in the mercator is well known and would men answer with argument and not with personal abuses i would at any time defend every part of the mercator which was of my doing but to say the mercator was mine is false i neither was the author of it had the property of it the printing of it or the profit by it i had never any payment or reward for writing any part of it nor had i the power to put what i would into it yet the whole clamor fell upon me because they knew not who else to load with it and when they came to answer the method was instead of argument to threaten and reflect upon me reproach me with private circumstances and misfortunes and give language which no christian ought to give and which no gentleman ought to take  i thought any englishman had the liberty to speak his opinion in such things for this had nothing to do with the public the press was open to me as well as to others and how or when i lost my english liberty of speaking my mind i know not neither how my speaking my opinion without fee or reward could authorize them to call me villain rascal traitor and such opprobious names  it was ever my opinion and is so still that were our wool kept from france and our manufactures spread in france upon reasonable duties all the improvement which the french have made in woolen manufactures would decay and in the end be little worth and consequently the hurt they could do us by them would be of little moment  it was my opinion and is so still that the ninth article of the treaty of commerce was calculated for the advantage of our trade let who will make it that is nothing to me my reasons are because it tied up the french to open the door to our manufactures at a certain duty of importation there and left the parliament of britain at liberty to shut theirs out by as high duties as they pleased here there being no limitation upon us as to duties on french goods but that other nations should pay the same  while the french were thus bound and the british free i always thought we must be in a condition to trade to advantage or it must be our own fault this was my opinion and is so still and i would venture to maintain it against any man upon a public stage before a jury of fifty merchants and venture my life upon the cause if i were assured of fair play in the dispute but that it was my opinion that we might carry on a trade with france to our great advantage and that we ought for that reason to trade with them appears in the third fourth fifth and sixth volume of the reviews above nine year before the mercator was thought of it was not thought criminal to say so then how it comes to be villainous to say so now god knows i can give no account of it i am still of the same opinion and shall never be brought to say otherwise unless i see the state of trade so altered as to alter my opinion and if ever i do i will be able to give good reasons for it  the answer to these things whether mine or no was all pointed at me and the arguments were generally in the terms of villain rascal miscreant liar bankrupt fellow hireling turncoat etc what the arguments were bettered by these methods that i leave to others to judge of also most of those things in the mercator for which i had such usage were such as i was not the author of  i do grant had all the books which have been called by my name been written by me i must of necessity have exasperated every side and perhaps have deserved it but i have the greatest injustice imaginable in this treatment as i have in the perverting the design of what really i have written to sum up therefore my complaint in few words  i was from my first entering into the knowledge of public matters and have ever been to this day a sincere lover of the constitution of my country zealous for liberty and the protestant interest but a constant follower of moderate principles a vigorous opposer of hot measures in all parties i never once changed my opinion my principles or my party and let what will be said of changing sides this i maintain that i never once deviated from the revolution principles nor from the doctrine of liberty and property on which it was founded  i own i could never be convinced of the great danger of the pretender in the time of the late ministry nor can i be now convinced of the great danger of the church under this ministry i believe the cries of one was politically made use of then to serve other designs and i plainly see the like use made of the other now i spoke my mind freely then and i have done the like now in a small tract to that purpose not yet made public and which if i live to publish i will publicly own as i purpose to do every thing i write that my friends may know when i am abused and they imposed on  it has been the disaster of all parties in this nation to be very hot in their turn and as often as they have been so i have differed with them all and ever must and shall do so i will repeat some of the occasions on the whigs side because from that quarter the accusation of my turning about comes  the first time i had the misfortune to differ with my friends was about the year      when the turks were besieging vienna and the whigs in england generally speaking were for the turks taking it which i having read the history of the cruelty and perfidious dealings of the turks in their wars and how they had rooted out the name of the christian religion in above threescore and ten kingdoms could by no means agree with and though then but a young man and a younger author i opposed it and wrote against it which was taken very unkindly indeed  the next time i differed with my friends was when king james was wheedling the dissenters to take off the penal laws and test which i could by no means come into and as in the first i used to say i had rather the popish house of austria should ruin the protestants in hungaria than the infidel house of ottoman should ruin both protestant and papist by overrunning germany so in the other i told the dissenters i had rather th church of england should pull our clothes off by fines and forfeitures than the papists should fall both upon the church and the dissenters and pull our skins off by fire and faggot  the next difference i had with good men was about the scandalous practice of occasional conformity in which i had the misfortune to make many honest men angry rather because i had the better of the argument than because they disliked what i said  and now i have lived to see the dissenters themselves very quiet if not very well pleased with an act of parliament to prevent it their iends indeed laid it on they would be friends indeed if they would talk of taking it off again  again i had a breach with honest men for their male treating king william of which i say nothing because i think they are now opening their eyes and making what amends they can to his memory  the fifth difference i had with them was about the treaty of partition in which many honest men were mistaken and in which i told them plainly then that they would at last end the war upon worse terms and so it is my opinion they would have done though the treaty of gertrudenburgh had taken place  the sixth time i differed with them was when the old whigs fell upon the modern whigs and when the duke of marlborough and my lord godolphin were used by the observator in a manner worse i must confess for the time it lasted than ever they were used since nay though it were by abel and the examiner but the success failed in this dispute my lord godolphin did me the honor to tell me i had served him and his grace also both faithfully and successfully but his lordship is dead and i have now no testimony of it but what is to be found in the observator where i am plentifully abused for being an enemy to my country by acting in the interest of my lord godolphin and the duke of marlborough what weathercock can turn with such tempers as these  i am now in the seventh breach with them and my crime now is that i will not believe and say the same things of the queen and the late treasurer which i could not believe before of my lord godolphin and the duke of marlborough and which in truth i cannot believe and therefore could not say it of either of them and which if i had believed yet i ought not to have been the man that should have said it for the reasons aforesaid  in such turns of tempers and times a man must be tenfold a vicar of bray or it is impossible but he must one time or other be out with every body this is my present condition and for this i am reviled with having abandoned my principles turned jacobite and what not god judge between me and these men would they come to any particulars with me what real guilt i may have i would freely acknowledge and if they would produce any evidence of the bribes the pensions and the rewards i have taken i would declare honestly whether they were true or no if they would give a list of the books which they charge me with and the reasons why they lay them at my door i would acknowledge any mistake own what i have done and let them know what i have not done but these men neither show mercy or leave place for repentance in which they act not only unlike their maker but contrary to his express commands  it is true good men have been used thus in former times and all the comfort i have is that these men have not the last judgment in their hands if they had dreadful would be the case of those who oppose them but that day will show many men and things also in a different state from what they may now appear in some that now appear clear and fair will then be seen to be black and foul and some that are now thought black and foul will then be approved and accepted and thither i cheerfully appeal concluding this part in the words of the prophet i heard the defaming of many fear on every side report say they and we will report it all my familiars watched for my halting saying peradventure he will be enticed and we shall prevail against him and we shall take our revenge on him jerem  0  0  mr pools annotations has the following remarks on these lines which i think are so much to that part of my case which is to follow that i could not omit them his words are these  the prophet says he here renders a reason why he thought of giving over his work as a prophet his ears were continually filled with the obloquies and reproaches of such as reproached him and besides lie was afraid on all hands there were so many traps laid for him so many devises devised against him they did not only take advantage against him but sought advantages and invited others to raise stories of him not only strangers but those that he might have expected the greatest kindness from those that pretended most courteously they watch says he for opportunities to do me mischief and lay in wait for my halting desiring nothing more than that i might be enticed to speak or do something which they might find matter of a colorable accusation that so they might satisfy their malice upon me this has always been the genius of wicked men job and david both made complaints much like this these are mr pools words  and this leads me to several particulars in which my case may without any arrogance be likened to that of the sacred prophet except only the vast disparity of the persons  no sooner was the queen dead and the king as right required proclaimed but the rage of men increased upon me to that degree that the threats and insults i received were such as i am not able to express if i offered to say a word in favor of the present settlement it was called fawning and turning round again on the other hand though i have meddled neither one way or other nor written one book since the queens death yet a great many things are called by my name and i bear every day the reproaches which all the answerers of those books cast as well upon the subject as the authors i have not seen or spoken to my lord of oxford but once since the kings landing nor received the least message order or writing from his lordship or any other way corresponded with him yet he bears the reproach of my writing in his defense and i the rage of men for doing it i cannot say it is no affliction to me to be thus used though my being entirely clear of the facts is a true support to me  i am unconcerned at the rage and clamor of partymen but i can not be unconcerned to hear men who i think are good men and good christians prepossessed and mistaken about me however i cannot doubt but some time or other it will please god to open such mens eyes a constant steady adhering to personal virtue and to public peace which i thank god i can appeal to him has always been my practice will at last restore me to the opinion of sober and impartial men and that is all i desire what it will do with those who are resolutely partial and unjust i cannot say neither is that much my concern but i cannot forbear giving one example of the hard treatment i receive which has happened even while i am writing this tract i have six children i have educated them as well as my circumstances will permit and so as i hope shall recommed them to better usage than their father meets with in the world i am not indebted one shilling in the world for any part of their education or for any thing else belonging to bringing them up yet the author of the flyingpost published lately that i never paid for the education of any of my children if an man in britain has a shilling to demand of me for any part of their education or any thing belong to them let them come for it  but these men care not what injurious things they write nor what they say whether truth or not if it may but raise a reproach on me though it were to be my ruin i may well appeal to the honor and justice of my worst enemies in such cases as this  conscia mens recti fama mendacia ridet conclusion by the publisher while this was at the press and the copy thus far finished the author was seized with a violent fit of an apoplexy whereby he was disabled finishing what he designed in his farther defense and continuing now for above six weeks in a weak and languishing condition neither able to go on or likely to recover at least in any short time his friends thought it not fit to delay the publication of this any longer if he recovers he may be able to finish what he began if not it is the opinion of most that know him that the treatment which he here complains of and some others that he would have spoken of have been the apparent cause of his disaster  finis
