a short essay on the virtues of dr norriss antimonial drops  the second edition  to which is added a catalogue of cures incontestibly proving eir sovereign efficacy in fevers  dr norris respectfully hopes the nobility and gentry will excuse this manner of communicating to them an account of his antimonial drops particularly when he assures them his principal view by this method is to render as universal as possible so great a benefit to mankind  it was by the method of transmitting cases and cures that physic first began to be formed into a science by the same it must be improved and brought if possible to perfection templeman short essay etc though there is nothing should less plead for an apology to the public than addressing them on what so immediately and importantly concerns them the continuance and restoration of their health yet in a metropolis like this  where the necessitous the ignorant and adventurous are every hour practicing on the constitutions of their fellow creatures  the most distant possibility of my being classed in this number would have prevented this address was i not at the same time so conscious from many years absolute experience in a variety of cases of the superior efficacy of this medicine that abstracted from all other considerations i should hold myself chargeable in point of duty to omit making it as universal as possible  upon this principle then and the corroborating success of this medicine for many years i beg leave to recommend to the public norriss antimonial drops which upon a certainty of their composition and salutary effects i pronounce a specific in the following disorders  inflammatory fevers putrid bilious fevers slow latent commonly called nervous fevers and putrid sore throats etc insomuch that in a vast variety of cases where life has been often despaired of and under some of the most respectable of the faculty there has been no one instance at least that has ever come to my knowledge of their being found ineffectual  i am however aware that from the title of this medicine many may have their doubts as antimony of all other physical productions has been considered as the most violent and dangerous in it is effects i will not contradict this popular apprehension on the contrary i think it generally well founded but this i will pledge myself to say that from my particular manner of preparing it it is efficacy can only be equalled by it is safety that it is a medicine of such singular or unique quality that it may be taken with equal safety in infancy or old age by delicate or robust constitutions in small or large quantities and so far from producing any of those violent operations the usual effects of antimony it recovers nature in the most friendly manner imaginable operating without any sensible difference than a degree of perspiration etc proportioned to the necessity of the disease  it is to be lamented that upon many occasions in fevers physicians are obliged to wait for what they call the crisis of the disorder and many days are often elapsed in this intermediate doubtful state before any thing can be pronounced in respect to an opinion on the patient but this medicine is so immediate yet innocent in it is effects that it waits for no crisis or particular period it may be taken in the first middle or latter stages of the disorder and in any quantities with safety in short it wants but to meet the disease to give it an absolute overthrow  from these positive declarations i am not insen ible what a risque i may be thought to run both in respect to my own character and fortune and indeed i should feel myself unworthy not only of the public patronage i have received but of the common benefits of mankind could i be so lost to my own honor and conscience for the mere sake of interested views thus to recommend a medicine which i even remotely doubted of it is success but the repeated proofs i have had of it is neverfailing efficacy it is immediate powerful and safe effects all give me a consciousness of communicating it to the world under the most positive and certain assurances  these drops besides being a specific for fevers i have often known succeed in a variety of other disorders such as bad digestion nervous headaches latent scurvies the source of many evils and infallably in gouty habits where insensible perspiration is suppressed and indeed when the extent of their powers as an universal deobstruent which lead to a general strengthening and restoration of nature are considered the universality of their effects will cease to be wondered at  having thus given a summary account of the virtues of these antimonial drops i am aware of the objections which will naturally arise from a comparative view of the general mode of medicinal administration and that which prevails in this essay i am likewise aware of the formidable opposition which every great discovery in medicine must unavoidably meet with not only from it is opposition to established practice but the uncharitable endeavors of interested men who under the specious pretense of it is not being in common use have invariably reprobated all such however beneficial to mankind as dangerous or uncertain though the use of these antimonial drops would be a convincing answer to such insinuations yet as many have not experienced their effects and as i would willingly obviate every difficulty as well for the sake of my own reputation as the satisfaction of the public i shall submit the following apology for my conduct  it is generally objected to those who have labored through a painful course of years and have been at great expenses in the discovery and preparation of medicine that to make a mystery for private emolument of what so essentially affects public benefit is repugnant to those principles of universal charity which should actuate the human breast  this at first blush i own seems plausible but then it should be considered that the means of throwing this into common use may destroy its effects as the excellency of a medicine depends not so much on the subject from which it is taken as the great care and judgment in the preparation a common chemist in shortening the necessary period of preparation dispensing with accidents substituting apparentlysimilar bodies or by any of those various means which may save his time or increase his profits may think himself sufficiently justified for so doing by the usage of trade but the more careful chemist conscious that the least accident or mismanagement is frequently sufficient to extinguish the virtues of his process and having nothing so much at heart as the credit of his medicine is barred by no labor no time no expenses no disappointments in bringing to perfection this his favorite object  permit me then to rank myself in this last class who from dedicating the best part of my life to chemical processes must necessarily be supposed to be well acquainted with the minutest preparation of medicine and on the credit of this experience let me add that what from the judgment and accuracy required together with the many accidents to which it is liable the process of my antimonial drops can scarcely be completed in the way of common business this consideration then alone i flatter myself will fully justify my conduct to the judicious and impartial part of mankind  i have already been sufficiently explicit in enumerating the virtues of this medicine i do not therefore mean to take up any more of the attention of the public otherwise than as the preservation and restoration of health form the principal and greatest blessing of life that they strictly examine into it is merits if it turns out to be productive of those benefits i have mentioned surely i cannot be thought presuming to expect that a public reward should follow so public a benefit if on the contrary i should be found one of those forward daring empyricks who are heedless what sacrifices they make to their own interests let me be branded with that infamy which those who endeavor to deceive mankind in such important matters deserve  and here i beg leave to request all those who have honored me with their confidence and who by experience or observation are vouchers of the efficacy of this medicine to favor me with their names and address that by the permitted publication of such authority to be from time to time added to this essay i may be the better enabled to render as universal as possible so great a benefit to mankind  dukestreet westminster

than six months illness my physicians drs addington and ford having so far given me over as to discontinue their prescriptions thinking every possible means had been tried at last consented that your drops should be administered the first dose gave manifest signs of amendment and in a short continuance of them i was restored from the brink of the grave to perfect health it is now upwards of five years since i experienced their happy effects since which i have not only recommended but administered them to many in fevers and do declare i never found them to fail in a single instance this you

servant was delirious and in all respects so bad in an inflammatory fever attended with a putrid disposition that it was generally thought she could not recover but on taking these drops she presently began to mend and the continuance of one small bottle perfected her cure  some time after my son had a violent inflammatory fever and from the almost immediate effects of these drops on my servant and

duty to add to your catalogue my testimony of their safety and efficacy of which to particularize no other there cannot be a stronger proof than the following case  a daughter of mine sixteen years of age of a delicate constitution was last autumn seized with a putrid fever and sore throat so rapid was the disease in it is progress that she was near a dissolution before your drops were administered we gave them in large doses and very freely by which the danger was presently overcome and my daughter soon perfectly restored to health you have my permission to subjoin this to your essay and am

parents who had despaired of her recovery she is happily restored to health by the virtues of this invaluable medicine two of his servants were cured of a putrid fever the one in his own house very speedily and went about his business in a few days the other soon after was attacked with the same disorder for reasons best known to his master he sent him to islington and put him under the care of an apothecary there but hearing very unfavorable accounts of him daily he went to see him and sent for the apothecary who told him among other things that his fever was a very dangerous one and must wait for a crisis etc this not appearing satisfactory to the old gentleman he discharged the apothecary and immediately sent for me let it suffice to say that i was under the necessity of giving this young man three times more in quantity of the drops than is ordinarily prescribed before the desired effect was produced he began to take them about eight o clock in the morning and between that and five in the evening he had taken four fifths of a half guinea bottle without their having the least sensible effect he then called for a large basin of tea which he drank and about six had a very profuse sweat in which he continued the whole night and slept comfortably i made him a visit the next day and found him equal to my wishes and the day following pronounced him out of danger which i reported to his master in a week or ten days after i saw him about his business   remarks very few people pay that attention to the directions given with the medicine which they ought if they did there would be very little occasion for my visits particularly in fevers  the following case you have in the gentlemans own words in the month of july      my eldest son was seized with a most violent fever and neverceasing excessive headache which defied all the various medicines that acknowledged skill and attention could prescribe for thirteen days and nights together until he was evidently sinking under dedebilitating vomits blisters and four bleedings the despairing father trembling for the fate of a youth who had never once swerved from the strictest rules of duty and who but very recently lost another most promising youth under circumstances exactly similar and therefore as a last resource in such imminent danger he applied for dr norriss antimonial drops which in one night carried off the violent headache and through a soft easy sweat that terminated in a sound sleep every dangerous symptom was at once removed which i dutifully attest to allay th excruciating anguish of all other unhappy parents in the like melancholy sorrow and distress for their beloved offspring sinking helpless and without any hope of further relief from fast approaching dissolution this sir you

perfectly recovered without any other sensible effect than a degree of perspiration this you have not only my permission but my request you will make public for the good of mankind  tho hepburn finchlane cornhill jan          remarks this young man after bleeding blistering leeches applied to his temples and every other means in common practice made use of to no good purpose his brother with whom he lives was advised to try in this desperate case my antimonial drops he made some enquiries about me at the carolina coffeehouse in birchinlane where i frequently go when in the city satisfied with mr carrs and several gentlemens report of me there the drops were immediately administered according to directions the next day i happened to call at the coffeehouse when mr carr who keeps it after reciting what had past was sorry to inform me the young man was no better and then past all hope that as i was so near he thought it advisable i should call i did and never did i see a human being so near death i could feel no pulse he lay on his back with his eyes wide open and fixed speechless and motionless to all appearance being the first instance of my antimonial drops failing in fevers at least that ever came to my knowledge made me more particularly inquisitive about the administration of them when to my great surprise the brother of my patient assured me with much concern they were administered according to directions and he had taken of nothing else since but the apothecarys stuffs as he called them every two hours as they were directed to be given there was no time to be lost in reproof it was now one oclock at noon i immediately dispatched a messenger to mr parkers for a half guinea bottle of drops a table spoonful of which was poured down that instant with directions if he lived an hour and an half to repeat it and continue to give him that quantity every two hours after till a sweat or some visible signs of amendment were discovered and then to diminish the dose gradually that no other medicine should be administered on any account but to let him have as much baum tea or any simple diluting liquor as they could get down by little and little every now and then the blunder committed before made them now doubly diligent and punctual i called the next day and found the fever was quite gone but such a lassitude and stupidity remained as exceeds all description the nurse informed me he lay very quiet till five oclock about six he began to perspire and continued so to do the whole night plentifully sleeping all the time which from his laying very still and motionless and as she thought breathless too made her several times conclude he was dead till by laying on her hand every now and then she was satisfied to the contrary i then ordered the drops to be given very sparingly not above twenty or thirty every two or three hours till i called the next day when i pronounced him out of danger and ordered him to be wrapped up in a blanket put into a carriage and taken somewhere to breathe a purer air as soon as possible which was accordingly done the next day he soon gathered strength and in a few days was able to return to his business and has continued ever since in good health and spirits  certificate i thomas reynolds master of the ship mentor belonging to the port of london do hereby certify to whom it may concern that upon my late voyage from st kitts to carolina with negro slaves several of them falling ill of fevers and some of them very dangerously so i administered to them dr norriss antimonial drops and they all perfectly recovered without the aid of any other medicine whatsoever  thomas reynolds london oct         remarks this gentleman informed me that from africa to st kitts he had lost upwards of seventy slaves not being able to prevail on the surgeon to administer my antimonial drops to them when he arrived at st kitts the doctor quitted the ship and the captain then had about seventy slaves left which he was to take to carolina in the passage ten or twelve of them were seized with the same fever the others died of being then without a surgeon he had recourse to my antimonial drops which recovered them verily believing if timely administered nine out of ten of those that were lost might have been saved these drops were sent by way of experiment at the instance of a worthy gentleman a merchant in the city much interested in african affairs and under the peculiar care of captain reynolds the only one he said he could depend upon to make a just report before which and since several small boxes were sent to merchants at liverpool for the same purpose and some few from the port of london also but strange to tell when immediately under the care and administration of the surgeon all their influence were gone and they became of none effect it would be no very easy matter to prevail upon many commanders of ships who sail without surgeons to credit this report from their own experience this i am very well assured of and could venture my credit reputation and fortune upon the event that if the surgeons of ships were actuated by the same disinterested principles my antimonial drops would prove a great acquisition not only to the african company in preserving their negroes but the lives of thousands subject to putrid fevers in hot climates  letter from capt stott of his majestys frigate the juno to dr norris in justice to you and from a desire of being serviceable to the community particularly that part of it which i have the honor to be a member of i send you attested by the officers of his majestys ship juno under my command an account of the effects of your antimonial drops in the course of my late voyage to and from falklands island  in the outward passage by the surgeon of the ships report to me of the  th of april last it appeared that geo hunter and laur pittman two of the seamen were taken ill with malignant fevers that having for several days been given the usual medicines without effect he thought them past a possibility of recovery judging this a fit opportunity to make a trial of the efficacy of your drops for notwithstanding the recommendations which were given me of them and which induced me to take them with me i had resolved to let every usual means take place before i gave them i then therefore gave a bottle to the surgeon and desired they might be administered he said it would he believed be of little consequence whatever was given them as he thought they could not live to the next day however he would try them the next morning in his account to me of the sick he told me the men were much better and he believed they would recover which from that time they did and were soon after able to do their duty in the ship  on the   th of july following being in the southern part of the torrid zone mr joslin the boatswain of the ship was taken ill of the same fever with the like symptoms as the two former and after the surgeon had represented to me that he had used all the means in his power for his recovery to no purpose the antimonial drops were given and had the desired effect by his immediate recovery  sometime afterward in the southern ocean ja hamm and evan williams the one a boy the other a marine were seized with a fever and were by the surgeons report to me given over for many days the drops were given them also which produced a plentiful sweating and their immediate recovery such repeated success gives me the highest opinion of the virtues and efficacy of your antimonial drops and on these grounds i cannot too strongly recommend them  i also enclose you the surgeons attestation taken from the journals of his practice in the ship and which as well as this letter you are at liberty to make public wishing you every success  i am sir your most obedient humble servant jn stott juno portsmouth jan         we the undermentioned officers of his majestys said ship juno do also testify

effects i have experienced from it both in myself and family to transmit you a short account of the result with regard to myself my constitution is rather valetudinary and has been so as long as i can remember it is now about fifteen years since it was first invaded by the gout which i think i may call hereditary as i cannot accuse myself of any irregularities adequate to the severity with which i have been visited by this formidable enemy  among many causes that combine to bring on the gout i was always of opinion that an obstrncted perspiration was one to remove this i was advised when perspiration was suppressed to take your antimonial drops frequently and plentifully these by promoting a good digestion and it is consequent attendant a brisk circulation of the fluids kept open my pores which before upon any sudden change in the air from heat to cold were generally closed  in the fits of the gout i frequently take them in small quantities and find them promote assisted by small dilutive liquors sensible perspiration in a high degree and upon any uneasy sensations in the stomach or bowels during the fit they seldom fail to remove the cause in fevers either putrid or inflammatory frequent occasions have offered to try their effects in a numerous family of my own and from repeated experience i never found them fail of success and that by removing the disease in a very few days  thus much i am warranted to say in their favor and think them possessed of much greater virtues than even i have described  i am sir your most obedient humble servant wm norris
