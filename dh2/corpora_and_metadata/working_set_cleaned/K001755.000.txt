a practical treatise on the gonorrhoea recommending the use of injection as the most speedy and efficacious method of cure with a brief account of the remedies which have been used in the lues venerea from its first appearance in europe and a critical enquiry into the present modes of administering mercury  by peter clare surgeon  non mihi sed rationi a new edition with additions  london printed for t cadell in the strand mdcclxxxiii  preface there are two very different methods of curing the gonorrhoea the one wholly by internal medicines the other principally by injection the former is generally a very uncertain and disagreeable process the latter is both expeditious and safe but dreaded by many persons on account of a false idea which has long prevailed this ill founded notion it is my business at present to confute by several arguments supported by quotations from authors of distinguished credit  mr pott recommends the advice given by lord bacon to a student to consider one disease at a time and to become thoroughly acquainted with that before he undertakes another he further observes that the only means by which true and useful knowledge is to be obtained in every part of surgery are a competent knowledge of the anatomical structure of the human frame a close attention to the symptoms of diseases in the living and a minute examination of the appearances in the dead these are the great fountains of all medical knowledge mr pott has here pointed out in a very judicious manner the path which every chirurgical practitioner and writer should pursue who undertakes to explain the true nature seat and cure of any bodily disorder  chancery lane january        table of contents treatise on the gonorrhoea page   on the cure by internal medicines page  0 particular

recapitulation of the argument with additional observations page    a treatise on the gonorrhoea the part principally affected by the gonorrhoea is the penis which consists of three parts two of which are called corpora cavernosa and lie on each side and a third which is situated underneath named corpus spongiosum urethrae consisting of the bulb and membranous part continued on to the bladder and terminating at the other extremity in the corona or glans penis the urethra has three glands which were discovered by cowper and called mucous glands from the tenacity of the liquor which they separate there are also two or rather one about the size of a nutmeg they lie at the neck of the bladder between the vesiculae seminales and penis under the ossa pubis almost within the pelvis of the abdomen they separate a limpid glutinous humor which is carried into the urethra by several ducts which enter near those of the prostatae the two first of cowpers glands are about the bigness of a french bean of a depressed oval figure and a yellowish color like the prostatae being on each side the bulb of the urethra a little above it their excretory ducts arise from the internal surface next the inner membrane of the urethra into which they open a little lower by two distinct orifices just below the curvature of the ossa pubis in perinaeo where they discharge a transparent viscous liquor the third mucous gland is a small conglobate yellowish gland like the former but somewhat less situated above the angle of the flexure of the urethra under the ossa pubis in the perinaeum near the anus it has two excretory ducts which enter the urethra obliquely a quarter of an inch below the two former and discharges a liquor like them both in color and consistence  the seat of the gonorrhoea in women is the vagina which is affected with a discharge charge like that of the urethra in men it lies between the bladder and intestinum rectum and has rugae under which are small glands whose excretory ducts are called lacunae these glands separate a mucilaginous slimy liquor to lubricate the vagina and are the seat of the gonorrhoea in this sex as the glands in the urethra are in the male the meatus urinarius being a very short passage the heat and scalding is consequently much less than in the men  a gonorrhoea from the urethra in a man begins with an uneasiness about the parts of generation together with an appearance of a little whitish matter about the orifice of the urethra a little swelling and sometimes redness there and a slight pungency upon the evacuation of urine the whitish matter soon increases in quantity the inflammation about the end of the urethra becomes more evident and for the most part there is now a tension and hardness through the whole of it a swelling of the lacunae and a sensation of stricture in the penis particularly on erection the matter still increases flows out and grows thinner loses all its adhesiveness and is of a yellow or greenish color there is now always a redness about the end of the canal often a pain from the distention of the urethra during the evacuation of urine and a much severer toward the orifice from its stimulus with an increase of the redness just after it is evacuated the inflammation prevents the extension of the urethra in erection so that the penis is at that time curved downwards with great pain which is increased if it be raised toward the belly and the stimulus occasions it often to be erected especially when warm in bed dr fordyces elements of physic   i believe it would generally be esteemed good practice on this occasion to give nitre in considerable quantity a purging electuary pill or salts and to take blood freely from the patient also to direct large quantities of diluting liquors and further to recommend a strict regimen and abstinence from particular meats vegetables and strong liquors the question is are such medicines and restriction necessary in my humble opinion they are not and they appear upon the whole to do more harm than good as i shall endeavor to demonstrate from the experience of those who are well qualified to give an opinion in a matter of this kind and also from my own observation and practice  dr cullen remarks that purgatives not only inflame the rectum but also extend their irritation to the urethra may not chordee and priapism then often be attributed to this cause  dr fordyce recommends increasing the secretion a little by such gentle purgatives as procure only two or three evacuations a day  but who can ensure his patient two or three stools only in a day the intestines being once put into motion will not accommodate themselves exactly to our wish or convenience happily for the patient it is certain that even gentle purging may be dispensed with on these occasions  he adds that severe purging often augments the inflammatory symptoms brings on strangury and exulcerations gives occasion to inflammation of the testicles and other neighboring parts or it stops the running before the infection is washed off and the gonorrhoea either returns in a few days or exulcerations take place  the doctor further observes that long continued purging is apt to weaken the stomach and intestines to hurt the digestion to produce obstinate gleets and leave hypochondriacal symptoms particularly in irritable or melancholic habits  many more authorities might be adduced in proof of the bad effects of a course of purgatives in these cases which are generally of considerable duration when treated in this manner neither are antiphlogistic remedies to be depended upon as they sometimes produce the very contrary effect to what was expected from them amongst the first of these is nitre in inflammatory disorders dr lewis a late writer of no small credit reckons that nitre often gives relief in stranguries and heat of urine proceeding either from a simple or a venereal taint and indeed the greatest part of practitioners have always given it and still continue to give it in the venereal ardor urinae  this practice however says dr hope in his lectures on the materia medica i am apt to believe has taken its rise from the name of ardor having always been given to the pain in evacuating the urine during the time of a venereal inflammation of the urethra and the name and virtues of a cooler having always been attributed to this salt but it is certain that the urine passed during the time of a venereal inflammation is no warmer than at other times and therefore to prescribe a cooler to allay the heat of it is absurd and i am persuaded that on a free and candid examination of this matter it will be found that nitre has not the smallest power of alleviating the pain which is then felt for i have given it in all the different stages of this disease in small and in large doses but from the sole use of it in a great number of trials have never been able to observe that it afforded the least relief nor when we consider the cause of that pain and the effects of nitre have we any reason to expect it for the pain certainly proceeds from the acrid salts in the urine stimulating the inflamed or excoriated urethra and a solution of nitre applied to any excoriated part always gives considerable pain experiments assure us that on taking nitre into the stomach the urine becomes impregnated with it the larger therefore the doses are the stronger will this impregnation be and the greater stimulus added to the urine so that we may sensibly conclude that this salt will rather augment than diminish the pain in evacuating it the doctor further remarks that there are many weak and delicate stomachs which cannot bear the cold it produces and others in whom it always creates sickness and nausea  besides the disagreeable circumstance of taking great quantities of nauseous medicines we find there is the greatest uncertainty as to their real effects on the diseases they are intended to remove a powder or medicine of any kind applied to blood in a basin may visibly affect that fluid and render it thin or thick yet being taken into the stomach and possibly from thence into the circulation it may have a very different effect on the circulating fluids or perhaps none having undergone a material alteration in its course  a late celebrated lecturer on the materia medica discoursing with his pupils on the powerful operations of mucilaginous medicines in the alleviation of the pain arising from the stone in the bladder remarked that such medicines were extremely useful where the stone was of the mulberry kind and apt to vellicate the coats of the bladder he told them the ropy mucilage would envelope the stone and make a uniformly smooth surface entirely depriving it of its asperities and consequently of its power of hurting the bladder  it is difficult for one conversant with the mechanism of the human body and the operation of medicine to conceive that a mucilage given by the mouth will arrive at the bladder in that state we are certain that particular remedies will stimulate particular parts balsam of capivi for instance being absorbed is known to affect the kidneys and bladder by the strong odor it imparts to the urine but we do not find this or any other medicine except quicksilver will pass off in the same form in which it is administered by the mouth this balsam is very much esteemed for its great virtues particularly in certain stages of the gonorrhoea but it is so very disagreeable on account of its oily and bitter quality as well as its smell that some patients are soon disgusted with it and others will not be prevailed upon to take it at all we cannot therefore think it strange that many gentlemen should often prefer injections to all other means which do not appear to produce effects in any degree equal to the trouble which attends them it must be acknowledged that patients often suffer more from the remedy than the disorder they are often more emaciated weak and pallid in their countenance circumstances which frequently lead to disagreeable discoveries from the operations of purgatives in the space of one week than they would have been in a month if there had been no attempt made to check the progress of this disorder  there are many people who have not leisure to pursue the several directions and prescriptions given by practitioners and if they could find time they would have but little inclination to undergo so much fatigue and trouble such tedious processes are very ill contrived for the multitude who must be and are daily cured by means much more easy expeditious and quite as effectual and if one class of men are cured in this manner why should not all enjoy the same benefit  i have asserted that a regimen or particular diet is not necessary in the cure of the gonorrhoea when treated in the manner here recommended some have asked if the disorder is not inflammatory and if living low is not indispensibly necessary in every complaint of this kind it may be said in reply that this is a local inflammation which yields at once to a cooling detergent liquid applied to the part whilst internal medicines are commonly slow and uncertain in removing it  when mercury does not pass into the stomach there is no occasion to enjoin restrictions with respect to diet since no disagreement can then happen patients may live in the same manner as at other times only avoiding excess  dr hugh smith who is an advocate for vitriolic injections asserts that a gonorrhoea if taken in the beginning may generally be cured in a fortnight without any injuty to the constitution or any ill effects whatsoever dr smiths formulae medicamentorum   i have met with the greatest success in the cure of this complaint from the same sort of injections and find they answer much better than mercurial ones which deposit a considerable sediment and being conveyed into the urethra cause irritation and pain in that tender passage  the injection should be applied cold rather than warm as cold braces and warmth relaxes which i find often completes the cure in much less than a fortnight the time mentioned by the doctor  if the injection causes any more than a slight sensation of smart or pain in the passage it is evidently too much impregnated with vitriol and the solution must be made weaker as the irritation of the liquor would increase the symptoms instead of diminishing them  the great objection to this sort of practice is raised on the supposition that injections are apt to produce stricture in the urinary passage this idea i apprehend is not well founded having enquired of many different people who have been troubled with strictures if they had used injections for the cure and was generally answered in the negative  i am much inclined to think with doctor fordyce that when a gonorrhoea continues long it sometimes produces a stricture in the part inflammation is naturally disposed to produce contraction and stricture in the different sacculi and passages of the body as well as in the urethra therefore we may conclude that evils are often attributed to injections which in fact owe their origin to other causes if the long duration of this distemper produces strictures and obstructions then what removes the disorder quickly must undoubtedly prevent the above evils instead of causing them  the same gentleman justly observes that omitting the injection once or twice will often make it fail of curing when it would have otherwise produced that effect if the injection should not produce the desired effect it will be right to enquire if the urine passes freely and whether it divides into two streams or more or whether it comes out twisted like a corkscrew in these cases it is not likely the injection should effect its purpose being unable to pass recourse must therefore be had to the bougie to restore the passage to its natural state  he likewise remarks that patients treated in this manner are less liable to inflammation of the testicles or of the glands in the groin on to chancres or strictures these observations are certainly founded on fact it is the general opinion that small doses of mercury ought to accompany the injection see fordyce saunders smith and others  conformably to this idea i give a grain of mercurial powder and apply it to the cuticular surfaces of the lips or the tongue and at the same time make use of the vitriolic in preference to every other injection though i have made repeated trials of several i know of no other which would remove the disorder in twice the time which this does but there are some that would not succeed at all and rather aggravate the symptoms  it is now proved by a repetition of ingenious experiments and generally admitted that the discharge in a gonorrhoea proceeding from the wethra is not pus but mucus pus is the matter which proceeds from wounds and ulcers but mucus comes from surfaces not ulcerated though sometimes inflamed dr hunter says he has often dissected the urethra of persons who have died having the gonorrhoea at that time and he adds that he never discovered any ulcer in the passage mucus is in itself an innocent mild fluid but capable of acquiring virulence and acrimony from contagious infection  the gonorrhoea is an increased and virulent discharge from the mucous glands described in pages   and   of the urinary passage mucus when untainted is transparent like the white of an egg appears as a drop sometimes at the orifice of the urethra next the glands is of a mucilaginous viscidity and its use is to sheathe and defend the passage from the irritating salts conveyed in the urine it resembles the fluid in the eye which is secreted in small quantity but when the lachrymal gland is stimulated by grief dust or other offending substance the discharge becomes copious and sometimes acrid  darwin observes in his experiments on pus and mucus that whenever the secretion of any fluid is increased there is at the same time an increased heat in the part the same gentleman observes that the catarrhal humor from the nostrils of some who ride in frosty weather and the tears which run down the cheeks of those who have an obstruction of the puncta lachrymalia are easily distinguished from others by their abounding in ammoniacal or muriatic salts whence they inflame the circumjacent skin thus in the catarrh the upper lip becomes red and swelled from the acrimony of the mucus and patients complain of the saltness of its taste the eyes and cheeks are red with the corrosive tears and the ichor of some herpetic eruptions erodes far and wide the contiguous parts and is pungently salt to the taste as some patients have informed him  when the mucous membrane of the nose is stimulated by a violent cold or other cause we often see an extraordinary quantity of discharge from that organ yet no one suspects the existence of any ulcers there and i have often observed that the discolored mucus of that part bears so strong a resemblance to the virulent discharge in the gonorrhoea that it would frequently perplex persons conversant in these matters to distinguish two handkerchiefs the one from the other when stained with the respective mucus either of these fluids having acquired acrimony will inflame and sometimes slightly excoriate irritable nervous membranes these excoriations generally heal of themselves and when they do not no one hesitates to apply repellent and healing medicines to the part without even the smallest suspicion of any bad consequence with ulcers the case is very different there being the greatest reason to apprehend danger from the absorption of matter into the circulation writers of good credit assert that a drop of acrid pus absorbed into the blood affects all the fluids stimulates the vessels and is capable of producing violent disorders such as putrid fevers etc impressed with such a belief no thinking man in this or any age would adopt a practice at once so irrational and dangerous but as the discharge is merely mucus and has no concern with the system or animal economy it may be safely washed away like any other sordes or filth from the surfaces of the body by injections which are not only far more expeditious in producing their effects but also appear on a due comparison of the merits of each to possess another advantage that of being a more cleanly safe and agreeable method of cure than any other whatsoever i have only to add in this place that i am confirmed more and more in the use of injections which entirely answer the above description and commendation  a brief account of the remedies in use for the cure of the lues venerea from its first appearance in europe the cure of this disorder which has now prevailed all over europe near three centuries has not been so much improved by the profession as might have been expected during so long a period it raged for several years uncontrouled before an effectual remedy for it was discovered after the antidote for this poison was found to exist in mercury yet still so very unfortunate was the applicat on of it that many lives were lost by salivations shocking to relate in consequence of the want of sufficient knowledge of the nature and qualities of this mineral in the practitioners of those times  the first attempts of the cure of venereal maladies by this remedy were learned from the arabians who having recommended mercurial ointments in the leprosy or scabies gave a handle to the italian physicians to try their efficacy in removing the foulness of the skin from a new and terrible contagion neither were they sparing of their liniments which they continued to rub in for twelve fifteen nay sometimes for above thirty days together mead on poisons  a very dangerous practice which prevails too much even in the present age sarsaparilla sassafras guaicum have all at different periods been in more or less estimation for their antivenereal virtues but mercury is the only antidote for this poison on which any age has reposed an entire confidence  in      dr sydenham wrote on this amongst other subjects his account shows that although the use of the remedy was better understood yet the cure of the disorder was but little improved  in      dr turner a member of the college of physicians in london who had made the venereal disease his particular study thought proper to communicate his observations and practice to the world his drastic purges and mercurial prescriptions were such as might destroy the most robust constitution what then must have become of those of a weak and delicate frame  dr boerhaave has advanced a system of his own apparently less detrimental than former ones and which has been very much adopted of late years the doctors theory of the disease is that it is seated in the fat therefore evacuations which destroyed it must in his opinion contribute greatly to the cure of this disorder for which reason the doctor recommended the most powerful sudorifics and purgatives the former of which though hurtful are less prejudicial to the constitution than the latter  dr astruc a celebrated writer has given a very sensible and accurate description of the lues venerea in all its stages with directions for its cure but the remedies are as violent as those recommended by preceding writers and ought therefore to be exploded  baron van swieten recommends the corrosive sublimate to be given internally it had hitherto only been used externally to fungus in wounds on account of the violence of its nature even when administered in rum or brandy to correct it the stomach can seldom retain it for which reason it has grown into disrepute although it has a most astonishing and rapid effect in removing venereal symptoms  mr professor plenk advises the giving quicksilver with gum arabic to prevent it from exciting a salivation this is the least prejudicial of all the modes of administering mercury internally  fumigation which is lately revived i have often seen applied to sores with hardly any perceptible advantage and sometimes it gave great pain and did a manifest injury  two circumstances have conduced greatly to the better treatment of this complaint within these twenty or thirty years i mean the extraordinary improvements in anatomy and chemistry by the former we have acquired a better knowledge of the seat of this disorder and by the latter of the medicines employed to effect it is cure  a critical enquiry into the operation of mercury and the different modes of administering it considered difference of opinion prevails with regard to the mode of administering mercurial preparations the advocates for each giving their reasons for that which they adopt in preference to any other the alterative method is much in esteem and practice and with some deviation and caution may be rendered very beneficial  this appellation of alterant or alterative is given to all such medicines as correct the bad qualities of the blood and other animal fluids without occasioning any sensible evacuation according to dr woodward all that is commonly alleged concerning the change of principles or ferments of diseases by alterant remedies is merely chimerical and imaginary he remarks that there is no change made to the advantage of the human body without a successive renovation and discharge of what is hurtful and a supply of its place by something innocent  the doctor gives the preference to evacuants as being the only medicines capable of freeing the machine from whatever incommodes it some take a contrary course and ascribe even the salutary effects of evacuants to their alterative nature which has been alleged of mercury in the cure of the venereal disease among alterant medicines there are several which change the scene of the symptoms and others which suspend the action of the morbific matter for a time but these remedies which hold the morbific principles captive pro tempoe are only palliatives and even on some accounts dangerous since they may as well captivate other principles necessary to lise  dr fordyce says whatever preparation we employ we should give it in such a manner and in such a dose as to produce hardness fullness and moderate frequency of the pulse with as little sensible evacuation as possible for that the mercury cures sooner and with greater certainty when the strength is but little than when it is much reduced by it  mr plenck is of opinion that mercury together with the venereal virus may be more conveniently and more easily evacuated by the ordinary excretions of sweat stool and urine  it seems to me much more safe to permit the gradual evacuation of mercury after it has circulated some time and subdued the virus than to confine it within the body by opiates or other means so as to occasion hardness fullness and acceleration of the pulse the saturation or surcharge of the system with mercury is very hazardous as it sometimes terminates in a fatal diarrhaea surely it is most prudent to permit a little of the mercury to depart and throw into the circulation such a proportion only as may be altogether safe and yet sufficient to keep up a gentle mercurial stimulus in the habit  mercury and wine operate somewhat alike upon the body with a certain quantity of wine hardness fullness and acceleration of the pulse will supervene till at length in common an evacuation takes place when it does not and the wine is retained there like mercury exhibited as an alterative it excites feverish heat and does the constitution much more injury than when it passes off gradually by any of the ordinary evacuations  dr fordyce observes it is never necessary to salivate a patient unless he be so irritable that the smallest dose of mercury immediately affects his mouth or unless the disease be proceeding so fast that it would be hazardous to wait till it was checked by the remedy given in such a manner as to avoid salivation or excepting when we cannot trust to his using it regularly on the contrary salivation renders the effects of the medicine uncertain the same author says if notwithstanding these precautions a salivation should come on we know of no remedy which will remove it with any degree of certainty although sulphur camphire and purgatives have been recommended for this purpose if therefore the case be urgent the best way is to let it go on using the mercurial ointment as above described dr saunders says he has known patients who have had violent fevers excited by mercury in the form of unction the same author remarks that a gentleman who had recourse to mercurial unction being seized with a fever sent for him and communicated to him his venercal complaints his pulse was quick and hard he complained of pain in his back headache thirst and other such symptoms as he had frequently seen arise from a mercurial course conducted on the plan here prescribed  dr cullen observes  that purging is never excited by any means without spasms of the intestines which when the operation is continued are apt to end in durable spasm and inflammation these are attended with very dangerous consequences neither does the method of purging by unction answer much better although perhaps more effectual because it is attended with very great pain  lectures on materia medica     i have ever found those patients more easily cured who were most susceptible of the mercurial stimulus let there be an affection of the mouth and cheeks and an amendment of the complaint takes place at least nine times in ten the mercury will run off in general very soon if the process is discontinued which it must not be but the tenderness of the mouth is to be kept up to a certain degree according to the urgency of the disorder and to prevent a relapse especially in chancres with hardness and in other inveterate cases it is not the mere quantity of mercury but the method of directing its operation which in my opinion is the chief circumstance to be relied on in the cure i would certainly run the risk if there was any of not immediately curing rather than expose my patient to the hazard of a large quantity of accumulated mercury ready at an hours notice or less to emancipate itself from the body by stimulating the intestines and thus exhausting lie  we may be amused with the theory of mercury circulating in the system in perfect equilibrium not inclining more to one secretion than to another but it is certain this is a powerful medicine that ought not to be trifled with we cannot say to it  so far shall thou go and no further the most skilful pilot will find it difficult so to trim his vessel that it shall not sink or overturn when too heavily laden with mercury  the ingenious plenck to whom the world is so much indebted for the great improvements he has made by his experiments on mercury and in the cure of this disease says that a salivation is a dangerous practice for the famous astruc says he asserts that there frequently supervene violent fevers diarrhaea dysentery haemoptoe an immobility of the jaws and likewise a suffocation and that too when a salivation has been most properly conducted and after him the most skilful locher tells us the same   several years since a practitioner had the misfortune to lose within a short time of each other two patients with chancres for the cure of which he had raised very high salivations by mercurial ointment just as their complaints were healed and salivation began to decline one of the gentlemen was seized with a dysenteric flux and expired within a few hours his death was attributed to a piece of butter which the nurse had inadvertently put into his gruel the other died also of a flux arising from the sudden descent of the mercury overturning the equilibrium and rushing through the patients bowels with irresistible impetuosity   to form a just idea of a salivation we should perambulate the public hospitals where there are wretches miserable indeed miserable in having a sad disease but much more so in having a cure to encounter which makes the unhappy objects call on death for a deliverance from their pains their head face and tongue so swelled as to forbid their uttering a syllable their cheeks often torn to pieces a salivary flux of two or three quarts a day with breath extremely offensive teeth loose tongue and gums ulcerated and inflamed attended with a severe unremitting headache and this process is the same in all cases and seasons it may truly be said such remedies are worse than the diseases they are intended to remove but this is not all the patient has to undergo add to this frequent severe cholicky pains accompanied with diarrhaea and dysentery which continuing so often prove fatal the patient can swallow no solid food during this severe operation and indeed scarcely liquids and is almost dead with hunger having often an appetite without the possibility of indulging it thus are persons confined for several weeks and when the process is finished they are so reduced in flesh as to be quite a spectacle and frequently go into a deep decline  if these evils may be prevented and that they may we have daily experience added to the strongest testimonies are we not all called upon by every motive of conscience religion and humanity to preserve the unhappy from ruin by rejecting so cruel a practice  graviora morbis patimur remedia nec vita tanti est vivere ut possis mori if the surgeons who superintend the hospitals would make a trial of my method i am convinced from experience they would be able without annoying the stomach to convey any quantity of any mercurial preparation into the system in few hours instead of weeks this may be done by rubbing mercury on the back and middle of the tongue and repeating the process at the shortest intervals there is no occasion to wait for its operation as in the case of pills but we may safely stimulate these surfaces as much and as often as we choose till we have actually produced the desired effect on the system let the mouth be well cleared of the saliva and i know of no other impediment to the success of this process dr home professor of physic at edinburgh has honored me by making a variety of public experiments in the edingburgh infirmary which will soon appear in the doctors intended publication by these experiments it is proved that mercury is more quickly introduced with greater certainty and with less prejudice to the constitution in this way than by any of the other modes of administering it internally or externally  objections to mercury in the form of pills bolus etc with respect to pills it is certain that many patients find a difficulty in taking them first it is hardly possible so to distribute the mercury throughout the mass that there shall not be some difference and uncertainty in the dose when divided into pills and secondly they sometimes pass through the body undissolved when they dissolve they irritate perhaps corrode the stomach an organ most essential to health this circumstance has excited universal complaint and dread of mercury which however being administered in my method is so very mild that it does not in the least impair the constitution as the surface on which the mercury is laid will bear a considerable degree of irritation without any sort of prejudice a grain of mercury applied to the internal surfaces of the mouth is thence absorbed with the greatest facility and operates kindly and with effect on the habit in general dr cullen justly observes lecture on mercury  that when we purge we think we are operating on the common sewer of the system but little advantage is to be found from the mercury employed in this way as its virtues depend chiefly on its operation on the body in general   the saline chrystals of mercury vellicate and twitch the sensible membranes of the stomach to that degree as excites them to an excretion of their contents and glandular juices upwards or downwards according as the force of irritation is greater or less  mead on poisons  of all the various modes of administering mercury that which you recommend seems to me the most safe and i have no doubt but it will likewise be found the most efficacious a false opinion has long prevailed that every medicine ought to be taken into the stomach this has done much mischief many people have such an aversion to medicines of all kinds that they will suffer any thing rather than swallow a single dose others have such a debility of the viscera that though they can swallow mercury yet it tears their stomach and bowels to pieces of this every medical practitioner must have seen many instances there are few persons who have been so unfortunate as to take large quantities of this mineral in the usual way who do not exhibit melancholy proofs of its baneful effects on the stomach and bowels by your mode of administering mercury these effects are obviated while it is much more cleanly and agreeable than the common method of applying it to the skin  extract from dr buchans letter  dr hunter observes that this process is preferable to pills or boluses as the calomel stimulates the primae viae much less and therefore he adds people with very tender bowels may bear it much better in this form than any other therefore it is best for all constitutions as every person has most undoubtedly tender bowels  dr krohn in his letter to me mentions the case of a gentleman who had a virulent chancre on the froenum of which he was cured in a fortnight by this process without the smallest inconvenience on the contrary he found his bowels perfectly free from any attack on them the usual attendants on former methods of treatment which he had frequently experienced previous to this trial  how many originally vigorous deduce their present weak bowels and crazy constitutions from the mischiefs occasioned by the action of the mercury on the primae viae  mr cruikshanks letter  after ample trial of all the different mercurial preparations in common use i find that any of them may be safely and expeditiously conveyed into the system from the surfaces of the mouth and that those of the most subtle and active kind are equal to the cure of the most confirmed disease their stimulating quality supplies the place of friction which is only necessary when any of the milder preparations are employed  objections to mercurial ointment the friction of mercurial ointment is to many people one of the most disagreeable things in the world it is leaden color contrasted with the skin makes it look dirty it has a particularly offensive smell independent of that of the turpentine or balsam of sulphur which may have been employed in extinguishing the quicksilver from the circumstance that half an hours friction or even that of a whole hour if ever so well performed will not commonly effect a total absorption of the ointment the skin is generally left a little smeared with it after the process is over as it is oily it does not evaporate or dry readily and will easily stick to whatever it touches patients are obliged to sleep in flannel drawers to prevent the ointment from getting through and daubing the bed clothes they must be frequently changing these drawers constantly washing the skin or as washing off the ointment would retard rather than forward the cure they must remain dirty for six weeks or perhaps three months together and if by accident any part of the ointment gets upon their linen from it is color it is very apt to give the alarm in families and lead to disagreeable discoveries  mr cruikshanks letter   dr manning in his practice of physic on the subject of my mercurial process observes as follows by this method we not only avoid the inconveniences of unction but the purgative effects that are often produced by mercury when taken into the stomach  with respect to a regimen in the treatment of the lues abstinence and low living certainly retard the cure persons afflicted with this distemper are much subject to despondency and living more freely now than at other times raises the spirits of the patient and contributes to his cure by cooperating with the medicine therefore i shall continue to recommend that practice at the same time should object as strongly as any other practitioner to every indulgence that might be prejudicial it has been said that people under a course of mercury cannot be kept too warm which is true only when the mercury affects the stomach or bowels or greatly opens the pores of the skin but from the very mild operation of mercury on the system in my method patients are exposed to all weathers without injury to the constitution  dr krohn on this subject says this mode agrees better with people who are debauchees having had essential proof of this assertion in a patient who drank all kinds of strong liquors was scarcely ever in bed for a week together till break of day and was much exposed to cold damp air  a recapitulation of objections to the common methods of administering mercury accompanied with some new observations and conveying a short and pointed view of the whole a lues is a venereal infection in the mass of blood and is to be cured by throwing a sufficient quantity of mercury into the system to expel it  there are many ways of conveying mercury into the circulation of the blood  the usual methods are by pills boluses and draughts and also by outward application of mercurial ointment  the first three are conveyed by the mouth into the stomach where the mercurial particles are in part absorbed by the lymphatic vessels of that organ and conveyed into the blood also by the same vessels in the intestines and frequently the greatest portion of the mercury escapes out of the body by this outlet having first irritated the animal economy throughout the whole of the canal  mercury may be prevented from passing downwards by joining opium with it which takes off its stimulus and generally prevents its purgative effects but this often creates sickness and reaching and shakes the whole nervous system  two grains of mercury taken up into the blood by the mouth will produce as powerful an effect on the system as twenty grains thrown into the stomach on the presumption that eighteen of the twenty make their exit downwards we reckon only what gets into the system for what passes through is lost and certainly better had never been given the stomach resembles a sink with a grate in it and is not constructed to retain mercury  mercurial ointment cures by being taken up into the blood by the absorbents of the external skin and when introduced there by operating on the whole vascular system and expelling the venereal poison by the different secretions and excretions of the body  the objections to this mode of practice are first that it is dirty and disagreeable that it is commonly slow and tedious that it requires too much labor for persons in a weak state and if the friction is performed by other hands than their own that one half of the ointment or more must infallibly be lost to the patient and may prove very injurious to the party who applies it  mercurial ointment affects the stomach or bowels and brings on purging insomuch that it is not uncommon for patients both in public and private practice to die under a course of unction of violent cholies accompanied by sanguinary and other fluxes and this happens by the quantity of mercury absorbed proving an overbalance for the constitution  practitioners do not accurately know what quantity of mercury may be given and what quantity of it will take effect as different constitutions require different doses five grains of mercurial ointment will take more effect on one subject than fifty on another after using it ten or fifteen days successively no visible effect may be produced on the constitution yet on the eighteenth or twentieth a salivary flux may commence and continue for a fortnight or three weeks and the patients strength become exhausted at this juncture should a diarrhaea unfortunately take place it carries off the patient in a few hours notwithstanding all the endeavors of the most skilful of the faculty  i have made use of such arguments as have occurred to me in behalf of this new method and have advanced nothing but what my repeated experience does fully warrant if the ideas of other practitioners do not coincide with mine i shall be happy to see their avowed and printed sentiments on this important subject divested of prejudice and delivered with candor  should it be asserted that this method sometimes fails let not that declaration prevent the trying it as this may be urged against all medical practice and often no doubt with the greatest injustice  it is said that this process by shortening the cure and lessening the medicines will diminish the fee the profession need not object to it on that account as they are paid not for their medicine this being no object but for their skill and judgment patients of liberal dispositions will always be pleased with dispatch and make a handsome return and others will find their interest also in behaving in the same equitable manner
