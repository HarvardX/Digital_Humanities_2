of love chloe the following piece peruse with care it of a most delicous country treats nor is it difficult to travel there you may the voyage make between the sheets  a voyage to the island of love it is but just dear bellamour that i should let you hear from me and that after a years absence you should at last be delivered from the uneasiness which the uncertainty of my fate has undoubtedly given you i have seen abundance of the world since my leaving you but am not sure whether in my present condition i shall have resolution enough to give you any tolerable account of my travels it is adding to my present affliction to call to mind my past sorrows and it is increasing my present pain making my old wounds bleed asresh to take a survey even in imagination of those pleasures whereof nothing now is remaining but cruel remembrance i believe however that it will be no small consolation to me to communicate to one of my best friends both my past pleasures and afflictions complaining is some ease to a person in misery i shall forget my sorrows whilst i am relating my adventures and for a moment make a truce with my heartbreaking anguish  it is now about a year as you may remember since i embarked on the wide ocean with several other persons of all ages and conditions but most of them very giddyheaded in search of a delicious country named pleasure whereof we had all of us heard a most enchanting description charmed with the thoughts of the delights we were there to enjoy we sailed for some days peaceably and nothing was to be heard but mirth and gayety from one end of the vessel to the other when pretty near an island where we intended to have taken in resreshments there arose so surious a tempest and the wind was so boisterous that in spite of the utmost skill and endeavors of the pilot it drove us with violence to a coast quite opposite to that to which we were bound in this condition we were tossed up and down between four and five days after which the weather began to clear up the sun shone out with greater luster than ever and we found our selves not far off of a beautiful island which seemed almost covered with the most delightful gardens or rather which seemed one continued garden and a second terrestrial paradise ravished with the numberless beauties which every where offered themselves to our eye we were all curious to know the name of that inviting country imagining it that to which we were bound and that the pilot had put an agreeable cheat upon us when he informed us that we had been driven so far out of our way but there happened to be a man on board the ship who undeceived us having before made the tour of the island accordingly he gave us the following information  this charming isle which ravishes the sight is sacred to the god of soft desires who to all mankinds homage claims a right and every breast inflames with amorous fires none scape his power all feel the tingling dart the young the old the monarch and the slave who is exempt therefrom that has a heart the weak the strong the coward or the brave once in their lives here all a visit make and quit their home to see this happy isle here their most ardent wishes center take dependent on the fair ones frown or smile ten thousand different ways you here may land no winds amiss to bring you into port no chains no guards to bar the entrance stand all sides lie open for a free resort the agreeables the beauties graces charms have all the ports committed to their care and making use of love s resistless arms let fly at all and not a heart they spare whilst this man was giving us this information we still drew nearer and nearer to the island till by that time he had made an end we were come so nigh that we could distinguish every object  here the still ocean quiet flows as the least crystal purling streams no wind but the soft zephyr blows and over the level surface skims whose pleasing murmurs whilst you hear in sporting with the wanton seas that natures self did sleep you would swear and therefore left the world at peace a thousand flowers along the shore the pink the lilly and the rose with pleasure vye their beauteous store yet the least wonders there disclose in effect all along the shore one sees an infinite number of things that create admiration all the beauties and graces all that is agreeable and charming is perpetually to be beheld there but what surprised me the most was to observe both the old and the ugly in company with the agreeables i could not forbear expressing my astonishment thereat whereupon the same man who had given us the abovementioned information instructed me farther as follows  love with his darts does every mortal wound and as he is the most powerful of kings that on earth in sea or in heaven is found by various means all in subjection brings thus it is that he to aggravate the pains of those who insolent his power deride makes them of worthless objects wear the chains and tremble at that god they once defied whilst he was thus instructing me i was wholly taken up with gazing with an attention that is not usual with me upon a young lady who was walking upon the sea shore she was in the midst of the beauties and graces and eclipsed their brightness by the luster of her charms i must own to you that she gained a conquest over me at first sight  for all the various charms that can adorn a blooming virgin in her person met a milkwhite skin cheeks rosy as the morn a mouth with even rows of ivory set lips coral red and suing to be pressed eyes that would stir an anchorets desire a faultless shape imagine all the rest then say who would not at her feet expire in the mean while ten or a dozen little boats loosed from the shore these boats were all embellished with the most beauteous flowers and their cordage was of silk of a hundred different colors several little cupids were the rowers to conduct these boats whilst numberless zephyrs flying round them and fanning the flowers continually with their gentle breezes filled the air with an agreeable odor and at the same time wafted the little fleet to us in peace  when they were come up with our vessel we were entertained with an admirable concert of music wherein some exquisite fine voices sung as follows  ye mortals who inflamed with amorous fires would of this life the choicest pleasures prove come to our isle and there have your desires there is no solid pleasure without love at the same time the zephyrs hovering around us stretched out their hands and with a sweet smile seemed to invite us to accompany them all these surprising wonders had charmed me to such a degree that i was no longer master of myself that enchanting beauty whom i had seen and whom i burnt with impatience of rejoining with somewhat i know not what that seized my heart at the same instant made me resolve to go ashore upon the island accordingly i held out my hands and the zephyrs took me up and carried me into a boat where the little cupids received me with a thousand demonstrations of kindness  there were several in our vessel who followed my example but there were others likewise who stayed behind and laughed at us insomuch that i was astonished at their inflexibility when they cried after us jearing  go giddy heads those real pleasures taste which in love s vanities are to be found you will tell your thoughts thereof when once they are past if ever you scape from that enchanted ground in the mean while we made the best of our way accompanied with consorts of music and covered with flowers and in a little while we got safe ashore  soon as one lands a goddess charming fair the mistress of the prudent and discreet reason whose eyes so bright and piercing are obstructs our passing on and cries retreat but oh the dazzled sense denies its aid and hides her beauteous features from our eyes till left amidst her foes the charming maid finds that no man in love was ever wise accordingly i went on without minding her preaching and ran full of impatience toward the place where i had seen the enchanting creature who had induced me to land in that country but just as i approached her a man whom i saw near her struck a terror into me with a single look he was tall and of a good mein but very grave and serious his eyes were very modest and his aspect very submissive and when he looked upon me he held his finger upon his mouth like the figure of the god silence a young maiden accompanied him who trod in his very steps and mimickd his every action and gesture looking at every turn round about her to see if she was observed a little love who from that time devoted himself to my service to bear me company in my travels and to instruct me gave me the following information  he whom you there behold with looks severe is called respect and is the child of love got on esteem great is his credit here him therefore court if you would successful prove they who neglect to follow his advice are very seldom favorites with the fair to buy his friendship silence is the price and even the language of the eyes forbear she who so constant on his steps does wait is called precaution circumspect and wise of discreet love thinseparable mate in love one must have every way ones eyes being instructed by such a good master i paid great civility to respect and precaution and desired their friendship which they both granted me with a very good grace this done i advanced trembling toward the fair one who had charmed me and begged her to do me the honor to let me hand her which she granted with haughtiness enough and after having talked for some time about things indifferent she left me and went her way  as night drew on love conducted me to a little village that was very near where i had a very sorry lodging this village is called anxiety from the name of the lady of the manor to whom we made a visit it is hardly possible to give you a tolerable description of this woman for she cannot sit one moment in the same place or posture one minute she is standing another minute she lies down sometimes she walks a snails pace at another time she runs so swift it is impossible to keep up with her she never sleeps which makes her very lean and hagged then she is very negligent of herself having her hair always dishevelled and in terrible disorder but especially about her forehead by reason she is osten rubbing it after having paid my respects to her whereof she took no manner of notice i went to my lodging and laid me down upon a bed but could get no rest the beautiful charmer being always present in my thought which caused me to make the following reflection  my words disjointed are and wild continual sighs break off my speech i am of my liberty beguiled and reasons aid in vain beseech has not zelinda charming queen bound my heart captive in her chains ever i her beauteous face had seen i never felt such cruel pains next morning i arose very early and love conducted me to another village whose name is courtship it is very different from anxiety being in my opinion one of the most agreeable places in the whole country  there one may tender lovers see in crowds flock thither every day near the object of their vows to be and with them sport the time away there every house is decked with flowers all seems magnificent and gay in feasts and balls they spend the hours and care and sorrow put away all vice is likewise banished thence nor suffered in this blessed retreat even misers lavish there their pence blessed if therewith a smile they get nay the most froward mortals strive themselves agreeable to make and the most stupid sotts alive learn wit and off their folly shake the pensive too no longer dumb finds there a tongue and talks with ease in short there is none who thither come but study all they can to please in effect there is nothing to be seen there but continual gallantry neatness magnificence complaisancy and good humor reside there perpetually in short every thing there is done with the best grace in the world  as soon as i arrived there i found myself in the most complaisant humor imaginable besides which nothing could be more ingenious at inventing new pleasures to divert zelinda with this design after having dressed myself very genteelly love conducted me to visit her better satisfied with myself than i had ever before been in my life but we were forced at night to return and lie at anxiety because there is no lodging to be had at courtship insomuch that i passed that night again very disagreeably through my impatience to see zelinda and enjoyed but one hours sound repose wherein my sleeping fancy entertained me with a dream that was perfectly agreeable  methought i saw my charming dear within my arms expiring lie but she revived more killing fair so sweet the death was she did dye methought i saw a while overcast the wonted luster of her eyes till languishing she sunk at last upon my breast in ecstasies but on my waking i perceived twas all a fleeting dream no more and grieved in sleep to be deceived to wake more wretched than before i returned early next morning to courtship where i was daily better and better treated by zelinda insomuch that the nights which i was forced to pass at anxiety gave me very little disquiet but after some time having done all that lay in my power to appear agreeable in zelindas eyes she went one day to another village which is called good reception from the name of the lord of the manor who is the most obliging and most complaisant man in the world he is mighty easy of access and receives every body very well the inhabitants of the place are likewise mighty civil and zelinda being willing to be conformable after the example of others treated me very obligingly and gave me room to imagine by her behavior that she was not at all displeased at the sight of me  hereupon love conducted me to hope where i took up my lodging it being a large and beautiful city vastly populous by reason of the daily arrival of thousands who flock thither from all parts nevertheless the greatest part of this city is built upon sand and without any foundation which makes it very often fall to ruin but the other part stands upon a pretty good foundation for which reason it has almost always continued in its first state this whole city is situated upon the river pretensions which takes its rise from a mountain of the same name bordering upon hope this river is perfectly pleasant but it is dangerous imbarking thereon which is the very reason why the houses built upon its banks are generally thrown down but whilst they remain standing the finest palaces dont equal them for beauty of their prospect  this pleasant river is famous for the ruin of diverse illustrious persons nevertheless i was tempted to bathe myself therein and love would have let me plunge in inconsiderately enough when i met respect followed by precaution who stopped me by the arm and told me that it was the ready way to ruin me and that i ought to be contented with continuing in hope without going to expose myself in the dangerous river pretensions  hereupon i thanked him for his good advice and took a walk toward that part of the town which is farthest from the river there it is that the palace of the princess hope stands who is reckoned the oracle of the island of love although it is not very safe relying upon what she says for  fair promises she always makes which promises full often she breaks in love to persevere decoys and buoys us up with promised joys nay often bids those wretches live who the next hour their doom receive by entering her palace one meets the thoughts which are always upon the wing and fly sometimes high sometimes low and sometimes in the middle of the air according as the fancy takes them for my part i happened upon such as were discreet enough for they always kept an even flight i went afterward to see the princess hope who is actually a very amiable lady she has a perpetual smile in her countenance and a most sweet and most engaging look one is never tired of her company she comforts the most afflicted animates the courage of the proud and flatters agreeably those who are not unreasonable in their desires when i went to pay her my respects two men entered her apartment at the same time with me one whereof had placed his affections on one so much his superior that he durst not promise himself any good issue from his passion and the other who was in the same case hoped for all things from his good fortune i must own i could not help admiring the artful address of the princess in comforting one and animating the other to the first she said  time and respect overcome all obstacles and love unshaken may do miracles and turning to the other said  it is great and glorious sure she cried tabase a haughty beautys pride and when you make the attempt in vain it is great by death to end your pain as for my part when i had told my case as she found me not to be unreasonable she said  you all may hope for from your prudent love and the fair one day will your flames approve although i very well knew that she constantly flattered every body i could not help being delighted with her answer and it left such a pleasing impression upon my mind that i rested better that night than i had done some time before and the next morning love would have conducted me to declaration but as we were on the way thither we were again met by respect who was very much out of humor and told me that i ought not to be in such posthaste he even reprimanded love pretty sharply which the little tyrant not being able to bear with any manner of patience cried out in a great passion  what always sigh and bear eternal pains always love on and wear a tyrants chains perhaps too dye at last and yet not dare at the last gasp ones sufferings to declare or know when a poor wretch expiring lies if she who caused his death will with him sympathize must one to happy be the venture run whether the cruel fair ever life be gone laying aside her haughtiness will deign to take some pity and to end his pain and not consider it may be too late and culprit first may have resigned to fate hereupon respect told him that should not be my case and that if i would be advised by him my passion should be soon known without going to declaration that as for the rest i should always find zelinda at the place to which he would conduct me whereas she would perhaps stay but one day at declaration after which i should never see her more i suffered myself to be prevailed on by these reasons notwithstanding all that love could urge to the contrary and went with him to a strong fortress whereof he is governor it is a citadel well fortified with several impregnable bastions whose walls are so high that the eye cannot reach the top of them and so strong and so thick that it is impossible to shake them  modesty silence and secresy guard the only gate there is to this fortress which nevertheless is but a very little wicket modesty is a woman of great gravity but without affecting to appear so her eyes have a resolute look accompanied with a great deal of reservedness and she goes always very plainly dressed having her arms and her neck continually covered up very close so as not to be seen by any one especially any men silence exactly resembles the pictures you have seen of him having a sullen look with his eyes and holding always one finger upon his mouth as for secresy he is hardly ever to be seen keeping himself generally concealed in an obscure corner whence he never stirs out but when it is very seasonable and if he speaks sometimes it is very low and in a whisper but he has excellent parts and his sagacity is so great that he understands every body at the least sign in the world he entered this citadel in the retinue of respect without speaking a word and almost by stealth and we saw that  in close retirement lives each family and all is done with the utmost privacy no balls or serenades alarm the ear nor in the streets any but at night appear all persons there their own affairs attend without intrusting confident or friend there lovers seldom meet but keep away forced a constraint on their desires to lay there they must suffer yet not dare complain though then oppressed with the most cruel pain this is the school where lovers learn to try the soft persuesive language of the eye that silent language which so well imparts the inmost thoughts and wishes of our hearts which without speaking can the mind explain and tell us all its joy and all its pain this citadel is called discretion from the name of the daughter of respect whom he has made his deputy and who commands the fortress under him she is a lady of great beauty though not of the sort that pleases at first sight but they who are used to her company are very fond of her conversation her eyes are inexpressibly piercing and lively insomuch that when they please they can make themselves understood by every body and she has the look of a person of the greatest modesty and reservedness through which nevertheless one may discover abundance of address and wit which she never fails to make use of whenever she sees occasion  after paying my respects to her i inquired artfully where zelinda lodged which when i was informed i took up my quarters in a house that was a good distance from thence and even when i chanced to meet her all my discourse was upon subjects quite different from love thus did i continue a considerable time in the citadel leading a very miserable life and holding no correspondence with any  with falling tears my cheeks i stained with grief and anguish worn away till but a skeleton remained of strephon once so blithe and gay yet i never let zelinda hear my groans or in the least complain but waited with respect and fear till she or death should end my pain the little love my companion and instructor took compassion on me and would have left me but i expressed such a value and so much kindness for him that he could not resolve absolutely upon it  after some time i became yet more miserable than ever for zelinda having discovered my love by my actions removed from thence and took up her abode in the cave of cruelty this cave is in the hole of a rock so steep and rugged that it is very difficult to ascend it the entrance is forbidden to all lovers for which reason there is a strong guard of tigers placed at the mouth to prevent their getting in i would have stopped zelinda just as she was upon the point of entering but was hindred by a woman of the largest size who was very ugly and had a savage look her eyes sticks out of her head she has great lean long arms with prodigious long nails like eagles talons treats every body with a great deal of haughtiness and contempt and takes a pleasure in torm enting all who approach her in short one only of her looks is enough to cause despair  her name is cruelty loves deadly foe whose sole delights in misery and woe a hideous monster dreadful to the sight from whom one single look the boldest would affright yet is she joined so it is decreed by fate to youth and beauty as their constant mate for my part i was struck with such a terror on her first approach that not being able to support her looks i withdrew hastily and went to the side of a large torrent which falls with violence from the top of the rock  from lovers eyes this torrent takes its source whose streaming tears its rapid channel fill and down the rock precipitates its course whilst with its fall resounds each neighboring hill its flowing streams soften the hardest stone its plaintive murmurs fill the woods around stern cruelty remains unmoved alone whilst trees and rocks are melted with the sound this torrent is surrounded by a very thick and gloomy forest whose trees all bear the marks of some disconsolate lover their bark being all full of their melancholy stones and complaints the whole forest resounds with nothing but cries and reproaches and that talkative nymph echo repeats nothing but mournful and lamentable expostulations in short one hears nothing but death talked of in this dismal place it was there that despairing of being ever able to draw zelinda out of the arms of cruelty i frequently cried out  alas zelinda cruel and severe will not death at least draw from your eyes a tear these woods and rocks are softened with my grief and had they power would give me some relief but you zelinda cruel beauteous fair cause all my woes yet leave me to despair thus did i make all the neighboring echoes resound with my complaints never having any rest nor ceasing from shedding floods of tears my usual employment was to walk round the rock where i sometimes met zelinda but she was always in company with cruelty whom i endeavored in vain to mollify by all manner of submissions at last one day when i was in a more despairing temper of mind than i had ever been before love conducted me to the side of a certain lake  despair s dire lake where nymphs and swains forlorn cease to be objects of their victors scorn hopeless to be beloved worn out with pain and having languishd months and years in vain finding their loves inexorable quite and liftless without them to bear the light thither they come resolved to end the strife and put an end at once to love and life birds of ill omen hover in the air and by their croaking noise inspire despair whilst thousands of wild swans a consort make and sing their mournful dirges on the lake whose plaintive harmony and dying strains seem to lament the expiring lovers pains several disconsolate lovers walk along the sides of the lake and i saw some who threw themselves into it headlong i was once tempted to do the same but before i attempted to put the desperate design in execution a design to which nature is always repugnant i imagined it better upon second thoughts to endeavor once more to mollify zelinda and that monster cruelty to this purpose i went and laid myself at the entrance of the cave with a firm resolution never to stir from thence till i should see zelinda come out there it was that by a flood of tears and innumerable heartbreaking sighs i made my complaints heard even to the bottom of the cave for which i was frequently very ill used by cruelty in short i believe i should at last have sunk under my pains if love had not given me a piece of very wholesome counsel which saved my life one day when i was swallowed up with grief i saw a very agreeable maiden pass by me who shed tears as she looked upon me and seemed by her countenance to bestow those tears upon my misfortunes  alas she seemed to say unhappy swain how do i pity all thy grief and pain thy tender passion and thy ardent love deserved not that thy fair should cruel prove i thought myself so much obliged to this maiden that i asked her name and love told me that it was pity who used frequently to come thus and endeavor to oblige some unfortunate lover and that if she would espouse my cause she would certainly engage zelinda to come out of the cave of cruelty  in order to follow his counsel i endeavored to prevail upon pity by letting her know my deplorable condition which she was so much moved with that she promised to use her utmost efforts to assist me accordingly it was not long before she made me sensible of the good effects of her promises for taking a turn round the rock she at last discovered zelinda and with tears in her eyes gave her an account of my melancholy condition and that in such moving language that it drew likewise tears from the beauteous eyes of the inhuman fair one pity finding she had moved her compassion conducted her to the place where i lay and showed her the miserable state to which she had reduced me zelinda could not help being sensibly affected with the melancholy sight and accordingly not only began to give ear to my amorous reproaches but approved thereof and at last resolved to put an end to them cruelty who was informed of her design would have prevented it but pity thrust her back very roughly and restored zelinda to me who raising me up said  strephon at length thy passion i approve thank pity here the beauteous child of love her words have forced their passage to my breast and me with tender thoughts of thee possessed live then i give thee leave fond strephon live and with this pleasing hope thy heart revive that with thy passion won i shall one day with endless love thy constancy repay it is impossible to express the joy i felt at these words i saw myself in a moment from the most miserable of mankind become the happiest mortal in the universe insomuch that in my raptures i cried out  rejoice my heart zelinda is appeased no longer think then on thy sufferings past but prize that life wherewith she is not displeased and think what joys may crown it at the last when on the dreadful brink of death thou stoodst her beauteous hand upraisd thee from the grave in common justice then my heart thou shoudst devote to her that life which she did save behold me then more happy than i ever durst have hoped to have been insomuch that i blessed a thousand times a day all the pains i had suffered and they vanished from my thoughts in a moment  but pity did not rest contented with bringing zelinda out of that disagreeable abode she likewise carried her on to confidence and then left us to go and assist some other lover in distress i conjured her however at parting to remember that i should always stand in need of her good offices whereupon she promised me her assistance in case of necessity and which was more committed us into the hands of confidence who owned the village where she took leave of us  this village properly speaking is but a pleasurehouse but the most agreeable in my opinion in the whole island as to confidence she is a maiden lady who has an open frank look insomuch that one may read the inmost recesses of her heart and not be mistaken in ones sentiments she is of the most even temper in the world always the same and there is no manner of restraint but every one enjoys full liberty in her house there it is that lovers keep their rendezvous in little winding groves whose avenues are very secret and where they are not disturbed  there it is that they have the pleasure of talking with each other the whole day without being tired and there it is that they see each other every hour and yet think they dont see each other enough there they enjoy each others conversation in private and have the pleasing satisfaction of seeking a thousand different ways of seeing or talking to each other by stealth billetdoux also pass there between each other very frequently in short i spent very many happy days there and indeed the happiest of my life for i was continually with zelinda she told me all her thoughts and i did not conceal from her any of mine  what pleasures past expressing i possessed how was my soul with rapturous transports blessed how sweetly had i past lifes irksome stage free from those passions that within me rage had my desires but moderation known and i contented pressed no farther on i met zelinda wheresoeer i went and spoke my mind to her without restraint all the proofs of friendship that could be desired and even some testimonies of affection i easily obtained after some few entreaties in short i lived the most agreeable life in the world if i could have been satisfied with it but love perpetually urged me to carry her to his temple and i was always sure of being out of her favor whenever i proposed to her to go thither  at last however after many fruitless entreaties we went together from the village of confidence but were hardly got out of it when a man who seemed to be a person of authority met us directly and with a strong arm took zelinda with violence from me notwithstanding his incivility i could not help respecting him and as i would have appeased him without designing to look upon me he led zelinda a quite contrary way and all she could do was to cry out  strephon farewell i dare no longer stay duty against my will drags me away yet live however better days await and keep thy faith to me inviolate i remained immovable at this sight and saw her go away without speaking one word however after some hesitation my first resolution was to run after her and wrest her from the arms of duty by main force but respect and precaution who happened to come by very seasonably prevented me this accidental meeting angered me at the first but i had always reaped so much benefit by their advice that i was resolved still to follow it  hereupon i retired to a neighboring desert which seemed agreeable to my humor iis a large valley surrounded with several mountains and very remote from all manner of correspondence where there is a castle situated in the midst of a great wood which is the continual abode of a melancholy female called absence she is very seldom to be seen having her eyes always drowned in tears and being consequently very much dejected and disfigured she is always in mourning and perpetually accompanied by thoughtfulness who is also mighty lean never fixing her eyes long upon any single object but looking upon every thing and yet seeing nothing she takes no notice nor gives the least attention to any thing neither does she ever speak but quite foreign to the purpose and hardly ever gives an answer to what is asked of her in short she seems to be collected within herself and to love no company but her own the fall of waters and their soft murmers and the singing of birds are her ordinary diversions hereupon i entered into a strict friendship with her and conformed myself entirely to her manner of living retiring with my sorrows to the greatest solitudes and conversing alone in the same manner as she with the woods the brooks the echoes and the springs  in the mean while i suffered a thousand afflicting torments having always a longing desire to see zelinda and not being able to satisfy that desire what i thought most grievous of all in that place was that the time is longer than in any other place in the world the moments being hours the hours days and the days years besides this one meets every where with troubles which are great gigantick mortals of a very disagreeable aspect and they are so numerous that there is no avoiding them at last being weary of living in such cruel torment and ready to sink under it i composed the following verses  it is then decreed above that i must dye my deadly pains admit no remedy and what is in vain applied to give me ease but more exasperates the fierce disease thy shortlived pleasures all my soul are dead zelinda is for ever from thee fled then cease to murmur longer and repine and losing her thy hated life resign far from the fair who was my sole delight far from those eyes which only charmed my sight by various passions tossed my wounded soul to each is made a prey without control of my once pleasing flame naught now remains but cutting sorrows and heartwounding pains till my sad days in deadly langour passed quite sink me down in endless night at last absence does still a cure effectual prove for the soulvexing memory of ones love but woe is me to quench my raging flame in vain i court the melancholy dame true from zelinda s love sheas banished me and from her pleasing talk and company but her bright charms whose power too well i know are ever present to increase my woe thus i experienced the cruel pains which absence makes poor lovers suffer and had no other comfort but some letters which love found the means to get conveyed to me nevertheless i should not have lived long if zelindas having at last got free from duty had not recalled me from my exile this made me in a moment forget all my past pains and run to see her again with all the impatience of an ardent lover but i was not much happier for the change of my condition for i found her in a place where no one yet ever enjoyed any repose  there all are upon groundless quarrels bent and duelling is hourly their intent fully resolved their fancied foes to end without respecting brother prince or friend there rage suspicion anger envy shed their dangerous poison upon every head till by their own or other hands to fall all seek for fraud and horror reigns over all this place is called the rivals whither i was no sooner come but i saw several persons about zelinda who reddend with anger on seeing me and prevented my speaking to her i felt within myself a secret hatred and aversion to them all and a little after thinking that zelinda looked upon them too kindly i suffered myself to be conducted by love to the palace of jealousy which is adjacent to the rivals  this palace is yet a much more disagreeable place than any of the rest for even absence and cruelty dont make one suffer half the ills that one suffers in jealousy continual winds rains and tempests render this a very unpleasant place to reside in the thunder growls there perpetually over ones head and the sky is very dark and multiplies every object the least shadow strikes one there with terror and the whole place is full of precipices where people are often lost by reason of the darkness that reigns throughout the whole  at the entrance of this palace we meet with passion idle fancies and perturbation of mind which bewitch the eyes in such a manner that one sees every thing the wrong way passion is always in a fury without knowing any reason why speaks very precipitately and says every thing unreasonably and without any order or connection perturbation of mind is startled and disturbed at the least thing in the world and is astonished at a mere nothing and idle fancies are always creating their own misfortunes because they form to themselves vain phantoms which prove their own torment all these persons at my entrance made me take a certain draught which transformed me into quite another man than i was before  suspicious hot and diffident i grew to me my heat seemed reasonable too my self my self tormented to my shame till every object troublesome became in this miserable state i went to visit jealousy who is very ugly and very lean besides her being covered with serpents which are perpetually gnawing her entrails her look is full of horror and she sees not any thing which she does not envy as soon as i entered the room where she was she threw one of her serpents at me which in the fury i was then in exasperated me yet ten times more insomuch that i ran up and down every where without knowing whither i was going or to what end when i met zelinda in company i durst not approach her and trembled in my very soul but then i endeavored to overhear what was said to her and her answers and i wrested every word she spoke to such a sense as might torment my self when any one whispered her i turned as pale as death immediately and interpreted the least action and the least gesture in favor of others and when i did not see her i imagined her in the arms of some happier rival if she was alone i fancied she was waiting for some body in short in my phrenzy i was jealous of every thing i saw and even of things inanimate  ye trees and flowers i in my transports cried where does zelinda from her strephon hide you are the confidents of all her cares with you she spends whole days whilst i am in tears woe is me wretched man if my ingrate had to me kept her faith inviolate why does she more delight in you than me and why for yours avoid my company in the mean while zelinda who saw my weakness did but smile at it at the beginning but afterward she resented it highly and then it was that i became acquainted with a man who would have cured me both of my love and jealousy at the same time his name was spite  the mortal enemy of pain who when he is ill used by the fair dont whining stand and sue in vain or give himself up to despair but armed with a resentment brave he wisely makes a quick retreat and often does a lover save from an entire and sad defeat stung with the falsehood of my fair no more to love a vow i made and spite so far prevailed i swear that three whole days from her i staid but grief and care still stuck so close and over my soul had so much power to dye her slave i rather chose than cease so many charms to adore i returned then with more violence than ever to my jealous suspicions but after a considerable time zelinda grew weary of seeing me in so deplorable a condition and pity who had promised me her assistance in case of necessity was as good as her word and removed from zelinda every object that might give me any vexation and brought me away with much difficulty from a place so disagreeable zelinda too undeceived me as i came out and convinced me of all my faults and mistakes upon which i fell at her feet and asking her a thousand pardons cried  with scorn and rigor arm your eyes be haughty cruel and severe if anger in my breast arise i will stifle it and keep it there no no whatever pains i bear though grief be painted in my eyes never shall my heart rebellious dare repine or say you tyrannize perhaps i languishing may mourn and beg you not to be severe but should my breast with anger burn i will stifle it and keep it there nevertheless zelinda did not immediately seal my pardon it was even with some difficulty that she brought herself to support my presence since i had been capable of so much weakness whereupon i endeavored to appease her by saying  think think how cutting is the grief when galled by a proud beautys chain to see the cruel lovely thief does only laugh at all our pain think that a lover can not live unless he sees whom he adores and give me hopes your heart forgives and me to favor once restores since though i have lightly been to blame and grossly wronged my charming fair enough i have attond the same by my sad suffering and despair at last my tears and entreaties together with the natural inclination she had for me as she had confessed to me at confidence prevailed on her to receive me again into favor in short after many difficulties we arrived at the metropolis of the kingdom of love which is called after the name of the island and where the court is kept which is beyond expression splendid and agreeable being composed of all sorts of nations ranks and degrees kings princes and subjects notwithstanding which no one there is a greater man than another  this city is very large and every thing there is in confusion persons of merit are joined there very often with those who have none and such as are handsome frequently leave all for those that are homely which sufficiently shows that the god who presides there is blind in the middle of the city is a very famous temple which is older than the world for love was there when he unravelled the chaos this temple is very spacious notwithstanding which it is hardly large enough to receive all the sacrifices that are offered up there every day  we went thither also to offer up our sacrifices according to custom and on our entrance were obliged to deliver up the victims which were our hearts zelinda still made some difficulty of parting with hers but desire at last snatched it away not without some little violence our hearts then were offered up in sacrifices to love and the flame which burnt them did not consume them insomuch that after the sacrifice we found them still both entire but burning  and which perhaps may seem most strange we of our hearts made an exchange zelinda seizing first on mine did thereby here is to me resign thus i of here is became possessed and treasured it up in my breast behold me then arrived at the height of all my wishes i continued therefore some time in the city enjoying all the pleasures whereof man is capable in being tenderly beloved that is to say  i was her sole delight with me she always could have wished to be in all my griefs still bore a share and my least hurt made her despair but this was not enough for me i was still dissatisfied for i was bent upon carrying her to the palace of true pleasure which is the countryseat where love goes to visit psyche and with that design i was conducting her that way when we met the most troublesome mortal in the world  pleasures great enemy and foe professed who still the fondest lovers does molest who over the passions bears impetuous sway and with loves soft desires cannot away numbers infatuated swell his train charmed with his empty maxims to their pain which all our pleasures criminal esteem and the least liberties reproachful deem this numerous company which attended him were very much out of order being all sickly women who could not keep up with him without great difficulties love which has taken entire possession of all the faculties of their soul makes them hourly languish and pine away till they are as lean as skeletons whilst their dying eyes betray their hearts and make it visible to every one that the little god in spite of all their resistance maintains his empire there  this mortal in one word was honor and was accompanied with shamefacedness of whom i can give you no tolerable description because she has always a vail over her face and will not discover herself to any one these two then having stopped zelinda said a thousand sine things to her which seemed very ridiculous to me but were not esteemed so by zelinda for as soon as she heard them she resolved to be advised by them at which new way of behavior i was very much astonished and immediately cried out  mourn mourn my eyes mourn your unhappy fate mourn your disgrace as unforeseen as great your sight zelinda will no longer bear but has resumed her heart and leaves you to despair if you are blessed when in her eyes you look if pleasure in her company you took weep weep my eyes with floods of tears run over those happy days you never will see more nevertheless i conjured love to use his utmost endeavors to recall her and he took so much pains therein that at last he succeeded and we pursued our journey to the palace of true pleasure we were not very far from thence when we met with respect and precaution but respect no longer looked so grave and austere on the contrary he had a very gallant and graceful air and his countenance was full of smiles neither did precaution stand so much upon ceremonies and respect said to us with a smile  go perfect lovers go feast every sense and of your loves reap the sweet recompense my presence now is of no use to you i have with your secret pleasures naught to do this said he embraced me and left me and he was but just gone when i saw a very handsome woman stark naked running to us very swift with her hair hanging all over her face before and quite bald behind there were several persons there some of which quite neglected her and the others ran after her very faintheartedly notwithstanding which they all seemed very much vexed at their having suffered her to pass by them hereupon love as soon as he saw her told me that it was opportunity and that she only had interest enough to procure me entrance into the palace of true pleasure wherefore i must not let her escape me because one could not be certain ever to find her again in obedience to his advice therefore i ran to meet her and stopped her and she brought zelinda to a resolution of going into the palace where we at last arrived with the greatest satisfaction in the world for it is actually a most enchanting place  there an eternal spring is seen and the azure sky is still serene a thousand roses hourly blow each moment does fresh wonders show the trees with fruit oerloaden stand and seem to court the gathrers hand each field is dressed in lively green around a thousand caves are seen with bows entwined all shaded over lest prying eyes should ought explore where lovers pass each gladsome day in amorous sports and wanton play these lonesome caves time out of mind have sacred been to love we find nature herself the branches wove the kind receptacles of love whereall the little feathered quire pleased with their mates in pairs retire and make the hills and dales around with love inspiring songs resound and others to excite the love themselves the pleasing lesson prove a thousand little rivlets there with their soft murmurs fill the air whilst kindly the still nights conspire to add fresh fuel to love s fire there lovers never are heard complain of their fairs rigor or disdain but after many troubles past joys even beyond their wishes taste why say i more since all that ever this world produced or great or fair have there love s pleasing passion tried and in their lovers arms have died i must own to you that one is very happy in that place as for my part when i considered that i was arrived at the height of all my wishes i thought i could never be sufficiently satisfied with my good fortune but my happiness was too great to be lasting accordingly i soon saw the end of it as you will observe but some days before as i was walking i met with a maiden who was but homely but who was nevertheless very affected and never satisfied with any thing she has no settled abode because she takes no care to provide herself of any one even the most agreeable things being irksome to her her name is coldness  she has a great power in the isle of love for they who will hearken to her counsel soon leave it without any trouble or regret for she conducts them to the bay of disgust where there are but too many vessels ready to carry one away i saw several who went along with her but i thought her so homely and so unreasonable that i would not stay one moment with her but returned to the palace of true pleasure where some days after i met with a misfortune which still makes a deep impression upon me and which i never expect to see an end of  one morning in the midst of all my pleasures i saw a man who came saucily to interrupt them his mien was majestic and independent and his look haughty and by his eyes and the whole air of his face one might see that he was one that was absolute and knew not what it was to obey in a word it was destiny whose decrees are irrevocable who forced zelinda from my arms all my efforts to detain her were in vain he took her away and carried her i know not whither for i have not been able to hear of her since  hereupon i immediately left the palace of true pleasure which seemed disagreeable to me since zelinda was no longer there and retired to the place where i now am and where i believe i shall pass those few remaining days which my sorrows will allow me i am here upon the top of a mountain called the desert of remembrance its solitude is very agreeable but what is very vexatious is that the place is so high that it overlooks the whole island of love insomuch that one has always ones misfortune before ones eyes and cannot help seeing the places through which one has passed and this it is that makes me miserable for which way soever i turn i find always some objects which recall my past happiness to my remembrance  i have now languishd here for some time and at last considered that you would have some reason to complain of me dear bellamour if i did not let you hear from me before my death farewell mourn my misfortune perhaps you may one day stand in need of the same consolation  finis a map of the island of marriage the country which i am going to describe to you is an island of a vast extent and indisputably the most populous of any country in the universe there is no possibility of entering it but in couples a man and a woman whence it happens that there is always an equal number of both sexes therein for no sooner has any one set his foot in it but there is a strong guard placed continually at the mouths of the harbors which prevents all persons whatsoever from stirring from thence but on condition of having their partners carried to the grave and being themselves transported to the peninsula of widowhood which is at one of the ends of the island  nor is this precaution needless for were it not for these guards this island as populous as it is would soon be a mere desert for notwithstanding thousands of strangers are flocking thither every day from all parts being induced thereunto by the spirit of curiosity the first ruin of mankind it is very certain that most of the inhabitants would soon swarm out again by millions did not these numerous guards render it impracticable  there is no way to arrive at this vast region but by two ports the one whereof is called interest and the other love the first of these is a trading port full of immense riches where fathers and mothers keep a perpetual fair to put off their daughters who are set out for sale in their warehouses and are disposed of for good round sums in ready money but there is one thing very particular in the way of trading of these gentry for whereas other dealers expect money in return for their goods these give a handsome price to those who will take their merchandise off their hands the port of interest is open on all sides and one may enter it with any wind  the other is a most agreeable port abounding with all imaginable pleasures the people live there in a perpetual spring and the trees which are ever green are always full of birds which make the air resound with their love inspiring harmony the only wind that carries into this port is a gentle gale called sighs and one always enters therein with delight but very often before one can get in there arises sudden hurricanes which come from the high mountain of parents drive the vessels back into open sea and prevent their putting into port nevertheless when the abovementioned gale is good and perseveres constantly in blowing from the region of sighs it seldom fails of getting the better of these hurricanes and bringing passengers safe into harbor  when one comes first within sight of this island and takes a view of it afar off before ones entering the port nothing can seem either more inviting or more agreeable one is entertained on all sides with enchanting prospects that form beautiful landskips to distant beholders and deceive the eye most egregiously but no sooner has one once set foot ashore but in proportion as one advances up into the country one perceives that those plains which seemed before when at a distance to be covered with a lively verdure to be enamelled with flowers and to flourish with all the beauties of the jolly spring are overspread with briars and thorns and full of dark and melancholy vales divided by torrents and precipices abounding with intricate and perplexing roads that are crossed by morasses which render them unpassable one finds also that those beautiful rising grounds which one fancied covered with little verdant groves are nothing but heaps of steep rocks between the mournful cypresses which overshade them besides which they are full of wild beasts dragons and serpents  thus it is evident that this island affords two very different prospects one which is very agreeable to those who have not yet set foot thereon and only view it at a distance and another which is highly disagreeable to those who have run themselves wilfully into that confinement and who are no sooner inthralled therein but they offer up their most ardent vows for that dear liberty which they have given up so imprudently insomuch that it is just the same with them as with the goldfinch and the cage  how sweet to warble in a cage and with soft notes our cares tasswage all is there provided at our need pure limpid stream good wholesome seed a kind she too with whom to play and sing and sport the hours away thus said a goldfinch blithe when he incagd a linnet once did see himself mean while at liberty with cheerful note and joyous sound who made his prison walls resound so damon when one day he spyd a blooming virgin natures pride with ecstasy and rapture cried thrice happy i beyond mankind were i but to that fair one joined in an undissoluble tie with her to live with her to die but neither cage nor marriage state ever show their evils till too late nor birds nor men find out the cheat till they are in and past retreat o you who burn with amorous fire would you still keep alive desire and add fresh fuel to the flame still love but never wed the dame the inhabitants of this island are at perpetual war with those of the isle of amathontis or of lovers which lies very near them i shall describe in the sequel after what manner their wars are carried on but first it will be necessary to give a description of the different inhabitants of the isle of marriage  toward the east and inclining a little to the south one may see another island separated by a great arm of the sea which holds no manner of correspondence with out isle it is called polygamy the mahometans have usurped to themselves the possession thereof and our rigid laws forbid our so much as touching thereat on the most severe penalties  not but that there have sometimes been travelers who have been so curious as to take a trip thither either out of a frolic or out of love and have obtained admittance there by some stratagem but nevertheless they have not been able to effect this without embroiling themselves with the courts of justice and unless one has as much gold to throw away as my lord m  d one runs the hazard of taking a voyage with count cahoon to the chequerinn in newgatestreet  the mahometans then are left in peaceable possession of the isle of polygamy and they have accordingly caused the following verses to be cut in golden letters upon a marble which is placed at the head of the pier of their harbor  to satisfy loves raging flames we mussulmans wed twenty dames although we own the strongest he more than enough will find one she but this with us a rule we make it is not too much a score to take so that among them we can find one wife that is generous just and kind the island of marriage is divided into five provinces which have each of them a capital city and several little towns dependent thereon four of these provinces extend themselves along the four sea coasts but the largest which is chiefly peopled by the colonies that flock thither from the other four is in the center of the island the government whereof it has usurped through the prodigious number of its inhabitants  the four provinces which lie along the sea coasts are inhabited by the discreet the illmatched the illatease and the jealous the head province which is in the middle is the famous cuckoldshire whose capital is the wellknown hornborough but besides these five provinces there are likewise two peninsulas the one of widowhood and the other of divorce which have taken up two necks of land at two ends of this island  the province of the discreet who were formerly called the faithful extends itself along the whole eastern coast its capital city is called sophia its buildings are modest and regular its fortifications good and capable of making a resolute defense it is watered by chastity which is a river whose pure stream flows softly and without noise although in its course it is enlarged by the waters of four rivulets called piety austerity morality and vigilance these have nothing agreeable in them because they only run in meanders and their sides are every where covered with briars and thickets which prevent the incursions of the scouts of amathontis who might otherwise attempt to land there  the governor of this city is prince integrity and my lord honor is the civil magistrate their churches are always open they live there with frugality and enjoy no pleasures but what are innocent the public walks where they take the air are all planted with linden trees that are sprung from those into which baucis and philemon were changed and all their fences are pallisadoes of laurel sprung from the chaste daphne  nevertheless as delightful and well governed as this city is one can scarcely imagine how very few inhabitants there are therein and were it not for the prudes who have found the means to get admittance into it under the borrowed mask of virtue this province would be almost a desert  these prudes then possess the largest part of this city and inhabit a quarter which is separated from the others by the obscure a little river overshaded with trees which shield it from the beams of the sun and disembogues itself into the black sea  their houses on the outside are not to be distinguished from those of the discreet but when my lord honor goes from time to time and makes a narrow inspection into the inside of their tenements he finds so vast a difference between their outward appearance and their management within doors that he is often forced to banish them and to send large colonies of them to people the head province  the metropolis being so poorly inhabited it may be well thought that the countrytowns and villages are yet worse in effect one meets only with a few scattered up and down and almost without inhabitants and even these are of such a churlish untractable temper that a passenger is hard put to it to find a lodging  although those who are really discreet are haughty and reserved they behave themselves with yet less haughtiness than the prudes there are no people in the world who extol their own merit to such a degree as they or make such a noise about their virtue insomuch that they treat all their neighbors with the utmost contempt but although they affect to seem wonderfully intrepid and to be eager for the combat they often prove not to be so brave as they would be thought by their discourse and the amathontins seldom attempt to invade their territories without making considerable havoc among them  even amongst the real discreet one may find two different sorts one of these are so through a principle of honor and are always as cheerful as they are invincible but there are others whose chastity is more owing to their vanity than their virtue these have always a sullen gravity in their looks which sufficiently demonstrates that they are not at all pleased with their condition  as little inhabited as the country is and as severe as the laws of their government are it does not prevent some and those even of the most discreet from removing daily into the head province for in short virtue as well as the mind grows weary of too intense an application to one point and is apt to abate of its first severity but those who stay behind look upon these deserters with contempt for which reason they have set up the following inscription over the front of their principal gate  ye virtuous fair our islands pride whose sterling honor often tried has always made a brave defense hither without distrust repair here you may live secure from fear armed capapee with innocence what though we are in number few we are all intrepid staunch and true nor treachery nor ambush dread nor need we against our honors foes implore the feeble aid of those who basely from our colors fled on the opposite side of the island that is on the western coast is the whimsical and unaccountable province of the illmatchd the metropolis of this province is called the old town none of the buildings of this city have any conformity one with the other nor is there any manner of symmetry observed therein insomuch that one may often see a great gate to a small house and a diminitive wicket to a spacious palace it is watered by two rivers one whereof is called the fantasque and the other the clandestine the one is a river consisting wholly of cascades and hurrying every moment with violence down precipices and the other a rapid torrent which being ashamed of showing itself runs impetuously under ground but notwithstanding the care it takes to hide its course cannot prevent its being discovered by a hollow noise it makes in flowing  as soon as one has set foot within the gates of this city one hears nothing but the cries and complaints of children whom either an old mother has sacrificed to a young rake or whom an old debauchee has given up as victims to a young coquet here the master of a family marries his cookmaid and there an old beldame of quality takes to husband her valet de chamber and solemnizes in her own chapel a ceremony which serves only to add fresh shame to her licentiousness  at the gates of this city grows that famous wood mentioned by the bantering doctor in the play the trees he says of this wood bear the heads of all sorts of iron tools and the earth underneath produces proper handles wherewith to fit them up but it often happens that when the iron is at full growth and falls instead of meeting with a handle that would be proper for it it drops upon one that matches it most preposterously for instance the head of a scythe falls upon the handle of a pike the head of a halberd upon the helve of a hatchet and so of all the rest insomuch that not one of them meets with a handle suitable to its purpose  it is just the same case with those who make matches so disproportionable either for age or quality that they only render themselves a laughing stock to every one who hears thereof i would have all persons therefore remember this as an infallible truth  on equal hinges turns the marriage state no happiness thereins allowed by fate two great a disproportion if there be in fortune humor age or quality for although it is a very common saying and almost grown into a proverb that love will unite the most distant extremes in its center it is only in loveaffairs that this union must be understood to be effected with pleasure but when the indissoluble tie of matrimony is in the case the proverb will be found no longer to hold good  upon the southern coast of this island is the province of the illatease whose capital city is shortallowance under the command of colonel hardfare the inhabitants of this country are melancholy and fretful the houses are but cottages which the want of bellytimber unfurnishes by little and little the kitchens all lie open to the north wind and the people therein have little else to do but to blow their fingers the city is watered by famine a sorry little brook which only runs murmuring over a parcel of flintstones and does not afford the smallest little fish the barren fields yield nothing but straw and the vines naught but sower and distasteful grapes  notwithstanding this miserable want of necessary provision most part of the inhabitants and especially the women will cheat their bellies of the little they can afford to bestow it upon a deceitful dress which conceals their inward necessities under a disguise of an easy outside but this desire of finery beyond what they can afford and the cries of a halfstarved belly makes these inhabitants leave this miserable country with pleasure and flock in large colonies to people the head province and endeavor to help the barrenness of their lands by the kindly showers of gold that fall from the pockets of their lovers  gallants who study night and day to gain fresh conquests over the fair the coyest she will fall a prey when her own wants first lay the snare on the northern coast of the isle of marriage lies the province of the jealous whose capital city is situated on the middle of mount chimaera just in that part which the ancients said was inhabited by bulls and goats the top being possessed by lions and the bottom by serpents which gave rise to the fable of its being an animal composed of three natures but the poets who were wretched geographers have mistaken its situation since it is certainly in this province that mount chimaera is situated  the metropolis of the jealous is called false belief it is watered by anxiety which is a river whose deep yellow stream serves the inhabitants as a deceitful and fallacious lookingglass and fills their heads with horned visions by representing things to them in a quite different manner from what they are in reality but besides the delusive nature of the water of this river the inhabitants in imitation of the antojos amongst the spaniards never stir a step without wearing upon their noses great spectacles made of magnifying glass which magnifies all objects to that degree that the smallest fly seems to them like an elephant and every atom appears to be a pair of large browantlers  these people are the most savage of any in the whole island and their country is the most rugged and unpassable it is wholly overspread with steep mountains covered with impenetrable woods gloomy vales and barren plains wherefore none but the native inhabitants can dwell therein neither would the jealous suffer them if they could and much less the amathontins than any others because they are firmly persuaded that they find some means or other to accomplish their designs every where  the capital city although situated on the side of a hill stands nevertheless in a very obscure place and is overshadowed with mountains on every side there is no way to it but by narrow difficult roads full of watchful centinals whose eyes are never both closed at one time but the one wakes while the other sleeps they caused formerly the following inscription to be set up upon a high post that was erected for that purpose beyond the glacis of their fortifications  deceivers sly gallants away this is no place for you to stay yourselves who value on base arts to circumvent weak womens hearts this city is forbidden ground march off nor in these parts be found you may indeed the outworks view but all withins forbidden you the amathontis being nettled at the presumptuous confidence of these verses marched thither one night blotted them out and substituted these following in their room  when once two hearts which burn with mutual fires with prudent care conceal their fierce desires the subtlest he no easy task will find to part that pair whom ardent love has joined in vain a fool may watch them up and down he will scratch his horns at last and sighing own when wife and spark are firm combined to gull you do what you please you will find yourself their cully the streets of this city are extremely lightsome and very strait to the end that one may be able to have a clear view of all that is transacted therein from one end to the other but the houses are extremely dark having but few windows and those very small and cross barred the inhabitants are mighty grave and hold very little correspondence with their neighbors  although the city be pretty populous one sees very few folks in the streets and the husbands beat the tattoo very early to call their wives home in good time before the dusk of the evening exposes them to any surprise they are an odd sort of mortals they are perpetually upon thorns and one may see them hurry out and return in again every minute with the utmost abruptness their eyes staring all the while and their ears pricked up with the utmost attention and anguish  they apply to themselves every word that is spoken and tremble at the sight of a man of gallantry as much as a dove at the sight of a hawk then it is that they are very diverting by the ridiculousness and folly of their uneasiness which is so far from being of any service to them that they themselves contribute most to the success of their enemies affairs by their perpetual teazing and provoking those whom they would defend from their attacks since it is certain that nothing contributes more to the conquest of a gallant than the reasons one gives a wife to revenge herself of ones ill usage and i have known those whose pleasure has received a more exquisite relish by the extravagant humors and caprices of a jealous cuckold  it is said that one day a pretty large colony of these jealous husbands were obliged to remove all together into the head province and that by a very whimsical and merry accident an amathontin who had found means to steal into their quarters took it in his head to post up the following verses in the principal square of the city  cease jealous fools your storming cease which does but your own woes increase and add fresh fuel to our fires to teaze your spouses night and day believe me is the ready way to make them yield to loose desires your unkind blows to tender wives your causless brawls and restless lives in everlasting discord spent will to yourselves most fatal prove will kindle hate instead of love and forward what you would most prevent hereupon one of the inhabitants who having a flea in his ear happened to rise earlier than the rest and had some business in that square went thither found these verses tore them down that instant hurried home directly with all speed and threshd his wife most enormously this done he handed them about very carefully from door to door amongst all his neighbors who taking each of them the thing to himself treated his rib just in the same manner as the first coxcomb but notwithstanding all the vigilance of these noodles every one of the women concerted their measures so well together that they were fully revenged of them the very night following insomuch that the next morning when they awoke all these jealous coxcombs found themselves in cuckoldshire without having ever dreamed of it and were irrecoverably entered upon the register of the headprovince  i have already observed that this city is watered by the river anxiety which is a large river navigable from its very spring its waters have this property that they deprive one of sleep it yields no other fish but gudgeons which the amathonlins often prevail on these jealous gentry to swallow the city is extremely strong and inaccessible the walls which are at least as thick as those built by semiramis are surrounded on all sides by this deep river so that there is no approaching the city but by a bridge that is laid over the river beyond which is a narrow causey fortified by six strong batteries well guarded which lead up to the only gate there is insomuch that no amathontin can pass but by the help of some disguise but as there are no people in the world that are more ingenious than this nation some of them perpetually find the means to get into the city which they seldom leave without making a terrible havoc  having given an account of the four nations that inhabit the sea coast order next requires me to mention the head province of cuckoldshire and its numerous inhabitants who by a very just antonomasia have assumed to themselves the name of cuckolds  the capital of this province is called hornborough and is at least as large as london to which it bears a very great resemblance but like the ancient thebes it has an hundred gates that it may be able to give entrance to the prodigious concourse of newcomers who daily flock thither from all parts all the world having a title to a freedom there from the greatest emperor to the most scoundrel blackguard and as soon as his spouse pleases the husband puts in his claim and enters into possession in right of his wife in short this city and indeed the whole province has the same property as the sea and the gallows for it refuses none from the prince to the beggar it has been observed indeed by some in exception to this that there never was pope cardinal jesuit nor priest in all this province i suppose because they dont care for the company of people of such bad principles but then to make amends there have been abundance of rosycheekd protestant divines especially a  b  ps b  p  s and dignified clergymen against whom no exception has ever been made they being always very welcome guests  this city is situated in the midst of a large and fertile plain abounding with all the pleasures and delicacies that can be wished for in life the pactolus runs quite through the midst of it and its fruitful streams which abound with golden sand divide it exactly in two my lord readymoney a grandee of spain and formerly viceroy of peru is governor thereof the jupiters also of the treasury who can convert themselves into golden showers bear great sway there it being from their powerful body that the magistracy are yearly chose for which reason they have caused the following inscription to be set over the front of their town hall  whenever we lovers sue in vain and neither sighs nor vows avail to move the fair to ease our pain the golden key will never fail each side of the pactolus is divided into two quarters insomuch that the whole city consists of four parts inhabited by four sorts of citizens who from their different characters are called by different names these are the contented the frantic the incredulous and the imaginary cuckolds  the contented cuckolds dwell in a quarter which they have named the land of plenty they are a good sort of people with whom a man may do what he will and who withdraw commodiously and without noise as soon as ever a lover appears they would be very sorry ever to interrupt the pleasures of those who do them the honor to visit their wives their word of battle is let pleasure be free i consent this jovial humor is visible in all their looks words and actions there is nothing to be seen at their houses but dancing and feasting perpetually operas balls masquerades hunting matches and parties of pleasure of all which they are sure to be partakers the city is neither fortified with walls gates or drawbridges on their side amongst them every one lives without constraint and without jealousy their only care being after what manner they shall divert themselves provided it is at the expense of the amathontins who are never better pleased than when they are among these good people although they never fail to send them by degrees to an hospital in order to make room for others for lovers are in one respect like fish the freshest are always the best and to the end that no body may be ignorant of the free and communicative temper of those gentry care has been taken to have these verses engraven on a large plate of gold and to have them set up in the midst of the principal square  with us all lead contented lives none ever conceal their soft desires but gallants husbands and their wives burn openly with mutual fires for what does secresy avail to guard a buxom females honor the watchfullst husbands care will fail when once the loving fits upon her to yield to fate is then the best and we the wisest method follow we drink we feast we take our rest and in delights and riches wallow ye jealous fools whose empty pride makes you esteem our conduct base had you but once the difference tried yourselves you d soon wish in our place with doubts and fears for ever crossed how much less happy days do you pass and who lives at anothers cost is not i m sure the greatest ass over against these contented cuckolds and on the other side of a large brook that parts them are the frantic cuckolds who have taken up their residence in that quarter of the town where cuckoldom has erected her bedlam  this quarter which is called the quarter of the pazzi is inhabited by those fools who take a pleasure in publishing their own shame in making the courts of justice ring with their ridiculous complaints and diverting the public with the continual farce of their extravagancies all their recreation is in bedaubing themselves with filth and giving themselves abundance of trouble and that at a vast charge in order to convince the courts of justice of their having suffered a disgrace which they ought rather if possible to endeavor to unknow themselves and with the fruits of which the honest lawyers feast themselves very merrily  these extravagant wretches are divided into two classes whereof the one have taken up their quarters in the hospital of the curables these are such as after a fruitless clamor which has rendered them for some time the talk and jest of the town begin to recover their senses and say that all things rightly considered taking one woman with another they still like their own wives best  the others who are lodged in a different and yet less agreeable quarter are those incurable lunaticks who under the direction of a hornified physician ride full speed to lay their bones in an almshouse by making themselves a prey to a senseless obstinacy and being the continual bubbles of the vultures and harpies of the law  the desolation of their families the confinement of their wives the disowning and bastardizing of their own children with an inexhaustable fund of lawsuits entailed one upon another are the necessary consequences of their frenzy and the countenance they find as long as they have money wherewith to feed the hungry lawyers is what contributes to their infatuation and compleats their ruin to all intents and purposes  one may see them always in a fury with their eyes swelled out of their heads and their faces in a flame running from attorney to attorney and from council to council hunting for and hiring at a vast expense false witnesses who cover all them with ignominy stopping their ears against all the good counsel that is given them and shutting their eyes against all the examples of those who have recovered their senses but of all these mad wretches none sure was ever more distracted than he over whose door they pasted up the following verses  pinchwife the maddest of the horned train drunk with the fumes that cloud his empty brain consumes in law the income of a lord to be allowed a cuckold on record yet tell him he is a fool and that the town laugh at his clamor and denide his moan that every prudent man in such a case endeavors to keep secret his disgrace go preach to such a wretch as well you might attempt to wash an ethiopian white on the other side of the pactolus are the imaginary cuckolds who believe themselves to be what they are not and the incredulous cuckolds who are not to be covinced that they are what they really are these are two sorts of citizens of very different tempers the first resolving to be inhabitants of this city in spite of all that could be done to prevent them and the others being to the last degree astonished at their being made free thereof without having any title to it as they are pleased to flatter themselves the houses of these two sorts of citizens whose tempers are so very different are separated from each other by a rivulet called the perverse whose waters are so muddy and so thick that the eye cannot discover what lies at the bottom  the incredulous are only so because they repose too entire and too implicit a confidence in whatever their artful wives endeavor to make them believe they live contented and at quiet but not like those contented ones in that quarter called the land of plenty who both know of give consent to and pocket up their horns in order to reap their own benefit from it but by the means of an indolent ignorance that keeps them from all uneasiness  whilst the day lasts their whole employment is to enjoy a sweet and peaceable repose in the forest of confidence a place that is impenetrable by the rays of the sun and not within the reach of the noise of the city the one might in vain beat all their drums and sound all their trumpets yet would it never in the least disturb their ears and the other might shine out with the greatest luster and diffuse all his brightest rays around the globe to as little purpose since it would not have the least effect upon their eyes happy they in their peaceful indolence but more happy still the artful gypsies who have brought them to such a pass  there is nothing to be seen in this quarter but mutual pleasure and endearments between the husbands and wives the one with an entire confidence think they can neither find words obliging enough or caresses tender enough to thank their dears for a fidelity which they are far from keeping and the subtle baggages the more they deceive them the more they redouble their wheedling their caresses and all manner of fond and ensnaring endearments  on the contrary that quarter which is inhabited by the imaginary cuckolds differs widely from this in every particular the people there are morose quarrelfome and unsociable one may observe them always upon their guard against every body and both sexes are equally subject to this virtigo nothing there is to be heard but quarrels and reproaches the one are perpetually troubled with the spleen and the others with the vapors their very children fall sacrifices to this reciprocal caprice even the most legitimate are looked upon as bastard grafts every thing there is misconstrued and they judge of nothing without prejudice one cannot so much as set a foot in the streets without finding a prodigious number falling together by the ears and the honest man in the play the mock doctor who interposed impertinently between the faggotmaker and his wife in order to bring them to a reconciliation would have found full employment there in meddling between the bark and the tree  in short these people are absolutely incorrigible for although the goddess of reason once sent the famous moliere to them from the contented witalls of the land of plenty in order to convince them of their infatuation by drawing an admirable picture of the extravagance of their imaginations he could never succeed in the cure he had undertaken and their brains remained as much addled as ever wherefore some time after they were complimented with the following verses  when real ills upon us fall if not felt they are no ills at all nor do they cause much grief or pain but they whom fancied ills oppress sworn foes to their own happiness are blessed with health and wealth in vain incurable is their disease in vain one strives to give them ease even remedies themselves offend and all the fruitless pains we take on their sick brain a cure to make texasperate them only tend as hornborough although it is of a vast extent is far from being large enough to contain that prodigious number of inhabitants who have actually an incontestable right to a freedom there the country round about swarms with the meaner sort who leave the city for courtiers commissioners of the treasury and customs gentlemen of estates great merchants substantial tradesmen and some officers of the army but above all for an infinite number of gownmen whose profession marks them out for a headpiece of hornwork which they very seldom fail to wear  having thus given an account of the whole body of the island there remains now only two little districts to be described which are two peninsulas that run out into the sea the one which is on a neck of land toward the north is the promontory of divorce and the other which is on another toward the south is the promontory of widowhood  the peninsula of divorce is only separated from the isle of marriage by a very narrow isthmus through which it is pretty difficult to pass it is called the isthmus of corinth and from thence came the proverb that every body is not allowed to go to corinth that is to say that every body is not allowed a passage into the peninsula of divorce  the extravagance of an old chancellor of a diocese who was desirous of rendering this passage more easy induced him formerly to constitute an imprudent filthy and brutal giant called my lord congress superintendant of this isthmus this was a curious and shameless wretch who in order to remove the difficulties of this passage rendered impotent by obliging them to be performed in public the conjugal efforts of those husbands who would have hindered their wives from removing into this peninsula the modesty of the moderns would no longer suffer this filthy lord to expose the combatants to this shame and infamy wherefore they have cashiered this ridiculous superintendant but in return the artful amathontins have brought into play another enchantress who has been introduced under the name of separation and they have supported her so well that she makes few attempts without success  it is she who now peoples the peninsula of divorce because the river repudiate whereby they formerly arrived thither is no longer navigable thus by removing a small evil which produced a great good they have introduced a small good which does not prevent a great evil  this little country has neither towns nor villages all the houses are separated from each other like hermitages and to take a view of it from the neighboring eminencies one would fancy it actually the abode of some anchorets but the solitude and melancholy of these deserts is mightily alleviated by the frequent intercourse of the amathontins who take abundance of delight therein and find the means to administer agreeable consolation to the solitary inhabitants above all this is the place where the gentlemen of the long robe gain the most triumphs for as the fair sex cannot get over the difficulties that obstruct this passage without the assistance of those who wear that robe their first care is always to provide themselves of a protector who may remove all obstacles  the inhabitants of this country are not beloved by those in the isle of marriage but when the latter take upon them to blame their conduct they have an answer ready which is as follows  full happily though something late we are freed from the cursed marriage state that bane and torment of our lives you who have of late put on those chains and blame our conduct count your gains when your new dears are grown mere wives a little patience we beseech ere you begin to us to preach and you ere long will surely find that even they who fare the best and envied are by all the rest are far from blessed in their own mind although these divorces are most commonly demanded by the women the men sometimes dont fail to take advantage thereof and several husbands have even found the means to provoke their wives artfully to sue for them and then pretending to oppose it they suffer themselves to be cast like ovids mistress who was overcome as he says by her own treachery this made one of those who had got rid of his matrimonial burden by this artisice and had obtained a place in this solitude have the picture of a ship in a storm drawn in fresco in his cell and the pilot calling out to the sailors to fling over board all the heaviest luggage in obedience to which order one of them takes up his wife and throws her into the sea with the following lines at the bottom of the picture  whilst the angry waves run mountains high and over the shattered vessel break throw over board the sailors cry your heaviest goods for all is at stake pleased with this order to comply i to the floods commit my wife for sure i am that never i had heavier goods in all my life the other peninsula is that of widowhood which is upon a promontory that lies toward the south and is only separated from the rest of the island by a very narrow neck of land which is wholly taken up by a magnificent mausoleum built after the model of that of queen artemisa insomuch that there is no passing for any one from the isle of marriage to the district of widowhood but through this tomb by the means of a subterraneous vault that is contrived under it  the inhabitants always make their entrance there in mourning and they live there in joy and pleasure the air of this country which every one there breaths with freedom being the most consolatory in the world nevertheless all the inhabitants are not able to relish it with pleasure and satisfaction for there comes a wind from the coast of a certain little province of the island called binubia whose malignant atoms cause new itchings which create such uneasiness as those that are troubled therewith believe they can have no cure for without going to binubia and breathing the air of that place  one cannot reenter the island of marriage but by this coast which makes a little separate province and has even some particular laws which are not observed in the other provinces  in order to set sail for this little country of binubia the inhabitants of the peninsula of widowhood must embark at a certain little port which has taken its name from the celebrated ephesian matron because it was there she took shipping with her soldier in order to set sail for binubia nevertheless several persons have given it the name of evil counsel although the marble that is at the foot of an old statue which is placed there gives very good counsel in the following verses which are to be seen thereon  why will you part with that dear liberty which you have so sighed for and so dearly bought why run again into that slavery whence fortunately you by death was brought from shipwreck once escaped the prudent man when he is arrived safe at his wished for port tempts he the dangers of the sea again to make himself of winds and waves the sport and on the other side of the marble one may read these other verses  whoever once freed from marriage chain hamper themselves therein again incorrigible write them down a title they cannot well disown and i with all my soul consent to doom them to the punishment those hardened culprits must expect whom mercy shown will not affect it is impossible to imagine with what violent fits of laughter what cutting raillery the inhabitants of widowhood banter those who set out for binubia they hire an infinite number of hawkers who are perpetually hollowing in their ears a warning to all old widows who marry second husbands the lamentable history and downfall of the old widower who married his cookmaid come a halfpenny a piece a halfpenny a piece and a thousand other such biting jests in derision to those who have not the resolution to keep themselves in that happy state which perhaps they have ardently wished for a hundred times before the happy minute of their deliverance came  but the people of binubia who have often been themselves the first to rally those whom they have afterward followed give once for all the following answer to those who stay behind  patience too soon your bliss you boast perhaps you count without your host already once the fool you have played and may again youre not yet dead and perhaps they are not very much in the wrong when they answer them in this manner for it frequently happens that we fall into that very same error for which we have been the first to reprehend others and most part of the inhabitants of binubia did not engage in second marriages till after they had often endeavored to dissuade others from it  binubia is a little city whose buildings are for the most part old and almost ready to fall only the walls are new whitewashd new plastered up and new painted according to art to hide all defects every thing there has a melancholy and mournful aspect and as almost every match there has been made by the influence of selfinterest all there are intent upon managing their affairs to their own private advantage at the expense of their partner whom they flatter themselves with the hopes of surviving accordingly the very best employment of any in this country is to follow the law in order to take advantage of the innumerable lawsuits which are daily caused by second marriages  nothing is to be heard there but the complaints and mournful lamentations of children by a first marriage who have been robbed and cheated of their right to enrich those by a second with endless enquiries into titles to estates to which the lawyers at last become the principal heirs and disputes about guardians accounts and false inventories in short every thing there is in trouble and confusion and the pettyfoggers have not in the world such another fruitful nursery of lawsuits  having now given you an account of all the different people that inhabit the island of marriage viz the discreet the illmatchd the illatease the jealous the cuckolds the binubians the divorced and the inhabitants of widowhood nothing remains but to give likewise some description of their enemies the amathontins and the perpetual wars they have with them  i have already observed that amathontis or the island of lovers is not far distant from the isle of marriage and indeed it is so near that the amathontins are every moment invading them in prodigious numbers and never fail making terrible havoc amongst them insomuch that they are very seldom driven out again when they have once got footing there one province or other is always warmly engaged with them especially cuckoldshire which is overrun with their multitudes and the others are not free from them  their manner of waging war is very pleasant for it is not in incursions that make a great noise and bustle in the world that they place their chief hope and dependence no they do their business much better by introducing themselves without clamor by getting footing privately and by gaining over to their interest all the most considerable persons in the country but they have no sooner made a lodgment any where but they know how to maintain themselves therein and the fewer they march in company the more formidable they are  it is not then with open force that they attack the enemy whom they design to overthrow one hears neither trumpet sound nor drum beat when they march either to storm a fort or to give battle all is done without noise advances are all made either by intrenchment or by sap and their battles are all reduced to single combat every man singling out the enemy with whom he chooses to encounter  as for their weapons volleys of sighs are their only smallarms languishing and dying eyes their only swords and the softest and most tender expressions their most dangerous artillery they have indeed a kind of short stilletto which they always carry about them concealed and with which they sometimes give dangerous stabs but this is never but when they are very close and very warmly engaged and have the enemy down and at a disadvantage for which reason some persons will scarcely allow it to be a fair weapon but be that as it will it is well known that few of the enemy are afraid of its most home thrusts their greatest valor then consists only in their submission and complaisance to their enemies their glory is wholly confined to loading them with their own spoils and their most complete victory is in expiring between the arms of the conquered enemy in short the more secret their triumphs are the greater pleasure they take in them  by this conduct and provided the sinews of war are not wanting there is nothing which an amathontin cannot effect no fortifications are proof against their cannon nor is there any fort which will not surrender if they persevere in their attacks this made them once put the following inscription upon a quiver which they dedicated to the god of love  in the island which from marriage takes its name especially amongst the jealous sands the watchfullst haughtiest and descreetest dame with difficuly can escape our hands yet do we never open war declare we are a kind of subtle privateers and when we find a tender hearted fair with all her numerous train of hopes and fears let argus all his hundred eyes employ still will we be the masters of the field in spite of him well seize the killing joy and force the coyest stubbornst she to yield neither do they often fail of being as good as their words these amathontins are an agreeable free goodhumoured generous and disinterested people insomuch that instead of ravaging and amassing spoils in the country of marriage they spend at such a rate that they very often enrich those they have overthrown and those who have connived at their getting any footing in the country  but whoever would attempt to describe all the wiles and all the stratagems whereof this artful nation makes use of in order to introduce themselves make a lodgment and gain a complete victory would be obliged to write millions of volumes not but that there are among them an infinite number of inconstants indiscreet ones and impostors one may hear complaints made of them every day but notwithstanding all these complaints there would be no living without them and half their enemies would be in a very sad condition if they should cease to make war upon them  it is impossible to conceive into what a good humor the reading of this agreeable piece put the whole company by its humerous description of the isle of marriage all owned it to be exquisitely imagined and to be carried on with the nicest judgment at last it brought into our minds the celebrated map of tender in the romance of clelia which formerly was highly extolled but every one agreed that this had several beauties and a delicacy and turn which the other was far from coming up to  every one then called to remembrance those places which had made the most lively impression upon their imagination but of all the parts of the island they always returned again to hornborough through a certain natural inclination which seems to draw all the world thither either to make part of its inhabitants or to laugh at them and very often for both for the citizens of this vast city have this merry faculty belonging to them that they generally ridicule one another some to divert peoples thoughts from being fixed upon them and others to comfort themselves for their own disgrace  at last melinda one of the three ladies who were with us and who has a delicate and just way of thinking and expressing herself turned about to me and asked me if i could give any reason why people were fond of having it thought that the horned society are the chief and most numerous part of the inhabitanes of this vast country  you ask me a question madam said i to which it is not very difficult to find an answer for as soon as you reflect that this formidable society consists for the most part of men who are haughty unsociable morose snappish illnatured uncomplaisant uneasy in their circumstances and perpetually employed about every thing that is the most unlikely to render a man gallant and agreeable you will find more reasons than one for what you desire to know  these few words opened us a large field of scandal and gave us full scope to take a general review of some hundreds of our acquaintance which we accordingly did afterward time not then permitting by reason dinner was ready wherefore we adjourned our satire till afternoon at the joint invitation of ceres bacchus and our own appetites which were by this time pretty sharp set what passed afterward may possibly prove the entertainment of another day if this meets with a favorable acceptance from the town  finis the batchelors

i return the following answer  you propose i should marry your relation who is worth  000 l down which is indeed a handsome fortune and such that i have the modesty to think i do not deserve yet at present cannot accept of the proposal because the following necessary expenses arise so frequently and so openly to my view that i must own whenever i have thought of matrimony they have contrary to my real inclination deterred me from entering into that agreeable state  l s d i now live in chambers which cost me  0 l a year as soon as married i must take a house which i cannot have suitable to

expenses at those diversions 0   0 00 i now seldom go to see above a play in a season i must in complaisance to my wife sometimes wait on her and partake of those entertainments for i do not think it proper she should go alone which i will moderately compute at 0   0 00    00 00 l s d brought forward    00 00 it costs me now about  0 s a year in coals i am sure it must then cost me    l so that here is another yearly increase of expense  0 00 00 the same of candles in proportion 0  00 00 my wifes necessary wearing apparel  0 00 00     00 00  having a family of my own i shall diminish little

the  0 l being the charge of my dinners there will be a necessary additional matrimonial expense in housekeeping      0 00 if my wife pleases me as i do not doubt but your relation will i know my own temper so well in that respect that i shall be often making her presents of either rings jewels snuffboxes watch tweezers some knickknacks and things of that nature in which one year with another i am

but happens in most families my wifes servants the expenses of doctor and apothecary and though it is accidental yet one year with another cannot come short of 0  00 00 as for children i dare say our attempts in that respect will not prove fruitless we may reasonably expect one in every two years if not oftener but it shall not be my fault if it does not the expense of lyingin childbedlinnen midwife nurses cawdles baskets cradle christenings blankets pinns clouts etc must at least be  0 l so that if it should happen once in two years it may be reckoned a yearly expense of    00 00      0

tablelinnen cannot come short of  00 l which with  0 l for plate without which being so moderate a quantity i dare say my wife nor indeed should i myself be satisfied will lie dead daily decrease in its value and bring me in no income i must therefore reckon my wifes fortune in point of its bringing me in a yearly income at no more than    0 l  now sir as you have been a housekeeper and married these several years pray tell me if in any one article i have charged too much whether if i have not rather undercharged them and omitted several that i being unacquainted with these sort of things can have no knowledge of  if therefore it is a moderate computation and necessary supposing interest to continue at five per cent which is unlikely the produce of    0 l is only    l  0 s and if it should fall to four per cent is only    l in the one case i must necessarily expend on my wife     l in the other     l  0 s above the income of the fortune she brings besides the hazard and want of security for the money which ought to be considered and though it be necessary yet how reasonable it is i submit to you  these things considered and he that marries without previous consideration acts very indiscreetly i do not see how i can marry a woman with the fortune you propose or that i should better my self at all by it and in prudence people should do so or let it alone not that i propose or think to have more i must therefore live single though with some regret that i cannot do otherwise and increase my own fortune which happens to be sufficient for my own maintenance till if i may so call it i can afford matrimony  i wish the lady all happiness and a better husband and if it be for her satisfaction one who has thought less of the matter not but that i have a very good opinion of matrimony and think of it with pleasure as hoping one time or other to enter into its list but i now wait with patience till my circumstances or thoughts vary  one thing i would not have you mistaken in is that i do not mean that your relation will be thus expensive to me more than any other only that whenever i marry let her be who she will i must necessarily if she has no more fortune than you propose expend considerably more than  00 l a year on her above the income of her fortune and at present i cannot persuade my self to be at so great an expense for the sake of trying a dangerous experiment whether the pleasures of matrimony are yearly worth that sum all which is submitted to your consideration by  sir your most obliged humble servant  the married mans answer to the batchelors estimate of the expenses of a married life in a letter to john single of graysinn esquire  london printed in the year mdccxlii  the married mans answer to the batchelors estimate of the expenses of a married life in a letter to john single of graysinn esquire dear sir your estimate has been read over and considered in our family and now lies upon the table to be perused by the neighbors  several objections have been made to it i shall take notice of some of them it is observed that you do not deal with that candor and ingenuity in stating the account that you ought to do for in the way you compute you make no allowance for the reputation and advantage which you will in many respects gain and which will accrue to your self by a house kept in the manner you mention the credit of which in a great measure centers in you while the care of it lies wholly upon your wife so that in     l per annum consisting of fourteen articles from the butchers bill down to brickdust rottenstone whiteing and other little ingredients you will be found not only to be the greatest cause of the expense but will have the principal share in the pleasure and in the esteem obtained by it though it is true fullersrents and sheerlane lose   s   d a day by your dinners the same error runs through some other articles for my relation will not i believe easily comprehend why she should be solely loaded with the charge of expending    l per annum upon children which you seem very well disposed to get besides let me tell you jack you ought to bring into the account the saving which will arise from the regular proceeding in that affair which upon the change of your condition you must make to come wonderfully cheap to you a grandee of spain reproached the lady whom he had married with a small fortune that he believed that every pleasure he had had with her had cost him a dobloon a time she replied that was none of her fault for his excellency might have reduced it to six denieres a time if he had pleased in the two years they had lain together i doubt you sink an article of your expense here you know jack your beloved horace says there are things quibus doleat natura negatis and does not loveless joyless unindeared casual fruition cost you money you tell us of the doctor and the apothecary when you are married it is well for you if you steer clear of the surgeon before you enter into that state nothing but urgent necessity can draw money from you he that deals in cheap pictures and cheap women is a loser at last  in your concluding remark you seem unjustly to diminish my kinswomans fortune for is not the  00 l furniture of your house and tablelinen with the  0 l for plate your own as much as if it were in cash and does not every circumstance in a married life recommend you to the world equal to the money it costs you if laid out prudently you have a settlement by it that makes you a better subject a more useful friend and a more virtuous man  how many are they who by degrees hardening themselves against the sex established by the laws of nature and of the land at last fall into a horrible and odious sin of nonconformity never tolerated in any christian country this sometimes draws an expense after it in a composition far exceeding the    l per annum the proper and sole charge of the pleasures of matrimony by your own calculation which you cannot persuade your self to undergo as not thinking them yearly worth that sum  consider jack who are your truly idle fellows in town and country that saunter away their time at coffeehouses and at gamingtables they are all or most of them of your family mr single the young fellows who are always studying how to spend time to pass away time to wear away time to kill time they are all of your family the reason is plain they have nothing in the world for which it is worth while to improve time besides idleness teaches all kind of evil and while you by your parsimonious celibacy deny your self the proper remedy you cherish the disease and at the same time you endeavor to check the river in its natural channel you make it overflow the bordering meadows  what topics are used to incite a

from the true proprietor to sell the better as to the first the town at its first coming out was sufficiently satisfied twas a grubstreet as to the second i think it beneath a gentleman to answer it because no gentleman could have wrote it consisting of so much scurrility it is sufficient satisfaction to me to observe that the readers of it from its being so preposterous and scurrilous immediately cry out of the author this fellow is a fool as to the married mans answer because it is wrote like a gentleman and with no such sordid view as the others were i choose for those reasons to answer it and shall therefore in so doing address myself to the author thereof  the first thing sir you begin with by way of answer is that i make no allowance for the reputation and advantage which you say i shall in many respects gain by housekeeping could you have mentioned any one of those many respects i dont doubt but that you would but such a general charge without any reason or foundation mentioned to support it seems to me to argue as if you could not maintain your allegation and indeed i cannot conceive how you can does paying parishtaxes clear our intellects or does matrimony refine our judgments if not how comes it about and on what foundation can the married man and housekeeper have a greater reputation than the bachelor i must own i dont know but now i think on it indeed in one respect he may that is by marrying an agreeable woman he stands a very fair chance of having a reputation now very much in vogue in that state which i thank my stars i as a bachelor am only capacitated to give but not to receive was i to employ a person to manage my affairs i should choose to employ the bachelor in regard the married man has so much to do to mind his familyaffairs he will have but little time to mind those of others  as to the deductions you would have made on the account of casual fruition and the consequential articles of it before you make such a deduction you should first lay it down as necessary that young fellows must whore or marry otherwise it is ungenerous to tax me as i have not committed the one that i must the other if you make it out that a bachelor must go a whoring you have found out something new and as the first discoveries of any thing useful ought to have thanks you have mine if there is no such necessity for ought you know i may be one of those batchelors that walking between two precipices whoredom and matrimony may have so cautiously directed my steps as to avoid both but as it is not for my credit with the fair sex to pretend not to have been gratified by any of them i own i have had some amors but not with such as were sordidly prostituting their charms for gain but with those only who gratified me for no other prospect than an equal return of love consequently no deduction ought to be made on the account of the expense of it but supposing that my taste has been so very low as to take up with those that let their charms to hire and that i have been at some expense in that respect yet as women are nowadays very cheap pardon me i mean those of the town and their price runs at a low ebb  0 l a year will drive a pretty good trade with that sort of ware and i am told you may agree by the great and for five guineas a year insure yourself against any ill consequences that may happen and if the expense of casual fruition is no more as prudent dealers therein assure me it is not i am sure the undervaluations and omissions in my estimate amount to above twice those sums  you allege and for argumentsake suppose it true that in the articles of housekeeping i shall have the principal pleasure yet i must be at six parts in seven of the expense pray how stands it then is that encouragement to commence husband  it is not my wife but i shall bear the load of the expense of children for you see her fortune can scarcely answer any expense at all but as she partakes of an equal if not as most allow a greater pleasure in the begetting them i dont see why she should not proportionably contribute to their maintenance  by the story of the spanish grandee you would insinuate and consistent enough with your admission of my being well disposed to get children that let it cost me what it will i may by a frequent repetition of the pleasures of matrimony and i dare say not disagreeable to my wife reduce the expense of each pleasure to a very minute sum unless it was my own fault which admits a readiness of one side but on a second calculation of the expenses of the estimate i find i shall pay for those pleasures at the rate of    s   d for each nights lodging a mere trifle you will say but however whether after honeymoon is over which by the way they tell me is the shortest in the year those pleasures will be so frequent as to reduce the expense of them to a very minute sum or on the other side whether several    s   pences will not be expended toward each pleasure is the hazardous experiment i still decline to make but leave it to those who have shot the gulf and now know the danger to reflect how prudent they were when they undertook so hardy an enterprise where let the dear partner be sullen and ill tempered or gay and goodnatured let her by chance or otherwise be ugly or agreeable let her be obstreperous and unruly and xantippe like scold me out of house and home or be meek and condescending let her be expensive and what some good wives have industriously done run me into goal or the frugal and careful let her be healthy or ailing let her be a messalina or a lucrece let her have all the ill and none of the good qualities yet this dear creature i am destined to love and cherish for life she must be partaker of my bed and board from this bargain though never so ill concerted there is no appeal lies or any redress to be had who then that lives already comfortably and happy would not knowing when he was well be fool enough to make an experiment where if it happens according to his wishes he can but live still comfortable and happy and where if it does not as i believe most people will allow it to be a reasonable chance to lay twenty to one against him he will have only this sad reflection i was happy but strove to be otherwise and am so such an experiment would be as prudent as that made by a person who having a very valuable diamond would needs try whether it was so hard as to bear the strokes of a hammer on an anvil he satisfied his curiosity what followed the diamond broke and the possessor of it cursed his stars for having been such a fool  you say by marriage i became a better subject a more useful friend and a more virtuous man neither of which can i allow as to the first then there is no law that commands or forbids us to marry he that does not transgresses no law and he that does complies with none how can one then be a better member of a community or a better subject than the other when what is said to make a difference between them is in itself indifferent but as every body thank heaven is left to his own choice and mine i think is the best being consistent with the opinion of an inspired writer i pronounce myself a better subject who can without injustice to any freely engage in the service of my king and country and as pomfret says afford them my tongue my pen my fortune and my sword than he that is obliged to make use of all these to minister to the necessities of a family which he is tied to and which consistent with the laws of god and man it is his utmost duty to provide for  to be a more useful friend it is almost impossible for a married man for he must and it is a great sin if he omits it breed up maintain and provide for his family if during that time he should provide for a relation do a friend a kindness or this or that act of charity it will be looked upon to be and so it is in fact so far a robbery of his own family so that the ties of his duty in that respect are so strong he can scarce do one act of benevolence to any other so true is the old proverb charity begins at home and even when he has done all he can his thankless children which by the way is no great encouragement to beget them think he made a very ill use of his time in not having raised them greater fortunes whereas the bachelor having none but himself to provide for and having the same methods and talents of becoming rich with the married man without a quarter of the expense soon gains that end while it is well if the married man with his greatest industry supports his family the bachelor gives his niece or cousin a fortune and places her in the world binds a nephew apprentice puts out a poor child to school relieves a poor iudustrious family struggling with poverty lends or gives a friend a sum on an emergency all these he does not as a performance of any duty incumbent on him nor will it be esteemed as such but as mere acts of benevolence he robs none he does none injustice his family at home want it not he is valued and respected as a truly generous soul he sees the good things he does rewarded in the gratitude of the receivers of his benevolence and in the increase of his fortune which with his good intentions gives him ability whilst the married man though perhaps he may have the inclination yet very seldom has the ability of being half so useful a friend as the bachelor  as to the married mans being more virtuous than a bachelor i am satisfied there are so many provocations to passion in familyconcerns that the married man lies under a frequenter temptation to sin in that respect and besides the necessary parsimony a husband must be master of to support his family often betrays him into a strange narrowness of temper and avarice and every body knows that there are sins and great ones too incident only to a married state which it is well if they are avoided those of omission even were our bosom friends our wives judges i dare say are not few  as to the odious sin of nonconformity i think it is ungenerous in the highest degree to suggest any thing without due grounds for it but let it stick on the guilty as for my part i assure you i love the fair sex so well i would willingly oblige them in any thing in the world but marry them  as to sauntering at coffeehouses and loss at play i would have you know i have business to employ me so as not to be idle and even not to have time so much almost as to think of matrimony for i think none but idlers do think on it and as to play i am so far averse to any thing that is attended with hazard and uncertainty that i decline matrimony on that account being with respect to the hazard of it a species of gaming  the ladies are much obliged to you for being their advocate all the men of honor will surely be married immediately there will scarce be a girl left for by the gascoon story you have plainly shown that those that marry and have families must of necessity be cowards and yet i dont know how to think them so since they dare marry  as to the two quotations out of milton and dryden pray read the following ones out of the same authors and reconcile them   oh why did god creator wise that peopled highest heaven with spirits masculine create at last this novelty on earth this fair defect of nature and not fill the world at once with men as angels without feminine or find some other way to generate mankind this mischief had not then befaln and more that shall befall innumerable disturbances on earth through female snares and strait conjunction with the sex  for either he never shall find out fit mate but such as some misfortune brings him or mistake which infinite calamity shall cause to human life and household peace confound milton marriage thou curse of love and snare of life that first debased a mistress to a wife love like a scene at distance shall appear but marriage views the grossdaubd landscape near loves nauseous cure thou cloyst whom thou should please and when thou curst then thou art the disease when hearts are loose thy chain our bodies ties love couples friends but marriage enemies and again  lord of yourself uncumberd with a wise where for a year a month perhaps a night long penitence succeeds a short delight minds are so hardly matched that even the first though paired by heaven in paradise were cursed for man and woman though in one they grow yet first or last return again to two he to gods image she to his was made so farther from the fount the stream at random strayed how could he stand when put to double pain he must a weaker than himself sustain each might have stood perhaps but each alone two wrestlers help to pull each other down not that my verse would blemish all the fair but yet if some be bad it is prudence to beware and better shun the bait than struggle in the snare dryden i would gladly know what end is attained by matrimony you say and it is admitted the bachelor has had particular favors granted him by the fair sex and that he is no novice to their charms what excuse has he then for matrimony only an idle curiosity to try whether the pleasures a woman affords you that has sordidly tied you neck and heels in loads of parchments and settlements and who would have differed with you if your estate had fell short of being adequate to her fortune by  l a year whether those pleasures are more refined than those of a truly generousspirited girl that obliges you without signing and sealing and there is one thing remarkable that the latter neither expects nor desires your affections any longer than she by her continuing agreeable merits them and in case as in all other fair dealings you dont like her you are at your liberty to act as you please but the former in case she does not answer the sample of her face the only one you are permitted to have and proves disagreeable she sticks to you for life and as if touched with birdlime the more you struggle the less you have power so to do  but to return to my estimate i cannot conceive why i should as i find i have made so many of the fair sex my enemies says one i will certainly pull him by the nose another threatens to box my ears a third excludes me from the teatable i am forbid to make my usual visits to them but what is most unreasonable those viragoes i find are all out of the case my estimate has nothing to do with them for their fortunes are so small exclusive of their own dear persons which some more amorous gentlemen may think fortune enough that they will not bear to be estimated but did they but rightly consider is it not more generous to refrain even though contrary to inclination as i proposed till my circumstances can afford to maintain a woman genteelly than marry and with both our fortunes but just barely subsist  did young fellows before they marry but coolly sit down and consider what they were going about and make proper estimates it is to be hoped the number of miserable wives and unprovided children would be very much diminished but in answer to all that can be alleged of the expensiveness of a married state the women cry out the pleasures thereof are so great they are not to be rated according to any expense that attends the purchasing of them it is true batchelors are at a loss to guess what they are and if that will do the fair sex any service i will admit them very great yea next to those of heaven for like them i am sure they are inconceivable  but now i think on it why do i talk of marrying i can have no hopes of such happiness each fair lady is determined not to have the wicked calculating bachelor though they would do well to stay till they are asked no not if he was worth  0 000 l but why because he told the truth if that is to be the case though i dont say i will not have them if they were worth so much and i must have no wife i say content or to use the words of a great man of the law be it so  from what i have said i would not have you think i dislike matrimony or that i would cast an odium on or ridicule that state as some modern batchelors do say they matrimony is like a hungry dog and a bone no sooner is the bone found but the dog wonderfully pleased with the adventure endeavors all he can to devour it but alter the position of the bone take it and tie it to his tail the poor creature runs from it with all his speed nor is he easy till he gets rid of it nor can i commend a gentleman pretty well known in town that lay in almost the worst condition the gratification of a loose passion could bring him to who cried out in a faultering tone to his friend and visitor even this tom is better than matrimony  no   higher of the genial bed by far and with mysterious reverence i deem i am dear sir your very humble servant jack single graysinn we shall conclude our miscellany with the two following songs the man who for life is blessed with a wife is sure in a happy condition go things how they will she sticks by him still she is comforter friend and physician pray where is the joy to trifle and toy yet dread some disaster from beauty but sweet is the bliss of a conjugal kiss where passion is mingled with duty one extravagant whore will cost a man more then twenty good wives that are saving for wives they will spare that their children may share but whores are eternally craving the man who for life is plagued with a wife is sure in a wretched condition go things how they will she sticks by him still and death is his only physician poor man etc to trifle and toy may give a man joy when summoned by love or by beauty but where is the bliss of a conjugal kiss when passion is prompted by duty poor man etc the dog when possessed of mutton the best a bone he may leave at his pleasure but if to his tail it is tied without fail he is harrassd and plagued beyond measure poor curr etc finis
