 april      cambridge joseph reed to joseph reed cambridge   april      dear sir by the express which i sent to philadelphia a few days ago i wrote you a few hasty lines i have little time to do more now as i am hurried in despatching one brigade after another for new york and preparing for my own departure by pointing out the duties of those that remain behind me nothing of importance has occurred in these parts since my last unless it be the resignations of generals ward and fry and the reassumption of the former or retraction on account as he says of its being disagreeable to some of the officers who those officers are i have not heard i have not enquired when the application to congress and notice of it to me came to hand i was disarmed of interposition because it was put upon the footing of duty or conscience the general being persuaded that his health would not allow him to take that share of duty that his office required the officers to whom the resignation is disagreeable have been able no doubt to convince him of his mistake and that his health will admit him to be alert   and active i shall leave him till he can determine yea or nay to command in this quarter general fry that wonderful man has made a most wonderful hand of it his appointment took place the   th january he desired ten days ago that his resignation might take place the   th april he has drawn three hundred and seventyfive dollars never done one days duty scarce been three times out of his house discovered that he was too old and too infirm for a moving camp but remembers that he has been young active and very capable of doing what is now out of his power to accomplish and therefore has left congress to find out another man capable of making if possible a more brilliant figure than he has done add to these the departure of generals lee and thomas taking some little account of spencer and howe and then form an opinion of the generals of this army their councils c  your letter of the   th ultimo contained a very unfavorable account of the carolinas but i am glad to find by the subsequent one of the   d that the prospect brightens and that mr martins first attempt through those universal instruments of tyranny the scotch hath met with its deserved success  the   old proverb of the first blow being half the battle cannot better apply than in these instances the spirits of the vanquished being depressed in proportion as the victors get elated i am glad to find my camp equipage in such forwardness i shall expect to meet it and i hope you at new york for which place i am preparing to set out on thursday or friday next the accounts brought by mr temple  of the favorable disposition in the ministry to accommodate matters does not correspond with their speeches in parliamentâ€”how then does he account for their inconsistency if the commissioners do not come over with full and ample powers to treat with congress i sincerely wish they may never put their feet on american ground as it must be selfevident in the other case that they come over with insidious intentions to distract divide and create as much confusion as possible how then can any man let his passion for reconciliation be never so strong be so blinded and misled as to embrace a measure evidently designed for his destruction no man does no man can wish the restoration of peace more fervently than i do but i hope whenever made it will be upon such terms as will reflect honor upon the councils and wisdom of   america with you i think a change in the american representation necessary frequent appeals to the people can be attended with no bad but may have very salutary effects my countrymen i know from their form of government and steady attachment heretofore to royalty will come reluctantly into the idea of independence but time and persecution bring many wonderful things to pass and by private letters which i have lately received from virginia i find common sense is working a powerful change there in the minds of many men  the four thousand men destined for boston on the  th if the ministerialists had attempted our works on   dorchester or the lines at roxbury were to have been headed by old put but he would have had pretty easy work of it as his motions were to have been regulated by signals and those signals from appearances he was not to have made the attempt unless the town had been drained or very considerably weakened of its force i believe i mentioned in my last to you that all those who took upon themselves the style and title in boston of governments men have shipped themselves off in the same hurry but under greater disadvantages than the kings i think it idle to keep up the distinction of ministerial troops have done being obliged in a manner to man their own vessels seamen not being to be had for the kings transports and submit to all the hardships that can be conceived one or two of them have committed what it would have been happy for mankind if more of them had done long ago the act of suicide by all accounts a more miserable set of beings does not exist than these taught to believe that the power of great britain was almost omnipotent and if it was not that foreign aid was at hand they were higher and more insulting in their opposition than the regulars themselves when the order issued therefore for embarking the troops in boston no electric shock no sudden flash of lightning in a word not even the last trump could have struck them with greater consternation they were at their wits end and conscious of their black ingratitude chose to commit themselves in the manner before described to the mercy of the   winds and waves in a tempestuous season rather than meet their offended countrymen and with this declaration i am told they have done it that if they could have thought that the most abject submission would have procured peace for them they would have humbled themselves in the dust and kissed the rod that should be held out for chastisement unhappy wretches deluded mortals would it not be good policy to grant a generous amnesty and conquer these people by a generous forgiveness i am with mrs washingtons compliments joined with my own to mrs reed dear sir c    p s i have this instant received an express from governor cooke informing me that a man of war is just arrived in the harbor at new port and that twentyseven sail of vessels supposed to be part of the fleet from boston are within seconet point i have ordered general sullivans brigade which marched from hence on friday afternoon to file off immediately for providence and general greenes which was to begin its march today to repair immediately to that place  g w george washington   april      cambridge brigadiergeneral arnold to brigadiergeneral arnold in canada cambridge   april      sir your favor of the   th of february is come to hand i much fear you will be much disappointed   in the number of troops you expected in that month as the lakes were impassable major general thomas will long before you receive this have informed you of the success of our operations here the enemy have quitted this harbor last week we have no certain accounts of their destination it is generally believed they are gone to halifax if true it is probable they will attempt to penetrate canada on the opening of the st lawrence i hope before that happens you will be in full possession of quebec and have its avenues well secured upon which depends the fate of this campaign in these parts i have despatched two companies of colonel knoxs regiment of artillery to you hence two mortars c as you will see at the foot hereof if any thing else is wanting that cannot be had in canada and in my power to send they shall be forwarded with all possible expedition upon my being informed thereof the chief part of the troops are marched from hence towards new york i will set off tomorrow if the enemy will not find us full employment and it is necessary you may expect a detachment from thence to your assistance i am very sorry that the gentlemen from new york and other officers should think themselves neglected in the new arrangement it is true that i reserved places in this army for those officers who went from hence under your command the congress have since informed me that they would be provided for in the army raised for canada i was not acquainted with the gentlemen who complain nor with their circumstances there is little doubt but   their merits will be rewarded in due time  i am very sensible of the many difficulties you have had to encounter your conduct under them does you great honor as general thomas will take the burthen off your shoulders i hope you will soon gather strength sufficient to assist in finishing the important work which you have with so much glory to yourself and service to your country hitherto conducted as i am informed that there is a furnace somewhere near you where shells and shot of any size can be cast i would recommend to general thomas to have what quantity of each that may be wanting immediately prepared the roads are so very bad that it is impossible to send you any great number of these necessary articles from hence i have appointed captain lamb who is a prisoner at quebec to be second major in the regiment of artillery commanded by colonel henry knox the gentlemen of this family return you their compliments and my best wishes attend general thomas i remain sir yours c george washington   april      cambridge to the president of congress cambridge   april      sir i was honored with your favors of the   st and   th ulto on the  d instant the former by mr hanson c the latter by fessenden i heartily  0 wish the money had arrived sooner that the militia might have been paid as soon as their time of service expired the disappointment has given them great uneasiness and they are gone home much dissatisfied nor have i been without severe complaints from the other troops on the same account when i get to new york i hope a sufficient sum will be there ready to pay every claim  it is not in my power to make report of the deficiency of arms in compliance with the direction of congress at this time as some of the regiments are at and most of the others on their march to new york nor do i know that it would answer any good purpose if it were having made repeated application to the several assemblies and conventions upon the subject and constantly received for answer that they could afford no relief when i arrive at new york i shall in pursuance of the order of congress detach four battalions to canada if the situation of affairs will admit of it and shall be extremely happy if they and the troops already there can effect the important end of their going in my letter of the  st inst and per post i enclosed you a copy of a letter from governor cooke advising me of the arrival of a ship of war c at and near the harbor of newport i have now the pleasure to inform you that the report was entirely premature    and without any foundation you have a copy of his letter of the  st inst to this effect i wish the alarm had never been given it occasioned general sullivan and his brigade to make an unnecessary and inconvenient diversion from their route enclosed is a copy of an account presented by the honorable general court of powder furnished the continental army by this colony from the account it appears that part of it was supplied before the army was under my command and therefore i know nothing of it but have not the smallest doubt of the justice of the charge i shall leave about two hundred barrels of this article with major general ward out of which congress will direct him to make a return if they think proper and also repayment of what may have been furnished by the other governments a proclamation of general howes issued a few days before his departure from town having fallen into my hands i have enclosed you a copy which may probably have been the occasion of large quantities of goods being carried away and the removal of many persons which otherwise would not have happened  colonel warren paymastergeneral finding the army likely to be removed from hence informed me the other day that the situation of his affairs and engagements    in the business of the colony are such as to prevent him personally attending the army and offered in case it should be required to resign this was rather embarrassing to me it appears indispensably necessary that the paymastergeneral with his books should be at or near headquarters indeed it is usual for the head of every department in the army however dispersed that army may be to be with the commanding general keeping deputies in the smaller departments on the other hand colonel warrens merit and attachment to the cause are such that i could do nothing less than desire as some money must be left for the pay and contingent charges of the army which will remain here that he would wait here till congress shall be pleased to give their sentiments upon the matter  sending in the meantime some person in whom he could confide with the money but little of which there will be to carry tho great the demands as nine of the regiments which have marched to new york have only received Â£ 00 each towards their pay for the months of february and march and others not one farthing i hope therefore this matter will be considered by congress and the result transmitted me as soon as done i would also mention to congress that the militia regiments which were last called upon in making up their abstracts charged pay the officers from the time they received orders to raise companies and the privates from the time they respectively engaged to    come or were called upon though they did not march for a considerable time after some not within three four to twenty days and during all which they remained at home about their own private affairs without doing any thing else than preparing for the march as they say by way of plea this appeared to me so exceedingly unreasonable and so contrary to justice that the public should pay for a longer time than from the day of their march to that of their return that i ordered the abstracts to be made out accordingly and refused to give warrants on any other terms they say that the enlisting orders which went out from their governments give them the pay they claim the fact may be that something in these may seem to authorize it but i must submit it to congress and wish for their decision whether the continent must pay it  i am c p s i shall set off today  george washington   april      cambridge richard henry lee to richard henry lee cambridge   april      dear sir your favor of the   th ult came to my hands last night by the post but as i am upon the point of setting out for new york by the way of providence and norwich i can do little more than acknowledge the receipt of it and thank you for the proceedings    and ordinances of the virginia convention which came safely to hand at present the lakes are in an impassable state neither being clear of ice nor covered with such as will admit of transportation at present also our troops are at different stages on their march from hence to new york nor is it possible for me till i get there as the congress have annexed conditions to my sending the four battalions to canada to tell whether they can be spared or not as i am unacquainted with the number of men or strength of the works at that place no time shall be lost in forwarding three battalions if there is a possibility of doing it with safety as no person can be more sensible of the importance of securing canada than i am a letter of the   th ult from general schuyler informs me that there are many men now stopped at albany on account of the state the ice is in on the lakes i thank you for your friendly congratulations on the retreat of the kings troops from boston it was really a flight their embarkation was so precipitate their loading so confused after making greater havoc of the kings stores than dunbar did upon braddocks defeat which made so much noise that it took them eleven days to fit their transports adjust the loads of them and take in water from the islands in nantasket road after they had fallen down there the coast is now clear of them except the renown a  0 gun ship and one or two frigates which remain here for the protection of such transports as shall be bound to this port i    pray you to make my best wishes acceptable to the good doctor his lady and family c and believe me to be as i really am c  george washington    april      new york commodore eseck hopkins to commodore eseck hopkins  new york    april      sir i have just received information that the nautilus sloop of war is arrived here from newport said to be    sent express from thence for the asia phÅ“nix and savage and that they are intended for new london in order to block up your squadron in that harbor i thought it my duty to give you notice of this by express that you might take your measures accordingly  the phÅ“nix savage and nautilus sailed this morning the asia still remains in the harbor i should be much obliged to you if you would forward the cannon and stores i left a list with you for as soon as possible and as the menofwar are now out i should be extremely glad if you would keep a good look out to see that the coast is clear before any more of the continental troops embark from new london i am very respectfully sir your most obedient servant     george washington    april      new york to the president of congress new york    april      sir i am now to inform you that on the  th instant i set out from cambridge and arrived here on saturday last i came through providence norwich and new london in order to see and expedite the embarkation of the troops the third brigade under the command of general greene was at new london when i left it where there was a sufficient number of transports to embark them and most probably they would have arrived here before this had it not been for a severe storm which happened the night they    sailed which dispersed them and i fear has done them some injury general spencer with the last brigade marched from roxbury the day i left cambridge and would be at new london ready to embark in the return transports which brought general sullivans division to this place the whole of the troops may be reasonably expected here in the course of this week the badness of the roads and difficulty of procuring teams for bringing the stores and baggage have greatly prolonged their arrival at this place i have not had time since i came to look fully about me but find many works of defence begun and some finished the troops are much dispersed some on long island others on staten island c i have ordered four battalions from hence to canada and am taking measures to have them forwarded to albany by water with all possible expedition this will greatly expedite their arrival and ease the men of much fatigue i have written general schuyler of their coming that he may have necessary measures taken to hurry their march to general thomas  i am informed by general putnam that the militia    that were called in for the support of this town in case the ministerial army had arrived before our troops are all discharged it being unnecessary to keep them longer all the ships of war besides the asia moved out of this harbor on saturday and the asia yesterday some of which are now below the narrows and the rest gone to sea your favor of the  0th instant by major sherburne directed to general putnam or the commanding officer here came to hand on saturday evening with three boxes of money which i shall deliver to the paymaster as soon as he arrives and transmit you his receipt for the same having received information from hence before my departure from cambridge that thirty pieces of heavy cannon were wanting and essentially necessary for the defence of this place in addition to those already here i took the liberty of applying to admiral hopkins whom i saw at new london for that number with the mortars and stores he brought from providence island a list of which he had transmitted you he told me that as many were wanting for the defence of providence river and the harbor at new london it was uncertain whether i could have all i wanted but that he would send me all that could be spared  i have not been able to get a return of the troops since i came as soon as i do it i will send it to you i am sir c   0 george washington    april      new york joseph reed to joseph reed new york    april      my dear sir your favor of the   th was this instant put into my hands scarce time enough to acknowledge the receipt of it by this post and to thank you for your great care and attention in providing my camp equipage whatever the list you sent may fall short of your intention of providing can be got here and may be delayed as the want or not of them will depend upon circumstances i am exceedingly concerned to hear of the divisions and parties which prevail with you and in the southern colonies on the score of independence these are the shelves we have to avoid or our bark will split and tumble to pieces here lies our great danger and i almost tremble when i think of this rock nothing but disunion can hurt our cause this will ruin it if great prudence temper and moderation is not mixed in our counsels and made the governing principles of the contending parties  when my    good sir will you be with me i fear i shall have a difficult card to play in this government new york and could wish for your assistance and advice to manage it i have not time to add more except that with great sincerity and truth i am dear sir your most obedient and affectionate humble servant p s mrs washington c came the hartford road and not yet arrivedâ€”detaind by the illness on the road of poor mr custis who is now better and coming on  george washington    april      to the committee of safety of new york headquarters    april      gentlemen there is nothing that could add more to my happiness than to go hand in hand with the civil authority of this or any other government to which it may be my lot to be ordered and if in the prosecution of such measures as shall appear to me to have a manifest tendency to promote the interest of the great american cause i shall encounter the local convenience    of individuals or even of a whole colony i beg it may be believed that i shall do it with reluctance and pain but in the present important contest the least of two evils must be preferred that a continuance of the intercourse which has hitherto subsisted between the inhabitants of this colony and the enemy on board their ships of war is injurious to the common cause requires no extraordinary abilities to prove a moments reflection not only evinces this truth but points out the glaring absurdity of such a procedure we are to consider ourselves either in a state of peace or of war with great britain if the former why are our ports shut up our trade destroyed our property seized our towns burnt and our worthy and valuable citizens    led into captivity and suffering the most cruel hardships if the latter my imagination is not fertile enough to suggest a reason in support of the intercourse in the weak and defenceless state in which this city was some time ago political prudence might justify the correspondence that subsisted between the country and the enemys ships of war but as the largest part of the continental troops is now here as many strong works are erected and erecting for the defence of the city and harbor those motives no longer exist but are absorbed in others of a more important nature to tell you gentlemen that the advantages of an intercourse of this kind are altogether on the side of the enemy whilst we derive not the smallest benefit from it would be telling what must be obvious to every one it is indeed so glaring that even the enemy themselves must despise us for suffering it to be continued for besides their obtaining supplies of every kind by which they are enabled to continue in your harbors it also opens a regular channel of intelligence by which they are from time to time made acquainted with the number and extent of our works our strength and all our movements by which they are enabled to regulate their own plans to our great disadvantage and injury for the truth of this i could produce instances but as it may be the subject of future discussion i decline it at present it would gentlemen be taking up too much of your time to use further arguments in proof of the necessity of putting an immediate and total stop to all further correspondence with the enemy    it is my incumbent duty to effect this convinced as i am of the disadvantages resulting from it and it cannot be thought strange or hard that under such conviction i should be anxious to remove an evil which may contribute not a little to the ruin of the great cause we are engaged in and may in its effects prove highly detrimental to this colony in particular in effecting the salutary purposes above mentioned i could wish for the concurrence and support of your honorable body it certainly adds great weight to the measures adopted when the civil authority coÃ¶perates with the military to carry them into execution it would also redound much to the honor of the government and of your committee in particular for the world is apt to judge from appearances  and    while such a correspondence exists the reputation of the whole colony will suffer in the eyes of their american brethren it is therefore gentlemen that i have taken the liberty to address you on this important subject relying on your zeal and attachment to the cause of american liberty for your assistance in putting a stop to this evil and that you will coÃ¶perate with me in such measures as shall be effectual either to prevent any future correspondence with the enemy or in bringing to condign punishment such persons as may be hardy and wicked enough to carry it on otherwise than by a prescribed mode if any case can possibly arise to require it i have the honor to be with the utmost respect gentlemen c    george washington    april      new york to the president of congress  new york    april      sir permit me through you to convey to the honorable congress the sentiments of gratitude i feel for the high honor they have done me in the public mark of    approbation contained in your favor of the  d instant which came to hand last night i beg you to assure them that it will ever be my highest ambition to approve myself a faithful servant of the public and that to be in any degree instrumental in procuring to    my american brethren a restitution of their just rights and privileges will constitute my chief happiness agreeable to your request i have communicated in general orders to the officers and soldiers under my command the thanks of congress for their good behavior in the service and i am happy in having such an opportunity of doing justice to their merit they were indeed at first a band of undisciplined husbandmen but it is under god to their bravery and attention to their duty that i am indebted for that success which has procured me the only reward i wish to receive the affection and esteem of my countrymen the medal intended to be presented to me by your honorable body i shall carefully preserve as a memorial of their regard i beg leave to return you sir my warmest thanks for the polite manner in which you have been pleased to express their sentiments of my conduct and am with sincere esteem and respect sir your and their most obedient and most humble servant george washington    april      new york majorgeneral schuyler to majorgeneral schuyler new york    april      dear sir yours of the   th instant from fort george was delivered me with the enclosures yesterday by express i agree with you that the intelligence is very alarming and requires the strictest attention  the    four regiments ordered from hence are now embarking and i hope will soon be with you i need not urge the necessity of forwarding them from albany with all possible despatch you will have with the troops five hundred barrels of provisions the commissarygeneral  0 expects every moment a large quantity from connecticut and what can be spared of it shall be sent to you in the same bottoms without delay what general lee contracted for is not yet delivered his sudden and unexpected departure to the southward left the contractors at a loss where to deliver the provisions and apply for the pay the commissarygeneral has since renewed the contract and ordered them to send provisions here i have ordered a return to be made of the state of our magazine and if the powder you request can possibly be spared you shall have it i have wrote to congress to know whether they would incline to send you a further reinforcement of men but we are yet in a very uncertain situation not knowing where the enemy may bend their force and constant applications are made from all quarters of the seacoast for a supply of men and ammunition the recruits that have been raised here are totally unfurnished with arms and what is still worse we do not know where to procure them     you who know the temper and disposition of the savages will i doubt not think with me that it will be impossible to keep them in a state of neutrality i have urged upon congress the necessity of engaging them on our side to prevent their taking an active part against us which would be a most fatal stroke under our present circumstances  the commotions    among the canadians are really alarming i am afraid proper measures have not been taken to conciliate their affections but rather that they have been insulted and injured than which nothing could have a greater tendency to ruin our cause in that country for human nature is such that it will adhere to the side from whence the best treatment is received i therefore conjure you sir to recommend to the officers and soldiers in the strongest terms to treat all the inhabitants canadians english and savages with tenderness and respect paying them punctually for what they receive or giving them such certificates as will enable them to receive their pay as you are perfectly well acquainted with the country and its inhabitants in and about albany i think it would be best for you to remain there at least until the troops and all their supplies are forwarded from thence to canada besides the four regiments ordered for that service i shall send a company of riflemen a company of artificers and two engineers i beg you will continue to furnish me with intelligence of every interesting occurrence and believe me most affectionately your obedient humble servant george washington  0 april      to the new york committee of safety  0 april      gentlemen i thank you for the polite and ready attention you paid to my requisition of the   th instant when the civil  military powers cooperate and    afford mutual aid to each other there can be little doubt of things going wellâ€”i have now to request the favor of your information in what manner and in what time a body of  000 or   00 militia might be collected from this colony for actual service upon any sudden emergency although we may not and i trust in god shall not have occasion for their aidâ€”common prudence does nevertheless dictate the expediency of a preconcerted plan for calling them in that in case of necessity they may be drawn together in proper corps without tumult or disorder and at the same time with the utmost expeditionâ€”this will not be the case if men are not regularly embodied and notified that they are to step forth at a moments warning the idea that strikes me as the properest to be pursued at present is to establish out of the continental forces good lookouts on the heights and head lands at the entrance of the harbor who upon the appearance of a fleet shall make such signals as being answered from place to place shall convey the earliest intelligence to head quarters of the strength and approach of the enemyâ€”these signals for greater certainty to be followed by expresses and then in case anything formidable should appear for the committee of safety if sitting if not those to whom the power shall be delegated upon application from the commanding officer of the continental forces to order in two or more battallions as the exigency of the case may require or for greater dispatch such militia or part of them as    shall be allotted to this service by the committee might be assembled if in the town or vicinity by signals to be agreed on a mode of proceeding of a similar kind concerted with jersey would bring in a reinforcement speedily and without those irregularities and unnecessary expences which but too frequently attend the movement of militia thus gentlemen i have expressd my sentiment to you upon the occasionâ€”your prudence will suggest to you the necessity of adopting these or other methods of a like nature and your wisdom will point out the most effectual and expeditious manner of carrying them into executionâ€”i therefore submit them to your consideration and am with great respect c george washington    april      new york to the president of congress new york    april      sir i was this day honored with the receipt of your favor of the  0th instant i have now the pleasure to acquaint you that the four regiments designed for canada embarked yesterday with a fair wind for albany under the command of colonels greaton patterson bond and poor besides which there was a company of riflemen a company of artificers and two engineers the whole commanded by brigadiergeneral thompson i have repeatedly mentioned to the honorable congress the distressful situation we are in for want of    arms with much pains and difficulty i got most of the regiments from the eastward tolerably well furnished but i find the new york regiments very badly provided colonel ritzemas has scarcely any and yet these men being enlisted during the war and at five dollars per month ought not in my judgment to be discharged as we find it almost as difficult to get men as arms this is a matter of some importance which i should be glad to receive the particular opinion of congress upon  mr baldwin is one of the assistantengineers ordered to canada he is indeed a very useful man in his department but he declined the service on account of his pay which he says is inadequate to his support in order to induce him to continue i promised to represent his case to congress and would recommend an increase of his pay and that he should have the rank of lieutenantcolonel of which he is very deserving i beg leave therefore to recommend him to the congress and that they would make provision for him accordingly  a few days ago application was made to me by the committee of safety for this colony for an exchange of prisoners for the particulars i beg leave to refer you to their letter a copy of which you have enclosed as there is a standing order of congress that no sailors or soldiers shall be exchanged for citizens i did not incline to comply with the request    without the particular direction of congress but i have been since informed that the prisoners mentioned in the committees letter as citizens are really seamen taken from private vessels but not in arms how far this may alter the case or how far the reasons which induced the congress to pass the resolve abovementioned may still exist must be left to their determination the militia who on my application were ordered to this place to keep possession until i should arrive with the continental forces were obliged to return home without their pay as there was not then money sufficient in the treasury for that purpose and to answer the exigencies of the army this occasioned great uneasiness among them and may be attended with very bad consequences in case we should have occasion for their service on any future emergency i therefore beg the congress would make provision for their pay and point out particularly whether it is to be done by the commander of the continental forces or by the provincial assemblies or conventions from whence they are sent as the time for which the riflemen enlisted will expire on the  st of july next and as the loss of such a valuable and brave body of men will be of great injury to the service i would submit it to the consideration of congress whether it would not be best to adopt some method to induce them to continue they are indeed a very useful corps but i need not mention this as their importance is already well known to the congress it is necessary they should    pay an early attention to this matter as we know from past experience that men are very slow in reenlisting  when i had the honor of seeing admiral hopkins at new london he represented to me the weak state of his fleet occasioned by sickness and the damage he received in his engagement with the enemy  and requested i would spare him two hundred men to assist him in a design he had formed of attacking wallace this i readily consented to and the men are to be returned as soon as the service is performed i wish it was in my power at present to furnish general lee with the companies of artillery he desires  i have already sent two companies to quebec and i have not yet been able to procure a return of those that are here i expect colonel knox every moment and shall then be able to determine whether any can be spared from hence  blankets we are in great want of ourselves and it was with great difficulty a few could be procured for the riflemen that were ordered for canada    i enclose you mr winthrops receipt for two hundred thousand dollars brought some time ago from philadelphia by major sherburne which you will please to deliver to the continental treasurers on my arrival here i found that mr livingston had been appointed by the provincial congress a commissary to furnish the continental troops stationed in this city with provisions i suppose this was done because there was no continental commissary then on the spot mr livingston still claims a right of furnishing all the troops but those lately arrived from cambridge mr trumbull is now here and as i consider him as the principal in that office i should be glad to know whether any part of the continental troops is to be furnished by any other than the commissary general i must needs say that to me it appears very inconsistent and must create great confusion in the accounts as well as in the contracts i intended to have laid before congress the amount of the rations as supplied by colonel trumbull and mr livingston and called upon those gentlemen to furnish me with a separate estimate for that purpose col trumbull has given me his by which it appears he supplies the troops at  â…“d per ration i have not yet received any from mr livingston but am informed his contract is at  0Â½d the difference is immense as it will amount to no less than two hundred pounds per day for  0000 men it is indeed to be considered that mr livingstons contract is including every other charge and that to mr trumbulls must be added store hire clerks and every other    contingent expense but even then it will not amount to so much as mr livingstons by a penny per ration which in the gross will be something very considerable i thought it my duty without prejudice or partiality to state the matter fairly to congress that they might take such order upon it as to them shall seem necessary i cannot however in justice to mr trumbull help adding that he has been indefatigable in supplying the army and i believe from his connections in new england is able to do it on as good terms as any person in america the several matters contained in the foregoing i must beg the early attention of congress to and that i may be favored with an answer as soon as possible  george washington    april      new york to the president of congress new york    april      sir in a letter which i had the honor to receive from congress some considerable time ago they were pleased to ask what rank aidsdecamp bore in the army from whence i concluded that they had adverted to the extraordinary trouble and confinement of those gentlemen with a view to make them an adequate allowance but nothing being since done or said of the matter i take the liberty unsolicited by and unknown to my aidsdecamp to inform your honorable body that their pay is not by any means equal to their trouble and confinement  0 no person wishes more to save money to the public than i do and no person has aimed more at it but there are some cases in which parsimony may be illplaced and this i take to be one aidsdecamp are persons in whom entire confidence must be placed it requires men of abilities to execute the duties with propriety and despatch where there is such a multiplicity of business as must attend the commanderinchief of such an army as ours and persuaded i am that nothing but the zeal of those gentlemen who live with me and act in this capacity for the great american cause and personal attachment to me have induced them to undergo the trouble and confinement they have experienced since they have become members of my family i give in to no kind of amusements myself and consequently those about me can have none but are confined from morning till eve hearing and answering the applications and letters of one and another which will now i expect receive a considerable addition as the business of the northern and eastern departments if i continue here must i suppose pass through my hands if these gentlemen had the same relaxation from duty as other officers have in their common routine there would not be so much in it but to have the mind always upon the stretch scarce ever unbent and no hours for recreation makes a material odds knowing this and at the same time how inadequate the pay is i can scarce find inclination to impose the necessary duties of their office upon them to what i have here said this further remark may be made and it is a matter    of no small concernment to me and in its consequences to the public and that is that while the duty is hard and the pay small it is not to be wondered at if there should be found a promptness in them to seek preferment or in me to do justice to them by facilitating their views by which means i must lose their aid when they have it most in their power to assist me influenced by these motives i have taken the liberty of laying the matter fully and with all due deference before your honorable body not doubting its meeting with a patient hearing  i am c  george washington    april      new york joseph reed to joseph reed new york    april      my dear sir i have been favored with several of your letters since i came to this place some of them indeed after getting pretty well advanced on the road towards bostonâ€”my extreame hurry with one kind of business and engagement or another leaves me little more than time to express my concern for your indisposition and the interposition of other obstacles to prevent me from receiving that aid from you which i have been wishing for  hourly expecting your letter of the   th descriptive of the jealousies and uneasinesses which exist among the members of congress is really alarmingâ€”if the house is divided the fabrick must fall and a few individuals    perish in the ruinsâ€”for the occurrences of this place i shall beg leave to refer you to mr palfrey who at the particular request of mr hancock comes to philadelphia the sooner my camp equipage is sent to this place the better that it may be ready for any service i may be sent or find necessary to go uponâ€”if you could hire horses to bring the waggon c to this place and could conveniently and readily sell those two you bought i would now rather wish it as the use for them is uncertain and the expense of keeping provender being both scarce and dear greatâ€”to which may be added that i have not the same occasion now as when i first required them having taken four of the troop horses which were found in boston and which answered the purpose exceeding well from cambridge here to fit out my baggage waggons i do not mean however by what i have said that you should with hold the horses if you cannot immediately  readily dispose of them without loss inclosed is a letter to mr hancock for payment for the whole i am with sincere esteem and regard dr sir c george washington    april      new york samuel tucker to samuel tucker  new york    april      sir the readiness shewn by the committee of safety for the province of new jersey to succor this place with their militia on a late occasion when they where    at my request called upon by brigadier general the earl of stirling and the alacrity with which i am informed the militia then stepped forward in defence of their country are sufficient proofs of the important service the province of new jersey is capable of rendering in support of the great cause of american liberty especially if the millitia of that province be put under such regulations as will enable them to give their aid at the very time it may be wanted and without the least delay possible what renders such a regulation the more necessary is that in the present situation of affairs it is more than probable that the approach of the enemy will be sudden and without our having long notice of their being on the coast late experience has taught us that under the present regulation it will take at least a fortnight after the necessity of the requisition is seen to assemble and embody any considerable detachment of the militia whereof it seems absolutely necessary that there be a resolution of your congress or committee of safety for alloting a particular number of your millitia to march on the first notice of the approach of the enemy the detachment from each regiment should be fixed upon who should march to certain places of rendezvous on the first alarm by regulated signals a regulation of such signals was lately made by lord stirling for the highlands of neversinks and staten island a copy of which with some alteration i now send you and which i think are very proper for the purposeâ€”the two last of which should be repeated    at a number of eminences in your provinceâ€”and if on the signal of the appearance of a large fleet the detachments of your militia were ordered to rendezvous at brunswick amboy woodbridge raway elizabeth town newark and bergen they might be ready in a day or two to march to such place either in your province or in this as would be found to stand most in need of their assistance and in order to avoid the inconveniences which may arise from the absence of your provincial generals from that part of the country where the troops may assemble it will be necessary that the colonels and commanding officers of every corps or detachment be directed strictly to obey the orders they may receive from the continental general to whom that department may be allotted i am c  george washington    april      new york to the president of congress new york    april      sir i have not yet heard that there has been any trial of the prizes carried into massachusetts bay this procrastination is attended with very bad consequences    some of the vessels i had fitted out are now laid up the crews being dissatisfied that they cannot get their prizemoney i have tired the congress upon this subject but the importance of it makes me again mention that if a summary way of proceeding is not resolved on it will be impossible to get our vessels manned i must also mention to you sir that captain manly and his crew are desirous to know when they may expect their part of the value of the ordnance stores taken last fall they are anxious to know what the amount may be as the inventory of that cargo is in the hands of congress i would humbly submit it to them whether a valuation thereof should not be made and the captors dividend be remitted to them as soon as possible it will give them spirit and encourage them to be alert in looking out for other prizes several officers belonging to the regiments raised in these middle colonies inform me that their men notwithstanding their agreement begin to murmur at the distinction of pay made between them and the regiments from the eastward i should be glad that the congress would attend to this in time lest it may get to such a pitch as will make it difficult to suppress they argue that they perform the same duty undergo the same fatigue and receive five dollars when the eastern regiments receive six dollars and two thirds per month  for my own part i wish    they were all upon the same footing for if the british army will not face this way it will be necessary to detach a great part of our troops in that case i should for many reasons be sorry there should be any distinctions of regiments that are all in pay of the united colonies the deficiency of arms in the new york regiments especially is very great if i am rightly informed there are scarce as many in colonel ritzemas regiment as will arm one company can the congress remedy this evil if they can there should not be lost a moment in effecting it as our strength at present is in reality on paper only should we think of discharging those men who are without arms the remedy would be worse than the disease for by vigorous exertions i hope arms may be procured and i well know that the raising men is extremely difficult especially to be engaged during the continuance of the war which is the footing on which col ritzemas regiment is engaged april   thâ€”i had wrote thus far before i was honored with your favor of the   d instant in obedience to the order therein contained i have directed six regiments more for canada which will embark as soon as vessels and other necessaries can be provided  these regiments will be commanded by general sullivan i shall give him instructions to join the forces in that country under general thomas as soon as possible with respect to sending more troops to that country i am really at a loss what to advise as it is impossible    at present to know the designs of the enemy  should they send the whole force under general howe up the river st lawrence to relieve quebec and recover canada the troops gone and now going will be insufficient to stop their progress and should they think proper to send that or an equal force this way from great britain for the purpose of possessing this city and securing the navigation of hudsons river the troops left here will not be sufficient to oppose them and yet for any thing we know i think it not improbable they may attempt both both being of the greatest importance to them if they have men i could wish indeed that the army in canada should be more powerfully reinforced at the same time i am conscious that the trusting of this important post which is now become the grand magazine of america to the handful of men remaining here is running too great a risk the securing of this post and hudsons river is to us also of so great importance that i cannot at present advise the sending any more troops from hence on the contrary the general officers now here whom i thought it my duty to consult think it absolutely necessary to increase the army at this place with at least ten thousand men especially when it is considered that from this place only the army in canada must draw its supplies of ammunition provisions and most probably of men and that all reinforcements can be sent    from hence much easier than from any other place by the enclosed return you will see the state of the army here and that the number of effective men is far short of what the congress must have expected  i have found it necessary to order colonel daytons regiment from new jersey to march as one of the six to canada wherefore i must reccommend it to congress to order two companies of one of the regiments still in pennsylvania to march to cape may which can be done much sooner  for had this destination of that regiment not taken place it would have been very inconvenient to detach two companies from it to that place as the march would according to lord stirlings and other accounts have been at least two hundred miles from amboy and they must have passed within twenty miles of philadelphia there being no practicable road along the seacoast of new jersey for their baggage to have passed doctor potts who is bearer hereof was i understand appointed director of the hospital for the middle colonies but the army being removed with the general hospital from the eastward does in course supercede him he is inclined to go to canada where he may be very useful if a person is not already appointed for that department i would humbly beg leave to ask the congress whether in all these appointments    it would not be best to have but one chief to whom all the others should be subordinate  george washington    april      new york governor trumbull to governor trumbull new york    april      sir when you did me the honor of a visit at norwich on my way to this place i communicated to you the recommendation i had received from congress for sending four battalions from hence to reinforce our troops in canada i now beg leave to inform you that in compliance therewith on saturday and sunday last i detached four regiments thence under the command of brigadiergeneral thompson and by an express received last night i am ordered by congress in addition to those already gone to send six more immediately  our regiments being incomplete and much wanting in numbers i need not add that the army here felt a sensible diminution by this detachment and when the second is gone it will be weak indeed considering the importance of this place and the many extensive posts which must be guarded for its defence and added to this almost the whole of our valuable ordnance stores and magazines will be deposited here for these reasons it appears to  0 me expedient that some mode should be adopted without loss of time by this your and the jersey government for throwing in immediate succors upon the appearance of the enemy or any case of emergency i have wrote to the congress of new jersey upon the subject praying them to form such regulations respecting their militia they being the only resource we have that assistance may be had on the earliest notice of an approach by the enemy for preventing the fatal and alarming consequences which might result from the common tedious and slow methods generally used for obtaining their aid and would take the liberty of mentioning that if the same should be done by you and your honorable council respecting your militia or such part of them as are nearest to this place the most salutary ends might result therefrom the benefits flowing from a timely succor being too obvious for repetition i shall propose with all possible deference for your consideration whether it would not be advisable to have some select corps of men appointed under proper officers in the western parts of your government to repair to this place on the earliest notice from the general or officer commanding here of the appearance of an enemy if it should be thought necessary upon an emergency in the first instance to resort to you and for all the ordinary forms to be gone through before any succors can be ordered in it is to be feared that the relief would be too late to answer any good purposes this however i shall submit to you in full confidence    of your most ready assistance on every occasion and that such measures as appear to you most likely to advance the public good in this and every other instance will be most cheerfully adopted i am sir with great esteem c george washington    april      new york to the committee of safety of new york new york    april      gentlemen in answer to your favor of the   th delivered to me yesterday i shall beg leave to inform you that it was my design to have included the militia of this city in the  000 or   00 men which i thought might be wanted upon an emergency but whether common prudence may not dictate the expediency of extending your views to a greater number in case of necessity is submitted to the wisdom of your boardâ€” the signals which i intended should convey the first notice of the approach of an enemys fleet you will find in the inclosed paper but if you will please to appoint a committee of your body i will desire the brigadiers sullivan greene and lord sterling to meet them  adopt a better if a better can be thought of new jersey is already advertized of these signals if the four battalions which were directed to be raised under the command of the colonels mcdougall clinton ritzema and wynkoop are placed under the immediate care of the committee of safety for this colony by congress i should be glad to know how far it is conceived that my powers over    them extend or whether i have any at all sure i am that they cannot be subjected to the direction of both and i shall have no small reluctance in asuming an authority i am not vested with powers to execute nor will my solicitude further than as a wellwisher to the cause on account of arms for and returns of these regiments continue if they are not considered as within the line of my command it becomes therefore my indispensable duty to be ascertained of this matter and to know whether these regiments cannot be ordered out of the colonyâ€”for instance to new jersey if necessity should require it  it would give me singular pleasure to advance you the sum asked for but the low state of our cash and heavy demands upon the paymaster render it altogether impracticable at this time the quarter    master and commissary are both wanting money and cannot be supplied nor can genl ward get what he has sent for to pay the five regiments to the eastward till a fresh supply arrives of which congress is informed genl heath since my arrival here has obtained a warrant upon the paymaster for money to replace the sum which your committee kindly lent him and to the best of my recollection genl thompson told me that he also meant to do the same these matters shall be enquired into i am c     george washington   th april      new york majorgeneral ward to majorgeneral ward new york   th april      sir it is with great concern i learn from every hand that your works for the defence of boston and the harbour go on exceeding slow i must entreat you therefore to push colo gridley on to a diligent and faithful discharge of his duty in this particularâ€”we cannot possibly tell where the enemy will pitch their tents nextâ€”if boston is left open and unguarded it may be a temptation to go there but at any rate no time should be lost in putting the town in the best posture of defense the nature of the case will admit of i shall be glad in your next to receive a particular acct of what has been done towards fortifying the harbor four regiments to wit poors pattersons seatons and bonds are already off for canada reeds and starks will imbark this day for albany on their road to the same place and four others will follow in a day or two i am sir c     george washington    april      new york john augustine washington to john augustine washington new york    april      dear brother since my arrival at this place i have been favored with two or three of your letters and thank you for your kind and frequent remembrance of me if i should not write to you as often as you do to me you must attribute it to its true cause and that is the hurry and multiplicity of business in which i am constantly engaged from the time i rise out of my bed till i go into it again i wrote to you a pretty full account just before i left cambridge of the movements of the two armies and now refer you to it since that time i have brought the whole army which i had in the new england governments five regiments excepted and left behind for the defence of boston and the stores we have there to this place and eight days ago detached four regiments for canada    and am now embarking six more for the same place as there are reasons to believe that a push will be made there this campaign and things in that country not being in a very promising way either with respect to the canadians or indians these detachments have weakened us very considerably in this important post where i am sorry to add there are too many inimical persons but as our affairs in canada can derive no support except what is sent to them and the militia may be called in here it was thought best to strengthen that quarter at the expense of this but i am afraid we are rather too late in doing it from the eastern army under my immediate command it was impossible to do it sooner we have already gone great lengths in fortifying this city and the hudson river a fortnight more will put us in a very respectable posture of defence the works we have already constructed and which they found we were about to erect have put the kings ships to flight for instead of lying within pistolshot of the wharves and their sentries conversing with ours whilst they received every necessary that the country afforded they have now gone down to the hook near thirty miles from this place the last harbor they can get to and i have prevailed upon the committee of safety to forbid every kind of intercourse between the inhabitants of this colony and the enemy this i was resolved upon effecting but i thought it best to bring it about through that channel as i now can pursue my own measures in support of their resolves    mrs washington is still here and talks of taking the smallpox but i doubt her resolution mr and mrs custis will set out in a few days for maryland i did not write to you by the squire because his departure in the first place was sudden in the next i had but little to say i am very sorry to hear that my sister was indisposed when you last wrote i hope she is now recovered of it and that your family are well that they may continue so and that our once happy country may escape the depredations and calamities attending on war is the fervent prayer of dear sir your most affectionate brother mrs washington mr and mrs custis join in love to my sister and the rest of the family  george washington  0 april      new york to the president of congress new york  0 april      sir i mean through you to do myself the honor of laying before congress a copy of an address transmitted to them some time ago by the assembly of rhode island which governor cooke favored me    with in the month of january at the same time requesting me to interest myself in procuring a body of forces on the continental establishment for the defence of that colony i doubt not but the address and subject of it have had the attention and consideration of congress before now but if they have not decided upon the matter i would beg leave to mention that i have made inquiry into the situation and condition of the colony and find it to be as stated in the address and with all deference to the opinion of congress conceive it highly necessary and expedient that they should adopt some measures for relieving their distress and granting the aid prayed for the importance of it rhode island in the chain of union its extensive seacoast affording harbors for our shipping and vessels at the same time exposing and subjecting the inhabitants to the ravages and depredations of our enemies the zeal and attachment which it has shown and which still actuate it towards the common cause their incapacity to pay a sufficient number of men for its defence should they be able to furnish them after so many engaged in other services these and many other reasons which are too obvious to be mentioned plead powerfully for the notice and attention of congress and seem to me to claim their support having thus stated the matter to congress for their consideration agreeable to my promise to governor cooke when i had the honor of seeing him on my way hither i shall leave it with them not doubting but they will duly weigh its importance and give    such assistance as they may think reasonable and just what they chiefly wish for is that the troops they have raised may be taken into continental pay and commanding officers to be appointed by congress  i have the honor c  george washington   may      new york to the president of congress new york   may      sir i am honored with your favor of the  0 ulto and observe what congress have done respecting the settlement of the pay masters accountsâ€”this seems expedient as he is out of office and i am certain will be attended with but little if any difficulty nothing more being necessary thereto than to compare the warrants with his debits and the receipts he has given with his credits  i wish every other settlement as easy and that a committee was appointed to examine and audit the accounts on which the warrants are founded particularly those of the quarter master and commissary generalsâ€”they are long and of high amount consisting of a variety of charges and of course more intricate and will require time and an extraordinary degree of attention to adjust and liquidate in a proper mannerâ€”upon this subject i did  0 myself the honor to write you a considerable time ago  having had several complaints from the officers in the eastern regiments who have been and are engaged in recruiting about the expense attending it and for which they have never been allowed any thing tho the officers in their governments have as i am informed i shall be glad to know whether the allowance of  0s granted to the officers for every man inlisted by the resolve of congress inâ€”  is general and indiscriminate or confined to the middle districts if general must i have retrospect to the time of the resolve and pay for the intermediate services or only for future inlistments  in a letter i wrote congress the   th of december i inclosed one i had received from jacob bayley esqr about opening a road from newbury to canada  i received another on the    ulto and from his account of the intelligence of others i have no doubt of the practicability of the measure and am well informed that the distance will be considerably shortened in so much that our troops going to canada from any part of the new england governments eastward of connecticut river or returning from thence home will perform their march in five or six days less than by going or returning any way    now used add to this that the road may be carried to missisque river as it is said from whence the water carriage to st johns is good except forty odd miles or so far to the northward as to keep clear of the lakes altogether and which will afford an easy pass to and from canada at all seasons the benefits resulting from this route will be so great and important that i have advanced colo bayley two hundred and fifty pounds to begin with and directed him to execute his plan no doubt it will require a more considerable advance to accomplish it but the whole will be soon sunkâ€”the expence saved by shortning six days pay and provisions for the men returning to the eastern governments at the expiration of this campaign will be almost if not more than equal to the charge of opening it if not as in all probability there will be often a necessity for detachments of our troops from those governments to go and return it will soon be repaid  by a letter from genl schuyler of the    ulto i find genl thompson and his brigade had arrived at albany genl sullivan with the last except three or four companies of colo waynes regiment not yet come is embarked and gone and probably will be soon there i am apprehensive from general schuylers account they will not proceed from thence with the expedition wished owing to a difficulty in getting teams and provender for the cattle necessary to carry their baggage and a scarcity of batteaus for    transporting so great a number tho he is using the utmost industry and diligence to procure em should they be retarded for any considerable time it will be exceedingly unfortunate as we are much weakened here by their going and our army in canada not strengthened i have sent with the last brigade sixty barrels of powder and other stores and intrenching tools a supply being wanted also the chain for a boom at the narrows of richlieu and the three boxes of money brought me by mr hanson and have wrote genl schuyler to have the boom fixed as soon as possible the commissary too has forwarded about eight hundred barrels of pork and is in expectation of a further quantity from connecticut which will go on without stopping here as the magazine from whence the northern and eastern armies will occasionally receive supplies of powder will probably be kept here and our stock is low and inconsiderable being much reduced by the sixty barrells sent to canada i shall be glad to have a quantity immediately forwarded our stores should be great for if the enemy make an attack upon the town or attempt to goe up the north river the expenditure will be considerable money too is much wanted the regiments that are paid have only received to the first of april by a letter from genl ward i find his chest is just exhausted the money left with him for the payment of the five regiments at boston and beverly being almost expended by large drafts in favor of the commissary and quarter master and in fitting out the armed    vessels i would here ask a question to wit whether as mr warrens commission is superseded by mr palfreys appointment it will not be necessary to fix upon some person to pay the troops at those places or are the payments to goe thro his hands he does not incline to do any thing in the affair without the direction of congress i have inclosed you a return of the last brigade departed and also of the forces remaining here and as it is a matter of much importance to know the whole of our strength from time to time and to see it at one view for regulating our movements with propriety i wish it were a direction from congress to the commanding officers in the different districts to make monthly returns to the commander in chief of the continental army of the state of the troops in their departments and also of the military stores such direction will probably make em more attentive than they otherwise would beâ€”i could not get a return of the army in canada all last year  i beg leave to lay before congress a copy of the proceedings of a court martial upon lieutent grover of the  d regiment and of his defence which i should not have troubled them with had i not conceived the courts sentence upon the facts stated in the proceedings of a singular nature the small fine imposed by no means adequate to the enormity of his offence and to be of a dangerous and pernicious tendency for these reasons i thought it my duty to lay the proceedings before them in order to their    forming such a judgement upon the facts as they shall conceive right and just and advancive of the public good  at the same time i would mention that i think it of material consequence that congress should make a resolve taking away the supposed right of succession in the military line from one rank to another which is claimed by many upon the happening of vacancies and upon which principle this offence seems to have originated in a great measure and this ordinary judgement to be founded declaring that no succession or promotion can take place in case of vacancies without a continental commission giving and authorizing it it is of much importance to check and entirely suppress this opinion and claim become too prevalent already and which have an obvious tendency to introduce mutiny and disorder or if they conceive the claim good and that it should take place that they will declare it so that the point may be known and settled in future  i have c  george washington   may      new york to the president of congress new york   may      sir i have so often and so fully communicated my want of arms to congress that i should not have given them the trouble of receiving another letter    upon this subject at this time but for the particular application of col wayne of pennsylvania who has pointed out a method by which he thinks they may be obtained in the hands of the committee of safety at philadelphia there are according to col waynes account not less than two or three thousand stand of arms for provisional use from hence he thinks a number might be borrowed by congress provided they are replaced with continental arms as they are brought into the magazine in that city at a crisis so important as this such a loan might be attended with signal advantages while the defenceless state of the regiments if no relief can be had may be productive of fatal consequences to give congress some idea of our situation with respect to arms and justice to my own character requires that it should be known to them altho the world at large will form their opinion of our strength from numbers without attention to circumstances it may not be amiss to inclose a copy of a return which i received a few days ago from the troops in the highlands and add that by a report from colo ritzemas regiment of the   th ult there appeared to be only    firelocks and seven bayonets belonging thereto and that all the regiments from the eastward are deficient from twenty to fifty of the former four of those companies at the fortifications in the highlands belong to colo clintons regiment but in what condition the residue are on account of    arms and how colo wynkoops men are provided i cannot undertake to say but am told most miserably as colo daytons of new jersey and colo waynes of pennsylvania also are this sir is a true tho melancholy description of our situation the propriety therefore of keeping arms in store when men in actual pay are wanting of them and who it is presumed will as they ought bear the heat and burthen of the day is submitted with all due deference to the superior judgement of others i cannot by all the enquiries i have been able to make learn what number of arms have been taken from the toriesâ€”where they layâ€”or how they are to be got at the committee of safety for this colony have assured me that no exertions of theirs shall be wanting to procure arms but our sufferings in the meanwhile may prove fatal as men without are in a manner useless i have therefore thought of employing an agent whose sole business it shall be to ride through the middle and interior parts of these governments for the purpose of buying up such arms as the inhabitants may incline to sell and are fit for use  the designs of the enemy are too much behind the curtain for me to form any accurate opinion of their plan of operations for the summers campaign we are left to wander therefore in the field of conjecture and as no place all its consequences considered    seemed of more importance in the execution of their grand plan than possessing themselves of hudsons river i thought it advisable to remove with the continental army to this city so soon as the troops evacuated boston but if congress from their knowledge information or believe think it best for the general good of the service that i should go to the northward or elsewhere they are convinced i hope that they have nothing more to do than signify their commands with great respect c     george washington   may      new york majorgeneral ward to majorgeneral ward at boston new york   may      sir your letters of the        ulto came in course to hand i am glad that you have given your attention to the works which i doubt not are by this time compleat it will give me pleasure to hear they are for should these accounts of hessians and hanoverian troops coming over prove true it is possible the enemy may make some attempts to regain a footing    in your province i have represented to congress the want you was in for cash to which i have not yet received a answer when i do you shall be informd thereof the account you give of the vessells at beverly being unfit for service surprizes me prodigiously i was taught to believe very differently of the ship jenny by commodore manly and captain bartlett who you mention to have given you their oppinion of them the brigantine from antigua was also thought very fit to arm doctr browns accounts are more immediately in the director genl of the hospital department when he arrives here i shall give them to him for his inspection mr singletanys account is easily settled as he has the commissarys receipt for the arms if the account of the cost of the arms was more particular it would be more regular  satisfactory a letter is just come to my hands from winthrop sargent esqr agent for the navy at gloucester he says there are some women and children whom he is obliged to mantain at the continental expense also a number of men taken in some of the last prizes you will please to examine into their situation if prisoners of war they should be sent into some inland place and confind if tories the general court are the proper persons to take cognizance of them i see by the publick prints that the prizes at beverly are to be sold the  0th instant as by the obstructions put on commerce in general there may appear but few purchasers for the vessel so of course they may be sold vastly under their value i think you had best have  0 some persons in whom you can confide present at the sale with power to purchase the large ship and the brig from antigua if he finds them going very much under their value it is not above two or three years since the ship cost Â£ 000 sterling she is to be sure something worse for wear  i believe is not remarkably well formed at present as she has been pillaged for the use of our armed vessells which must make a considerable abatement of her value the brigantine is i suppose in the same predicament but a good judge will easily know the value wm watson esqr of plymouth advises that the prizes norfolk and happy return are condemned and desires i would appoint a day for sale of them and their cargoes this you will please to doâ€”letting them be advertised in the papers at least a fortnight before the sale i have had no advice from congress relative to your resignation i shall write them this day to know what officer they may think proper to the command in your state when i receive their answer you shall be informed i am c george washington  0 may      new york lund washington to lund washington mount vernon new york  0 may      dear lund as i am not able to form any idea of the time of my return and as it is very reasonable and just that mr custis should be possessed of his estate although it is not in my power circumstanced as i am at present to liquidate the accounts and make a final    settlement with him i have wrote to the clerk of the secretarys office for authentic copies of the last accounts which i exhibited against him and the estate of his deceased sister with these for i have directed them to be sent to you and the bundle of bonds which you will find among my papers i would have mr custis and you repair to colonel mason and get him as a common friend to us both as a gentleman well acquainted with business and very capable of drawing up a proper memorandum of the transaction to deliver him his own bonds which if my memory fails me not and no changes have happened are in one parcel and endorsed and at the same time deliver him as many bonds out of the other parcel endorsed miss custiss bonds as will pay him his moiety of her fortune and the balance which will appear due to him from me at my last settlement with the general court how the account will then stand between us i cannot with precision say but i believe the balance will be rather in my favor than his in my last settlement of the estate of miss custis which you will have sent to you i expect by mr everard every bond mortgage c were fully accounted for and will be the best ground to found the dividend between mr custis and myself upon lest any of the bonds or mortgages should be misplaced or in the office mr mercers bonds i have promised to take into my part and as there are wheat and other accounts opened between that estate and me i should be glad to have them allotted accordingly in like manner    i promised to take mr robert adamss debt upon myself and believe the last mortgage from him was taken in my own name as to the others i do not care how they are divided nor was i anxious about these further than that it served to comply with their desires founded i believe on an opinion that i should not press them for the money the bank stock must i presume be equally divided between us long before i left virginia i directed it to be sold writing to messrs cary and company who had always received the dividends to negotiate the matter in consequence they sent me a power of attorney and a great deal of formal stuff for mrs washington and myself to execute before the governor this we did literally as required and transmitted since which the directors of the bank have prescribed another mode and i have had forwarded to me another set of papers to be executed also before the governor which it has never been in my power to do as they arrived but a little while before i set out for the congress last spring thus the matter stands as far as i know with respect to the money in the funds there is another matter which i think justice to myself requires to be mentioned and that is with respect to the sterling balance which it will appear i was owing to mr custis upon the last settlement it was then and ever since has been my intention to assign to him as many bonds carrying interest as would discharge this balance but my attendance upon congress in the fall of      and spring of         put it out of my power to attend the general court at their sessions consequently no order could be taken or account rendered of this matter and now by the rise of exchange if i were to turn current money bonds into sterling i should be a considerable sufferer when i had not nor could have any interest in delaying of it and that it was so delayed was owing to the reasons abovementioned it being a practice to let out his money upon interest as soon as it came to my hands the many matters which hang heavy upon my hands at present do not allow me time to add more but oblige me to request as i have not written fully to colonel mason on this subject that you will show him and if necessary let him have this letter i am very sincerely c     george washington    may      new york to the president of congress new york    may      sir i am now to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of the   and   instt with their several inclosures and am exceedingly glad that before the resolution respecting lt colo ogden came to hand i had ordered him to join his regiment and had quelled a disagreeable spirit both of mutiny and desertion which had taken place and seemed to be rising to a great degree in consequence of itâ€”in order to effect it i had the regiment paraded and ordering two more at the same time under arms convinced them of their error and ill conduct and obtained a promise for their good behavior in future to such of them as had absconded i gave pardons on their assurances to return to their duty again in my letter of the   instt which i had the honor of addressing you i mentioned to congress the refractory and mutinous conduct of lieut grover of    the  d regiment and laid before them a copy of the proceedings of a court martial upon him and of his defence with a view that such measures might be adopted as they should think adequate to his crime  i will now beg leave to inform them that since then he has appeared sensible of his misconduct and having made a written acknowledgement of his offence and begged pardon for it as by the inclosed copy will appear i thought it best to release him from his confinement and have ordered him to join his regiment which i hope will meet their approbation and render any determination as to him unnecessary    observing at the same time that i have endeavored and i flatter myself not ineffectually to support their authority and a due subordination in the army i have found it of importance and highly expedient to yield many points in fact without seeming to have done it and this to avoid bringing on a too frequent discussion of matters which in a political view ought to be kept a little behind the curtain and not be made too much the subjects of disquisition time only can eradicate and overcome customs and prejudices of long standingâ€”they must be got the better of by slow and gradual advances i would here take occasion to suggest to congress not wishing or meaning of myself to assume the smallest degree of power in any instance the propriety and necessity of having their sentiments respecting the filling up the vacancies and issuing commissions to officers especially to those under the rank of fieldofficers had i literally complied with the directions given upon this subject when i first engaged in the service and which i conceived to be superseded by a subsequent resolve for forming the army upon the present establishment i must have employed one clerk for no other business than issuing warrants of appointment and giving information to congress for their confirmation or refusal it being evident from the necessity of the thing that there will be frequent changes and vacancies in office from death and a variety of other causes i now submit it to them and pray their direction whether i am to pursue that mode and all the ceremonies attending    it or to be at liberty to fill up and grant commissions at once to such as may be fit and proper persons to succeed when i came from cambridge i left instructions with colo knox of the artillery regiment for the regulation of his conduct and among other things directed him immediately to send forward to this place lt colo burbeck who notwithstanding he received orders for that purpose has refused to comeâ€”considering himself as he says in his answer to colo knox his letter copies of which i have inclosed bound in point of generosity to stay in the service of the province tho i am told by col knox that some of the members of the general court on hearing of the matter informed him that they did not consider him as engaged to them and that he had no just pretext for his refusal i thought it right to lay this matter before congress and submit it to them whether colo burbeck who will or will not serve the continent or go to this or that place as it may suit his convenience and square with his pretended notions of generousity shoud be longer continued in office  before i have done with the utmost deference and respect i would beg leave to remind congress of my former letters and applications respecting the appointment of proper persons to superintend and take direction of such prisoners as have already fallen and will fall into our hands in the course of the war being fully convinced that if there were persons appointed for     who would take the whole management of them under their care that the continent would save a considerable sum of money by it and the prisoners be better treated and provided with real necessaries than what they now are and shall take the liberty to add that it appears to me a matter of much importance and worthy of consideration that particular and proper places of security should be fixed on and established in the interior parts of the different governments for their reception such establishments are agreeable to the practice and usage of the english and other nations and are founded on principles of necessity and public utility the advantages which will arise from em are obvious and many i shall mention only two or three they will tend much to prevent escapes which are difficult to effect when the public is once advertised that the prisoners are restrained to a few stated and wellknown places and not permitted to goe from thence and the more ingenious among them from disseminating and spreading their artful and pernicious intrigues and opinions throughout the country which would influence the weaker and wavering part of mankind and meet with but too favorable a hearing further it will be less in their power to join and assist our enemies in cases of invasions and will give us an opportunity always to know from the returns of those appointed to superintend them what number we have in possession the force sufficient to check and suppress their hostile views in times of emergency and the expenses necessary for their maintenance  support many other reasons    might be adduced to prove the necessity and expediency of the measure i shall only subjoin one more and then have done on the subject which is that many of the towns where prisoners have been already sent not having convenience for or the means of keeping them complain that they are burdensome and have become careless inattentive and altogether indifferent whether they escape or not and those of em that are restricted to a closer confinement the limits of jail neglected and not treated with that care and regard which congress wish  i have not received further intelligence of the german troops  since my letter of the  th instant covering mr cushings despatches but lest the account of their coming should be true may it not be advisable and good policy to raise some companies of our germans to send among them when they arrive for exciting a spirit of disaffection and desertion if a few sensible and trusty fellows could get with them i should think they would have great weight and influence with the common soldiery who certainly have no enmity towards us having received no injury nor cause of quarrel from us the measure having occurred and appearing to me expedient i thought it prudent to mention it for the consideration of congress having received a letter from general ward advising that congress have accepted his resignation and praying to be relieved and it being necessary that a general officer should be sent to take the command  0 of the troops at boston especially if the army should arrive which is talked of and which some consider as a probable event i must beg leave to recommend to congress the appointment of some brigadiergenerals not having more here nor so many at this time than are essential to the government and conducting the forces and works that are carrying on generals sullivan and thompson being ordered to canada i cannot spare one more general officer from hence without injuring the service greatly and leaving the army here without a sufficient number  having frequent application from the committee of safety and others about an exchange of prisoners and not having authority to pursue any mode in this instance than that marked out by a resolve of congress some considerable time ago i hope they will pardon me when i wish them to take under consideration such parts of my letter of the   d ultimo as relate to this subject and for their determination upon it i shall then have it in my power to give explicit and satisfactory answers to those who shall apply  george washington    may      new york to the president of congress new york    may      sir since my last of the    instt which i had the honor to address you nothing of moment or importance    has occurred and the principal design of this is to communicate to congress the intelligence i received last night from general schuyler by a letter of the  0th respecting the progress of our troops in getting towards canadaâ€”not doubting of their impatience and anxiety to hear of it and of every thing relating to the expeditionâ€”for their more particular information  satisfaction i have done myself the pleasure to extract the substance of his letter on this head which is as follows that genl thompson with the last of his brigade in the morning of tuesday sennight embarked at fort george and in the evening of the next day genl sullivan arrived at albany that he had ordered an additional number of carpenters to assist in building boats who finishing eight every day would have   0 complete by the   st before which he was fearfull the last of genl sullivans brigade could not embark that they would carry  0 men each besides the baggage ammunition and intrenching tools that he has given most pointed orders to restrain the licentiousness of the troops which was disgraceful and very injurious in those gone on heretofore in abusing the inhabitants and batteau men and that he had ordered captain romans from canada for trial at albany there being sundry complaints lodged against him he also informs that the  0 barrells of powder had arrived and would be forwarded that day that the  st regiment of genl sullivans brigade marched that morning and that the intrenching tools and about  00 barrells of pork were also gone on that he cannot possibly send more than half of the  00000 dollars into canada being greatly in debt on the public account and the creditors exceedingly clamorous and importunate for payment which sum he hopes will be sufficient till the canadians agree to take our paper currency to which they are much averse and of which he is exceedingly doubtfull that he had got the chain and would forward it that day to genl arnold with orders to fix it at the rapids of richlieu    he adds that he had reviewed genl sullivans brigade in presence of about   0 indians who were greatly pleased with the order and regularity of the troops and surprized at the number which the tories had industriously propagated consisted only of   companies and that they were kept always walking the streets to induce em to believe their number was much greater than it really was  i have inclosed a copy of general schuylers instructions to jas price esqr deputy commy genl for the regulation of his conduct in that department which i received last night  which genl schuyler requested me to forward you i also beg leave to lay before congress a copy of a letter from saml stringer director of one of the hospitals purporting an application for an increase of surgeons mates câ€”an estimate of which is also inclosed and submit it to them what number must be sent from hence or got elsewhere it is highly probable that many more will be wanted in canada than what are already there on account of the late augmentation of the army but i thought it most advisable to make his requisition known to congress and to take their order    and direction upon it as to the medicines i shall speak to doctor morgan not yet arrived as soon as he comes and order him to forward such as may be necessary and can be possibly spared     george washington    may      new york majorgeneral schuyler to majorgeneral schuyler new york    may      dear sir i this morning received your favor of the    instant with its enclosures conveying intelligence of the melancholy situation of our affairs in canada  and am not without my fears i confess that the prospect we had of possessing that country of so much importance in the present controversy is almost over or at least that it will be effected with much more difficulty and effusion of blood than were necessary had our exertions been timely appliedâ€”however we must not despair a manly and spirited opposition only can ensure success and prevent the enemy from improving the advantage they have obtainedâ€”i have forwarded the letters to congress and their answer to you and the honorable commissioners i will transmit to you as soon as they come to handâ€”i    am fully sensible that this unfortunate event has greatly deranged your schemes  will involve you in difficulties to be obviated only by your zeal  assiduity which i am well satisfied will not be wanting in this or any other instance where the good of your country requires them notwithstanding the most diligent pains but a small part of the nails you wrote for is yet collected nor will there be a possibility of getting half the quantity the quarter master expects that they will be here to day when they will be instantly forwarded with the five tons of leadâ€” i am sir with sentiments of much esteem and regard your most obedient humble servant     george washington    may      new york richard henry lee to richard henry lee new york    may      my dear sir in great haste i write you a few lines to cover the enclosed  they came in the manner you see them and as explained in captain langdons letter to me i hesitated some time in determining whether i could    with propriety select them from the rest considering in what manner they came to my hands but as there are some things in each which may serve to irritate i concluded it best to send not only the one directed to you but the other also to doctor franklin under cover to you as you may communicate and secrete such parts as you like i have no time to add the    necessity of vigorous exertions they are too obvious to need any stimulus from me adieu my dear sir p s upon second thought knowing that doctor franklin is in canada i send you a copy only of a letter to him which i take to be from doctor lee and the original to the doctor george washington  0 may      new york to the president of congress new york  0 may      sir your favor of the   th with several resolutions of congress therein enclosed i had not the honor to receive till last night before the receipt i did not think myself at liberty to wait on congress although i wished to do it and therefore the more readily consented to general gatess attendance as i knew there were many matters which could be better explained in a personal interview than in whole volumes of letters he accordingly set out for philadelphia yesterday morning and must have been too far advanced on his journey as he proposed expedition to be overtaken     i shall if i can settle some matters which are in agitation with the provincial congress here follow tomorrow or next day and therefore with every sentiment of regard attachment and gratitude to congress for their kind attention to the means which they think may be conducive to my health and with particular thanks to you for the politeness of your invitation to your house  i conclude dear sir your most obedient c   0 george washington    may      new york majorgeneral schuyler to majorgeneral schuyler new york    may      dear sir i have enclosed for your perusal copies of two informations and a letter i received on saturday last from the committee of kings district by the hands of a martin bebee who says he is their clerk and was sent express from these you will readily discover the diabolical and insidious arts and schemes carrying on by the tories and friends of government to raise distrust dissensions and divisions among us having the utmost confidence in your integrity and the most incontestable proof of your great attachmt to our    common country and its interest i could not but look upon the charge agt you with an eye of disbelief and sentiments of detestation and abhorrence nor should i have troubled you with the matter had i not been informed that copies were sent to different committees and to govr trumbull which i conceived would get abroad and that you should you find that i had been furnished with them would consider my suppressing em as an evidence of my belief or at best of my doubts of the charges the confidence and assurance i have of the injustice and infamy of the charges agt the convention obliged me also to lay the matter before them lest my not doing it should be construed a distrust by them of their zeal and promote the views of the tories who to excite disorder and confusion judge it essential to involve those in high departments in a share of the plot which is not unlikely to be true in some parts believing that our internal enemies have many projects in contemplation for to subvert our liberties  before i conclude i woud mention that    some officers called upon me a few days agoe having your permit to goe to pennsylvania and settle some affairs there this license when there is really    business is certainly countenanced by humanity and generosity but nevertheless it shoud not be indulged and i hope will not be granted in future as    it gives them an opportunity of getting intelligence of all our operations of forming opinions of our strength the places proper for attack and settling a channel of correspondence with the disaffected by which our enemies may and will be furnished with    full accounts of our designs and every thing that can promote their service and injure oursâ€”there is but little reason to believe nay we are certain they will not conduct themselves upon principles of the strictest honor for the favors done em but will when in their power exercise every matter that can operate to our prejudice i am sir c george washington majorgeneral putnam to majorgeneral putnam  instructions the congress having been pleased to signify a desire that i should repair to philadelphia in order to advise and consult with them on the present posture of affairs and as i am on the point of setting out accordingly i have to desire that you will cause the different works now in agitation to be carried on with the utmost expedition to this end i have written to the provincial congress of this colony for tools and have hopes of obtaining them apply therefore accordingly taking an exact account of what you receive the works upon longisland should be completed as expeditiously as possible so should those in and about this town and upon governors island if new works can be carried on without detriment to the old for want of tools i would have that intended at paulus hook set about immediately as i conceive it to be of importance in like manner i would have that at the narrows begun provided colonel knox after his arrangement of the artillery should find there are any fit pieces of cannon to be spared for it otherwise as i have no longer any dependence upon cannon from admiral hopkins it would be useless the barriers of those streets leading from the water are not to be meddled with and where they have been pulled down are to be repaired and nearer the water if more advantageous    as it does not appear to me improbable that the enemy may attempt to run past our batteries in and about the town and land between them and the woody grounds above mr scotts i would have you employ as many men as you can in throwing up flushes at proper places and distances within that space in order to give opposition in landing but if there are not tools enough to carry on the other more essential works and these at the same instant you are not to neglect the first but esteem this as a secondary consideration only delay not a moments time to have the signals fixed for the purpose of communicating an alarm upon the first appearance of the enemy let them be placed in such a manner and at such distances as to be easily discovered day or night if this was continued upon the long island shore for some distance good consequences might result from it as nothing can be attended with more signal advantages than having timely notice of the enemys approach whilst nothing can add more to the disgrace of an officer than to be surprised for this reason i have to beg that the same vigilance and precaution may be used as if the enemy were actually within sight as a brisk wind and flowing tide will soon produce them when they are once on the coast the officers and men therefore should be constantly at their quarters the guards alert and every thing in readiness for immediate action as i have great reasons to fear that the fortifications in the highlands are in a bad situation and the garrisons on account of arms worse i would have you send brigadier lord stirling with colonel putnam and colonel knox if he can be spared up there to see report and direct such alterations as shall be judged necessary for putting them into a fit and proper posture of defence open any letters which may come directed to me upon publick service whilst i am absent and if any very interesting advices should be contained therein either from the eastward or northward forward them to philadelphia after regulating your conduct thereby i must again beg that your particular attention be turned to our powder magazines to see that that valuable article is properly    placed and secured i also beg that no time or means be neglected to make as many cartridges as possible i have reason to believe that the provincial congress of this colony have in contemplation a scheme for seizing the principal tories and disaffected persons on long island in this city and the country round about and that to carry the scheme into execution they will have recourse to the military power for assistance if this should be the case you are hereby required during my absence to afford every aid which the said congress or their secret committee shall apply for i need not recommend secrecy to you as the success you must be assured will depend absolutely upon precaution and the despatch with which the measure when once adopted shall be executed general greene will though not in person perhaps have a principal share in ordering the detachments from his brigade on long island of course he will be a proper person to be let into the whole plan i would therefore when application is made by congress have you and him concert measures with such gentlemen as that body shall please to appoint and order the execution with as much secrecy and despatch as possible and at the same time with the utmost decency and good order given under my hand at headquarters in the city of new york this   st day of may          george washington    may      amboy majorgeneral schuyler to majorgeneral schuyler amboy    may      dear sir congress having been pleased to request my attendance at philadelphia to advise with them on the situation of our affairs and of such measures as may be necessary to adopt for this campaign i had got thus far on my journey when i called to view the    ground and such places on staten island contiguous to it as may be proper for works of defence when your favor of the   th instant with its several enclosures came to hand i am exceedingly concerned for the distress of our troops in canada and as i informed you heretofore have been very importunate with the commissary to forward all the provisions in  00 his power in consequence of which he has sent a good deal on and i shall again repeat my orders and enjoin him to continue his supplies as largely and expeditiously as possible i wrote you on the   th inst and am hopefull the     Â½ casks of nails which were all that could be got with the   tons of lead then sent will have reached you or got to albany from whence they will be forwarded and in a letter to genl putnam have  0  directed him to examine our stock of the latter and to furnish you with a further quantity if it can be spared at philadelphia i will try to get a supply i have also directed him to send you two tons more of powder and such intrenching tools as can be possibly spared or procured from the convention in consequence of an application i made two or three days since we are deficient in those not having a sufficiency to carry on the works for the defence of new york with the expedition i wish or the exigency of the times demands in respect to cannon shot and guns for the vessells in the lake i have requested him to consult with col knox and with the convention about sail cloth c and if any of them can be spared or procured that they be immediately sent you our situation respecting the indians is delicate and embarrassing they are attached to johnson who is our enemy policy and prudence on the one hand suggest the necessity of seizing him and every friend of governmt on the other if he is apprehended there will be danger of incurring their resentment i hope the committee will conduct the matter in the least exceptionable manner and in that way that shall most advance the public good i observe by the minutes of a council of war by general thomass letter and that of messrs carroll and chase to dr franklin that our troops cannot make a stand at deschambault as i had hoped i wish it were practicable for most certainly the lower down the river we can maintain our post the more important will the advantages resulting from it be  0  considering all the country below us as lost and that there may be some prospect of gaining that above from whence we might draw supplies in some degree and have the friendship and assistance of the inhabitantsâ€”it is certain we should make a stand as low down as we can so as not to have a retreat cut off in case of necessity or an opportunity of receiving provisions but unacquainted as i am with the country i cannot undertake to say where it should be not doubting and hoping that every thing for the best will be done i am sir c  george washington    may      philadelphia majorgeneral thomas to majorgeneral thomas in canada philadelphia    may      sir i received your favor of the  th instant with its enclosures confirming the melancholy intelligence i had before heard of your having been obliged to raise the siege of quebec and to make a precipitate retreat with the loss of the cannon in the batteaux and interception of the powder going from general schuyler this unfortunate affair has given a sad shock to  0  our schemes in that quarter and blasted the hope we entertained of reducing that fortress and the whole of canada to our possession from your representation things must have been found in great disorder and such as to have made a retreat almost inevitable but nevertheless it is hoped you will be able to make a good stand yet and by that means secure a large or all the upper part of the country that being a matter of the utmost importance in the present contest it is my wish and that of congress that you take an advantageous post as far down the river as possible so as not to preclude you from a retreat if it should be ever necessary or from getting proper supplies of provision the lower down you can maintain a stand the more advantageous will it be as all the country above will most probably take part with us from which we may draw some assistance and support considering all below as entirely within the power of the enemy and of course in their favor this misfortune must be repaired if possible by our more vigorous exertions and trusting that nothing will be wanting on your part or in your power to advance our countrys cause i am c george washington    may      philadelphia majorgeneral putnam to majorgeneral putnam philadelphia    may      sir i received yours of the   th inst with its several inclosures and the letter and invoice from genl ward giving intelligence of the fortunate capture made by our armed vessells on which event you have my congratulations  0  i have wrote genl ward as you will see by the inclosed letter which having read you will seal and send by post to send forward to new york colo putnams demand  also such articles as colo knox may apply for out of the cargoe takenâ€”in like manner i have desired him to send me as soon as possible part of the powder and eight hundred of the carbines which will greatly assist in making up the deficiency in this instance as to the plan for employing the armed vessells i have no objection to its being adopted provided it will not frustrate the main design for which they were fitted out that i would by no means have injured as it is a matter of much importance to prevent a correspondence between the disaffected and the enemy and the latter from getting supplies of provision but if this end can be answered and the other advantages in the plan mentioned it is certainly an eligible one the great variety of business in which congress are engaged has prevented our settling what i was requested to attend for though we have made several attempts and a committee has been appointed for the purpose day after day nor can i say with precision when i shall be at liberty to return i must therefore pray your attention and vigilance to every necessary work and further if you should receive before i come certain advices and such as you can rely on of the enemys being on the coast or approaching new york that you inform me by express as early as possible i do not wish an alarm to be given me without foundation but as soon as you are certified of their  0  coming that it be instantly communicated to me and orders given the express who comes to bespeak at the different necessary stages on the road as many horses as may be proper for facilitating my return and that of the gentlemen with me with the greatest expedition i am sir yours c p s i advise youl speak to the several colonls  hurry them to get their colors done  george washington    may      philadelphia john augustine washington to john augustine washington philadelphia    may      dear brother since my arrival at this place where i came at the request of congress to settle some matters relative to the ensuing campaign i have received your letter of the   th from williamsburg and think i stand indebted to you for another which came to hand some time ago in new york i am very glad to find that the virginia convention have passed so noble a vote and with so much unanimity   0  things have come to that pass now as to convince us that we have nothing more to expect from the justice of great britain also that she is capable of the most delusive arts for i am satisfied that no commissioners ever were designed except hessians and other foreigners and that the idea was only to deceive and throw us off our guard the first has been too effectually accomplished as many members of congress in short the representation of whole provinces are still feeding themselves upon the dainty food of reconciliation and though they will not allow that the expectation of it has any influence upon their judgment with respect to their preparations for defence it is but too obvious that it has an operation upon every part of their conduct and is a clog to their proceedings it is not in the nature of things to be otherwise for no man that entertains a hope of seeing this dispute speedily and equitably adjusted by commissioners will go to the same expense and run the same hazards to prepare for the worst event as he who believes that he must conquer or submit to unconditional terms and its concomitants such as confiscation hanging c c  0  to form a new government requires infinite care and unbounded attention for if the foundation is badly laid the superstructure must be bad too much time therefore cannot be bestowed in weighing and digesting matters well we have no doubt some good parts in our present constitution many bad ones we know we have wherefore no time can be misspent that is employed in separating the wheat from the tares my fear is that you will all get tired and homesick the consequence of which will be that you will patch up some kind of a constitution as defective as the present this should be avoided every man should consider that he is lending his aid to frame a constitution which is to render millions happy or miserable and that a matter of such moment cannot be the work of a day i am in hopes to hear some good accounts from north carolina if clinton has only part of his force there and not strongly entrenched i should think that general lee will be able to give a very good account of those at cape fear surely administration must intend more than five thousand men for the southern district otherwise they must have a very contemptible opinion of those colonies or have great expectations from the indians slaves and tories we expect a very bloody summer of it at new york and canada as it is there i expect the grand efforts of the enemy will be aimed and i am sorry to say that we are not either in men or arms prepared for it however it is to be hoped that if our cause is just as i do most religiously believe it to be the same  0  providence which has in many instances appeared for us will still go on to afford its aid your convention is acting very wisely in removing the disaffected stores c from the counties of princess anne and norfolk and are much to be commended for their attention to the manufacture of salt saltpetre powder c no time nor expense should be spared to accomplish these things mrs washington is now under inoculation in this city and will i expect have the smallpox favorably this is the thirteenth day and she has very few pustules she would have written to my sister but thought it prudent not to do so notwithstanding there could be but little danger in conveying the infection in this manner she joins me in love to you her and all the little ones i am with every sentiment of regard dear sir your most affectionate brother george washington   june      philadelphia majorgeneral putnam to majorgeneral putnam philadelphia   june      dear sir i received your favor by yesterday evenings express with the several letters and intelligence from general schuyler and am much concerned for the further misfortunes that have attended our arms in canada i have laid the whole before congress who had before resolved to send a considerable augmentation to our army there and doubt not that general schuyler may receive assistance from the  0  militias most convenient to him for securing the different passes and communications till they can be as to sending a reinforcement from new york neither policy nor prudence will justify it as we have the strongest reasons to believe the day not far distant when a large armament will arrive and vigorously attempt an impression there to oppose which the forces we have will not be more than equal if sufficient congress have determined on building sundry gondolas and firerafts to prevent the menofwar and enemys ships from coming into the new york bay or narrows i must therefore request that you make inquiries after carpenters and procure all you can with materials necessary for building them that they may goe on with all possible expedition as soon as the person arrives from hence whom i have employed to superintend the work he will be there in a day or two i am dear sir c    0 george washington   june      new york majorgeneral schuyler to majorgeneral schuyler new york   june      dear sir i have not time to answer your two last favors minutely but only to acknowledge the receipt of them     being just returned from philadelphia and the post about to depart this morning the situation of our affairs in canada is truly alarming and i greatly fear from the intelligence transmitted from thence by captain wilkinson to general greene  that ere this we have sustained further and greater misfortunes than what happened when you wrote i have enclosed you a copy of his letter by which you will see i have too much ground for my concern and i sincerely wish the next letters from the northward may not contain melancholy advices of general arnolds defeat and the loss of montreal the most vigorous exertions will be necessary to retrieve our circumstances there and i am hopefull you will strain every nerve for that purpose unless it can be now done canada will be lost for ever the fatal consequences of which every one must feel i have enclosed to you a copy of a resolve of congress for reinforcing the army in canada and keeping up the communication with that province  i hope the several colonies will immediately furnish their quotas of men which or as many of them as may be necessary i should imagine had better be employed at the communications and all the enlisted soldiers sent forward to canada you have also another resolution for employing and engaging a number of indians in the service  though congress have not particularized     the mode for raising and engaging em i would have you and the commissioners appointed for indian affairs pursue such measures for the purpose as to you may seem best for securing their friendship and service if a smaller number than two thousand will do i would not advise more to be embodied than may be necessary if your presence or direction at st johns or any post in canada could be of service and tend to put our affairs in a better channel than they now are i would wish you to goe as general thomas is down with the smallpox but i do not mean to direct or request you to do it if you think by remaining where you are or not going will be of more public advantage or that the cause will be injured by doing it you will be governed by such measures as appear to you best and the circumstances of our affairs under your management and those in canada with which you must be much better acquainted than i am or can possibly be at this distance it is probable your     presence may be necessary  wanted at the negotiation with the indians which will be one cause to prevent your going  george washington   june      new york to the president of congress new york   june      sir i do myself the honor to inform congress that i arrived here yesterday afternoon about one oclock and found all in a state of peace and quiet i had not time to view the works carrying on and those ordered to be begun when i went away but have reason to believe from the report of such of the general and other officers i had the pleasure to see that they have been prosecuted and forwarded with all possible diligence and despatch  i am much concerned     for the situation of our affairs in canada and am fearful ere this it is much worse than was first reported at philadelphia the intelligence from thence in a letter from captn wilkinson of the  d regt to genl greene is truly alarming it not only confirms the account of colonel bedels and major sherburnes defeat but seems to forebode general arnolds with the loss of montreal i have enclosed a copy of the letter which will but too well show that there is foundation for my apprehensions on wednesday evening i received an express from general schuyler with sundry papers respecting sir john johnson which i have not time to copy as the post is just going off but will do myself the honor of transmitting you as soon as i possibly can  before     i left philadelphia i employed a person to superintend the building of the gondolas which congress had resolved on for this place he is arrived and all things seem to be in a proper channel for facilitating the work but when they are done we shall be in much want of guns having never received any of those taken by commodore hopkins be pleased to mention me to congress with the utmost respect and i am sir with every sentiment of regard and esteem your and their most obedient servant p s i this minute received your favor of the   inst i am in need of commissions and beg congress to point out precisely the line i am to pursue in filling em up this i mentioned in my letter of the    ulto    i am much pleased at the fortunate captures and the generous conduct of the owners and masters for the tender of the money to congress  george washington   june      new york to the president of congress new york   june      sir in my letter of yesterday which i had the honor of addressing you and which was designed to have     come by the post but was prevented by his departure before the usual time i mentioned my having received by express a letter and sundry papers from general schuyler respecting sir john johnson copies of which i herewith transmit to you for your inspection and perusal they will show you what measures were planned and attempted for apprehending him and securing the scotch highlanders in tryon county having heard that the troops at boston are extremely uneasy and almost mutinous for want of pay several months of which being now due i must take the liberty to repeat a question contained in my letter of the   ulto what mode is to be pursued respecting it whether is money to be sent from hence by the paymaster general or some person subordinate to him to be appointed there for that purpose i expected some direction would have been given in this instance long ere this from what was contained in yours accompanying or about the time of the last remittance i presume it has been omitted by reason of the multiplicity of important business before congress  in perusing the several resolves you honored me with when at philadelphia and since my return i     find one allowing a chief engineer for the army in a separate department the service requiring many of them i wish congress if they know any persons skilled in this business would appoint them general schuyler has frequently applied and suggested the necessity of having some in canada i myself know of none i also find there is a resolve of the  d of june for taking indians into service which if literally construed confines them to that in canada is that the meaning of congress or that the commanderinchief may order their service to any place he may think necessary in respect to the establishing expresses between the several continental posts who is to do itâ€”the resolve does not say is it expected by congress that i should whoever the work is assigned to i think should execute it with the utmost dispatch the late imperfect and contradictory accounts respecting our defeat at the cedars strongly point out the necessity there is for itâ€”no intelligence has yet come from any officer in command there and most probably for want of a proper channel to convey it tho this misfortune happened so long agoe  when i had the honor of being in congress if i mistake not i heard a resolve read or was told of one allowing the new york troops the same pay     of others in the continental service this if any such i do not find and if there is not such a one i shall be under some embarrassment how to pay the militia to be provided by this province the resolve providing them says they are to be paid while in service as other troops are but if those inlisted heretofore in this province are to receive according to the first establishment it is a matter of doubt what the militia are to have   before this comes to hand a handbill containing an account of a victory gained by general arnold over the party that had defeated colo bedel and major sherburne will most probably have reached you i have inquired into the authenticity of this fortunate report and have found there is no dependance to be put in it nor do i believe it deserves of the least credit i shall be happy not to hear the reverse i have c p s if congress have come to any resolution about an allowance to induce men to reinlist you will     please to favor me with it as the time the rifle regimt is engaged for is just expired as the militia will be coming in and they will be in much need of covering please to have all the tents and cloth proper for making em that can be procured forwarded as soon as possible  george washington   june      new york to the president of congress new york   june      sir i was honored yesterday with your favor of the  th with its inclosures when doctor potts arrives i shall order him to canada or lake george as may appear most proper it is certainly necessary that he or doctor stringer should go to the former the resolve respecting general woosters recall i will immediately transmit to him with directions to repair hither without delay  the situation of our   0 affairs in canada as reported by the honorable commissioners is truly alarming and i am sorry that my opinion of the ill consequences resulting from the short enlistment of the army should be but too well confirmed by the experience they have had of the want of discipline and order in our soldiery there this induces me again to wish congress to determine on a liberal allowance to engage the troops already in service to reenlist for a longer period or during the continuance of the war nor can i forbear expressing my opinion of the propriety of keeping the military chest always supplied with money as evils of the most interesting nature are often produced for want of a regular payment of troops the neglect makes them impatient and uneasy i am much surprised     at the scarcity of provisions there particularly of flour as from several accounts i had received from thence i was led to expect that considerable supplies of that article could be procured there that our misfortunes may not become greater i have wrote to the commissary to forward more provisions in addition to those already sent an adjutant and quartermaster general are indispensably necessary with assistants the money saved the continent by their nonappointment will be but small and trifling when put in competition with the loss for want of them colonel fleming who acted in the former capacity under general montgomery is now here but his indisposition is such as to render him unfit at this time for the post it is an important one and requires vigor and activity to discharge the duties of it he will be of much service to colonel reed the business of whose office will increase considerably by the augmentation of the army it will be necessary too that the commissaries in canada and the deputy quartermastergenerals should have several assistants and clerks nor do i think a precise number can be fixed on as a variety of circumstances may and must occur to render the number essential for doing the business in those departments greater or less at different times it will be better i apprehend to leave it indefinite and with power to the commanding officer to allow such as may be wanted i am still in the dark how the unfortunate affair ended at the cedars or on what terms the surrender     was made as the last letter from the commissioners has reference to a former and mentions an agreement entered into which i have not seen but i know of it more than i could wish i have received from providence in consequence of mr morriss order as chairman of the secret committee of congress     musquets in part of the     directed to be sentâ€”the inclosed copy of a letter from mr brown will account for the deficiency i shall be much obliged by your ordering a quantity of lead and flints to be immediately forwarded our demands for both are and will be very pressingâ€”there are also wanted some particular and necessary medicines to compleat our hospital chests of which i will get dr morgan to furnish the congress with a list when he writes or waits on them about some other matters necessary to be fixed in his department as general wooster in all probability will be here in a little time in compliance with the resolve of congress and my order transmitted him i wish to know what i am to do with him when he comesâ€” genl schuyler in his letter of the   st ulto of which i transmitted you a copy yesterday mentions that sundry persons had a design to seize him as a tory and probably still have and wishes congress to give him some public mark of their approbation if they are convinced of his zeal and attachment to the cause of his countryâ€”whether he intended that i should communicate his desire to them or not i am not certain but supposing that he did i must beg leave to request that you lay the paragraph before     them that they may do in the instance of his requisition whatever they may judge necessary i have c p s if congress have agreed to the report of the committee for allowing the indians  0Â£ for every prisoner they shall take at niagara c it is material i should be informed of itâ€”this will be a favorable opportunity for them to embrace to gain possession of detroit and the other posts whilst the enemy are engaged towards montreal c  george washington   june      new york general schuyler to general schuyler new york   june      dear sir i am now to acknowledge the receipt of your several favors of the   st   th   th    th              st ulto with the several papers enclosedâ€”the whole of them except the last i communicated to congress when at philadelphia that i did not get till on my return but have since transmitted them a copy of it and of the papers respecting sir j johnson in regard to a further remittance to canada the commissioners have wrote congress fully on the subject and i presume they will forward such a supply of money immediately as they think necessary as there is but too much probability that sir j j may attempt to ravage the frontier counties and to excite the disaffected to take arms against us i think it will be advisable that colonel dayton should remain as you request as long as you apprehend a necessity for it it is not in my power to spare any more men from hence either for the communication or to assist in repairing ticonderogaâ€” the detachments already gone to canada have weakened the force necessary for the defence of this place considering its importance more perhaps than policy will justifyâ€” be that as it may the reinforcements which congress have resolved to send to canada for keeping open the communication between that country and these colonies as you will see by the copy inclosed in my letter of the  th would supersede the necessity of men going from this camp provided they could be spared i should suppose that vanschaicks and wynkoops regiments exclusive of any other men would nearly suffice for the purposes mentioned in your     several letters or that very few men more in addition to them certainly wouldâ€”if they were compleat and properly employed but i am informed by a letter from general sullivan of the   th ulto dated at albany that those regiments were not to be found on the strictest enquiry he could make that colo vanschaick who was there never furnished a single man for guard or any other duty after he got there and that lieutenant colo courtland of wynkoops regiment when he applied for pay for two companies said to be in tryon county to keep the tories in order informed him they had neither arms nor ammunition that in some companies there was not a man present fit for duty and that in others there were not more than eleven and in some less he also complains of the great waste of pork by the waggoners drawing out the brine to lighten the carriageâ€”and in his letter two days before charges the batteau men and the waggon master with indolence and a strange neglect of dutyâ€” i well know my dear sir that the multiplicity of matters you are engaged in will necessarily put in the power of these who are not influenced by principles of honesty and justice to practise many impositions but i must beg you will turn your attention as much as possible to these things and reform such abuses as have already happened or prevent them in future i am very doubtful whether the flour you seem to think may be had in canada can be got the commissioners letters as late as the   th ulto seem to preclude every such hope     i esteem it a matter of importance not only to fortify and secure ticonderoga but every other post on the communication and that you should garrison them with men under judicious and spirited officers to be fixed there who might be called to account for misconduct which is difficult to do where they are shifting and changing continually and who would esteem it their indispensible duty to carry on and maintain the works against any surprizes or attacks that may be attemptedâ€” i have wrote to congress to appoint engineers if they can fix upon proper persons for the office if you know of any you had better employ them i am confident congress will allow them the usual pay when i came from philadelphia i left the indians there and doubt not but congress will use their endeavors to prevent them returning for some time i shewed them what you said upon the subject i have spoken to the q m about proper person to superintend the building of gondolas but he knows of none there is a man who came to direct the building of some here and if any of the carpenters shall be deemed qualified after seeing the model i will send you one i have wrote to philadelphia for a supply of flints which shall be forwarded you as soon as possible and will give direction that you be furnished with a quantity of necessary medicinesâ€” with respect to st luc lacorne major campbell and the other prisoners at esopus i think it will be prudent for you to remove them or such of them as     you apprehend dangerous to some other secure place and they should be under a suitable and trusty guard your continuing to build batteaus appear a necessary measure as a sufficient number should be had to transport our troops going to canada or coming from thence if they should ever be under the disagreeable necessity of evacuating the possession they now have to the enemyâ€”an event i sincerely wish not to happen but which from the melancholy complexion of things in that quarter i conceive possible i have been much surprized at not receiving a more perfect and explicit account of the defeat of colo bedel and his party at the cedars i should have thought some of the officers in command there would undoubtedly have transmitted it immediately but as they have not it is probable i should have long remained in doubt as to the event had not the commissioners called on me today nor should i consider my not having a return of the army stores c in canada a matter of less wonder had i not been accustomed to the neglect if it is not become too inveterate i wish it could be got the better ofâ€”it is certainly of much importance and necessary to be known frequently since mine of the   st  yours of the   st ulto captns swann and dundee with three privates have been here having a permit to go to philadelphia they came down the north river from albany i believe to this place where i make no doubt they reconnoitre all our works and in their passage there at the highlands this indulgence i conceive of such     infinite prejudice to our cause for the reasons i have assigned and many more that may be added that i hope it will be never granted again i wish you to notify the several committees in the neighborhood of albany having the care of prisoners of the injurious consequences which must necessary result from such a license to prevent their allowing it to any on future applications as congress have resolved on a large augmentation to the army in canada as you will see by the copy of their vote transmitted in my last it seems material that you should advise with the commissary in that department and mr trumbull there and concert a plan for their subsistence if they cannot be supplied plentifully with provisions their going will be of more injury than benefit and encrease the distress of the whole in your favor of the   th you are desirous that a court of inquiry should be ordered respecting the charges contained in the informations i enclosed you in mine of the   st if you conceive it necessary i will do it with pleasure if you will point out the mode to be pursued to me the matters objected to you appear so uncertain vague and incredible that there is nothing to found the proceedings on were there the most distant necessity for the scrutinyâ€”by reason of a paragraph in your letter of the   st i mentioned the matter to congress to whom i had the honor of writing this day and when at philadelphia communicated it to some of them on their reading your first letter in which mention was made of the subject in     doing this and giving you the information i had received i consider myself as having only discharged the duties of justice and of friendship i am sorry for the attack you have had of the ague and wishing you a perfect recovery i am c george washington  0 june      new york to the president of congress  new york  0 june      sir since i did myself the honor of writing to you yesterday i have had the satisfaction of seeing and for a few minutes conversing with mr chase and mr carroll from canada their account of our troops and the situation of affairs in that department cannot possibly surprise you more than it has done me but i need not touch upon the subject which you will be so well informed of from the fountainhead nor should i have given you the trouble of a letter by this days post but for the distraction which seems to prevail in the commissarys department as well as others in that quarter the necessity of having it under one general direction and the dissatisfaction of colonel trumbull at the allowance made him by congress as an equivalent for his trouble with respect to this particular matter i can only say that i think he is a man well cut out for the business and that where a shilling is saved in the pay a pound may be lost by mismanagement in the office and that his resignation at this time i mean this campaign   0 may possibly be attended with fatal consequences i therefore humbly submit to congress the propriety of handsomely rewarding those gentlemen who hold such very important troublesome and hazardous offices as commissary and quartermaster  in speaking to the former about the supplies necessary for the troops to be raised he informed me that the quantity of salt provisions which was shipping from hence might render his attempts to do it precarious in consequence of which i desired him to lay the matter before the convention of this colony which he will do this day but in the mean while desired congress might be informed of the matter which i cannot better do than in his own words enclosed and submit the consideration of it to the wisdom of that honorable body to congress i also submit the propriety of keeping the two continental battalions under the command of colonels shae and mcgaw at philadelphia when there is the greatest probability of a speedy attack upon this place from the kings troops the encouragements given by governor tryon to the disaffected which are circulated no one can well tell how the movements of these kind of people which are more easy to perceive than describe the confident report which is said to have come immediately from governor tryon and brought by a frigate from halifax that the troops at that place were embarking for this added to a thousand incidental circumstances trivial in themselves but     strong from comparison leaves not a doubt upon my mind that troops are hourly expected at the hook  i had no doubt when i left this city for philadelphia but that some measures would have been taken to secure the suspected and dangerous persons of this government before now and left orders for the military to give every aid to the civil power but the subject is delicate and nothing is done in it we may therefore have internal as well as external enemies to contend with i have the honor to be c      george washington    june      new york lund washington forged letter  to lund washington new york    june      dear lund though i wrote to you but a very few days ago and have nothing new of much moment to communicate i cannot deny myself the comfort of unburthening my mind to you whenever i have a little leisure amid the thousand anxieties and disquietudes that almost distract me i know the goodness of your heart and that you will attend to me with indulgence and sympathy though it be not in your power any otherwise to afford me relief there cannot in the nature of things be a situation so truly irksome to an ingenuous mind as the being perpetually obliged to act a part foreign to our true feelings yet this alas as you know is and must be my lot i wear a countenance dressed in the calm serenity of perfect confidence whilst my heart is corroded with infinite     apprehensions and i have no bosom friend near me to whom i dare lay it open tell me lund for you have long been privy to my most secret thoughtsâ€”trusting to thy native candor i have never hesitated to lay my heart bare and open to thy inspection tell me then am i do you think more subject to fears than other men for i will not conceal it from you that at this moment i feel myself a very coward do not mistake me i thank my god i have never yet known what it was to fear for any personal danger that might befal me i am not afraid to die why should i i am afraid only to die with infamy and disgrace and if i am afraid so to die need i tell you that i am ten thousand times more afraid to live like lucifer a fallen angel no lund that were too much betide what will i cannot and i will not survive either my misfortunes or my disgraces heaven that knows how truly i love my country and that i embarked in this arduous enterprize on the purest motives but we have overshot our mark we have grasped at things beyond our reach it is impossible we should succeed and i cannot with truth say that i am sorry for it     because i am far from being sure that we deserve to succeed that the british ministry had meditated schemes fatal to the liberties of america and that if we had not opposed their first efforts to impose taxes upon us without our consent we might have bid adieu to every idea of constitutional security hereafter i have not a doubt nay i am so thoroughly persuaded of the unworthiness of their designs and of the duty of every honest american to oppose them that dissatisfied as i am with my situation were it to do over again i would rather be even as i am than tamely crouch whilst chains were fastening round my neck for there is not in my estimation so vile a thing upon earth as a human being who having once enjoyed liberty can patiently bear to see it taken from him i would and i will die ten thousand deaths rather than be this thing myself on these principles and these only i first took up arms but my misfortune and the true source of all my uneasiness is that though in good policy as well as honor these ought to be the principles of every american i have long ago discovered they are not and on this account alone that i dread our defeat our want of skill our want of ammunition in short our want of     everything which an army ought to have are all no doubt exceedingly against us but they are all nothing to our want of virtueâ€” unused to the many arts and devices by which designing men carry their points i unwillingly listened to my own apprehensions when early in the first congress i thought i saw a tendency to measures which i never could approve of i reasoned myself however out of my fears with no ordinary reproach on my own meanness in having given way to suspicions which could not be true unless we had men amongst ourselves more flagitious than even those we were opposing at length however when a continental army came to be voted for my fears returned with redoubled force for then for the first time i clearly saw our aims reached farther than we cared to avow it was carried with an unanimity that really astonished me because i knew many who voted for it were as averse to the independency of america as i was and they even ridiculed me for my apprehensions on that account and indeed when they suggested that great britain seeing us apparently determined to risque every thing rather than that they should tax us would never think of engaging in a civil war with us which must necessarily cost her more than even america could repay her i could not but hope that i was mistaken and that our military preparations might be a good political movement in one thing however we all agreed that as the forces were chiefly to be raised in newengland it would be extremely rash and imprudent in the southern delegates to leave them in the possession of so formidable a power without any check i need not tell you that it was this consideration which if i am to be credited sorely against my will determined me to accept of the command of this army we set out with bad omens i was mistrustful of them in every thing and they were taught to look upon me with jealousy this soon manifested itself in forming them to any thing like decent discipline but i have long ago pestered you more than enough with complaints on this head i knew not however certainly that i had been appointed to this high station only to be disgraced and ruined till about the middle and latter end of last february when contrary to my wishes i found it absolutely necessary that we should come to open hostilities against our fellow subjects in the ministerial army doubtless common prudence required that when we did attempt it we should if possible do it speedily and effectually and having all the reason in the world to believe that large armies would be sent against us early in the summer i resolved cost what it would to cut off those already here which would have     given us such infinite advantages over any future reinforcements that might be sent and this i believe was easily in our power but as i have already told you nothing is to be done with our new england allies unless they are let into all your secrets i could not advance a step without communicating my intentions to the gentlemen in the civil department a thing ever ruinous in war it soon got wind as i had foreseen and it appeared that the general of the enemy was apprized of my design still however i persevered in my purposes which in spite of all his care and caution i was confident must succeed and reduce him to the utmost extremity but as every military man must know so capital a blow was not to be struck without the loss both of many men and much property for my design was if they would not surrender by an honorable capitulation to burn the town about their ears and so rush in and cut them off in their attempts to escape to the ships and this with our superiority of numbers we certainly could have effected though no doubt it would have been a bloody business if they had not surrendered as i think they would but when as i was obliged i laid this before the council and representatives they not only found a thousand objections to it but absolutely restrained me and i could not have got a man that would have gone on what they called so desperate a scheme hence was i under a necessity of proceeding in the poor slow and unsoldierlike manner which not only gave them an opportunity to escape but has taught them to despise us there is no forming an idea of the importance of such a stroke at that juncture if any thing upon earth could have made america independent and glorious that was the golden opportunity i confess to you i had worked my imagination up to such a pitch of high expectation that my disappointment has dispirited me in a manner i never can recover for from that moment i have despaired of our ever doing any thing truly great any little gleams of success or fairer prospects we have since had serve but to make our inferiority the more conspicuous for what incidents can fall out to aggrandize us who can be made great only by great and spirited efforts when we have shewn that we wanted both the understanding and the virtue to purchase to ourselves immortal glory on better and cheaper terms than ever we can hope hereafter to have it but the worst remains yet to be told some of those very men who were the most forward to thwart me in this measure had discovered a different way of thinking on other occasions and i am persuaded that were the question put to them now as to this city and the southern regiments i should not hear a dissentious voice but let me spare you     after all this you will again i doubt not as you often have ask me why i continue in a situation so disagreeable to me i wish you had forborne this question the truth being that i neither am able nor very willing to answer it my resolution to hold it out as long as i can is dictated by my feelings which i neither can describe to you nor wholly justify on paper but which however i find it impossible for me to disregardâ€”the eyes of all america perhaps of europe of the world are fixed on me it has been our policy and at the time i thought it well founded to hold out false lights to the world there are not a hundred men in america that know our situation threefourths of the congress itself are ignorant of itâ€”yourself excepted there lives not a man at all acquainted with my peculiar circumstances the world looks upon us as in possession of an army all animated with the pure flame of liberty and determined to die rather than not be free it is in possession of proofs that it is so under my own hand i have always so spoken of it and i still do but you know how remote in my judgment all this is from the truth though i am not sure that there is another man in the army besides myself that thinks so i should guess however that there are many but tied up as my own mouth is it is little to be wondered at that theirs are so too at least to me thus circumstanced can you point out a way in which it is possible for me to resign just now as it were on the eve of action without imputation of cowardice there is no such way besides diffident and desponding as i am how do i know that it is not so with those we have to oppose they certainly have reason the events of war depend on a thousand minutiÃ¦ without the ken of a mere bystander i know not that the commander of the armies of the low countries could his heart have been read as you do mine had not the same fears and the same causes for them that i have you learn not this from the history nor was it to be expected you should yet he succeeded at last and who knows what an overruling providence who often brings about the greatest revolutions by the most unlikely means may intend for america if it be the will of god that america should be independent of great britain and that this be the season for it even i and these hopeful men around may not be thought unworthy instruments in his hands and should we succeed we are heroes and immortalized beyond even those of former times whereas disgrace only and intolerable infamy await our retreat in this persuasion i resolve to go on contented with the glorious king william to save my country or die in the last ditch i am my dear lund your faithful friend and servant     george washington  0 june      new york governor trumbull to governor trumbull new york  0 june      sir before this i expect you have received the resolve of congress for augmenting our army here and in canada with their requisition for the quota of men to be furnished by your colony  i must beg leave to add that from the intelligence i have just received and a variety of circumstances combining to confirm it general howe with the fleet from halifax or some other armament is hourly expected at the hook with designs doubtless to make an impression here and possess themselves of this colony of the last importance to us in the present controversy our works are extensive and many and the troops here but few for their defence being greatly reduced by the regiments detached on the canada expedition in this critical conjuncture of affairs the experience i have had of your zeal and readiness to assist the common cause induces me to request the most speedy and early succor that can be obtained from your colony and that the militia may be forwarded one battalion after another as fast as they can possibly be raised without waiting to make up the whole complement to be furnished for this place before any of them march i would advise that they come properly     provided with field and other officers and that the person appointed by the colony to command the whole be here a day or two before them to receive his orders and to be in readiness to take the command on their arrival it will be proper too that notice be sent a day or two before their coming that provision may be made for furnishing and disposing of them in proper places i have wrote a similar letter to the jersey convention praying aid from them i am sir c  george washington    june      new york to the president of congress headquarters new york    june      sir i have the honor of transmitting to congress a letter which came by express last night from general schuyler enclosing the copy of a letter to him from colonel kirkland i have likewise enclosed the copy of one directed to general putnam or the commanding officer at new york the representations contained in these letters have induced me without waiting the determination of congress to direct general schuyler immediately to commence a treaty   0 with the six nations and to engage them in our interest upon the best terms he and his colleagues in commission can procure and i trust the urgency of the occasion will justify my proceeding to the congress the necessity for decision and despatch in all our measures in my opinion becomes every day more and more apparent the express mr bennet was overtaken at albany by general schuyler who had received intelligence at fort george that a considerable body of mohawk indians were coming down the mohawk river under the conduct of sir john johnson the generals extreme hurry would not allow him to write but it seems his intention is to collect at albany a sufficient force to oppose sir john i have given him my opinion that colonel daytons regiment should be employed in that service and to secure the post where fort stanwix formerly stood in consequence of an information that several merchants were exporting salted pork and beef from this place i requested the commissary to make application to the provincial congress for a restraint to be laid on the exportation of those articles as i apprehended not only that the enemy might receive supplies by the capture of our vessels but that our people might shortly experience a scarcity the provincial congress have accordingly made a resolution a copy of which is enclosed to stop the exportation for fourteen days they expect congress will in the meantime frame some general regulations on this head they are unwilling they say to subject their constituents to partial restraints     i once mentioned to congress that i thought a waroffice extremely necessary and they seemed inclined to institute one for our army but the affair seems to have been since dropped give me leave again to insist on the utility and importance of such an establishment the more i reflect upon the subject the more i am convinced of its necessity and that affairs can never be properly conducted without it tis with pleasure that i receive the resolve enclosed in your favor of the   th instant one considerable ground of dissatisfaction in the army is thereby removed i have employed persons in building the gondolas and rafts which the congress thought necessary for the defence of this place and in conjunction with the provincial congress i have determined to sink chevaux de frise one of which is already begun i am c george washington    june      new york brigadiergeneral sullivan to brigadiergeneral sullivan in canada new york    june      dear sir having received intelligence of the unfortunate death of general thomas occasioned by the smallpox he had taken the command of the army in canada devolves on you i am therefore to request your most strenuous exertions to retrieve our circumstances in that quarter from the melancholy situation they are now in and for performing the arduous task of bringing order out of confusion i confess there is more room for enterprise and activity than i could     wish but then you will remember that you and your colleagues will be entitled to the grateful thanks of your country in proportion to the services you render being extremely hurried in sending despatches to congress and general schuyler i have not time to write to you so fully as i could wish and therefore shall only add my request that you from time to time make me regular returns of the strength of the army military stores and every material occurrence  wishing you and your brothers under the direction of a gracious providence to lead your army to conquest and victory i am dear sir your most obedient servant george washington    june      new york to the president of congress new york    june      sir i herewith transmit to you copies of a letter from general schuyler and its several enclosures which i have received since i had the honor of addressing you yesterday from these you will learn that general thomas died the  d instant  and the apprehensions of our frontier friends in this colony that our savage foes are meditating an attack against them i must beg leave to refer you to a paragraph in the copy of general schuylers letter to general putnam or the commanding officer here inclosed in mine of the   th where he requests a supply of clothing     to be sent for the army in canada as there is but little or no probability of getting it here i shall be glad to know whether there will be any chance of procuring it in philadelphia and if it should be sent thro the hands of the qr master here to what account it is to be charged i was last evening favored with yours of the   th inst and hope the two battallions which congress have ordered from philadelphia to the defence of this place will come provided with arms if they do not they will be of no service as there are more troops here already than are armed from genl schuylers letter he has in view the taking post where fort stanwix formerly stood i wrote him i thought it prudent previous to that to secure a post lower down about the falls below the german flatts lest the savages should possess themselves of the country and prevent supplies of men and provisions that may be necessary to send there in future he says he is in want of cannon and ammunition but has expressed himself so ambiguously that i am at a loss to know whether he meant what he has said as an application or not this being the only intelligence on the subject and the first mention of his want i have desired him to explain the matter and in his future requisitions for necessaries to be more certain and explicit as to quantity and quality in the mean time i shall send him some intrenching tools and inquire whether there are any cannon that can be spared from hence i am c      george washington    june      new york majorgeneral ward to majorgeneral ward new york    june      sir i am now to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of the   th ulto  of the  d   th instt and in answer to the  st think you was right in your direction to mr barttoll about brigantine hannah as mr morris had wrote for one the two schooners considering their force and number of men certainly behaved extremely well in repelling the attack made by such a number of boats and it is only to be lamented that the affair was attended with the death of captain mugford he seemed to deserve a better fate  the determination of the court of inquiry upon colo varnums complaint transmitted in that of the  d is very different from what he expected or i imagined it would be from his state of the caseâ€”whether it is right or wrong it is not in my power to so determine as the evidence which was before them is not inserted in the proceedings which ought to have been as i at this distance can have no other means to warrant me either in confirming or rejecting the sentence i cannot but add that it seems extraordinary to me and exceedingly strange that capn lane should have been at so much trouble and expence to get the men without having a right to     emâ€”for which reason to discountenance a practice extremly pernicious in its nature of one officer trying to take away and seduce the men of another and on account of the imperfection in the proceedings in not stating the matter fully  the whole evidence the complaint should be reheard and every thing appertaining to it the manner of inlistment c particularly specified for me to found my judgement on  the arms c which you sent to norwich as mentioned in the invoice contained in that of the  th are not arrivedâ€”the number of carbines is only half of what genl putnam wrote for as i have been informed and it is less by three hundred than i directed to be sent in my letter from philadelphia of the    ulto this i suppose had not come to hand when you wrote as you have not acknowledged the receipt of it i have inclosed two letters for majr small and chs procter esqr supposed to be at halifax which being wrote with a design to procure the enlargement of capt procter a prisoner on board the mercury man of war or induce them to intercede for a more     humane treatment to be shewn him i request you to forward by the first opportunity by way of nova scotia i am this moment favored with yours of the   inst advising me of the capture made by our armed vessels of one of the transports with a company of highlanders on board and i flatter myself if our vessels keep a good look out as the whole fleet are bound for boston which sailed with her that more of them will fall into our hands this is a further proof that governmt expected genl howe was still in boston i am extremely sorry that your health is more and more impaired and having heard by a letter from col hancock that mr whitcomb colonel whitcombs brother is appointed a brigadiergeneral i shall order him to relieve you as soon as i am informed that he accepts his commission and if he does you may immediately call him to your assistance before i am certified of his acceptance this will ease you of some trouble till i can regulate a few matters of importance here which i hope to do in a little time i am sir your most obedient servant      george washington    june      new york brigadiergeneral sullivan to brigadiergeneral sullivan new york    june      dear sir i was favored with yours of the  th and  th instant by express yesterday evening from general schuyler and am exceedingly happy on account of the agreeable and interesting intelligence it contains before it came to hand i almost dreaded to hear from canada as my advices seemed to promise nothing favorable but rather our further misfortunes but i am now hopefull that our affairs from the confused distracted and almost forlorn state in which you found them will emerge and assume an aspect of order and success  i am convinced that many of our misfortunes are to be attributed to a want of discipline and a proper regard to the conduct of the soldiery hence it was and from our feeble efforts to protect the canadians that they had almost joined and taken part against us as you are fully apprized of this and conceive them well disposed towards us with confidence i trust you will take every step in your power to conciliate and secure their friendship if this can be effected  of which you seem to have no doubt i see no objection to our indulging a hope that this country of such importance in the present controversy may yet be added to and complete our union i confess this interesting work is now more difficult than it would have been heretofore had matters     been properly conducted but yet i flatter myself it may be accomplished by a wise prudent and animated behavior in the officers and men engaged in it especially if assisted by the friendly disposition of the inhabitants i think every mark of friendship and favor should be shown them to encourage their zeal and attachment to our cause and from which if they once heartily embark we shall derive innumerable benefits your conduct in pushing and securing posts low down the country is certainly judicious and of the utmost advantage the farther down we can take and maintain posts the greater will our possession of the country be observing at the same time the necessity of having a safe retreat left if you should be obliged to abandon them by a superior force i am hopefull and shall anxiously wait to hear of general thompsons making a successful attack upon the party intrenching at the three rivers their defeat will be of the most essential service it will chagrin them and disconcert their schemes on the one hand and animate our men and give life to our canadian friends on the other and efface from their minds the unfavorable impressions our late conduct has made it will be of material consequence in your advances down the country to secure the several important posts as you goe at which you may in case you should be obliged to decline the main object you have in view make a vigorous and successful stand in your retreat i concur with you in thinking it not of material moment to keep a very large number of men at     lachine or the upper posts there should be no more than will be necessary to repel such attacks and attempts as may be made by the savages and the regular troops above you allowing for such a number of disaffected canadians as may join them but then there should be a sufficient number for that purpose as our further misfortunes there might be of the most injurious consequence if they can be maintained the disaffected above will dwindle away and the insurrection promise nothing disastrous it is impossible for me at this distance and not acquainted with the situation of affairs as well as you who are on the spot to give any particular direction for your conduct and operations i therefore have only to request that you with your officers will in every instance pursue such measures as the exigency of our affairs may seem to require and as to you shall appear most likely to advance and promote the interest and happiness of your country the return which you mention to have inclosed was not in your letter you probably thro hurry forgot to put it in or genl schuyler may have omitted it when in his hands i wrote you on the    inst on this subject and must again enjoin a particular attention to this part of your duty it being of the utmost importance to be frequently certified of our whole strength and storesâ€”in compliance with your request i shall transmit a copy of your letter to congress by tomorrows post it will give them sensible pleasure and such as they had no good reason to expect at least so soon   0 i have inclosed you an extract of a letter from genl ward from the capture mentioned in it there is no reason to expect the other transports that sailed with her are not far off the coast  in regard to your giving commissions it is a measure that i can neither approve or disapprove having no authority to act in this instance myselfâ€”the propriety of it must depend upon the powers and practice of your predecessors in commandâ€”if they had none it will be judged of most probably by the good or bad consequences it may produceâ€”congress from your letter will see you have exercised such a power and when they write you will either confirm or refuse it in all probability      lest you should conceive that i do not think lachine or the cedars posts of importance and whose defence are not very material i must then add that i esteem them of much consequence but only mean that more men need not be employed than what will be equal to any probable attack that may be made against them i would observe before i have done that it is my most earnest request that harmony a good understanding and a free communication of sentiments may prevail and be preserved between the general and fieldofficers particularly the former nothing can produce greater benefits than this nor tend more to promote your military operations whereas history and observation sufficiently evince they abound with numberless examples the fatal consequences which have ever resulted from distrust jealousy and disagreement among officers of these ranks wishing therefore your counsels and efforts to be founded in a happy union and to meet the smiles of a kind providence i am dear sir c p s knowing your great zeal for the cause of your country and desire to render her every possible service i must caution you not to put too much to the hazard in your exertions to establish her rights and to receive with a proper degree of caution the professions the canadians may make they have the character of an ingenious artful people and very capable of finesse and cunning therefore my advice is that you put not too much in their power but seem to trust them rather than do it too far i     would also have you to keep all your posts as you goe well secured to guard against any treacherous conduct george washington    june      new york majorgeneral schuyler to majorgeneral schuyler new york    june      dear sir i last night received by mr bennet your favor of the   inst addressed to genl putnam or the officer commanding here covering one for congress with a copy of col kirklands to youâ€”both of which i shall immediately forward to philadelphia in consequence of your former letters the commissary has been directed to continue supplies of provisions i shall repeat the direction and doubt not of his exertions in this instanceâ€”if its arrival at albany ceased for a time it might be owing to the accounts received that a good deal particularly flour might be had in canada i will speak to him about the expenditure of pork here and request that no more be used than he may find necessary that there may be a large quantity for the canada department  i will also speak to the quarter master general to provide and forward all the clothing he     can get as soon as possibleâ€”as to intrenching tools they are extremely scarce and what we have far too few for the works carrying  proper to be carried on for the defence of this placeâ€”however i will try to furnish you with a few more and wish your endeavors to purchase what you can from the country peopleâ€”many of them perhaps will part with a spade or pick ax and some with both and tho many may not be collected in that way what are will be of great service if the accounts of colonel bedels and major butterfields conduct be true they have certainly acted a part deserving the most exemplary notice i hope you will take proper measures and have good courts appointed to bring them and every other officer that has been or shall be guilty of malconduct to trial that they may be punished according to their offences our misfortunes at the cedars were occasioned as it is said entirely by their base and cowardly behavior and cannot be ascribed to any other cause  in my letter of the  th which will have reached you ere this i enclosed a resolve of congress for engaging the indians not more than two thousand     in our service this will indicate to you their opinion and knowing their sentiments fully upon this head i cannot but advise that you forthwith hold a conference with the six nations and any others you with your brother commissioners may think necessary and form with them an alliance on such terms and conditions as shall seem most likely to secure their interest and friendship without waiting the further direction of congress  the situation of our affairs will not suffer the delay and i am persuaded your conduct and the speech you intend to deliver the sachems will meet their approbation and thanks i think that part of it which mentions the time and place of our taking post might be omitted but this i leave to you i shall inform congress of what i have wrote you on this subject and of the verbal intelligence you sent me by bennet from albany where you overtook him respecting the indians coming down the mohawk river under sir john johnson and of your preparing to resist them i sincerely wish you success and that their first incursions and attempts against us may be attended with their entire defeat it will be necessary to employ colonel dayton and his regiment in this service and in securing a post where fort stanwix formerly stood which i esteem of much importance but i submit it     to you who are much better acquainted with that country than i am whether previous to that it will not be necessary and essential that a post be established lower down somewhere about the falls below the german flatts to secure our communication with that garrison should this not be done will it not be in the power of the savages to come between that and our frontiers and intercept all supplies of men and provisions going thither i observe you esteem the ground opposite to ticonderoga to be more advantageous for a post against the enemy messrs chase and carroll had told me the same i should think therefore that the place most capable of defence and having the greatest advantages should be improved and necessary works thrown up with the utmost despatch but will not both be best cannot ticonderoga be kept and this improved and maintained at the same time i must submit this to you and refer you to my letter of the  th upon the subject of fortifying all the posts and about the engineers if you know of any persons who can be of service in that way do employ them i know of none myself or have i one whom i can possibly spare i have been applied to by colo nicholson who says he was appointed by congress to the command of a regiment to be raised out of   battallions of york troops that were in canada last year for instructions for that purpose as this concerns the department more immediately under your direction and with which you must be much better     acqd than i am i did not think it right to give him any direction about it but if the fact is so advise that you will give him such orders that the views of congress may be carried into execution as you judge necessary  in like manner i have had several applications from officers coming from the canada department for pay that became due them which did not conceive myself at liberty to comply with being ignorant of their appointments or service and as they will perhaps apply to you for certificates to lay before me i wish you to be very explicit as to the time of their being in office and from which their pay is due george washington    june      new york to the president of congress new york    june      sir the enclosed came to my hands as a private letter from general sullivan as a private letter i lay it before congress  the tendency for it requires no explanation will account for the contrast between it and the letter of general arnold that the former is aiming at the command in canada is obvious whether he merits it or not is a matter to be considered and that it may be considered with propriety i think it my duty to observe as of my own knowledge that he is active spirited and zealously attached to the cause that he does not want abilities     many members of congress as well as myself can testify but he has his wants and he has his foibles the latter are manifested in a little tincture of vanity and in an over desire of being popular which now and then leads him into embarrassments his wants are common to us allâ€”the want of experience to move upon a large scale for the limited and contracted knowledge which any of us have in military matters stands in very little stead and is greatly overbalanced by sound judgment and some knowledge of men and books especially when accompanied by an enterprising genius which i must do general sullivan the justice to say i think he possesses but as the security of canada is of the last importance to the wellbeing of these colonies i should like to know the sentiments of congress respecting the nomination of any officer to that command the character i have drawn of general sullivan is just according to my ideas of him congress will be pleased therefore to determine upon the propriety of continuing him in canada or sending another as they shall see fit whether general sullivan knew of the promotion of general gates at the time of his writing and that he had quitted the department he left him in when he marched his brigade hence to canada i cannot undertake to say nor can i determine whether his wish to be recalled would be changed by it if he did i shall add no more than my respectful compliments to congress and that i have the honor to be with every sentiment of regard and esteem sir c      george washington to the committee of essex county new jersey no date gentlemen the absolute necessity of preventing all correspondence between the inhabitants of this county and our enemies obliges me to use every degree of intelligence that lead to the channel of such intercourseâ€”doctor william burnet of new ark  can inform you of certain informations and charges against part of the army under my command as if they were liable to bribery and corruption in permitting persons to go from staten island to the menofwar at or near sandy hook and as the person from whom he has received the intelligence resides at new ark within the district of your commitee i must request it as a matter of great importance that your committee will as soon as possible call on david ogden esqr to declare who the person was who informed him that he had engaged the guard of the riflemen at staten island to carry him on board the menofwar with all the circumstances within his knowledge and also that you do call on the person whom he points out to be his informant to declare every circumstance within his knowledge relative to the matter george washington    june      new york to the committee of safety of pennsylvania new york    june      gentlemen i was this evening honored with yours of the    instt and it is with no small degree of pain that i am under the necessity of informing you that it is     out of my power at this time to comply with the request made by your honorable body  the many important works carrying on for the defence of this place against which there is the highest probability of an attack being made in a little time will not allow me to spare from hence any person having the least skill in the business as an engineer nor have i but one on whose judgment i should wish to depend in laying out any work of the least consequence congress well know my wants in this instance and several of my late letters to em have pressed the appointment of gentlemen qualified for the business added to this on account of the deficiency i have not been able to secure or improve two posts in the highlands esteemed of the utmost importance to prevent the enemy passing up the north river and getting into the interior parts of this colony should our attempts to stop them here prove ineffectual but i beg you to be assured sir and to inform the committee as soon as it is in my power i shall with infinite pleasure direct a person to attend them for two or three days if the service will not admit of a longer absence in order to trace out such works and plans for carrying them on as shall appear necessary and wishing you to ascribe my noncompliance to want of ability and not inclination to comply with your request i have the honor c   0 george washington    june      john parke custis forged letter to john parke custis    june      my very dear jack you have exceedingly obliged me by your letter which i received by yesterdays post it discovers an attention to the great affairs now carrying on and an information concerning them which i own to you i had not given you credit for your youth and inexperience pleaded your excuse and though you gave me no opportunity to praise you for any active exertions i paid you no ordinary compliments in my own mind for your modesty in forbearing to meddle with things which it was no reproach to you to confess were out of your reach considering your rank fortune and education whenever it is proper for you to come forward on the theatre it must not be any underpart that you act you are therefore certainly in the right to decline taking any part at all till you are fit for a first and leading character and you have my full and perfect approbation of your resolution to persist in your purpose for the present not to accept of any rank civil or military i see your anxiety lest the present opportunity for signalizing your just love for your country should by your unnecessary caution be suffered to slip by you unimproved your ardor is commendable and far be it from me to discourage in you a spirit i so much love but whilst you retain these honorable principles there is little danger of your wanting opportunities to call them forth into action the momentous enterprize in which your country is engaged is not to be accomplished in this or that year if in no longer a period than the siege of troy we bring all our mighty schemes to bear it will be the greatest work that ever was perfected in so little a time you have set your heart you tell me on a military employment this is the usual bent of young men and as it was my own it will be with an ill grace that i reprehend it in you but with the experience that i have had of it i should be wanting in that love and esteem i owe you should i hesitate to tell you that as your father there is not a profession you could have chosen in which i should not more cordially have concurred with you yet i love arms i am married to my sword as well as to your amiable mother and herein is my witness that i am in earnest when i say death alone shall divorce me from either i am not so blindly devoted however to my profession as not to see by how frail a tenure i hold the little reputation i have in it as a statesman as a senator it is in the general sufficient that you mean well that you are careful to qualify yourself to form a right judgment of the true interests of your     country and that with the honest impartiality of a free man you have still exerted your best endeavors to promote those interests but with a soldier success alone is merit and there is nothing that can atone for the want of it the world is a worse judge of military matters than any other it would astonish you to find on a minute comparison how very little difference there was in the skill and spirit which guided braddock and wolfe in the last actions of their lives but how different has been their fateâ€”i think i am not without some talents for the line of life which has fallen to my lot but opposed as i must be by men probably of infinitely superior skill and encompassed moreover with such hosts of other difficulties and discouragements as i am it is not mine to command success and when either my contemporaries or future historians shall sit in judgment on my conduct if haply illfortune should overtake me seeing our miscarriages only and having neither curiosity nor ability to investigate the thousand causes which led to them am i not too well warranted in concluding that they will be attributed to mismanagement have i not then reason to wish that your choice had fallen on the quieter but not less important calling of a private gentleman in which as a senator you might have given proof of your abilities in a way in which fortune would not have had so great a share but notwithstanding all this and if after all you be irrevocably determined to try your fortune in the field and you can gain your mothers and your wifes consent i here give it you under my hand that you shall not want mine most certainly there cannot be a more honorable employment and if which heaven avert fortune should declare against you my consolation will be that i can assure myself you will deserve to be successful i will on the opening of the next campaign procure you an appointment to the command of a regiment either here or in the southern wing and if my opinion may have any weight with you you will for many reasons prefer the being stationed in some of the southern states there is no fear of its being an inactive station i have little expectation that this year will close with aught considerably decisive on either side and if our enemies be able to hold out another campaign it is most likely their policy will be by means of their naval superiority to carry on a kind of an incursive war by making unexpected descents in different and distant places meanwhile permit me to press you to persevere in your attention to military matters the manual exercise which you were so justly diligent to learn whilst i was with you is but the a b c of your profession neither will you profit so much as you might reasonably expect from the study of those authors who have written professedly on the art of war this     is like the learning the game of whist by reading hoyle i have been witness to the mischievious effects of it a man booklearned only does very well in the still scenes of marchings and encampments but when in the various bustles of actual war a cause arises as must often be the case not described in his books he is utterly at a loss i would not however have you to understand me as if i meant to discourage your reading these books at all so far from it i would have you read them very often and make yourself acquainted with the subject as much as you can in theory my caution meant only to guard you against placing too much reliance on them their best commentators next to your own experience will be the historians of greece and rome which it is your happiness to be able to read in the originals but the main and most essential qualification is an high sense of honor an elevation of sentiment and a certain dignified stile of behavior that distinguishes or should distinguish a soldier from every other man it is a shame indeed if he who undertakes to command others has not first learned to command himself i will not endure any thing mean or sordid either in your principles or your manners having determined if it were left with me to be as strict and rigorous in these particulars as were the knights of old when a candidate was to be invested with the orders of chivalry i cannot dissociate the ideas between a soldier and a gentleman and however common it may be to give that last appellation to persons of every character it yet conveys to me an idea of worth i want words to express i am not solicitous to pay you compliments even by implication but i may certainly be permitted to say that if i had not known you to be a gentlemen you never should have had my consent to your becoming a soldier your observations on this important contest are just and accurate and discover a reach of thought and a penetration beyond what i had expected of you what you say on the subject of independency is perfectly judicious and no doubt highly worthy of all our most serious consideration yet i have a presentiment that it will take place and speedily open and unreserved as my conduct towards you has ever been i have no reluctance to confess to you that the measure is diametrically opposite to my judgment for i have not yet despaired of an honorable reconciliation and whilst i can entertain but an hope of that both interest and inclination lead me to prefer it to every thing else upon earth human affairs are oddly ordered to obtain what you most wish for you must often make use of means you the least approve of as in bargaining to obtain a fair and equal price you must frequently ask more than you wish to take i do not really wish for independence i hope     there are few who do but i have never heard the reasonings of those who have proved that if we did not declare for it we should fail to obtain the constitutional subordination to which we are entitled fairly refuted i would not have you therefore hastily conclude that if in this struggle we fall short of every thing we have claimed we are worsted perhaps the very worst thing that could befal us is that we should gain all i do assure you that in my opinion the next misfortune to that of being thrust from our just rank in the order of freemen would be the giving us up and leaving us to ourselves but this great britain will never do voluntarily for if even she does whatever may become of us from that moment she may date the commencement of her own downfall i am exceedingly happy in the becoming moderation which you observe and endeavor to introduce towards the unhappy men whose political creeds differ from ours but for this blot in her scutcheon thrown on her by two many of her rash and unworthy advocates by a contrary conduct this effort of america would have done her honor even though she had failed i am shocked at the instances of intolerance i daily hear of and have no power to prevent but like the other evils of war it is a calamity that unavoidably grows out of such a convulsion and one might as well hope to stem the fury of a torrent as to give laws to an outraged people it is however the duty of every true friend to liberty by every gentle and conciliatory means in his power to restrain it and i am happy to find this sentiment daily becoming more general amongst us all things considered i cannot but think it not a little to our honor that things have not been carried to still a greater heighth in this way remember me affectionately to nelly and tell her that though i should be most happy to see her i may not hope for that happiness speedily as the din of arms i imagine would be but unpleasing entertainment to her and i have little prospect of any leisure at least before we go into winter quarters i hope mr calvert and all the family are well i beg to be remembered to them i will write to your mother in a few days you are very good in leaving her alone as little as may be continue to write to me frequently freely and fully the hearing of my dearest friends and familys welfare being the only true happiness i have any chance to enjoy amidst the perpetual hurry in which i live i am my dear jack your very affectionate friend and father geo washington      george washington  0 june      new york to the president of congress new york  0 june      sir i am now to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of the   th and   th instant and the interesting resolves contained in them with which i have been honored the several matters recommended to my attention shall be particularly regarded and the directions of congress and your requests complied with in every instance as far as in my power the instituting a waroffice is certainly an event of great importance and in all probability will be recorded as such in the historic page the benefits     derived from it i flatter myself will be considerable though the plan upon which it is first formed may not be entirely perfect this like other great works in its first edition may not be free from error time will discover its defects and experience suggest the remedy and such further improvements as may be necessary but it was right to give it a beginning in my opinion  the recommendation of the convention of new york for restraining and punishing disaffected persons i am hopefull will be attended with salutary consequences and the prohibition against exporting provisions appears to have been a measure founded in sound policy lest proper supplies should be wanted wherewith to subsist our armies i have transmitted general schuyler the resolves about the indians and the others on which he is to act and have requested his strict attention and exertions in order to their being carried into execution with all possible despatch i note your request respecting mr hancockâ€”he shall have such directions as may be necessary for     conducting his office and are happy he will have so early a remittance for paying the troops in his department the silver and paper money designed for canada will be highly serviceable and i hope will be the means of reestablishing our credit there in some degree with the canadians and also encourage our men too who have complained in this instance when it arrives i will send it forward under a proper guard i have communicated to majorgeneral gates the resolve of congress for him to repair to canada and directed him to view pointaufer  that a fortress may be erected if he shall judge it necessary he is preparing for his command and in a few days will take his departure for it i would fain hope his arrival there will give our affairs a complexion different from what they have worn for a long time past and that many essential benefits will result from it the kind attention congress have shown to afford the commanderinchief here every assistance by resolving that recommendatory letters be written to the conventions of new jersey new york and assembly of connecticut to authorize him to call in the militia in case of exigency claims my thankful acknowledgments and i trust if carried into execution will produce many advantages in case it may be expedient at any time to call in early reinforcements the delays incident to the ordinary mode may frequently     render their aid too late and prove exceedingly injurious i this evening received intelligence of the   th inst from capt pond of the armed sloop schuyler of his having taken about  0 miles from this on the south side of long island a ship and a sloop bound to sandy hookâ€”the ship from glasgow with a company of the    regimt had been taken by one of commodore hopkinss fleet who took the soldiers out and ordered her to rhode islandâ€”after which it was retaken by the cerberus and put under the convoy of the sloopâ€”as captain pond informs there were five commissd officers two ladies  four privates on boardâ€”they are not yet arrived at head quartersâ€”inclosed is an invoice of what they have on board general wooster having expressed an inclination and wish to wait on congress i have given him permission not having any occasion for him here he set out this morning i have been up to view the grounds about kingsbridge and find them to admit of several places well calculated for defence and esteeming it a pass of the utmost importance have ordered works to be laid out and shall direct part of the two battalions from pennsylvania to set about the execution immediately and will add to their numbers several of the militia when they come in to expedite them with all possible despatch  their consequence     as they will keep open the communication with the country requires the most speedy completion of them i am c  george washington  0 june      new york majorgeneral schuyler to majorgeneral schuyler new york  0 june      dear sir i herewith transmit to you sundry resolves of congress respecting the indians the fortifying fort stanwix and for rendering more easy and commodious our passes into canada as the resolves are of an interesting and important nature i must request your particular attention to them and most active exertions for accomplishing and carrying the whole into execution with all possible despatch i am hopeful the bounty which congress have agreed to allow as you will perceive by the last resolve will prove a powerful inducement to engage the indians in our service and their endeavors to make prisoners of all the kings troops they possibly can  you will use every method you shall judge necessary to conciliate their favor and to this end you are authorized to promise them a punctual payment of the allowance congress have determined on     for such officers and privates belonging to the kings army as they may captivate and deliver to us june   stâ€”i have this moment received your favors of the   th and   th and the post being about to depart have not time to answer them fully i shall only add that lady johnson may remain at albany till further directions i am c george washington    june      new york to the president of congress new york    june      sir i herewith transmit you an extract of a letter from general ward which came to hand by last nights post containing the agreeable intelligence of their having obliged the kings ships to leave nantasket road and of two transports more being taken by our armed vessels with two hundred and ten highland troops on board  i sincerely wish the like success had attended our arms in another quarter but it has not in canada   0 the situation of our affairs is truly alarming the enclosed copies of generals schuylers sullivans and arnolds letters will inform you that general thompson has met with a repulse at three rivers and is now a prisoner in the hands of general burgoyne who these accounts say is arrived with a considerable army  nor do they seem to promise an end to our misfortunes here it is greatly to be feared that the next advices from thence will be that our shattered divided and broken army as you will see by the return have been obliged to abandon the country and retreat to avoid a greater calamity that of being cut off or becoming prisoners i will be done upon the subject and leave you to draw such conclusions as you conceive from the state of facts are most likely to result only adding my apprehensions that one of the latter events either that they are cut off or become prisoners has already happened if they did not retreat while they had an opportunity     general schuyler and general arnold seem to think it extremely probable and if it has taken place it will not be easy to describe all the fatal consequences that may flow from it at least our utmost exertions will be necessary to prevent the advantages they have gained from being turned to our greater misfortunes general gates will certainly set out tomorrow and would have gone before now had he not expected to receive some particular instructions from congress which colonel braxton said he imagined would be given and transmitted here enclosed is a copy of a letter from general arnold respecting some of the indian tribes to general schuyler and of a talk had at albany with thirteen of the oneidas they seemed then to entertain a friendly disposition towards us which i wish may not be changed by the misfortunes we have sustained in canada i have the honor to be c  george washington majorgeneral gates to majorgeneral gates instructions sir the honorable continental congress reposing the greatest confidence in your wisdom and experience have directed me to appoint you to the very important command of the troops of the united colonies in canada with power to appoint a deputy adjutantgeneral a deputy quartermastergeneral a deputy mustermastergeneral and such other officers as you shall find necessary for the good of the service you are also empowered to fill up all vacancies in the army in canada and notify the same to congress for their approbation     you are also authorized until the first of october next to suspend any officers and fill up all vacancies transmitting to the honorable congress such order and suspension giving your reasons therefor and specifying the particular charge made against such officer you are directed previous to your departure to consult with the commissarygeneral and concert with him the most effectual measures for continuing proper supplies of provisions for that department you are in like manner to consult with colonel knox about the artillery which may be wanted and what may probably be procured there and whether any brass or iron fieldpieces can be spared from hence for that service upon your arrival in albany you will consult with general schuyler in regard to the present state of provisions and stores and fix upon some certain means of forwarding the regular supplies in future from that place at the same time endeavor to learn whether supplies heretofore sent have not reached that department and by what means such failures have happened that a proper remedy may be provided from general schuyler you will also receive such advice and information respecting the operations of the campaign as may be useful and necessary you are to direct all the general officers deputy quartermastergeneral local commissaries paymaster in canada and all other persons there or on the communication without delay to render their accounts and settle them no general officer on such settlement is to receive pay as colonel of a regiment nor any fieldofficer as captain of a company upon your taking the command of the troops you will give particular orders agreeably to a rule of congress that no officer shall suttle or sell to the soldiers on penalty of being fined one months pay and being dismissed the service with infamy that all sales of arms clothing ammunition and accoutrements made by soldiers are to be deemed void and that the baggage of officers and soldiers is hereafter to be regulated conformably to the rules of the british army by a like resolve no troops in canada are to be disbanded there but all soldiers in that country ordered to be disbanded or their times of enlistment being expired refusing to reenlist shall be sent under proper officers to ticonderoga or such other     posts on the lakes as you shall direct where they are to be mustered and the arms accoutrements blankets and utensils which they may have belonging to the public shall be delivered up and deposited in the public store you will as soon as possible make as accurate a return as you can procure of the troops artillery arms ammunition provisions and stores which you find in canada or upon the communication with albany distinguishing where stationed and in what magazines and if possible transmit such a return to the honorable continental congress and to me once a fortnight the distance of the scene and the frequent changes which have happened in the state of our affairs in canada do not allow me to be more particular in my instructions the command is important the service difficult but honorable and i most devoutly pray that providence may crown our arms with abundant success given under my hand at headquarters new york june   th       george washington    june      new york majorgeneral schuyler to majorgeneral schuyler new york    june      dear sir on the  0 inst i received your two favors of the   th    th by bennet and yesterday evening that of the    continued to the  0th with genl sullivans     letter and return and the several copies you inclosed the accounts transmitted by general sullivan are truly alarming and i confess i am not without apprehension lest the next advices should be that the unfortunate defeat and taking of general thompson have been succeeded by an event still more unfortunate the destruction of a large part if not the whole of our army in that quarter the weak divided and disheartened state in which general sullivan represents it to be does not seem to promise any thing much more favorable and is what general arnold appears to be suspicious of from the whole of the accounts supposing the facts all true there was nothing left to prevent their ruin but a retreat  that i hope has been made as the only means of saving themselves and rendering their country the least service by reason of the succession of ills that has attended us there of late and this last one i fear we must give up all hopes of possessing that country of such importance in the present controversy and that our views and utmost exertions must be turned to prevent the incursions of the enemy into our colonies to this end i must pray your strictest attention and request that you will use all the means in your power to fortify and secure every post and place of importance on the communication you are as much impressed with the necessity of the measure as any man can be and with confidence i trust that nothing     you can do will be wanting to effect it if the troops have retreated they will in a little time i am hopefull complete such works on the passes as to bid defiance to the most vigorous efforts of the enemy to penetrate our country especially when you are assisted by the militia who most probably are on their march ere now had this unfortunate defeat not happened the militia were designed not only to reinforce the army in canada but to keep up the communication with that province as you will see by recurring to the resolve directing them to be employed      majorgeneral gates whom congress had appointed to command after general thomass death will set out tomorrow and take with him one hundred barrells of powder out of which the supplies necessary for the different posts must be drawn i have also directed col knox to send up the cannon you wrote for if they can be possibly spared from hence with some artillerists c a proper quantity of ball and other necessaries for them and will in every instance afford you all the assistance i can at the same time i wish if there are any cannon at ticonderoga or other necessaries there or elsewhere that you may want and which can be spared for any other post or purpose that you would get them in preference to any here as the number we have is not more than sufficient for the extensive and important works necessary to be maintained for the defence of this place in respect to the proceedings of the commissioners for raising two companies of the mohekans or and connecticut indians they appear to me not to answer the views of congress as i presume they live within the government of connecticut and are to be considered in the same light with its inhabitants and that their design was extended to those who were not     livers among us and were of hostile character or doubtfull friendship but in this i may be mistaken and there may be a necessity of engaging those you have to secure their interest as to your doubts about the officer commanding in canada his right to punish capitally i should suppose that necessity independent of any thing else would justify the exercise of such an authority but congress having determined that the commanding officer there should inflict exemplary punishmt on those who violate the military regulations established by them has put the matter out of question and i apprehend every commander there has such power and of right may and should exercise it as colonel parsons has requested you to send down the person who is supposed to have murdered his brother i have no objection to your doing it if you judge necessary he from what i have been told designs to apply to congress for instituting some mode of trial for the offence i am dear sir your most obedient servant george washington    june      mrs washington forged letter to mrs washington    june      my dearest life and love you have hurt me i know not how much by the insinuation in your last that my letters to you have lately been less frequent because i have felt less concern for you the suspicion is most unjustâ€”may i not add it is most unkind have we lived now almost a score of years in the closest and dearest conjugal intimacy to so little purpose that on an appearance only of inattention to you and which you might have accounted for in a thousand ways more     natural and more probable you should pitch upon that single motive which alone is injurious to me i have not i own wrote so often to you as i wished and as i ought but think of my situation and then ask your heart if i be without excuse we are not my dearest in circumstances the most favorable to our happiness but let us not i beseech you idly make them worse by indulging suspicions and apprehensions which minds in distress are but apt to give way to i never was as you have often told me even in my better and more disengaged days so attentive to the little punctilios of friendship as it may be became me but my heart tells me there never was a moment in my life since i first knew you in which it did not cleave and cling to you with the warmest affection and it must cease to beat ere it can cease to wish for your happiness above any thing on earth i congratulate you most cordially on the fair prospect of recovery of your amiable daughterinlaw nor can i wonder that this second loss of a little one should affect you i fear the fatigues of the journey and the perpetual agitations of a camp were too much for her they are however both young and healthy so that there can be little doubt of their soon repairing the loss and now will my dearest love permit me a little more earnestly than i have ever yet done to press you to consent to that so necessary so safe and so easy though so dreadful a thingâ€”the being innoculated it was always advisable but at this juncture it seems to be almost absolutely necessary i am far from sure that that restless madman our quondam governor from the mere lust of doing mischief will not soon betake himself to the carrying on a predatory war in our rivers and as potomack will certainly be thought most favorable for his purposes as affording him scope to keep without the reach of annoyance i have little reason to flatter myself that it would not be particularly pleasing to him to vent his spite at my house let him it would affect me only as it might affect you and for this reason among others i wish you out of his reach yet i think i would not have you quit your house professedly from an apprehension of a visit from him an appearance of fearfulness and timidity even in a woman of my family might have a bad effect but i must be something more or less than man not to wish you out of the way of a danger which to say the least must be disagreeable to you and could do good to no one all this makes for your going to philadelphia a place of perfect security and it would almost be worth while to be innoculated if it were only for the fair pretence it furnishes you with of quitting virginia at a time when i could not but be exceedingly uneasy at your remaining in it     but i flatter myself any further argument will be unnecessary when i shall add as i now do that till you have had the smallpox anxiously as else i should wish for it i never can think of consenting to your passing the winter here in quarters with me i would have lund washington immediately remove all the unmarried and suspicious of the slaves to the quarters in frederick the harvesting must be got in by hirelings let him not keep any large stock of grain trod out especially at the mill or within the reach of water carriage in particular let as little as may be be left at cliftons quarters it will not be too late even in the first week of july to sow the additional supply of hemp and flaxseed which mr mifflin has procured for me in philadelphia and which i hope will be with you before this letter for obvious reasons you will not sow it on the island nor by the water side but i hope you will have a good account of your crop on the ohio if bridgey continues refractory and riotous though i know you can ill spare him let him by all means be sent off as i hope jack custiss boy joe already is for his sauciness at cambridge my attention is this moment called off to the discovery or pretended discovery of a plot it is impossible as yet to develope the mystery in which it either is or is supposed to be involved thus much only i can find out with certainty that it will be a fine field for a war of lies on both sides no doubt it will make a good deal of noise in the country and there are who think it useful to have the minds of the people kept constantly on the fret by rumors of this sort for my part i who am said to be the object principally aimed at in it find myself perfectly at my ease and i have mentioned it to you only from an apprehension that hearing it from others and not from me you might imagine that i was in the midst of danger that i knew not of the perpetual solicitude of your poor heart about me is certainly highly flattering to me yet i should be happy to be able to quiet your fears why do you complain of my reserve or how could you imagine that i distrusted either your prudence or your fidelity i have the highest opinion of them both but why should i teaze you with tedious details of schemes and views which are perpetually varying and which therefore might not improbably mislead where i meant to inform you suffice it that i say what i have often before told you that as far as i have the control of them all our preparations of war aim only at peace neither do i at this moment see the least likelihood of there being any considerable military operations this season and if not in this season certainly in no other it is impossible to suppose that in the leisure   0 and quiet of winter quarters men will not have virtue to listen to the dictates of plain common sense and sober reason the only true interest of both sides is reconciliation nor can there be a point in the world clearer than that both sides must be losers by war in a manner which even peace will not compensate for we must at last agree and be friends for we cannot live without them and they will not without us and a byestander might well be puzzled to find out why as good terms cannot be given and taken now as when we shall have well nigh ruined each other by the mutual madness of cutting one anothers throats for all these reasons which cannot but be as obvious to the english commissioners and ours as they are to me i am at a loss to imagine how any thing can arise to obstruct a negotiation and of consequence a pacification you who know my heart know that there is not a wish nearer to it than this is but i am prepared for every event one only exceptedâ€”i mean a dishonorable peace rather than that let me though with the loss of every thing else i hold dear continue this horrid trade and by the most unlikely means be the unworthy instrument of preserving political security and happiness to them as well as to ourselvesâ€”pity this cannot be accomplished without fixing on me that sad name rebel i love my king you know i do a soldier a good man cannot but love him how peculiarly hard then is our fortune to be deemed traitors to so good a king but i am not without hopes that even he will yet see cause to do me justice posterity i am sure will mean while i comfort myself with the reflection that this has been the fate of the best and bravest men even of the barons who obtained magna charta whilst the dispute was pending this however anxiously as i wish for it it is not mine to command i see my duty that of standing up for the liberties of my country and whatever difficulties and discouragements lie in my way i dare not shrink from it and i rely on that being who has not left to us the choice of duties that whilst i conscientiously discharge mine i shall not finally lose my reward if i really am not a bad man i shall not long be so set down assure yourself i will pay all possible attention to your recommendations but happy as i am in an opportunity of obliging you even in the smallest things take it not amiss that i use the freedom with you to whisper in your ear to be sparing of them you know how i am circumstanced hardly the promotion of a subaltern is left me and free and independent as i am i resolve to remain so i owe the congress no obligations for any personal favors done to myself nor will i run in debt to them for favors to others besides i am mortified to have to ask of them what in sound policy if other motives     had been wanting they ought to have granted to me unasked i cannot describe to you the inconveniences this army suffers for want of this consequence being given to its commander in chief but as these might be increased were my peculiar situation in this respect generally known i forbear only enjoining you a cautious silence on this headâ€”in a regular army our virginia young men would certainly in general make the best officers but i regret that they have not now put it in my power justly to pay them this compliment they dislike their northern allies and this dislike is the source of infinite mischiefs and vexations to me in the many disputes and quarrels of this sort which we have had one thing has particularly struck me my countrymen are not inferior in understanding and are certainly superior in that distinguished spirit and high sense of honor which should form the character of an officer yet somehow or other it forever happens that in every altercation they are proved to be in the wrong and they expect of me attentions and partialities which it is not in my power to shew them let me rely that your answer to this will be dated in philadelphia if i am not very busily engaged which i hope may not be the case perhaps i may find ways and means to pay you a visit of a day or two but this i rather hint as what i wish than what i dare bid you expect if you still think the fragments of the set of greys i bought of lord botetourt unequal to the journey let lund washington sell them singly or otherwise as he can to the best advantage and purchase a new set of bays i could as you desire get them here and perhaps on better terms but i have a notion whether well or ill founded i know not that they never answer well in virginia i beg to be affectionately remembered to all our friends and relations and that you will continue to believe me to be your most faithful and tender husband  george washington    june      new york to the president of congress new york    june      sir i this morning received by express letters from generals schuyler and arnold with a copy of one     from general sullivan to the former and also of others to general sullivan of all which i do myself the honor to transmit to you copies they will give you a further account of the melancholy situation of our affairs in canada and show that there is nothing left to save our army there but evacuating the country i am hopeful general sullivan would retreat from the isleauxnoix without waiting for previous orders for that purpose as from generals schuylers and arnolds letters it is much to be feared by remaining there any considerable time his retreat would be cut off or at best be a matter of extreme difficulty i would observe to congress that it is not in my power to send any carpenters from hence to build the gondolas and galleys general arnold mentions without taking them from a work equally necessary if not more so here of the same kind and submit it to them whether it may not be advisable as it is of great importance to us to have a number of those vessels on the lake to prevent the enemy passing to withdraw the carpenters for the present from the frigates building up the north river and detach them immediately with all that can be got at philadelphia for that purpose and carrying on those here i have the pleasure to inform you of another capture made by our armed vessels of a transport on the   th instant with a company of highland grenadiers on board the enclosed extract of a letter from general ward by last nights post contains the particulars to which i beg leave to refer you i have been honored with your favors of the   st     and    inst in due order with their important enclosures to which i shall particularly attend i have transmitted to general schuyler a copy of the resolve of congress respecting the mohickan and stockbridge indians and directed him to put an immediate stop to the raising the two companies  the quarter master general has been called upon for stopping the tents designed for massachusetts bay and ordered to forward them immediatelyâ€”he means to write to congress upon the subject and hopes his conduct will not appear to deserve their reprehension of this they will judge from his relation of the matter being extremely desirous to forward the intelligence from canada to congress well knowing their anxiety about our affairs there i must defer writing upon some other matters i want to lay before them till the next opportunity which i hope will be tomorrow when i will inform them fully upon the subject of rations having desired the commissary general to furnish me with some things necessary in that instance i have c      george washington    june      new york to the president of congress new york    june      sir in compliance with the request of congress contained in your favor of the    inst and my promise of yesterday i do myself the honor to inform you     that the cost of a ration according to the commissary generals estimate from the  st of july to the  st of december will be from  d to  Â½ york currency having discharged the obligation i was under in this instance and finding that many applications have been made for victualling the flying camp i would with all possible deference wish congress to consider the matter well before they come to any determination upon it who the gentlemen are that have made offers upon this occasion i know not consequently my objections to their appointment cannot proceed from personal dislike nor have i it in view to serve mr trumbull the commissary general by wishing him to have the direction of the whole supplies for his emolument because whatever rations are taken from him save him the trouble of supplying provisions to the amount without diminishing his pay that being fixed and certain but what influences me is a regard to the public good i am morally certain if the business is taken out of mr trumbulls hands and put into anothers that it may and will in all probability be attended with great and many inconveniences it is likely during the continuance of the war between us and great britain that the army here or part of it and the troops composing the flying camp will be frequently joined and under the necessity of affording each other mutual aid if this event is probable and most certainly it is the same confusion and disorder will result from having two commissaries     or one commissary and one contractor in the same army in the same department as did between mr trumbull and mr livingston on the coming of the former to new york i cannot discriminate the two cases and not foreseeing that any good consequences will flow from the measure but that many bad ones will such as clashing of interestsâ€”a contention for stores carriages and many other causes that might be mentioned if hurry of business would permit i confess i cannot perceive the propriety of appointing a different person or any but the commissary i would also add that few armies if any have been better supplied than the troops under mr trumbulls care in this instance which i should suppose ought to have considerable weight especially as we have strong reasons to believe that a large share of the misfortunes our arms have sustained in canada sprang from a want of proper and necessary supplies of provisions mr trumbull too i am informed has already made provision in new jersey for the flying camp which will be stationed there and employed proper persons in that colony to transact the business incident to his department in obedience to my orders and his full confidence that it was to come under his management my great desire to see the affairs of this important post on which so much depends go on in an easy smooth and uninterrupted course has led me to say thus much upon the subject and will i hope if i am unhappy enough to differ in opinion with congress plead my excuse for the liberty i have taken     i would also beg leave to mention to congress the necessity there is of some new regulations being entered into respecting the chaplains of this army they will remember that applications were made to increase their pay which was conceived too low for their support and that it was proposed if it could not be done for the whole that the number should be lessened and one be appointed to two regiments with an additional allowance this latter expedient was adopted and while the army continued altogether at one encampment answered well or at least did not produce many inconveniences but the army now being differently circumstanced from what it then wasâ€”part hereâ€”part at bostonâ€”and a third part detached to canada has induced much confusion and disorder in this instance nor do i know how it is possible to remedy the evil but by affixing one to each regiment with salaries competent to their support no shifting no change from one regiment to another can answer the purpose and in many cases it would never be done the regiments should consent as where details are composed of unequal numbers or ordered from different posts many more inconveniences might be pointed out but these it is presumed will sufficiently shew the defect of the present establishment and the propriety of an alterationâ€”what that alteration shall be congress will please to determine congress i doubt not will have heard of the plot that was forming among many disaffected persons in this city and government for aiding the kings troops upon their arrival no regular plan seems to have     been digested but several persons have been enlisted and sworn to join them the matter i am in hopes by a timely discovery will be suppressed and put a stop to many citizens and others among whom is the mayor are now in confinement the matter has been traced up to governor tryon and the mayor appears to have been a principal agent or gobetween him and the persons concerned in it the plot had been communicated to some of the army and part of my guard engaged in it thomas hickey one of them has been tried and by the unanimous opinion of a courtmartial is sentenced to die having enlisted himself and engaged others the sentence by the advice of the whole council of general officers will be put in execution today at eleven oclock the others are not tried i am hopeful this example will produce many salutary consequences and deter others from entering into the like traitorous practices      the enclosed copy of a resolve of the provincial congress will show that some of the disaffected on long island have taken up arms i have agreeably to their request sent a party after them but have not as yet been able to apprehend them having concealed themselves in different woods and morasses general gates set out on tuesday with a fine wind which has been fair ever since and would soon arrive at albany i this moment received a letter from lieutenant davison of the schuyler armed sloop a copy of which i have enclosed to which i beg leave to refer you for the intelligence communicated by him  i could wish general howe and his armament   0 not to arrive yet as not more than a thousand militia have yet come in and our whole force including the troops at all the detached posts and on board the armed vessels which are comprehended in our returns is but small and inconsiderable when compared with the extensive lines they are to defend and most probably the army that he brings i have no farther intelligence about him than what the lieutenant mentions but it is extremely probable his accounts and conjectures are true i have the honor to be c p s i have inclosed a genl returnâ€” it may be certainly depended on that genl howe  fleet have sailed from halifaxâ€” some of the men on board the prizes mentd in the lts letter were on board the greyhound  saw genl howe  george washington    june      new york majorgeneral schuyler to majorgeneral schuyler new york    june      dear sir your favor of the   th and its inclosures with genl arnolds of the same date i received by yesterday mornings expressâ€”that of the   th came by todays post i am sorry general sullivan in the situation our affairs were in should have stopped at the isleauxnoix until he could obtain orders for retreating further thereby hazarding his army without a prospect of success and rendering his retreat liable to an interception or at least difficult in case     the enemy were in a condition to pursue their victory for these reasons i cannot but approve your directions and i hope they have arrived in time if he had not before left the isleauxnoix by the advice of his council of war and joint intercession of his officers my letter of the   th would show you had it been received that from his representation of matters i thought a retreat the only means left for the security of his army and doing the least essential service to their country if he gets off i shall be happy that our loss was so inconsiderable in numbers though i regret much the captivity of general thompson i have wrote congress about carpenters on general arnolds letter and having none to spare from hence have pointed out the necessity of their sending some from philadelphia if not there withdrawing for the present those employed up the north river deeming it a matter of infinite importance to have a considerable number of gundaloes on the lakes to prevent the enemy passing i have directed the quarter master general to procure and forward you the anchors and cables mill saws and files if to be had i have also requested colo knox to examine whether some more field pieces cannot be sent up and i design to order a further quantity of powder to be forwarded you to answer two purposes one that you may have proper supplies for the several posts and every contingencyâ€”the other because i do not wish to keep a larger stock here than may be necessary least any unfortunate     event should cast up and we be deprived of more than we are yet able to loose i would have you make ready every thing necessary for taking post at fort stanwix and when you are prepared to use your utmost industry for erecting and completing the work our most vigorous exertions will be required in every instance i am convinced our enemies will strain their every nerve against us this campaign and try to injure us wherever we may be unprovided it will be extremely proper to forward on the militia for reinforcing the several garrisons on the communication and securing the different passes i wish they were not so slow in repairing to the places of rendezvous but i would fain apprehend they will be in time to prevent any attempts our enemies may have in view i am extremely sorry for your indisposition and that you should be so harrassed by the ague and fever and wishing you a perfect recovery from it and a speedy one i am dear sir c p s congress by a letter i received from the president last night have resolved up on four thousand men more to augment the army in the northern department and recommended the colonies of new hampshire immediately to send one regimt of militiaâ€”massachusetts two and connecticut oneâ€”they have also resolved on a bounty of ten dollars for every soldier that will inlist for three years and requested the several governments who are to furnish militias to do it with all possible expedition      our armed vessels at the eastward have taken some valuable prizesâ€”and also three more transports safely brought in with about   0 or  0 highland troops well accoutred captain nedel one of commodore hopkins fleet took two also with about   0 moreâ€”he put all the prisoners on board one of the prizes we fear she is retakenâ€”the arms he took into his own vessellâ€”the other prize was retaken and again taken by another of our vesselsâ€”yesterday i received a letter from lt davison of the schuyler armd sloop advisg that she with another of our cruizers had retaken   prizes which had been taken by the grey hound man of warâ€”the prisoners on board the prizes informed the lt that genl howe was on board the grey hound and sailed from hallifax the   inst with     transportsâ€”that they saw a vessel the evening before standing towards the hook which they imagined was the grey hound there is reason to conclude he is now thereâ€”the militia ordered for the defence of this place come on slowlyâ€”not more than a thousand yet arrivedâ€”our force by no means so strong as it should beâ€”it is     said and i believe with authority that  0 tons of powder and  000 sterlgs worth of goods have got into providence  george washington    june      new york to the president of congress new york    june      sir i was last night honored with your favour of   th inst and agreable to your request shall pay proper attention to the resolves it inclosed i observe the augmentation congress have resolved to make to the forces destined for the northern department and the bounty to be allowed such soldiers as will inlist for three years i hope many good consequences     will result from these measures and that from the latter a considerable number of men may be induced to engage in the service i should esteem myself extremely happy to afford the least assistance to the canada department in compliance with the desire of congress and your requisition were it in my power but it is not the return which i transmitted yesterday will but too well convince congress of my incapacity in this instance and point out to them that the force i now have is trifling considering the many and important posts that are necessary and must be supported if possible but few militia have yet come in the whole being about twelve hundred including the two battalions of this city and one company from the jerseys i wish the delay may not be attended with disagreable circumstances and their aid may not come too late or when it may not be wanted i have wrote i have done everything i could to call them in but they have not come tho i am told that they are generally willing the accounts communicated yesterday through lieutenant davisons letter are partly confirmed and i dare say will turn out to be true on the whole for two or three days past three or four ships have been dropping in and i just now received an express from an officer appointed to keep a lookout on staten island that fortyfive arrived at the hook today some say more and i suppose the whole fleet will be in within a day or two i am hopeful before they are prepared to attack that i shall get some     reinforcements be that as it may i shall attempt to make the best disposition i can of our troops in order to give them a proper reception and to prevent the ruin and destruction they are meditating against us as soon as the express arrived last night i sent the letters for the northern colonies to the qr master general with orders to forward them immediately when monsieur wiebert comes i have not seen him yet i shall employ him as congress have directedâ€”the terms upon which he offers his service seem to promise something from him  i wish he may answer and be skilled in the business he says he is acquainted with  george washington  0 june      new york to the president of congress new york  0 june      sir i had the pleasure of receiving your favor of the   th early this morning with which you have been pleased to honor me together with the resolves for a further augmentation of our army the battalion of germans which congress have ordered to be raised     will be a corps of much service and i am hopefull that such persons will be appointed officers as will complete their enlistments with all possible expedition i shall communicate to colonel stephenson and one of his fieldofficers what you have requested and direct them to repair immediately to philadelphia it is an unlucky circumstance that the term of enlistment of these three companies and of the rifle battalion should expire at this time when a hot campaign is in all probability about to commence  canada it is certain would have been an important acquisition and well worth the expenses incurred in the pursuit of it but as we could not reduce it to our possession the retreat of our army with so little loss under such a variety of distresses must be esteemed a most fortunate event it is true the accounts we have received do not fully authorize us to say that we have sustained no loss but they hold forth a probable ground for such conclusion i am anxious to hear it confirmed      i have the honor of transmitting to you an extract of a letter received last night from general ward if the scheme the privateers had in view and the measures he had planned have been carried into execution the highland corps will be tolerably well disposed of but i fear the fortunate event has not taken place in general wards letter was enclosed one from lieutenantcolonel campbell who was made prisoner with the highland troops i have transmitted you a copy this will give you a full and exact account of the number of prisoners on board the four transports and will prove beyond a possibility of doubt that the evacuation of boston by the british troops was a matter neither known or expected when he received his orders indeed so many facts had concurred before to settle the matter that no additional proofs were necessary when i had the honor of addressing you yesterday i had only been informed of the arrival of forty five of the fleet in the morning since that i have received authentic intelligence from sundry persons among them from genl greene that one hundred and ten sail came in before night that were counted and that more were seen about dusk in the offing i have no doubt but the whole that sailed from hallifax are now at the hook      just as i was about to conclude my letter i received one from a gentn  upon the subject of calling the five regiments from boston to the defence of canada or new york and to have militia raised in their lieu i have sent you a copy and shall only observe that i know the author well his handwriting is quite familiar to meâ€”he is a member of the general court very sensible of great influence and a warm and zealous friend to the cause of america the expedient proposed by him is submitted to congress i have c   00 george washington july the  d      new york to the president of congress new york july the  d      sir since i had the honor of addressing you and on the same day several ships more arrived within the hook making the number that came in then   0 and there remains no doubt of the whole of the fleet from hallifax being now here yesterday evening  0 of em  0  came into the bay and anchored on the staten island side  their views i cannot precisely determine but am extremely apprehensive as a part of em only came that they mean to surround the island and secure the whole stock upon it i had consulted with a committee of the provincial congress on the subject and a person was appointed to superintend the business and to drive the stock off i also wrote to brigadier general heard and directed  0  him to the measure lest it might be neglected but am fearfull it has not been effected our reinforcements of militia are but small yetâ€”their amount i can not ascertain having not been able to procure a return however i trust if the enemy make an attack they will meet with a repulse as i have the pleasure to inform you that an agreeable spirit  willingness for action seem to animate and pervade the whole of our troops  as it is difficult to determine what objects the  0  enemy may have in contemplation and whether they may not detach some part of their force to amboy and to ravage that part of the country if not to extend their views farther i submit it to congress whether it may not be expedient for em to repeat and press home their requests to the different governments that are to provide men for the flying camp to furnish their quotas with all possible dispatch it is a matter of great importance and will be of serious consequence to the camp established in case the enemy should be able to possess themselves of this river and cut off the supplies of troops that might be necessary on certain emergencies to be sent from hence i must entreat your attention to an application i made some time agoe for flints we are extremely deficient in this necessary article and shall be greatly distressed if we cannot obtain a supplyâ€”  of lead we have a sufficient quantity for the whole campaign taken off the houses here esteeming it of infinite importance to prevent the enemy from getting fresh provisions and horses for their waggons artillery c i gave orders to a party of our men on staten island and writing genl heard to drive the stock off without waiting for the assistance or direction of the committee there lest their slow mode of transacting business might produce too much delay and have sent this morning to know what they have doneâ€”i am this minute informed by a gentleman that the committee  0  of elizabeth town sent their company of light horse on monday to effect it and that some of their militia was to give their aid yesterday he adds he was credibly told last night by part of the militia coming to this place that yesterday evening they saw a good many stock driving off the island and crossing to the jerseysâ€”if the business is not executed ere now it will be impossible to do it i have the honor c  george washington   july      new york to the president of congress new york   july      sir when i had the honor to address you on the  0 ulto i transmitted a copy of a letter i had received from a gentleman a member of the honorable the general court of massachusetts bay suggesting the improbability of succors coming from thence in any seasonable time for the defence of this place or to reinforce our troops engaged in the canada expeditionâ€”i  0  am sorry to inform you that from a variety of intelligence his apprehensions appear to be just and to be fully confirmed nor have i reason to expect but that the supplies from the other two governmts connecticut and new hampshire will be extremely slow and greatly deficient in numberâ€”as it now seems beyond question and clear to demonstration that the enemy mean to direct their operations and bend their most vigorous efforts against this colony and will attempt to unite their two armies that under genl burgoyne and the one arrived here i cannot but think the expedient proposed by that gentleman is exceedingly just and that the continental regiments now in the massachusetts bay should be immediately called from thence and be employed where there is the strongest reason to believe their aid will be indispensably necessary the expediency of the measures i shall submit to the consideration of congress and will only observe as my opinion that there is not the most distant prospect of an attempt being made where they now are by the enemy and if there should that the militia that can be assembled upon the shortest notice will be more than equal to repel itâ€”they are well armed resolute and determined and will instantly oppose any invasion that may be made in their own province i shall also take the liberty again to request congress to interest themselves in having the militia raised and forwarded with all possible expedition as fast as any considerable number of em can be collected that  0  are to compose the flying campâ€”this i mentioned in my letter of yesterday but thought proper to repeat it being more and more convinced of the necessity the camp will be in the neighborhood of amboy and i shall be glad if the conventions or committees of safety of those governments from whence they come may be desired to give me previous notice of their marching that i may form some plan and direct provision to be made for their reception the disaffection of the people at that place and others not far off is exceedingly great and unless it is checked and overawed it may become more general and be very alarming the arrival of the enemy will encourage it they or at least a part of em are already landed on staten island which is quite contiguous and about  000 were marching about yesterday as i have been advised and are leaving no arts unessayed to gain the inhabitants to their side who seem but too favorably disposedâ€”it is not unlikely that in a little time they may attempt to cross to the jersey side and induce many to join em either from motives of interest or fear unless there is a force to oppose em  as we are fully convinced that the ministerial army we shall have to oppose this campaign will be  0  great and numerous and well know that the utmost industry will be used as it already has been to excite the savages and every body of people to arms against us whom they can influence it certainly behoves us to strain every nerve to counteract their designsâ€”i would therefore submit it to congress whether especially as our scheme for employing the western indians does not seem to be attended with any great prospect of success from general schuylers accounts it may not be advisable to take measures to engage those of the eastward the st johns nova scotia penobscot c in our favor i have been told that several might be got perhaps five or six hundred or more readily to join us if they can i should immagine it ought to be done it will prevent our enemies from securing their friendship and further they will be of infinite service in annoying and harrassing them should they ever attempt to penetrate the country congress will be pleased to consider the measure and if they determine to adopt it i conceive it will be necessary to authorize and request the general court of the massachusetts bay to carry it into execution their situation and advantages will enable them to negotiate a treaty and an alliance better than it can be done by any persons else   0  i have been honored with your two favors of the  st instt and agreable to the wishes of congress shall put monsieur wiebert in the best place i can to prove his abilities in the art he professes i shall send him up immediately to the works erecting towards kings bridge under the direction of general mifflin whom i shall request to employ him i have this moment received a letter from general greene an extract from which i have enclosed the intelligence it contains is of the most important nature and evinces the necessity of the most spirited and vigorous exertions on our part the expectation of the fleet under admiral howe is certainly the reason the army already come has not begun its hostile operations when that arrives we may look for the most interesting events and such as in all probability will have considerable weight in the present contest it behoves us to be prepared in the best manner and i submit it again to congress whether the accounts given by their prisoners do not show the propriety of calling the several continental regiments from the massachusetts government raising the flying camp with all possible despatch and engaging the eastern indians july  thâ€”general mercer arrived here on tuesday and the next morning was ordered to paulus hook to make some arrangements of the militia as  0  they came in and the best disposition he could to prevent the enemys crossing from staten island if they should have any such views the distressed situation of the inhabitants of elisabethtown and newark has since induced me upon their application to give up all the militia from the jerseys except those engaged for six months i am hopeful they will be able to repel any incursions that may be attempted generals mercer and livingston are concerting plans for that purpose by a letter from the latter last night i am informed the enemy are throwing up small works at all the passes on the north side of staten island which it is probable they mean to secure none of the connecticut militia is yet arrived so that the reinforcement we have received is very inconsiderable a letter from general schuyler with sundry enclosures of which no        are exact copies this moment came to hand and will no doubt claim as it ought to do the immediate attention of congress the evils which must inevitably follow a disputed command are too obvious and alarming to admit a moments delay in your decision thereupon  and although i do not presume to advise in a matter   0 now of this delicacy yet as it appears evident that the northern army has retreated to crown point and mean to act upon the defensive only i cannot help giving it as my opinion that one of the majorgenerals in that quarter would be more usefully employed here or in the flying camp than there for it becomes my duty to observe if another experienced officer is taken from hence in order to command the flying camp that your grand army will be entirely stripped of generals who have seen service being in a manner already destitute of such  my distress on this account the appointment of general whitcomb to the eastern regiments  a conviction in my own breast that no troops will be sent to boston and the certainty of a number coming to this place occasioned my postponing from time to time the sending of any general officer from hence to the eastward heretofore and now i shall wait the sentiments of congress relative to the five regiments in massachusetts bay before i do any thing in this matter the commissary genl has been with me this     morning concerning the other matter contained in genl schuylers letter respecting the business of that departure he has i believe in order to remove difficulties recalled mr avery but seems to think it necessary in that case that mr livingston should be left to himself as he cannot be responsible for persons not of his own appointmentâ€”this matter should also be clearly defined by congressâ€”i have already given my opinion of the necessity of these in matters being under one genl direction in so full  clear a manner that i shall not take up the time of congress to repeat it in this place  george washington   july      william livingston to brigadiergeneral william livingston  head quarters   july      sir your favor of the  th came safely to handâ€”the situation of new jersey is such and the apprehensions of the inhabitants so justly excited that i have concluded to discharge the militia from this place except those from morris county whose internal situation is such as to leave them nothing to fear from the enemy these i have posted in bergen in     order to prevent any communication and to give the enemy obstruction in case they should attempt to land in that quarter which with the assistance of the continental troops posted there i hope they will be able effectually to do the remainder of the militia i have dismissed as i have reason to believe the enemy is waiting for the european fleet and will not make a general attack untill it arrivesâ€”but we have not yet one man from connecticut you will observe i have dismissed the militia from hence but have not discharged them as i am of opinion a part of them may be usefully employed in the immediate defence of the province in this view they fall properly under your command and i would suggest to you the propriety of stationing them in proper places along the shore opposite to staten island so as to relieve the inhabitants from the apprehensions they are under of being plundered as well as preventing any communication with the enemy there are a number of people in amboy who will undoubtedly open a correspondence with them immediately and endeavor to excite disaffection thro the province now they feel themselves under some kind of protection if it is practicable in the present situation of things i am of opinion those officers of government and the notoriously disaffected there should be removed with all expedition to less dangerous places that the cattle and sheep and horses on the shores contiguous to staten island should be immediately drove back the ferries carefully attended to and all boats watched that pass     or attempt so to do the number of men necessary for these services you will be able to ascertain better than i can but in such emergency it is better to exceed than fall short as to provision for the men i presume while the militia are employed in the immediate defence of the province the expence at least in the first instance will fall upon the colony how far the continent will reimburse the province i cannot determine but the necessity of some supplies being collected is so evident that i make no doubt the convention will immediately go into it in the mean time i should think no person could run any risque in doing what is immediately necessary under your appointment i have been the more induced to dismiss the militia that the new levies or   months men may be forwarded as soon as possible and i must request your exertions for this purpose as it is my intention to have them here without a moments delay since this letter was begun another of your favors came to my hands informing me that the enemy have thrown up two small breast works on the cause way from the point you also request some experienced officers to be sent over which i would gladly comply with if in my power but i have few of that character and those are so necessarily engaged here that for the present i must refer you to general mercer whose judgment and experience may be depended on i have wrote him that i should endeavor to send over an engineer as soon as possible from all accounts     we receive i cannot think they have any serious intentions at present beyond making themselves masters of staten island guarding against any attack from us and collecting what stock they can but at the same time it is highly prudent for you to be in the best posture of defence you can i am c george washington   july   oclock pm      new york william livingston to brigadiergeneral william livingston headquarters new york   july   oclock pm      sir your favor of this date enclosing major duyckincks letter was this moment received the known disaffection of the people of amboy and the treachery of those of staten island who after the fairest professions have shown themselves our most inveterate enemies induced me to give directions that all persons of known enmity or doubtful character should be removed from places where they might enter into a correspondence with the enemy and aid them in their schemes in this end general heard had directions to apprehend such persons as from their conduct have shown themselves inimical or whose situations connexions or offices gave just cause of suspicion i have no knowledge of the persons apprehended but suppose general heard had good reason for taking hold of them however if there are any whom from your personal knowledge and opinion you think may be permitted to return i have no objection and sending the others to provincial congress for their disposal but as to the former i would suggest to     you that my tenderness has been often abused and i have had reason to repent the indulgence shown to them i would show them all possible humanity and kindness consistent with our own safety but matters are now too far advanced to sacrifice any thing to punctilios i have given direction to forward you a supply of ammunition but must beg you to inculcate the utmost frugality  care of it as we have no superfluity this supply of cartridges some loose powder  leadâ€”if you have any occasion for ammunition for field pieces which the latter will not supply i will endeavor to assist you but i would wish you to make no more drafts than are absolutely necessary general mercer has just set off for jersey in his experience and judgment you may repose great confidence he will proceed to amboy after conferring with you you will please to keep me constantly informed of the proceedings of the enemy and be assured of every assistance and attention i am c      george washington   july      new york governor trumbull to governor trumbull new york   july      sir i have been honored with your favors of the  d and  th instant and return you my sincere thanks for your kind intention to afford me every assistance in your power at this truly critical and alarming periodâ€”the situation of our affairs calls aloud for the most vigorous exertions and nothing else will be sufficient to avert the impending blow from four prisoners taken the other day we are informed that genl howe has already about ten thousand men being joined by the regiment from the west indies and some of the highland troops in his passage hither that he is in daily expectation of the arrival of admiral howe and that nothing would be attempted till he came having come from halifax in consequence of advices received a few days before from england that the admiral was ready to sail with a fleet of one hundred and fifty ships with a large reinforcement to join him here these armies when united you will readily conceive will be extreamly formidable and such as will require a large and numerous one on our part to oppose themâ€”but yet i have been under the necessity of informing col silliman that it will be impossible to subsist the horse of the three regiments orderedâ€”and if it could be done the expence would be enormous and     what i do not apprehend i have authority to assent to at the same time knowing the important advantages that may result from their aid i have entreated his exertions to prevail on the men to come themselvesâ€”i hope on the one hand they will see the propriety of my objecting to their horses and on the other the necessity there is of coming themselves      my anxiety leads me to request a continuance of your good offices in forwarding the battalions ordered with all possible dispatch the interest of america is now in the ballance and it behoves all attached to her sacred cause and the rights of humanity to hold forth their utmost and most speedy aid i am convinced nothing will be wanting in your power to effect the situation of the northern army is certainly distressing but no relief can be afforded by meâ€”this i am persuaded you will readily agree to i should suppose if proper precautions are taken the small pox may be prevented from spreadingâ€”this was done at cambridge and i trust will be contrived by generals schuyler and gates who are well apprized of fatal consequences that may attend its infecting the whole army â€”but a small part of the forces here have had it and were it not the caseâ€”neither policy or prudence would allow me to send any more from hence that have seen the least of serviceâ€”too many have been already detached to part with more would be to put all to the hazardâ€” the retreat of the army from canada i doubt not will occasion a general alarm to the frontier inhabitants and our enemies without question will     use every means they can suggest to excite the savages against them but i would feign hope their incursions will be prevented and repelled without much difficulty the first opportunity i have i will transmit a copy of your letter to congress upon this subject and request their attention to it i am sir  george washington july the        new york lund washington forged letter to mr lund washington new york july the        dear lund we are still going on with all imaginable briskness and success with our works which i think are already impregnable it would really astonish you to see the progress we have made i do not believe that all history can furnish a precedent of so much being done in so little a time or in so masterly a manner where you had so little right to look for consummate skill if in every thing else we could but come up to our exertions in these fortifications i should hardly know how to doubt the judgment of those who think that we may bid defiance to the world but i know not how it is i am diffident of every thing whilst almost every body else seem to have persuaded themselves that we have nothing to fear i alone torment myself with thinking that every thing is against us even from these very works which have inspired us with such confidence i anticipate only misfortune and disgrace by this time the die is cast and america is authoritatively declared free and independent and unless we can be contented to appear ridiculous in the eyes of all the   0 world we must resolve to support this declaration by a suitable conduct we must fight our way to freedom and independencey for in no other way shall we be permitted to obtain it farther than words a war therefore and a most serious one is now inevitable next to good finances which it is not my promise to provide for a good army is doubtless a main requisite to the carrying on a successful war and a good army is by no means secured as some seem to reckon by securing a large number of men we want soldiers and between these and raw undisciplined men there is a wide difference the question then is how are these raw and undisciplined men to be formed into good soldiers and i am free to give it as my opinion that so far from contributing to this will strong holds fortified posts and deep intrenchments be found that they will have a direct contrary effect to be a soldier is to be inured to and familiar with danger to dare to look your enemy in the face unsheltered and exposed to their fire and even when repulsed to rally again with undiminished spirit the indian maxim is that it is equally your duty to take care of yourself and to annoy your enemy to a general this may not be an unusual caution but i will venture to assert that whenever a private sentinel allows himself to act on this principle the odds are that in the moment of trial in his exceeding solicitude not to forget the former the latter will be but little attended to now what i ask are all these mighty ditches and breastworks but so many lessons and admonitions to our men of what prodigious importance it is to take care of themselves it would be almost worth our while to be defeated if it were only to train us to stand fire and to bear a reverse of fortune with a decent magnanimity if it had not been for this illjudged humor of fighting from behind a screen the   th of april and   th of june last year might have been the happiest days america ever saw all these things have i again and again represented to my masters i am ashamed to say to how little purpose they return me answers and instructions which though i cannot refute have not yet convinced what i would call the feelings of my own mind this day week the enemys fleet was first descried off sandy hook they have been employed since then in debarking their troops on staten island where they are cantoned as far as i can judge in a very uncompact and unguarded manner i cannot exactly ascertain their number but i have reason to believe that they fall short of seven thousand it is more extraordinary still that i am not able to inform you of the exact number of forces under my     own command i fancy however we might bring into the field at this place double their number at a minutes warning and with this superiority of numbers making all possible allowances for our other disadvantages one would hope we might be able to give a good account of them you who are sanguine in the extreme and all impatience will eagerly ask why we suffered them to land unmolested and to remain so ever since what excellent expeditions your fireside generals can instantly plan and execute but you forget that they are posted on an island and that we have no way of coming at them unless they would lend us their ships and boats which i have not presumed to ask of them aware however of the importance of falling on them whilst there is a chance of doing it with success and eer they become a match for us by reinforcements which they daily expect i have formed a scheme which at least is plausible and promises fair to be successful i have submitted it to congress and every moment expect their answer and if they will but support me with alacrity and in good earnest my next i trust will not be so desponding i expect to be all ready to put my plan in execution on tuesday or at farthest on wednesday night so that probably at the very moment you are reading this we may be engaged in a very different service you will no doubt be impatient to hear from me as soon as may be after wednesday and i will not disappoint you meanwhile i shall not need to tell you that end how it will all that i freely chatter to you is to remain a profound secret to every body else doctor now brigadiergeneral mercer is here and is a great comfort to me like myself he wants experience but he is very shrewd and sensible and though a scotsman is remarkable humane and liberal i have communicated the whole of my design to him alone and am not ashamed to own that i have received much assistance from him i know not how it may turn out but though neither he nor i are very apt to be sanguine we have both confessed to be so on this occasion animated however as i feel myself with the near prospect of at length doing something not unworthy the high rank to which i am raised i own to you i take a serious pleasure in it only as it flatters me with the hope of thereby obtaining a speedier and happier peace let us since war must be our lot distinguish ourselves as freemen should in fields of blood still remembering however that we fight not for conquest but for liberty i am with the truest esteem dear lund your faithful friend and servant g w     george washington   july      new york majorgeneral ward to majorgeneral ward new york   july      sir the enclosed declaration will show you that congress at length impelled by necessity have dissolved the connexion between the american colonies and great britain and declared them free and independent states and in compliance with their order i am to request you will cause this declaration to be immediately proclaimed at the head of the continental regiments in the massachusetts bay it being evident from a variety of concurring circumstances that the british armies mean to direct their most vigorous operations this campaign against the state of new york to penetrate into it by way of the lakes and the north river and to unite their attacks the importance of it has induced congress to take further measures for baffling their designs and rendering it more secure you will see by the resolves now transmitted that the northern army is to be augmented by part of the troops under your command and i do desire that you will immediately detach for that purpose three of the fullest regiments forthwith to march to ticonderoga or such other place as the said army may be at and put themselves under the order and directions of the general officer commanding the same you will also perceive that congress have resolved that the arms taken in the scotch transports should be sent here the president informs me he has wrote to the agents respecting em but as i presume they are in your possession or in some of the stores     by your order you will have the whole of them forwarded with all possible despatch in the usual route and with necessary directions congress have made some alteration in the establishment of chaplains and advanced their pay as they have that of the regimental surgeons as you will see by their proceedings copies of which in their instances are also transmitted  you will be particularly attentive to hastening the march of the three regiments and give proper orders for their route and to the commissary and quartermasters that every thing necessary for the same may be immediately provided their aid is much wanted and may be of the utmost importance when they have marched you will be pleased to put the remaining regiments under the command of the oldest colonel with such instructions as you may judge necessary and then retire if it shall be agreeable to you for the recovery of your health as i cannot possibly request you longer to continue and wishing you a speedy restoration of it i am sir c      p s i would have you consult with proper persons and some of the members of the general court respecting the route of the three regiments to be detached to the northern army and if they shall be of opinion that they may probably arrive from thence for albany i should think that would be more preferable for two reasonsâ€”first it will ease the troops of much fatigue and   they might if there was a necessity for it afford succor how they passed i do not mean to give any direction in the matter nor do i wish this mode to be adopted unless there appears a probability of their arriving where they are intended to be sent by congress as early as if they pursued their march by land and across the country  george washington  0 july      new york to the president of congress new york  0 july      sir i am now to acknowledge the receipt of your two favors of the  th and  th instant which came duly to hand with their important enclosures     i perceive that congress have been employed in deliberating on measures of the most interesting nature it is certain that it is not with us to determine in many instances what consequences will flow from our counsels but yet it behoves us to adopt such as under the smiles of a gracious and allkind providence will be most likely to promote our happiness i trust the late decisive part they have taken is calculated for that end and will secure us that freedom and those privileges which have been and are refused us contrary to the voice of nature and the british constitution agreeably to the request of congress i caused the declaration to be proclaimed before all the army under my immediate command and have the pleasure to inform them that the measure seemed to have their most hearty assent the expressions and behavior both of officers and men testifying their warmest approbation of it i have transmitted a copy to general ward at boston requesting him to have it proclaimed to the continental troops in that department      it is with great pleasure that i hear the militia from maryland the delaware government and pennsylvania will be in motion every day to form the flying camp it is of great importance and should be accomplished with all possible despatch the readiness and alacrity with which the committee of safety of pennsylvania and the other conferees have acted in order to forward the associated militia of     that state to the jerseys for service till the men to compose the flying camp arrive strongly evidence their regard to the common cause and that nothing on their part will be wanting to support it i hope and i doubt not that the associated militia impressed with the expediency of the measure will immediately carry it into execution and furnish in this instance a proof of the continuance of that zeal which has so eminently marked their conduct i have directed the commissary to make necessary provision for their reception who will also supply the army for the flying camp with rations a proper officer will be appointed to command it  in pursuance of the power given me by congress and the advice of my general officers i have wrote to general ward and desired him forthwith to detach three of the fullest regiments from the massachusetts bay to join the northern army esteeming it a matter of the greatest importance to have a sufficient force there to prevent the enemy passing the lake and making an impression in that quarter the gondolas and gallies will be of great service and i am hopefull the carpenters you have sent from philadelphia and that will go from the eastward on     your application will be able to build a sufficient number in time to answer every exigency  i have requested governor cooke if the duck mentioned in mr greens letter is proper for tents to have it made up as early as possible and forwarded here i have also desired him to send the flints and small arms as i have genl ward those of the latter that were taken out of the scotch transports our deficiency in these necessary articles being still great observing that congress have particularly mentioned a bounty of ten dollars to be paid to men of some corps directed to be raised in two or three instances since their resolve of the    of june allows such bounty i have been led to doubt how that resolve is to be construed whether it is a general regulation and extends to all men that will engage for three years for instance the soldiers of the present army if they will inlist for that time  if it is and extends to them it will be necessary to forward a large sum of money many perhaps would engage i also observe by the resolve of the   th june for raising four regiments of militia in the eastern governments to augment the troops in the northern department that the assemblies of those governments are empowered to appoint paymasters to the said regiments this appears to me a regulation of great use and i could wish that it was made general and one allowed to     every regiment in the service many advantages would result from it the connecticut militia begin to come in but from every account the battalions will be very incomplete owing they say to the busy season of the year that government lest any inconvenience might result from their militia not being here in time ordered three regiments of their lighthorse to my assistance part of which have arrived but not having the means to support them and if it could be done the expense would be enormous i have thanked the gentlemen for their zeal and the attachment they have manifested upon this occasion and informed them that i cannot consent to their keeping their horses at the same time wishing them to stay themselves i am told that they or part of them mean to do so genl mercer is now in the jerseys for the purpose of receiving and ordering the militia coming for the flying camp and i have sent over our chief engineer to view the ground within the neighborhood of amboy and to lay out some necessary works for the encampment and such as may be proper at the different passes in bergen neck and other place on the jersey shore opposite staten island to prevent the enemy making impressions and committing depredations on the property of the inhabitants the intelligence we have from a few deserters that have come over to us and from others is that genl howe has between nine and ten thousand men who are chiefly landed on the island posted in different   0 parts and securing the several communications from the jerseys with small works and intrenchments to prevent our people from paying em a visit that the islanders have all joined them seem well disposed to favor their cause and have agreed to take up arms in their behalf they look for admiral howes arrival every day with his fleet and a large reinforcement are in high spirits and talk confidently of success and carrying all before em when he comes i trust thro divine favor and our own exertions they will be disappointed in their views and at all events any advantages they may gain will cost them very dear if our troops will behave well which i hope will be the case having every thing to contend for that freemen hold dear they will have to wade thro much blood and slaughter before they can carry any part of our works if they carry em at all and at best be in possession of a melancholy and mournfull victory may the sacredness of our cause inspire our soldiery with sentiments of heroism and lead em to the performance of the noblest exploits with this wish i have c  george washington    july      new york to the general court of massachusetts bay headquarters new york    july      gentlemen at a crisis like the present when our enemies are prosecuting a war with unexampled severity when they have called upon foreign mercenaries and have excited slaves and savages to arms against us a regard     to our own security and happiness calls upon us to adopt every possible expedient to avert the blow and prevent the meditated ruin impressed with this sentiment and impelled by necessity the congress have been pleased to empower me as you will perceive by the enclosed copy of their resolve which i have the honor of transmitting you to call to our aid so many of the st johns nova scotia and penobscot indians as i might judge necessary at the same time they have desired that i should request the assistance of your honorable body in carrying their views into execution and to assure you that whatever expenses you may necessarily incur in doing it and as incident to it they will reimburse esteeming their service of such importance particularly if the enemy should attempt an impression into the interior parts of the country i must entreat your kind offices upon this occasion and your friendly exertions immediately to engage on the best terms you can five or six hundred men of these tribes and have them marched with all possible expedition to join the army here having professed a strong inclination to take part with us in the present contest it is probable they may be engaged for less pay and on better terms than the continental troops but if they cannot they must be allowed it the term of their enlistment should be for two or three years unless sooner discharged the right of which should be reserved us if they will engage for so long a time if not for such time as they will agree and provided it is not too     short and it must be part of the treaty and enjoined upon them to bring every man his firelock if it can be possibly effected as the services they may render will probably depend on their early and timely arrival it is unnecessary to suggest to you the necessity of the utmost despatch in the matter i well know the execution of the work will be attended with some trouble and inconvenience but a consideration of the benefits that may arise from employing them and your zeal for the common cause i am persuaded will surmount every obstacle and apologize for my requisition especially as it comes recommended and supported by authority of congress since i had the honor of addressing you on ye  th inst i have recd a resolve from congress for calling ye other small contl regts from the massachusetts bay to join the army here a copy of which i have enclosed  by the advice of my genl officers have wrote genl ward to detach them immediately the accounts that we have all agreeing that lord howe is every day expected with   0 transports with   000 men at least in addition to those already here  i have the honor to be c     george washington    july      new york majorgeneral schuyler to majorgeneral schuyler new york    july      dear sir i received your favors of the  st and  d instant and agreeable to your request transmitted congress a copy of the former and of its several enclosures the important subjects referred to em have met with their attention and the letter accompanying this will inform you and general gates of the result of their deliberations i hope that harmony and a good agreement will subsist between you as the most likely means to advance the interest of the cause you both wish to promote they have determined the matter between mr trumbull and mr livingston and decided the right of supplying the northern army and appointing persons for that purpose to be in the former      i gave orders immediately on receipt of your favor for the several articles you wrote for to be sent you if they could be hadâ€”ball or buck shot could not be spared from hence and i directed a quantity of lead to be sent you out of which you must attempt to have them made i have not heard any thing of the money mentioned by mr duaneâ€”i imagine it has not been sent if any accident had befallen it the matter would have been known ere nowâ€” since my last general howes fleet from halifax has arrived in number about one hundred and thirty sail his army is between nine and ten thousand being joined by some of the regiments from the west indies and having fallen in with part of the highland troops in his passage he has landed his men on staten island which they mean to secure and is in daily expectation of the arrival of lord howe with one hundred and fifty ships with a large and powerful reinforcement this we have from four prisoners which fell into our hands and some deserters that an advice packett arrived at halifax before they left it informing that he was ready to sail when they came from england to join general howe here in consequence of which he came with the present armament they add that nothing will be attempted till his arrival their intelligence i have no doubt is well founded indeed the enemys having done nothing yet affords proof beyond question that they are waiting for more troops we are strengthening ourselves as much as possible and     deem their staying out so long a fortunate circumstance as it not only gives us an opportunity of advancing our works but of getting some relief from the neighbouring provinces from every appearance they mean to make a most vigorous push to subdue us this campaign and for this purpose to possess themselves of this colony if possible as a step leading to it our utmost exertions must be used and i trust through the favor of divine providence they will be disappointed in their views as having a large number of gundolas  gallies on the lakes will be of great importance mr hancock informs me in his letter of the  th instant that fifty carpenters were gone from philadelphia in order to build them  that he had wrote to govr cooke to engage  forward the same compliment i am advised by govr trumbull in a letter just received that he has procured two companies of twenty five each who were about to set out when they arrive they will be able i am in hopes to turn several of the stocks in a little timeâ€” it being evident that an attempt will be made by general burgoyne to penetrate and make an impression into the colonies by way of the lakes unless there is a sufficient force to oppose him i have exercised a discretionary power with which i was honored by congress and ordered three of the fullest continental regiments that were stationed in the massachusetts government to march immediately on receiving my orders to join the northern army i have directed them to come to norwich and there     embark for albany hoping they will arrive as expeditiously in this way and with much less fatigue than if they had pursued their route by land altogether at this hot uncomfortable season these with such militia as may be furnished from the several colonies required to provide them and the troops that were under general sullivan in canada i flatter myself will be able and more than equal to repel any invasion that may be attempted from that quarter it will be some time before their aid can be had having never had the authority of congress to order em until within this week you will perceive by the enclosed declaration that congress of late have been deliberating on matters of the utmost importance impelled by necessity and a repetition of injuries no longer sufferable without the most distant prospect of relief they have asserted the claims of the colonies to the rights of humanity absolved them from all allegiance to the british crown and declared them free and independent states in obedience to their order the same must be proclaimed throughout the northern army i am dear sir c a prisoner taken yesterday belonging to the  0 regiment informs that admiral howe is hourly expectedâ€”he adds that a vessel has arrived from his fleetâ€”      george washington    july      new york to the president of congress new york    july      sir i was honored with your favor of the  th instant by yesterday mornings post with the several resolves to which you referred my attentionâ€”i shall duly regard them and attempt their execution as far as i am able by virtue of the discretionary power that congress were pleased to vest me with and by advice of such of my general officers as i have had an opportunity of consulting i have ordered the two remaining continental regiments in the massachusetts bay to march immediately for the defence of this place in full confidence that nothing hostile will be attempted against that state in the present campaign i have wrote to the general court of massachusetts bay and transmitted a copy of the resolve for employing the eastern indians entreating their good offices in this instance and their exertions to have them forthwith engaged and marched to join this army i have desired five or six hundred of them to be inlisted for two or three years if they will consent to it subject to an earlier discharge if it shall be thought necessary and upon the same     terms of the continental troops if better cannot be had tho i am hopefull they may in my letter of yesterday i mentioned the arrival of part of the connecticut lighthorse to assist in the defence of this place and my objection to their horses being kept four or five hundred of them are now come in and in justice to their zeal and laudable attachment to the cause of their country i am to inform you they have consented to stay as long as occasion may require though they should be at the expense of maintaining their horses themselves they have pastured them out about the neighborhood of kingsbridge being unwilling to send them away at the rate of half a dollar per week each meaning to leave it entirely with congress either to allow or refuse it as they shall judge proper i promised to make this representation and thought it my duty and will only observe the motives which induced them at first to set out were good and praiseworthy and were to afford the most speedy and early succor which they apprehended would be wanted before the militia arrived their services may be extremely important being most of them if not all men of reputation and of property the subject of the enclosed copy of a letter from governor trumbull i beg leave to submit to the consideration of congress they will perceive from his representation the disquieting apprehensions that have seized on the minds of the people since the retreat of the northern army and how exposed the northern frontiers of new york and new hampshire are     to the ravages and incursions of the indians how far it may be expedient to raise the battalion he conceives necessary to prevent the calamities and distresses he points out they will determine upon what he has said and the necessity that may appear to them for the measure  what i have done being only meant to lay the matter before them in compliance with his wishes i have also inclosed a memorial from the surgeons mates setting forth the inadequacy of their paymentsâ€”their services and maintenance and praying that it may be encreased i shall observe that they have a long time since complained in this instance and that some additional allowance may not be unnecessary as i am truly sensible the time of congress is much taken up with a variety of important matters it is with unwillingness and pain i ever repeat a request after having once made it or take the liberty of enforcing any opinion of mine after it is once given but as the establishing of some office for auditing accounts is a matter of exceeding importance to the public interest i would beg leave once more to call   0 the attention of congress to an appointment competent to the purposes two motives induce me to urge the matter first a conviction of the utility of the measure secondly that i may stand exculpated if hereafter it should appear that money has been improperly expended and necessaries for the army obtained upon unreasonable terms for me whose time is employed from the hour of my rising till i retire to bed again to go into an examination of the accounts of such an army as this with any degree of precision and exactness without neglecting other matters of equal importance is utterly impracticable all that i have been able to do and that in fact was doing nothing was when the commissary and quartermaster and directorgeneral of the hospital for it is to these the great advances are made applied for warrants to make them at times produce a general account of their expenditures but this answers no valuable purpose it is the minutiÃ¦ that must be gone into the propriety of each charge examined the vouchers looked into and with respect to the commissarygeneral his victualling returns and expenditures of provisions should be compared with his purchases otherwise a person in this department if he was inclined to be knavish might purchase large quantities with the public money and sell one half of it again for private emolument and yet his accounts upon paper would appear fair and be supported with vouchers for every charge i do not urge this matter from a suspicion of any unfair practices in either of the departments before     mentioned and sorry should i be if this construction was put upon it having a high opinion of the honor and integrity of these gentlemen but there should nevertheless be some control as well upon their discretion as honesty to which may be added that accounts become perplexed and confused by long standing and the errors therein not so discoverable as if they underwent an early revision and examination i am well apprized that a treasury office of accounts has been resolved upon and an auditorgeneral for settling all public accounts but with all deference and submission to the opinion of congress these institutions are not calculated to prevent the inconveniences i have mentioned nor can they be competent to the purposes circumstanced as they are  we have intelligence from a deserter that came to us that on wednesday morning the asia chatham and greyhound menofwar weighed anchor and it was said intended to pass up the north river above the city to prevent the communication with the jerseys they did not attempt it nor does he know what prevented them  a prisoner belonging to the      0th regimt taken yesterday informs that they hourly expect admiral howe and his fleet he adds that a vessel has arrived from them and the prevailing opinion is that an attack will be made immediately on their arrival by a letter from genl ward i am informed that the smallpox has broke out at boston and infected some of the troopsâ€”i have wrote him to place the invalids under an officer to remain till they are well and to use every possible precaution to prevent the troops coming from thence bringing the infection the distresses and calamities we have already suffered by this disorder in one part of our army i hope will excite his utmost care that they may not be increased i have c  george washington    july      half past   p m new york to the president of congress new york    july      half past   p m sir the design of this is to inform congress that about half after three oclock this evening two of the enemys ships of war one of forty and the other of twenty guns with three tenders weighed anchor in the bay opposite to staten island and availing themselves of a brisk and favorable breeze with a flowing tide ran past our batteries up the north river without receiving any certain damage that i could perceive notwithstanding a heavy and incessant cannonade was kept up from our several batteries     here as well as from that at paulus hook they on their part returned and continued the fire as they ran by i despatched an express to brigadiergeneral mifflin at our encampment towards the upper end of the island but i have not heard whether they have got by or received any damage  the account transmitted by this mornings post respecting the arrival of one of the fleet seems to be confirmed several ships have come in today among them one this evening with a st georges flag at her foretopmast head which we conclude to be admiral howe from the circumstance of the flag and the several and     general salutes that were paid it is probable they will all arrive in a day or two and immediately begin their operations as it will be extremely necessary that the flying camp should be well provided with powder and ball and it may be impracticable to send supplies from hence on account of our hurry and engagements besides the communication may be uncertain i must beg the attention of congress to this matter and request that they will forward with all possible expedition such a quantity of musket powder and lead if balls of different sizes cannot be had as will be sufficient for the militia to compose that camp by an express this minute arrived from genl mifflin the ships have passed his works i am c  george washington    july      to the secret committee of the convention of the state of new york  headquarters    july      gentlemen a multiplicity of engagements and a continual pressure of other concerns has prevented our proceeding in the case of the soldiers confined for seditious     and treasonable practices but as soon as time will admit a proper attention will be paid to it in the mean time i beg leave to suggest the propriety of the authority of the province taking some steps with regard to those persons confined by them for the same offences they certainly are to be deemed the principals and justice to the inferior agents while the others pass unnoticed i observe only excites compassion and censure i am very sensible it is a case full of difficulty and perplexity and well deserving your most serious deliberation nor do i entertain a doubt but the result will be such as will conduce to the public good i have some time ago mentioned to the body of which you are a committee the necessity of falling upon some measures to remove from the city and its environs persons of known disaffection and enmity to the cause of america the safety of the army the success of every enterprise and the security of all depend so much on adopting the most speedy and effectual steps for the purpose that i beg leave again to repeat it and do most earnestly entreat you to adopt some plan for this purpose or give me your assistance so to do as to remove those disquieting and discouraging apprehensions which pervade the whole army on this subject a suspicion that there are many ministerial agents among us would justly alarm soldiers of more experience and discipline than ours and i foresee very dangerous     consequences in many respects if a remedy to the evil is not soon and efficaciously applied the removal of the tory prisoners confined in the gaol of this city is a matter to which i would solicit your attention in every view it appears dangerous and improper in case of an attack and alarm there can be no doubt what part they would take and none can tell what influence they might have you will gentlemen do me the justice to believe that nothing but the importance and necessity of the case could induce me thus to urge these matters in which you have also an immediate and common interest  the gentlemen appointed to give passes to persons leaving the city i am informed decline acting great inconvenience will ensue to the citizens if this business should be committed to the officers of the army who from their ignorance of the inhabitants as well as other reasons are wholly improper for the management of it i should be glad if your committee will take this matter also into their consideration i am gentlemen with great respect and regard your most obedient humble servant      george washington    july      new york to the president of congress new york    july      sir my last of friday evening which i had the honor of addressing you advised that two of the enemies ships of war and three tenders had run above our batteries here and the works at the upper end of the island i am now to inform you that yesterday forenoon receiving intelligence from genl mifflin that they had past the taupan sea and were trying to proceed higher up by advice of r r livingston esqr and other gentn i despatched expresses to genl clinton of ulster and the committee for safety for dutchess county to take measures for securing the passes in the highlands lest they might have designs of seizing them and have a force concealed for the purpose i wrote the evening before to the     commanding officer of the two garrisons there to be vigilant and prepared against any attempts they or any disaffected persons might make against them and to forward expresses all the way to albany that provision and other vessels might be secured and prevented falling into their hands the information given genl mifflin was rather premature as to their having gone past the sea a letter from the committee of orange county which came to hand this morning says they were there yesterday and that a regiment of their militia was under arms to prevent their landing and making an incursion the messenger who brought it and to whom it refers for particulars adds that a party of them in two or three boats had approached the shore but were forced back by our people firing at them since the manÅ“uvre of friday there have been no other movements in the fleet general sullivan in a letter of the  d instant informs me of his arrival with the army at crown point where he is fortifying and throwing up works he adds that he has secured all the stores except three cannon left at chamblee which in part is made up by taking a fine twelvepounder out of the lake the army is sickly many with the smallpox and he is apprehensive the militia ordered to join them will not escape the infection an officer he had sent to reconnoitre had reported that he saw at st johns about a hundred and fifty tents twenty at st roys and fifteen at chamblee and works at the first were busily carrying on i have inclosed a general return of the army here     which will shew the whole of our strength all the detached posts are inclosed a letter from the eastward by last nights post to mr hazard post master in this city advises that two ships had been taken  carried into cape ann one from antigua consigned to genl howe with     puncheons of rumâ€”the other a jamaica man with  00 hogsheads of sugar  00 puncheons of rum    bales of cotton pimento fustick c c each mounted   guns six pounders about three oclock this afternoon i was informed that a flag from lord howe was coming up and waited with two of our whaleboats until directions should be given i immediately convened such of the general officers as were not upon other duty who agreed in opinion that i ought not to receive any letter directed to me as a private gentleman but if otherwise and the officer desired to come up to deliver the letter himself as was suggested he should come under a safeconduct upon this i directed colonel reed to go down and manage the affair under the above general instruction on his return he informed me after the common civilities the officer acquainted him that he had a letter from lord howe to mr washington which he showed under a superscription to george washington esq colonel reed replied there was no such person in the army and that a letter intended for the general could not be received under such a direction the officer expressed great concern said it was a letter rather of a civil than military nature that lord   0 howe regretted he had not arrived sooner that he lord howe had great powers the anxiety to have the letter received was very evident though the officer disclaimed all knowledge of its contents however colonel reeds instructions being positive they parted after they had got some distance the officer with the flag again put about and asked under what direction mr washington chose to be addressed  to which colonel reed answered his station was well known and that certainly they could be at no loss how to direct to him the officer said they knew it and lamented it and again repeated his wish that the letter could be received colonel reed told him a proper direction would obviate all difficulties and that this was no new matter the subject having been fully discussed in the course of the last year of which lord howe could not be ignorant upon which they parted i would not upon any occasion sacrifice essentials to punctilio but in this instance the opinion of others concurring with my own i deemed it a duty to my country and my appointment to insist upon that respect which in any other than a public view i would willingly have waived nor do i doubt but from the supposed nature of the message and the anxiety expressed they will either repeat their flag or fall upon some mode to communicate the import and consequence of it      i have been duly honored with your two letters that of the  0th by mr anderson and the   th with its inclosures i have directed the quarter master to provide him with every thing he wants to carry his scheme into execution it is an important one and i wish it success but i am doubtfull that it will be better in theory than practice  the passage of the ships of war and tenders up the river is a matter of great importance and has excited much conjecture and speculation to me two things have occurred as leading them to this proceeding first a design to seize on the narrow passes on both sides of the river giving almost the only land communication with albany and of consequence with our northern army for which purpose they might have troops concealed on board which they deemed competent of themselves as the defiles are narrow or that they would be joined by many disaffected persons in that quarter others have added a probability of their having a large quantity of arms on board to be in readiness to put into the hands of the tories immediately on the arrival of the fleet or rather at the     time they intend to make their attack the second is to cut off entirely all intercourse between this place and albany by water and the upper country and to prevent supplies of every kind from going and coming these matters are truly alarming and of such importance that i have wrote to the provincial congress of new york and recommended to their serious consideration the adoption of every possible expedient to guard against the two first and have suggested the propriety of their employing the militia or some part of them in the counties in which these defiles are to keep the enemy from possessing them till further provision can be made and to write to the several leading persons on our side in that quarter to be attentive to all the movements of the ships and the disaffected in order to discover and frustrate whatever pernicious schemes they have in view  in respect to the second conjecture of my own and which seems to be generally adopted i have the pleasure to inform congress that if their design is to keep the armies from provision the commissary has told me upon inquiry that he has forwarded supplies to albany now there and above it sufficient     for ten thousand men for four months that he has a sufficiency here for twenty thousand men for three months and an abundant quantity secured in different parts of the jerseys for the flying camp besides having about four thousand barrels of flour in some neighboring part of connecticut upon this head there is but little occasion for any apprehensions at least for a considerable time i have the honor to be c p s i have sent orders to the commandg officer of the pennsylvania militia to march to amboy as their remaing at trenton can be of no service  george washington   th july      new york governor cooke to governor cooke head quarters new york   th july      dear sir since my last two of the enemies ships one of forty the other twenty guns taking advantage of a strong wind and tide passd us notwithstanding a warm fire from all our batteries they now lie in taapen sea between twenty and thirty miles up hudsons river where no batteries from shore can molest them their views no doubt are to cut off all communication between this and albany by water which they effectually will doâ€”if the gundaloes row gallies c from providence and connecticut were here i should think of making their station uncomfortable if possible i must request they may be sent on as soon as conveniently may be i have wrote governor     trumbull requesting the same of him tis not unreasonable to suppose these ships have a number of small arms on board which are intended to put into the hands of the disaffected on the north river and in the back parts of this province when a favorable opportunity may offer for their making use of them against us i am sorry to say their numbers by the best information i can get are great we have one large row galley compleate and another which will be ready by the time those arrive from providence and connecticut the whole when collected will be sufficient to attack the two ships up the riverâ€”if no material alteration between this time and their arrival the channel they now lie in is so narrow they cannot work their guns to advantageâ€”lord howe arrived on fryday lastâ€”his fleet cannot be far of i have the honor c george washington    july      new york lund washington forged letter to lund washington new york    july      dear lund last friday the british fleet was seen off statenisland they have since been employed uninterrupted by us in debarking their men stores c and as they must now i should imagine be pretty nearly as strong as they expect to be this campaign no doubt we shall soon hear of their motions i have reason to believe their first essay will not be on this but on longisland where injudiciously i think we also are or soon shall be in force yet if we do but act our parts as becomes us be the issue as it may we shall at least give them no pleasing earnest of what they have to expect in the course of the war but there is no relying on any plan that is to be executed by raw men you have heard much of the powers with which commissioners were to be invested for the purpose of settling this dispute like most other things belonging     to it these too have made a much greater figure in talk than they do in fact there are but two commissioners the two howes and their powers are extremely vague and undefined it is a pity methinks that congress had not had better information on this subject if they had it is to be presumed they would not have precipitated the declaration of independency so as to preclude all possibility of negotiation i may venture to whisper in your ear that this excepted i firmly believe that america might have carried every other point and certainly there was a time when this would have been deemed a conquest beyond the warmest wishes of the warmest american whether in the present posture of affairs it still be so is another question i can answer only for myself that i would not even ask so much different men will judge differently with respect to this conduct on the part of great britain i own i am bewildered and puzzled to account for it after such an astonishing expence as they have been at and with such fair prospects as they have before them of being soon in a capacity to prescribe their own terms it certainly is extraordinary to find them condescending to be friends with us on conditions as mortifying and degrading to them as they are flattering to us i can account for it but in one way i really ascribe it to their magnanimity it must be an unpleasant contest to the nation i say the nation for however expedient it may be for us to have it called a ministerial war no man who knows anything of the english government can imagine that the ministry could have moved a step in it if it had not been the sense of the nation it must too be a most fruitless and unprofitable war since every advantage they can gain must in fact be a loss as being gained over themselves no wonder therefore they have been slow and backward to enter into it no wonder they would be glad to be well rid of it on almost any terms i have ever been of this opinion and it was this persuasion alone that reconciled me to the measure of taking up arms i see however the world around me viewing it in a different light every concession that is made to us they attribute to timidity only and despondency i own appearances make for this conjecture and no doubt congress will give it its sanction i have not adopted this opinion that we might have peace with great britain on terms which would once have been thought most honorable on slight grounds yesterday a letter was brought to me making overtures for a negotiation from lord howe i had expected it and had my instructions it was addressed to me as i had foreseen as in a private character only on the ground of independency if we chose to maintain it this was not a mere matter     of punctilio it was the critical moment of trial whether we would assert or recede from our pretentions never did men sit in debate on a question of higher magnitude and when they had once determined to declare their country free i see not why they might not support this their declaration by this as well as other means a contrary conduct would certainly have indicated some want of firmness yet i confess to you i felt aukward upon the occasion the punctilio seemed and it could not but seem to be my own and as suchit looked methought as though i were proud of my titles put yourself in my place and see me longing as you know i do most earnestly for peace yet turning my back on a gentleman whom i had reason to consider as the harbinger of it only because he asked for mr and not general washington how often it is my lot to find it my indispensible duty to act a part contrary to both my own sentiments and inclinations but if i mistake not it is in such instances only that properly speaking we manifest our fortitude and magnanimity i shall astonish you when i inform you that this first rebuff abated not the ardor of the noble commissioner his deputy paid us a second visit and vouchsafed to honor me with the appellation of general what name will you give to this condescention i own it hurt me and has well nigh led me into a train of thinking very different from all my former opinions the gentleman who brought the message is a colonel patterson adjutantgeneral and a sensible well informed man he requested to speak to me alone and i was glad he did after the first salutations he told me the purport of the letter which had been refused and his errand now was to ask me to point out the most eligible means of opening a negociation for the purpose of accommodating the unhappy dispute i replied that i knew of but one way and that was by application to congress he said the kings commissioners would have no objection to treating with the members who composed the congress provided only that they came with legal authority from the regular legislatures of their respective countries i answered they doubtless would come with such authority as indeed they could come with no other i evidently saw his drift in the exception as he did mine and so put a stop to all possibility of mistake he declared it impossible for his masters ever to acknowledge the congress as such a legal and constitutional body of men and as it seemed to be rather a punctilio of pride than of any real importance he hoped it might be waved i stared how sir have you not already acknowledged the powers of congress by acknowledging the honorable rank i hold and which i     hold from them and them only that said he was the concession merely of politeness and made for the purpose only of getting access to me and he was persuaded i was too sensible a man to lay any stress on so mere a trifle i thanked him for his compliment but assured him that i meant to lay the most serious stress on it if he really had that opinion of my understanding which he was pleased then to express he must have supposed that though a trifle in itself it ceased to be so after i had made a point of it words could not have told him more strongly that our resolutions were to assert and maintain our independency and if the commissioners of the king of great britain found themselves either unable or unwilling to give up this as a preliminary article they and he must pardon me for saying that i could but think them very idly employed in soliciting an interview with me on this he prepared to take his leave first adding with a degree of sharpness and animation that i own affected me sir said he you are pleased to be cavalier with me i consider you as a wellmeaningâ€”i wish i could say wellinformed man yet i am mistaken if your head as well as your heart would not at this moment dictate a very different language there may be heroism for ought i know in desperately resolving to go all lengths with the men with whom you have connected yourself but it is madness and you may be thankful if posterity gives no worse name to a man who has no judgment of his own wrong sir your judgment no longer we certainly stooped as low as the proudest wronghead among you could ask us but if you really think as you seem to effect to do that we have made these overtures either from meanness from a distrust of our cause or our ability to make good our just claims you are out in all your reckoning that the mean and narrow minded leaders of your councils may disseminate such opinions in your unhappy country i can easily suppose but remember sir you and your party owe some account to the world and when the world shall come to know your infatuated insolence in this instance before us as know it they must think how you will excuse yourselves i replied with no less warmth nor i trust dignity i was indeed stung for after once having owned me as a general you must confess there was something singularly contemptuous in presuming thus to school me a few personal civilities put an end to the conference i have transmitted a faithful account of it to congress but as i can hardly suppose they will judge it expedient to make it public i thought i owed to you not wholly to disappoint your curiosity you will not therefore need me to caution you to be secret as well on this as on other things which i write to you     one thing more i must not omit to mention to you in my conference with colonel patterson i thought i could discover that it was intended i should be impressed with a persuasion that the commissioners thought not unfavorably of our pretensions as urged in the beginning of the dispute this is to be accounted for they are whigs and if i am rightly informed the general owes his seat in parliament to the interests of the dissenters but why approve of our first pretensions only surely if we were then right we are not now wrong i mean as to what we have a right to by the principles of the constitution the expediency of our measures is now out of question i cannot dissociate the ideas between our having a right of resistance in the case of taxation and the same right in the case of legislating for us you know i am no deep casuist in political speculations but having happily been brought up in revolution principles i thought i trod surely when i traced the footsteps of those venerable men wonderful these too are the principles of our opponents so that all our misfortune and fault is the having put in practice the very tenets which they profess to embrace but i shall exhaust your patience which i should not do foreseeing as i do that i shall hereafter have occasion to put it to the trial i am with the truest regard dear lund yours c g w george washington    july      new york to the president of congress new york    july      sir this will be handed to you by mr griffin  who has also taken upon him the charge and delivery of two packets containing sundry letters which were sent to amboy yesterday by a flag and forwarded to me today by general mercer the letter addressed to governor franklin came open to my hands      i was this morning honored with yours of the   th instant with its important and necessary enclosures and in obedience to the commands of congress i have transmitted to general howe the resolves intended for him those for general burgoyne i enclosed and sent to general schuyler with directions immediately to forward to him the inhuman treatment of the whole and murder of part of our people after their surrender and capitulation was certainly a flagrant violation of that faith which ought to be held sacred by all civilized nations and founded in the most savage barbarity it highly deserved the severest reprobation and i trust the spirited measures congress have adopted upon the occasion will prevent the like in future but if they should not and the claims of humanity are disregarded justice and policy will require recourse to be had to the law of retaliation however abhorrent and disagreeable to our natures in cases of torture and capital punishments i have c    0 george washington    july      new york to the president of congress new york    july      sir i was this morning honored with yours of the   th instt with sundry resolves i perceive the measures congress have taken to expedite the raising of the flying camp and providing it with articles of the greatest use you will see by a post script to my letter of the   th i had wrote to the commanding officer of the pensylvania militia ordering them to be marched from trenton to amboy as their remaining there could not answer the least public good for having consulted with sundry gentn i was informed if the enemy mean to direct their views towards pensylvania or penetrate the jerseys their route will be from near amboy and either by way of     brunswic or bound brook the lower road from south amboy being thro a woody sandy country besides they will then be able to throw in succor here  to receive it from hence in cases of emergency the connecticut lighthorse mentioned in my letter of the   th notwithstanding their then promise to continue here for the defence of this place are now discharged and about to return home having peremptorily refused all kind of fatigue duty or even to mount guard claiming an exemption as troopers though their assistance is much needed and might be of essential service in case of an attack yet i judged it advisable on their application and claim of such indulgences to discharge them as granting them would set an example to others and might produce many ill consequences the number of men included in the last return by this is lessend about  00 i last night received a letter from genl schuyler with several inclosures copies of which i have herewith transmitted they will give congress every information i have respecting our northern army and the situation of our affairs in that quarter to which i beg leave to refer their attention i cannot but express surprize at the scarcity of provisions which genl schuyler mentions after what the commissary assured me  which formed a part of my letter of the   th he still assures of the same this is a distressing circumstance as every article of provision and every thing necessary for that department can have no other now than a land conveyance the water     communication from hence to albany being entirely cut off congress will please to consider the inclosure no   about raising six companies out of the inhabitants about the lakes to prevent the incursions of the indians the genl officers in their minutes of council have determined it a matter of much importance and their attention to the price of goods furnished the soldiery may be extremely necessary they have complained much upon this head the retreat from crown point seems to be considered in opposite views by the general and field officers the former i am satisfied have weighed the matter well and yet the reasons assigned by the latter against it appear strong and forcible i hope whatever is done will be for the best i was apprehensive the appointment of general gates over general sullivan would give the latter disgust his letter which i transmitted to congress seemed to warrant the suspicion he is not arrived yet when he does i shall try to settle the affair with him and prevail on him to continue as i think his resignation will take from the service a useful and good officer      by a letter from the committee of orange county received this morning the menofwar  tenders were yesterday at haverstraw bay about forty miles above this a number of men in four barges from the tenders attempted to land with a view they suppose of taking some sheep  cattle that had been previously removed a small number of militia that was collected obliged em to retreat without their doing any damage with their cannon they were sounding the water up towards the highlands by which it is probable they will attempt to pass with part of the fleet if possible yesterday evening a flag came from general howe with a letter addressed to george washington esq c c c it was not received on the same principle that the one from lord howe was refused  i have the honor to be c      george washington   th july      new york lund washington forged letter to lund washington new york   th july      dear lund how cruelly are all my hopes in one sad moment blasted and destroyed i am positively ordered to wait for the enemy in our lines and lest i should be mad enough not to obey their mandates not a single tittle of any thing i had     asked for is granted thus has a second opportunity of rendering my country an essential service in the way of my profession been unwisely and in the most mortifying manner denied me i profess i hardly know how to bear it having to regret not only that two opportunities such as may never again occur have been suffered to pass by us unimproved but that none can happen we can improve managed as matters are we neither are nor ever shall be a military people and yet in the train in which things are now put unless we are it were idiotism to hope for either freedom or independence i remember well in a conversation i once had with a friend now most unjustly as unwisely driven from his friends and his home on the subject of monarchies and republics he objected to the unavoidable slowness and dilatoriness of the executive power in the latter aiming to answer him in his own way i replied that if popular councils were slow they yet were sure and that in the multitude of counsellors there is safety his answer was prophetical if ever he said we of these countries should rashly put these things to the proof it would be found that however true this adage might be in the cabinet it was not so in the field convinced by melancholy experience that this is the case and that without some different system we shall but expose ourselves to contempt and ruin i resolve this evening honestly  openly to say so to the congress i will go farther and add that if they cannot in fact as well as in appearance trust me with the uncontrouled command of their army i will no longer be their puppet why should i it being now morally certain that by going on as we have hitherto done i can neither bring honor nor profit to them and yet am sure to lose all the little of either which i have or might have possessed i want words to express to you what i have felt and still do feel on this disappointment of all my hopes i had allowed myself to build too much on my scheme and i seem to be in the situation of one who should be allowed to rise on purpose only to be thrown down the enemy in the midst of all our blusterings must despise us and did not shame or some better principle restrain them i should be but little surprized to find general howe even with his present little handful attacking us yes attacking us in our entrenchmentsâ€”what shall i do to retreat is to entail on myself the curses of every public man in my country and to go on is certain ruin and disgrace were the world to know only my true history on this trying occasion i persuade myself all the candid and considerate in it would acquit me of blame but this the world can know only by my resolving to tell a tale which considering the rank     i now hold in it must involve my country in such internal broils and quarrels as must be fatal to the glorious cause in which we have embarked and this i trust i shall have the virtue never to do be my private wrongs and sufferings ever so great i have finished my letter to the congress to whom i have at length spoken in a more peremptory tone than i fancy they have been used to it was absolutely necessary and i should ill deserve their confidence if through any mistaken complaisance or diffidence i hesitated to point out to them the mischievous consequences of their interference i have also insisted on precise instructions in what manner i am to conduct myself towards the british commissioners if peradventure as is possible their overtures should be made through me their answer will have a great influence on all my future measures as i shall then know and surely it is time i should on what ground i stand the very decided and adventurous measure which congress itself has just taken is big with the most important consequences not only to the community at large but to every man in it the temper and judgment which they shall now manifest on their first avowed assumption of the reins of government will be indicative of what we may hereafter expect hoping for the best i yet will watch them most carefully tis all fearful expectation every man i see seems to be employed in preparing himself for the momentous rencontre which every man persuades himself must shortly come on there is an ostensible eagerness and impetuosity amongst us i could willingly have excused i should have been better pleased with that steady composure which distinguishes veterans one thing is in our favor the passions of our soldiery are seldom suffered to subside being constantly agitated by some strange rumor or other happen what will it can hardly be more extraordinary than some one or other is perpetually presaging and we have already performed such feats of valor whilst we have no enemies to engage but such as our own imaginations manufacture for us that i cannot but hope we shall do well merely because no one ever seems to entertain a suspicion that we shall not i can as yet give no guess where or when they will approach us i conclude however that they will hardly stir till they are joined by all the men they expect desponding as i am i wish they were arrived and that at this moment they were in a condition to attack us they may gain by procrastination but we are sure to lose i wrote to mrs washington lately and shall again in a week or two if i do not hear of her ere that in philadelphia it has surprized me that after     what i wrote she should hesitate i beg of you if she be still fearful to second my persuasions by every means in your power exposed as she must be to so many interviews with people in the army all of whom are in the way of the smallpox i have the most dreadful apprehensions on her account i know not well how the notion came into my head but it is certain i have for several days persuaded myself that she is already inoculated and that out of tenderness and delicacy she forbears to inform me of it till she can also inform me she is out of danger i note sundry particulars in your letter to which i am not solicitous to give you answers why when you have so often asked me in vain will you press me for congresssecrets whatever your or my private sentiments or wishes may be it is sufficient for us that we know the highest authority in our country has declared it free and independent all that is left for us to do is so far as we can to support this declaration without too curiously enquiring into either its wisdom or its justice i firmly believe that the advocates for this measure meant well and i pay them but an ordinary compliment in thinking that they were fitter to determine on a point of this sort than either you or i are at any rate the world must allow it to be a spirited measure and all i have to wish for is that we may support it with a suitable spirit i am my dear lund yours most affectionately g w george washington    july      new york majorgeneral schuyler to majorgeneral schuyler new york    july      dear sir yesterday evening i was favored with your of the   th instt with its several inclosures as to the propriety or impropriety of giving up crown point and vacating that post it is impossible for me to determine my ignorance of the country my unacquaintance with its situation and a variety of circumstances will not permit me to pronounce any certain opinion upon the subject or to declare whether it might or could not be maintained against     the enemy i doubt not that the measure was duly weighed by the general officers in council and seemed to them best calculated to secure the colonies and prevent the enemy from penetrating into them however i cannot but observeâ€”though i do not mean to encourage in the smallest degree or to give the least sanction to inferior officers to set up their opinions against the proceedings and councils of their superiors knowing the dangerous tendency of such a practiceâ€”that the reasons assigned by the officers in their remonstrance appear to me forcible and of great weight they coincide with my own ideas i have ever understood crown point to be an important post and from its situation of the utmost consequence to us especially if we mean to keep the superiority and mastery of the lake if it is abandoned by us it is natural to suppose the enemy will possess it if they do and my judgment does not mislead me any vessels or galleys we employ upon the lake will certainly be in their rear and it will not be in our power to bring them down to ticonderoga or the post opposite to it or from thence to have the least communication with them or the means of granting them succors or supplies of any kind perhaps it is intended to employ the galleys only on the communication between the two posts that of crown point and the one now to be established how far they would there answer our views i cannot tell as i said before i have not a sufficient knowledge of the several posts or the neighboring country to form an accurate judgment     upon the matter and of consequence do not design any thing i have said by way of direction trusting that whatever is best to advance the interest of the important struggle we are engaged in will be done  i am extremely sorry to have such unfavorable accounts of the condition of the army sickness of itself is sufficiently bad but when discord and disorder are added greater misfortunes cannot befall it except that of a defeat while they prevail there is but little hopes of things succeeding well i must entreat your attention to these matters and your exertions to introduce more discipline and to do away the unhappy pernicious distinctions and jealousies between the troops of different governments enjoin this upon the officers and let them inculcate and press home to the soldiery the necessity of order and harmony among them who are embarked in one common cause and mutually contending for all that freemen hold dear i am persuaded if the officers will but exert themselves that these animosities and disorders will in a great measure subside and nothing being more essential to the service than that it   0 should i am hopefull nothing on their part will be wanting to effect it  the scarcity of provision which you mention surprises me much i had hoped that an ample and competent supply for a considerable time was now in store nor can i but believe the most lavish  extravagant waste has been made of it not longer than three or four days ago  just after the two men of war  tenders passed by as mentioned in my last the situation of the northern army in respect to this article occurred to my mind  induced an inquiry after the commissary about it being certain the water communication with albany would be entirely cut off  was happy to find from him that the supplies he had forwarded with such a proportion of fresh meat as could be procured would be fully sufficient for  0000 men for four months this i informed congress of as a most fortunate event to be told now that there is none or next to none is so contrary to what i expected that i am filled with wonder and astonishment i have informed the commissary of it who is equally surprised  must request as our navigation is so circumstanced that you will direct those whose business it is to use every possible means to provide such supplies as may be necessary  that proper attention be paid to the expenditure or it will be impossible ever to subsist that army     as to intrenching tools i have from time to time forwarded all that can possibly be spared i have directed the quarter master to send such things contained in your list as can be had  may be transported by land the greatest part it would be difficult to procure  if they could be had it would be attended with immense trouble  expence to forward them i must therefore entreat your utmost diligence and inquiry to get them  not only them but every necessary you want wherever they may be had the water intercourse being now at an end but few supplies can be expected from hence  i make not the least doubt if active proper persons are employed in many instances you will be able to obtain such articles as you stand in need of i am under the necessity of doing so here and by much pains and industry have procured many necessaries as for the articles wanted for the gondolas i should suppose many of them may be purchased of the proprietors of crafts about albany  of persons who have vessels there by allowing them a good price the communication by water being now stopd they cannot employ them  i presume may be prevailed on to part with most of their tackle for a good consideration i transmitted congress a copy of your letter and of its several inclosures  recommended to their particular attention the resolution no   for raising six companies to guard the frontiers  the high price of goods furnished the soldiery  that some measures might be taken thereon there is a resolve of congress against officers     holding double commissions  of long standing none are allowed it except adjutants  quarter masters they generally are also first or second lieutenants in this army there is no instance of double offices but in the cases i mention the carpenters from philadelphia unfortunately had not time to get their tools c on board a craft here before the menofwar got up they set out by land next day and i suppose will be at albany in the course of this week as also two companies from connecticut i have enquired of mr hughes  find that the six anchors  cables were on board capn peter posts vessel belonging to esopus who upon the first appearance of the fleet coming above the narrows went off without taking the necessaries brought by captain douw mr hughes says captain douw who brought you the lead had orders to get them i have inclosed you a list of the naval articles the qr master expects to obtain  send from hence which will evince the necessity of your exertions to get the rest elsewhere many of the articles i should suppose may be made at albany  within the neighborhood of it i am in hopes in consequence of your application the different governments will take some steps for apprehending deserters it is a growing evil and i wish it may be remedied from the northern army they have been extremely numerous and they should most certainly be returned if they can be found how far the mode suggested by you may answer the event     will show but i am doubtful whether many will return of themselves i fancy a part of your letter was omitted to be sent when you come to speak of deserters what i have on the subject begins a new sheet and seems to suppose something preceding about them after requesting mr hughes to be spoke to about the anchors c the next page begins unanimously agreed that i should write c you will perceive by the enclosed resolve congress mean to raise the garrison for presque isle c in the counties of westmoreland  bedford in pennsylvania i am sir c july   th  0 oclock ante meridien p s i have this minute spoke to mr trumbull again about provisions  pressed his most vigorous exertions i believe he is determined to leave nothing undone on his part  has already sent off some persons upon the business of which i suppose he will inform you or mr livingston      george washington    july      new york to the committee of the city of new york  headquarters new york    july      gentlemen i enclose you a copy of a resolution of the convention of the state of new york dated the   th instant recommending it to all the general and subcommittees to apprehend and secure all those persons whose going at large at this critical time they may deem dangerous to the safety of the state as this city is hourly threatened with an attack from a powerful enemy and as there is too much reason to apprehend from their vicinity to this city and from the number of suspicious characters still in it that they may receive intelligence which may counteract all my operations for its defence i strongly recommend it to you to remove for some time all equivocal and suspicious characters this appears to me to be the spirit of the resolution of the provincial convention and the propriety of it is founded on the law of selfpreservation and confirmed by the practice of all nations in a state of war     i esteem it my duty to add my recommendation to that of the convention that if through an illtimed lenity my attempts to secure this province should be baffled the blame of it may not be imputed to my want of vigilance i have enclosed a list of persons represented as dangerous as i can only speak from information i must rely upon your taking proper steps with them unless from your better knowledge you determine them to be of different characters from that represented i am gentlemen c  george washington    july      new york to the president of congress new york    july      sir i have been duly honored with your favors of the   th    th with the several resolves they contained to the execution of which so far as shall be in my power i will pay proper attention     in my letter of the   th i transmitted you a copy of one from genl schuyler and of its several inclosures i confess the determination of the council of general officers on the  th to retreat from crown point surprized me much and the more i consider it the more striking does the impropriety appear the reasons assigned against it by the field officers in their remonstrance coincide greatly with my own ideas and those of the other general officers i have had an opportunity of consulting with and seem to be of considerable weightâ€”i may add conclusive i am not so fully acquainted with the geography of that country and the situation of the different posts as to pronounce a peremptory judgement upon the matter but if my ideas are right the possession of crown point is essential to give us the superiority and mastery upon the lake that the enemy will possess it as soon as abandoned by us there can be no doubt and if they do whatever gallies or force we keep on the lake will be unquestionably in their rear how they are to be supported there or what succor can be drawn from em there is beyond my comprehension perhaps it is only meant that they shall be employed on the communication between that and ticonderoga if this is the case i fear the views of congress will not be answered nor the salutary effects be derived from them that were intended i have mentioned my surprize to general schuyler and would by the advice of the generals here have directed that that post should be maintained had it not been for two causes     an apprehension that the works have been destroyed and that if the army should be ordered from ticonderoga or the post opposite to it where i presume they are to repossess it they would have neither one place or another secure and in a defensible state the other lest it might encrease the jealousy and diversity in opinions which seem already too prevalent in that army and establish a precedent for the inferior officers to set up their judgements when ever they would in opposition to those of their superiorsâ€”a matter of great delicacy and that might lead to fatal consequences if countenanced tho in the present instance i could wish their reasoning has prevailed if the army has not removed what i have said to general schuyler may perhaps bring on a reconsideration of the matter and it may not be too late to take measures for maintaining that post but of this i have no hope in consequence of the resolve of congress for three of the eastern regiments to reinforce the northern army i wrote general ward and by advice of my general officers directed them to march to norwich and there to embark for albany conceiving that two valuable purposes might result therefromâ€”first that they would sooner join the army by pursuing this route and be saved from distress and fatigue that must attend every long march thro the country at this hot uncomfortable season and secondly that they might give succor here in case the enemy should make an attack about the time of their passing but the enemy having now with     their ships of war and tenders cut off the water communication from hence to albany i have wrote this day and directed them to proceed by land across the country if congress disapprove the route or wish to give any orders about them you will please to certifye me thereof that i may take measures accordingly  enclosed i have the honor to transmit you copies of a letter and sundry resolutions which i received yesterday from the convention of this state  by them you will perceive they have been acting upon matters of great importance and are exerting themselves in the most vigorous manner to defeat the wicked designs of the enemy and such disaffected persons as may incline to assist and facilitate their views in compliance with their request and on account of the scarcity of money for carrying their salutary views into execution i have agreed to lend them out of the small stock now in hand not more than sixty thousand dollars twenty thousand dollars as a part of what they want which they promise speedily to replace had there been money sufficient     for paying the whole of our troops and not more i could not have done it but as it was otherwise and by no means proper to pay a part and not the whole i could not foresee any inconveniences that would attend the loan on the contrary that it might contribute in some degree to forward their schemes i hope my conduct in this instance will not be disapproved i enclosed governor trumbull a copy of their letter and of their several resolves by colonel broome and mr duer two members of the convention who are going to wait on him but did not think myself at liberty to urge or request his interest in forming the camp of six thousand men as the levies directed by congress to be furnished the  d of june for the defence of this place by that government are but little more than one third come in at the same time the proposition i think a good one if it could be carried into execution in case the enemy should attempt to effect a landing above kingsbridge and to cut off the communication between this city and the country an army to hang on their rear would distress them exceedingly i have the honor to be c  p s the enclosed paper should have been sent before but was omitted thro hurry p s after i had closed my letter i received one from genl ward a copy of which is herewith transmitted i have wrote him to forward the two regimts now at boston by the most direct road to   0 ticonderoga as soon as they are well with the utmost expedition  consider their having had the small pox as a fortunate circumstanceâ€”when the three arrive which have marched for norwich i shall immediately send one of em on if congress shall judge it expedient of which you will please to inform me  george washington    july      new york majorgeneral gates to majorgeneral gates ticonderoga new york    july      dear sir i expected ere this to have heard from you and i will open the correspondence by expressing my exceeding great concern on account of the determination of your board of general officers to retreat from crown point to ticonderoga assigning contrary to the opinion of all your fieldofficers for reason that the former place is not tenable with your present force or the force expected my concern arises from information and a firm belief that your relinquishing crown point is in its consequence a relinquishment of the lakes and all the advantages to be derived therefrom for it does not admit of a doubt that the enemy will if possible possess themselves of that pass which is a key to all these colonies the moment you leave it and thereby confine your vessels to the narrow part of the lake in front of that post or by having them     in the rear of it cut off all kind of supplies from and all intercourse between your camp and them securing by this means a free and uninterrupted passage into the three new england governments for invasion thereof nothing but a belief that you have actually removed the army from crown point to ticonderoga and demolished the works at the former and the fear of creating dissensions and encouraging a spirit of remonstrating against the conduct of superior officers by inferiors has prevented me by advice of general officers from directing the post at crown point to be held till congress should decide upon the propriety of its evacuation as the case stands i can give no order in the matter lest between two opinions neither of the places are put into such a posture of defence as to resist an advancing enemy i must however express my sorrow at the resolution of your council and wish that it had never happened as every body who speaks of it also does and that the measure could yet be changed with propriety we have the enemy full in view but their operations are to be suspended till the reinforcement hourly expected arrives when i suppose there will soon be pretty warm work lord howe is arrived he and the general his brother are appointed commissioners to dispense pardons to repenting sinners my compliments to the gentlemen with you of my acquaintance i am dear sir c      george washington    july      new york to the president of congress new york    july      sir your favors of the   th    th with which you have been pleased to honor me have been duly received with the several resolves alluded to     when the letter and declaration from lord howe to mr franklin and the other late governors come to be published i should suppose the warmest advocates for dependence on the british crown must be silent and be convinced beyond all possibility of doubt that all that has been said about the commissioners was illusory and calculated expressly to deceive     and put off their guard not only the good people of our own country but those of the english nation that were averse to the proceedings of the king and ministry hence we see the cause why a specification of their powers was not given to the mayor and city of london on their address requesting it that would have been dangerous because it would then have been manifest that the line of conduct they were to pursue would be totally variant from that they had industriously propagated and amused the public with the uniting the civil and military offices in the same persons too must be conclusive to every thinking one that there is to be but little negotiation of the civil kind i have enclosed for the satisfaction of congress the substance of what passed between myself and lieutenantcolonel patterson adjutantgeneral at an interview had yesterday in consequence of a request from general howe the day before to which i beg leave to refer them for particulars      colonel knox of the train having often mentioned to me the necessity of having a much more numerous body of artillerists than what there now is in case     the present contest should continue longer and knowing the deficiency in this instance and their extreme usefulness i desired him to commit his ideas upon     the subject to writing in order that i might transmit them to congress for their consideration agreeably to my request he has done it and the propriety of his plan is now submitted for their decision it is certain that we have no more at this time than are sufficient for the several extensive posts we now have including the drafts which he speaks of and which i presume not only from what he has informed me but from the nature of the thing can never be qualified to render the same service as if they were regularly appointed and formed into a corps for that particular purpose i beg leave to remind congress that some time ago i laid before them the proposals of some persons here for forming a company of lighthorse and of the presidents answer a little time after intimating that the plan seemed to be approved of as those who wanted to make up the troop are frequently pressing me for an answer i could wish to be favored with the decision of congress upon the subject by a letter from general schuyler of the   th instant dated at albany he informs me that the day before some desperate designs of the tories in that quarter had been discovered the particulars of which he could not divulge being under an oath of secrecy however that such measures had been taken as to promise a prevention of the intended mischief and that four of the conspirators among them a ringleader were apprehended about one oclock that morning not far from the town what the plot was or who were concerned in it is a matter i am ignorant     of as yet with my best regards to congress i have the honor to be your and their most obedient servant p s congress will please to observe what was proposed respecting the exchange of mr lovell and signify their pleasure in your next the last weeks return is also inclosed  george washington july         new york lund washington forged letter to lund washington new york july         i wish i could say i thoroughly approved of all the new regulations in the new institution of government in my native state it could however hardly have been expected that a reformation so capital and comprehensive should be perfect at first the wonder is it is not still more exceptionable my heart glows with unusual warmth when i advert as i often do to that pure and disinterested ardor which must have animated the bulk of my countrymen throughout the whole of this controversy there may be exceptions amongst us and no doubt there are but it is not fair to infer this from our uncommon impetuosity and violence this one would wish restrained but by no means extirpated for is it not the effect of a highly agitated spirit the mere effervescence of good principles thrown into a state of strong fermentation and surely even precipitency is preferable to the spiritbreaking cautions of chill despondency yet i am no advocate in general either for rash measures or rash men but at such a conjuncture as this men had need to be stimulated by some more active principle than cool and sober reason they must be enthusiasts or they will continue to be slaves     i give this in answer to my friend mr carters objections to the first procedures of the new government no doubt henry is in many respects the unfittest man in the state for governor of virginia he has no property no learning but little good sense and still less virtue or public spirit but he is the idol of the people and as it is by their means only that you can hope to effect the grand schemes which you have meditated you must humor them and indulge them with their rattle they will soon tire of him and the opportunity must then be watched gently to lead them to a better choice for they may be led though they cannot be driven and though it be alas but too true that they often mistake their real interests i am of opinion they never mistake them long sooner or later they will judge and act from their settled feelings and these i take it are generally founded in their settled interests when great enterprises are to be performed we may well dispense with some errors in judgment when without that we have in its stead that which perhaps we could not have with it i mean that undisciplined ardor which is infinitely better adapted to our purposes there cannot be a more striking instance that the judgment of the people may in general be safely trusted in the long run than is to be met with in virginia very few countries have to boast of more men of respectable understandings i know of none that can produce a family all of them distinguished as clever men like our lees they are all of them the very men one would wish for to take the lead of a willing multitude for they are certainly men of shining talents and their talents are of that particular kind which usually render men popular no men are more so than the men in question once were it is obvious this is no longer the case and the reason must be that they are no longer worthy of it with all their cleverness they are selfish in the extreme the people at length found this out or no doubt r h lee would have now been governor the grand object of all his aims you would be mortified to hear the criticisms which are common here on henrys inauguration speech it is indeed a poor and pitiful performance and yet i can believe that set off by his smooth and oily delivery it would appear clever when he spoke it why did he not ask mr page to prepare it for him there is not a man in america more capable the counsellors of state are certainly irreproachable and will do honor to those who appointed them i am particularly pleased with the success of my honest brotherinlaw bat dandridge and the pleasure is not lessened by the assurance he makes me that my letters were serviceable to him there being but   0 few men whom i love more than i do him as you are soon to go down the country you will see him and therefore spare me the trouble of writing particularly to him my friends must now be be so indulgent to me as to wave the matter of compliment i think myself happy whenever i can write as i should on urgent business you know how ticklish my situation is little as one would think there is to be envied in it i yet am envied and though in all good reason their fears should take a direct contrary course there are who are for ever suggesting suspicions and jealousies of the army and its commander my own heart assures me i mean them no ill however if i really have the influence and ascendency which they suppose i will for their sakes as well as my own hereafter maintain it at some little cost a thousand considerations determine me to strain every nerve to prevent the armys being under any other controul whilst i live let a persuasion of the necessity of this if occasion should arise be seasonably urged in my native state and in the mean while let some more than ordinary pains be taken to make me popular their own honor and interest are both concerned in my being so shew this to mr dandridge and as you both can enter into my meaning even from the most distant hints i can rest satisfied that you will do every thing i wish you we have lately had a general review and i have much pleasure in informing you that we made a better appearance and went through our exercises more like soldiers than i had expected the southern states are rash and blamable in the judgment they generally form of their brethren of the four new england states i do assure you with all my partiality for my own countrymen and prejudices against them i cannot but consider them as the flower of the american army they are a strong vigorous and hardy people inured to labor and toil which our people seldom are and though our hot and eager spirits may perhaps suit better in a sudden and desperate enterprise yet in the way in which wars are now carried on you must look for permanent advantages only from that patient and persevering temper which is the result of a life of labor the new englanders are cool considerate and sensible whilst we are all fire and fury like their climate they maintain an equal temperature where as we cannot shine but we burn they have a uniformity and stability of character to which the people of no other states have any pretension hence they must and will always preserve their influence in this great empire were it not for the drawbacks and the disadvantages which the influence of their popular opinions on the subject of government     have over their army they soon might and probably would give law to it if general putnam had the talents of mr s adams or mr adams had his perhaps even at this moment this had not been matter of conjecture but putnam is a plain blunt undesigning old fellow whose views reach no further than the duties of his profession he is indeed very ignorant yet i find him a useful officer and chiefly because he neither plagues me nor others with wrangling claims of privileges i owe him too no small acknowledgments for the fairness of his accounts i could open to you some strange scenes in this way some people seem to have gotten such a habit of cheating government that though sufficiently conscientious in other respects they really are far less scrupulous in their manner of charging than i think becomes themâ€”but as i have often told you general mercer is the man on whom these states must rest their hopes the character that one of his countrymen gave to the pretender fits him exactly he is the most cautious man i ever saw not to be a coward and the bravest not to be rash in my judgment he is not inferior to general lee in military knowledge and in almost every thing else he is infinitely his superior yet the overbearing virtues of this last named gentleman are useful to us especially at our setting out we wanted not the sober and slow deductions of argument and reason and lee like the author of common sense has talents perfectly formed to dazzle and confound i thank you for your care in making the remittances you mention to messrs carey  co i sincerely wish they may arrive safe as i certainly owe it to them to take every step in my power to make them easy there is a pleasure in doing as one ought in little as well as great affairs but in my present circumstances i should often want this pleasure were it not for your affectionate assiduity and truly friendly attention god bless you my dear friend for every instance of your care and concern for me i am câ€” g w george washington    july      new york john augustine washington to john augustine washington new york    july      dear brother whether you wrote to me or i to you last i cannot undertake to say but as it is some time since a letter has passed between us and as i expect every     hour to be engaged in too busy a scene to allow time for writing private letters i will take an opportunity by this days post to address to you a few lines giving a brief acct of the situation of affairs in this quarter to begin then we have a powerful fleet within full view of us distant about eight miles we have general howes present army consisting by good report of abt eight or nine thousand men upon staten island covered by their ships we have lord howe just arrived that is about  0 days ago and we have ships now popping in which we suppose but do not know to be part of the fleet with the expected reinforcements when this arrives if the report of deserters prisoners and tories are to be depended upon the enemys numbers will amount at least to twentyfive thousand men ours to about fifteen thousand more indeed are expected but there is no certainty of their arrival as harvest and a thousand other excuses are urged for the reasons of delay what kind of opposition we shall be able to make time only can show i can only say that the men appear to be in good spirits and if they will stand by me the place shall not be carried without some loss notwithstanding we are not yet in such a posture of defence as i could wish two ships to wit the phÅ“nix of fortyfour guns and rose of twenty run by our batteries on the   th exhibiting a proof of what i had long most religiously believed and that is that a vessel with a brisk wind and strong tide cannot unless by a     chance shott be stopped by a battery without you could place some obstruction in the water to impede her motion within reach of your guns  we do not know that these ships received any capital injury in their rigging they were somewhat damaged and several shot went through their hulls but few if any lives were lost they now with three tenders which accompanied them lye up the north or hudsons river abt forty miles above this place and have totally cut off all communication by water between this city and albany and between this army and ours upon the lakes they may have had other motives inducing them to run up the river such as supplying the tories with arms etc etc but such a vigilant watch has hitherto been kept upon them that i fancy they have succeeded but indifferently in those respects notwithstanding this country abounds in disaffected persons of the most diabolical dispositions and intentions as you may have perceived by the several publications in the gazettes relative to their designs of destroying this army by treachery and bribery which was providentially discovered     it is the general report of deserters and prisoners and a prevailing opinion here that no attempt will be made by genl howe till his reinforcement arrives which as i said before is hourly expected our situation at present both in regard to men and other matters is such as not to make it advisable to attempt any thing against them surrounded as they are by water and covered with ships least a miscarriage should be productive of unhappy and fatal consequences it is provoking nevertheless to have them so near without being able in their weakness to give them any disturbance their ships that passed us are also safely moored in a broad part of the river out of reach of shott from either shore      george washington    july      new york john parke custis to john parke custis new york    july      dear sir i wrote to you two or three posts ago since which your letter of the tenth instant is come to hand with respect to the proposed exchange of lands with colonel thomas moore i have not a competent knowledge of either tract to give an opinion with any degree of precision but from the situation of moores land and its contiguity to a large part of your estate and where you will probably make your residence i should were i in your place be very fond of the exchange     especially as the land you hold in hanover is but a small tract and totally detached from the rest of your estate what local advantages it may have i know not these ought to be inquired into because a valuable mill seat often gives great value to a poor piece of land as i understand that of yours in hanover is i have no doubt myself but that middling land under a mans own eye is more profitable than rich land at a distance for which reason i should were i in your place be for drawing as many of my slaves to the lands in king william and king and queen as could work on them to advantage and i should also be for adding to those tracts if it could be done upon reasonable terms i am very sorry to hear by your account that general lewis stands so unfavorably with his officers i always had a good opinion of him and should have hoped that he had been possessed of too much good sence to maltreat his officers and thereby render himself obnoxious to them we have a powerful fleet in full view of usâ€”at the wateringplace of staten island general howe and his army are landed thereon and it is thought will make no attempt upon this city till his reenforcements which are hourly expected arrive  when this happens it is to be presumed that there will be some pretty warm work give my love to nelly and compliments to mr calvert and family and     to others who may inquire after dear sir your affectionate mrs washington is now at philadelphia  has thoughts of returning to virginia as there is little or no prospect of her being with me any part of this summer i beg of you to present my love to my sister and the children and compliments to any inquiring friends and to do me the justice to believe that i am c  george washington    july      new york to the president of congress new york    july      sir disagreeable as it is to me and unpleasing as it may be to congress to multiply officers i find myself under the unavoidable necessity of asking an increase of my aidsdecamp the augmentation of my command the increase of my correspondence the orders to give the instructions to draw cut out more business than i am able to execute in time with propriety the business of so many different departments centring with me and by me to be handed on to congress for their information added to the intercourse     i am obliged to keep up with the adjacent states and incidental occurrences all of which require confidential and not hack writers to execute renders it impossible in the present state of things for my family to discharge the several duties expected of me with that precision and despatch that i could wish what will it be then when we come into a more active scene and i am called upon from twenty different places perhaps at the same instant congress will do me the justice to believe i hope that it is not my inclination or wish to run the continent into any unnecessary expense and those who better know me will not suspect that show and parade can have any influence on my mind in this instance a conviction of the necessity of it for the regular discharge of the trust reposed in me is the governing motive for the application  and as such is submitted to congress by c c      george washington    july      new york george clinton to general george clinton head quarters new york    july      dear sir yours of the   d instant is duly received and am pleased with your timely notice of your situation strength movements c c and think time is not to be lost or expence regarded in getting yourselves in the best posture of defence not knowing how soon the enemy may attempt to pass you the fire rafts you mention are not of the best construction but probably are the best that can be procured with the dispatch necessaryâ€”cables and anchors i should suppose might easily be procured from the vessels which used to be plying up and down the riverâ€”and are now lying idleâ€”salt petre from the manufactures in the country as neither are to be had in this placeâ€”the necessity of the case will fully justify your taking the former wherever to be found and the safety of the people i should imagine would induce them to assist you to the latter all in their power i have sent up lieut machin  to lay out and oversee  00 such works as shall be thot necessary by the officers there and from your representation of the hill which overlooks the fort i think it ought to be taken possession of immediatelyâ€”you who are on the spot must be a better judge than i possibly can must leave it with you to erect such works as you with col clinton and the engineer may think necessaryâ€”a proper abstract or pay roll should be made out of the wages due the artificers examined and certified by you or your bro when it may be sent here and the money drawnâ€”your method of fixing fires with advanced guards if they are vigilant must answer the purpose you intendâ€”your dismissing all the new englandmen to  00 is a step i approve ofâ€”i hope you may continue to prevent the enemy from obtaining any supplies or intelligence and from committing any ravages on the distressd peasentry on and about the shoresâ€”while you are able to keep them in this situation below the forts they can do little damageâ€”by every conveyance i shall like to hear of your situation and the enemies manÅ“uvers i am sir wishing you successâ€” p s since the above the q m genl informs me you may be supplied with turpentine here and thinks can get salt petre enough for the present emergency   0  george washington    july      new york to the president of congress new york    july      sir i was yesterday morning honored with your favor of the   th instt with its several inclosures to which i shall pay the strictest attention the confidence congress are pleased to repose in my judgement demands my warmest acknowledgements and they may rest assured it shall be invariably employed so far as it shall be in my power to promote their views and the public weal i have inclosed a letter received from major french two days ago also one from him to his lady congress will perceive thereby what he says and thinks about his parole and will be pleased to transmit me by the earliest opportunity the result of their opinion and such orders as they may think necessary to be taken upon it the letter for mrs french they will please to return me it was only forwarded to shew his views more explicitly than what that for me does since my last nothing material has occurredâ€”yesterday evening report was made that eight ships were seen in the offing standing towards the hook the men of war  tenders still are up the river they have never attempted to pass the highland fortifications and a day or two ago quitted their station and fell down the river eight or ten milesâ€”the  0  the vigilance and activity of the militia opposite where they were have prevented their landing and doing much injury i would wish to know whether the allowance given to officers the   th of january of one and a third dollars for every man they inlist congress mean to extend to the officers who inlist for the new army for three yearsâ€”at first it may appear wrong or rather exorbitant supposing that many will be recruited out of the regiments now in service and under them but the allowance will be of great use as it will interest the officers and call forth their exertions which otherwise would be faint and languid  indeed i am fearfull from the inquiries i have made that their utmost exertions will not be attended with but little success it is objected that the bounty of ten dollars is too low and argued that if the states furnishing men for five or six months allow considerably more why should that be accepted and when the form of inlistment is to be for three years i heartily wish a bounty in land had been or could be given as was proposed some time agoe i think it would be attended with salutary consequences in consequence of my application to governor trumbull he has sent me two rowgalleys and i expect another from him none from governor cooke are yet come nor have i heard from him on the subject one is complete here the fireships  0  are going on under mr andersons direction but rather slowly and i am preparing some obstructions to the channel nearly opposite the works at the upper end of this island when all things are ready i intend to try if it shall seem practicable to destroy the ships and tenders above and to employ the galleys if they can be of advantage the militia for the flying camp come in but slowly by a return from general mercer yesterday they are but little more than three thousand if they were in or can be there shortly and the situation of the enemy remains the same i would make some effort to annoy them keeping our posts here well guarded and not putting too much to hazard or in any manner to risk i have the honor c   0  george washington    july      new york to the board of war new york    july      gentlemen at length i have been able to comply with the first part of a resolution of congress of the   th ulto relative to a return of the vacancies in the several regiments composing that part of the army under my immediate command i thought to have made this return much sooner but the dispersed situation of our troops the constant duty they are upon the difficulty of getting returns when this is the case especially when those returns are to undergo several corrections and the variety of important occurrences which have intervened of late to draw attention from this matter will i hope be admitted as an excuse and the delay not ascribed to any disinclination in me to comply with the order as i shall while i have the honor to remain in the service of the united states obey to the utmost of my power and to the best of my abilities all orders of congress with a scrupulous exactness with respect to the latter part of the aforementioned resolution of the   th of june i have to observe that i have handed in the names of such persons as the field officers of the several regiments  their brigadiers have pointed out as proper  0  persons to fill these vacancies i have neither added to or diminished ought from their choice unless the following special information which i conceived my indispensible duty to give should occasion any alterations for the  0th regiment then late arnolds there are two competitors to wit col durkee the present lieut colonel who has had charge of the regiment ever since the first establishment of it and lieut colonel tyler of parsons regiment the pretensions of both and a state of the case i have subjoined to the list of vacancies given in by general spencer as i have also done in the case of col learned to another list exhibited by general heath if learned returns to the regiment the vacancies stand right if he should not i presume the regiment will be given to the lieut colonel william shepperd who stands next to tyler in rank and not second to him in reputation this change would in its consequences occasion several moves there is a third matter in which i must be more particular as it is unnoticed else where and that is the lieut colonel of wyllys regiment rufus putnam acts here as a chief engineer by which means the regiment is totally deprived of his services and to remove him from that department the public would sustain a capital injury for altho he is not a man of scientific knowledge he is indefatigable in business and possesses more practicable knowledge in the art of engineering than any other we have in this camp or army i would humbly submit it therefore to  0  congress whether it might not be best to give him putnam the appointment of engineer with the pay of sixty dollars per month less than which i do not suppose he would accept as i have been obliged in order to encourage him to push the business forward in this our extreme hurry to give him reasons to believe that his lieutenant colonels pay would be made equal to this sum if this appointment should take place then it makes a vacancy in wyllyss regiment which i understand he is desirous of having filled by major henly an active and spirited officer now a brigade major to general heath i am sorry to take up so much of your time as the recital of particular cases and some others requires but there is no avoiding it unless congress will be pleased to appoint one or more persons in whom they can confide to visit this part of this army once a month inspect into it and fill up the vacancies as shall appear proper to them upon the spot this cannot be attended with any great trouble nor much expense as it is only in the part of the army under my immediate direction that such regulations would be necessary the officers commanding in other departments having this power i believe already given them   0  i have the honor to enclose a list of the officers of the regiments at this place and long ago directed the like return to be made from the northern and eastern troops which i hope is complied with i also make return of the artillery according to colonel knoxs report and of the ordnance stores c agreeably to the commissarys return i come now to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of the  0th instant with several inclosures relative to a proposal of mr goddard and beg leave to give it as my opinion that the introduction of that gentleman into the army as lieut colonel would be attended with endless confusion i have spoke to colo parsons who is a very worthy man upon this subject i have done moreâ€”i have shewn him the memorial in answer to which he says that in the conversation had between him and mr goddard the latter was told that unless lieut colonel tyler was provided for major prentice advanced to a lieut colonelcy in some other regiment and his eldest captain chapman not deprived of his expectation of the majority his coming in there would give uneasiness but nevertheless if it was the pleasure of congress to make the appointment he would  0  do every thing in his power to make it palatible if all these contingencies were to take place before mr goddard could get into a regiment he had been paving the way to what prospect can there be of his getting into any other without spreading jealousy as he goes with respect to the regiment of artificers i have only to observe that the forming them into one corps at the time i did when immediate action was expected was only intended as a temporary expedient to draw that useful body of near six hundred men into the field under one head and without confusion the appointment of officers therefore in this instance was merely nominal and unattended with expense the mode of promotion whether in a continental colonial or regimental line being a matter of some consideration and delicacy to determine i thought it expedient to know the sentiments of the general officers upon the consequences of each before i offered my own to your board and have the honor to inform you that it is their unanimous opinion as it is also mine from observations on the temper and local attachments of each corps to the members thereof that regimental promotions would be much the most pleasing but this it is thought had better appear in practice than come announced as a resolution and that there ought to be exceptions in favor of extraordinary merit on the one hand and demerit on the other the first to be rewarded out of the common course of promotion whilst the other might stand and sustain no injury it is a very difficult matter to  0  step out of the regimental line now without giving much inquietude to the corps in which it happens was it then to be declared as the resolution of congress that all promotions should go in this way without some strong qualifying clauses it would be almost impossible to do it without creating a mutiny this is the sense of my officers as also that the promotions by succession are not meant to extend to noncommissioned officers further than circumstances of good behavior may direct as the lists of vacancies are returned in consequence of an order of congress and would i doubt not be referred to your board i have sent no duplicates nor have i wrote to congress on the subject but that i may not appear inattentive to their commands i must request the favor of having this letter or the substance of it laid before them i have the honor c george washington  0 july      new york lieutenantgeneral howe to lieutenantgeneral howe headquarters new york  0 july      sir lieutenantcolonel patterson adjutantgeneral of the army under your command at the interview between us having proposed an exchange of mr lovell for governor skene i am authorized to inform you that the congress have not only approved of this proposition but judging that a general exchange of prisoners will be attended with mutual convenience and pleasure to both parties have empowered their commanders in each department to negotiate one in   0 the following mannerâ€”continental officers for those of equal rank either in the land or sea service soldier for soldier sailor for sailor and citizen for citizen they have also particularly mentioned the exchange of colonel ethan allen for any officer of the same or inferior rank you will be pleased to signify the time and place for that of mr lovell and governor skene that i may give direction for the latter to be ready who is now at hartford about one hundred and twenty miles from hence also to favor me with your sentiments as well on the proposition respecting colonel allen as on the subject of a general exchange i have the honor to be with due respect sir your most obedient servant  george washington    july      new york majorgeneral schuyler to majorgeneral schuyler new york    july      dear sir your favors of the   th   th  0th    th have been duly received  i am extremely happy to find that you have discovered and apprehended some of the ringleaders of a dangerous plot you say was forming in the neighborhood of albany nor do i hear with less pleasure of the harmony and good     agreement between you and general gates knowing how essential they are to the service agreeable to your request i communicated to mr trumbull that part of your letter respecting mr livingstons  your apprehensions of his resigning in case any person should be appointed to act independently of him in the business he usually managed upon this occasion i must observe that as mr trumbull has the supreme direction given him by congress of supplying the northern army  is the person that is accountable if it is not done in a proper manner his appointments should  must be regarded or things in this instance will never proceed in a regular channel and fatal consequences will otherwise ensue mr trumbull i believe has wrote mr livingston on the subject  i imagine has mentioned in what manner he would have him to act  also given necessary instructions to his deputies it gives me great satisfaction to hear that taking post at fort stanwix has not given umbrage to the indians and also that those that were at philadelphia and this place have returned with such favorable ideas of our strength and resources to their several nations from this circumstance i am hopeful that you will be able to engage them in our interest and with the assistance of the reward allowed by congress to excite their efforts to make prisoners of our enemies i would have you press the matter strongly in both instances and though you should not succeed i flatter myself that you will secure their neutrality that will be an important point to gain     i conceive it will not be only proper but absolutely necessary to request general howe to deliver the officers who regardless of their paroles have escaped from pennsylvania and all others that have acted in the same manner pointing out the impropriety of such conduct and the difficulty it lays us under as to the line of treatment to be observed to others in a conversation with the adjutantgeneral of the kings army i touched upon this subject and he assured me all complaints of this nature would be strictly attended to by general howe and those who gave rise to them be handled with severity lord howe too i am confidently informed has expressed his great disapprobation of such behavior and said that those who were guilty of it should be severely noticed if they came into his hands every thinking and sensible person must see the impropriety of it and the consequences that must attend it i should suppose the requisition will claim general burgoynes attention and be readily complied with the swivels you mention cannot be had but if the experiments of a person who has undertaken to cast some three pounders should succeed perhaps after some time you may be furnished in part with a quantity of these colo knox seems to think they will be far superior to swivels the man supposes after he begins he will be able to compleat twenty every week neither are there any hand granadoes we have a large number of  Â½ inch shells which might be a good substitute but i do not know how things of     this sort can be forwarded to you as the water communication with albany is entirely cut off the difficulty will be great if not almost insuperable i observe your reasons for quitting crown point and preferring ticonderoga my knowledge of the importance of the former was not properly my own it arose from the information i had from gentlemen and persons who were or said they were well acquainted with it and the situation of the country about it being founded on that i cannot say any thing myself on the subject your representation of it most certainly lessens its consequence in a capital degree however i am fearful the observation of the fieldofficers that the new england governments will be thereby exposed to the incursions of our cruel and savage enemies will be but too well verified if that post could not have been maintained this evil with others greater must have happened in respect to the privilege you have given the officers who held double commissions to retain which they choose i cannot object if the authority giving them was the same  such as was exercised usually  approved i see no cause for it  suppose the officers have that right as to lieut colo buells case i cannot give any direction about it not having authority to appoint officers generally it is not in my power to spare you any money from hence our chest is all but empty congress would be informed by your letters of your situation     doubtless i mentioned it in mine and have suggested as i often have the expediency nay the necessity of keeping regular supplies all the eastward accounts say that three or four captures have been made lately among them a provision vessel from ireland which of herself came into boston harbor in the southern department we have been still more lucky sir peter parker and his fleet got a severe drubbing in an attack made upon our works on sullivans island just by charleston in south carolina a part of their troops at the same time attempting to land were repulsed the papers i presume have reached you announcing this fortunate event where you will see the particulars as transmitted by general lee to congress i am sir your most obedient servant      george washington   august      new york to the president of congress new york   august      sir your favor of the  0th ulto with its several inclosures i was honored with by wednesdays post congress having been pleased to leave with me the direction of colonel wards regiment i have wrote to governor trumbull and requested him to order their march to this place being fully satisfied that the enemy mean to make their grand push in this quarter and that the good of the service requires every aid here that can be obtained i have also wrote colonel elmore and directed him to repair hither with his regiment when it comes i shall fill up commissions for such officers as appear with their respective companies colonel holman with a regiment from the massachusetts state is arrived colonel carey from thence is also here waiting the arrival of his regiment which he hourly expects he adds when he left new london he heard that the third regiment from the massachusetts was almost ready and would soon be in motion     the enemys force is daily augmenting and becoming stronger by new arrivals yesterday general greene reports that about forty sail including tenders came into the hook what they are or what those have brought that have lately got in i remain uninformed however i think it probable they are a part of admiral howes fleet with the hessian troops it is time to look for em  i have the honor to be c p s i am extremely sorry to inform congress our troops are very sickly      george washington   august      new york to the president of congress new york   august      sir i was honored with your favor of the   st ulto on friday with its several inclosures and return you my thanks for the agreeable intelligence you were pleased to communicate of the arrival of one of our ships with such valuable articles as arms and ammunition also of the capture made by a privateer the mode for the exchange of prisoners resolved on by congress is acceded to by general howe so far as it comes within his command  a copy of my letter and his answer upon the subject i have the     honor to enclose you to which i beg leave to refer congress the enclosed copy of a letter from colonel tupper who had the general command of the galleys here will inform congress of the engagement between them and the ships of war up the north river on saturday evening and of the damage we sustained what injury was done to the ships i cannot ascertain it is said they were hulled several times by our shot all accounts agree that our officers and men during the whole of the affair behaved with great spirit and bravery the damage done to the galleys shows beyond question that they had a warm time of it the ships still remain up the river and before any thing further can be attempted against them should it be thought advisable the galleys must be repaired i have also transmitted congress a copy of a letter i received by saturdays post from governor cooke to which i refer them for the intelligence it contains the seizure of our vessels by the portuguese is i fear an event too true their dependence upon the british crown for aid against the spaniards must force them to comply with every thing required of them i wish the morris may get safe in with her cargo as to the ships which captain buchlin saw on the   th ultimo they are probably arrived for yesterday twentyfive sail came into the hook by a letter from general ward of the    ulto he informs me that two of our armed vessels the day before had brought into marblehead a ship bound from hallifax to staten island she had in     about   0 Â£ cost of british goods besides a good many belonging to tories a hallifax paper found on board her i have inclosed as also an account sent me by mr hazard transmitted him by some of his friends as given by the tories taken in her their intelligence i dare say is true respecting the arrival of part of the hessian troops genl ward in his letter mentions the day this prize was taken capn burke in another of our armed vessels had an engagement with a ship and a schooner which he thought were transports and would have taken them had it not been for an unlucky accident in having his quarter deck blown up two of his men were killed and several more wounded the hulks and three chevauxdefrise that have been preparing to obstruct the channel have got up to the place they are intended for and will be sunk as soon as possible  i have transmitted congress a genl return   0 of the army in  about this place on the  d inst by which they will perceive the amount of our force before i conclude i would beg leave to remind congress of the necessity there is of having some majorgenerals appointed for this army the duties of which are great extensive and impossible to be discharged as they ought and the good of the service requires without a competent number of officers of this rank i mean to write more fully upon the subject and as things are drawing fast to an issue and it is necessary to make every proper disposition and arrangement that we possibly can i pray that this matter may be taken into consideration and claim their early attention i well know what has prevented appointments of this sort for some time past but the situation of our affairs will not justify longer delays in this instance by the first opportunity i shall take the liberty of giving you my sentiments more at large upon the propriety  necessity of the measure i have c      george washington   august      new york to the president of congress new york   august      sir in my letter of the  th which i had the honor of addressing you i begged leave to recall the attention of congress to the absolute necessity there is for appointing more general officers promising at the same time by the first opportunity to give my sentiments more at large upon the subject confident i am that the postponing this measure has not proceeded from motives of frugality otherwise i should take the liberty of attempting to prove that we put too much to the hazard by such a saving i am but too well apprized of the difficulties that occur in the choice they are i acknowledge great but at the same time it must be allowed that they are of such a nature as to present themselves whenever the subject is thought of time on the one hand does not remove them on the other delay may be productive of fatal consequences this army though     far short as yet of the numbers intended by congress is by much too unwieldy for the command of any one man without several majorgenerals to assist for it is to be observed that a brigadiergeneral at the head of his brigade is no more than a colonel at the head of a regiment except that he acts upon a larger scale officers of more general command are at all times wanted for the good order and government of an army especially when the army is composed chiefly of raw troops but in an action they are indispensably necessary at present there is but one majorgeneral for this whole department and the flying camp whereas at this place alone less than three cannot discharge the duties with that regularity they ought to be if these majorgenerals are appointed as undoubtedly they will out of the present brigadiers you will want for this place three brigadiers at least the northern department will require one if not two as general thompson is a prisoner and the baron woedtke reported to be dead or in a state not much better there being at present only one brigadiergeneral arnold in all that department for the eastern governments there ought to be one or a majorgeneral to superintend the regiments there and to prevent impositions that might otherwise be practised these make the number wanted to be six or seven and who are to be appointed congress can best judge to make brigadiers of the oldest colonels would be the least exceptionable way but it is much to be questioned whether by that mode the     ablest men would be appointed to office and i would observe though the rank of the colonels of the eastern governments was settled at cambridge last year it only respected themselves and is still open as to officers of other governments to pick a colonel here and a colonel there through the army according to the opinion entertained of their abilities would no doubt be the means of making a better choice and nominating the fittest persons but then the senior officers would get disgusted and more than probable with their connexions quit the service that might prove fatal at this time to appoint gentlemen as brigadiers that have not served in this army in this part of it at least would not wound any one in particular but hurt the whole equally and must be considered in a very discouraging light by every officer of merit view the matter therefore in any point of light you will there are inconveniences on the one hand and difficulties on the other which ought to be avoided would they be remedied by appointing the oldest colonels from each state if this mode should be thought expedient the enclosed list gives the names of the colonels from new hampshire to pennsylvania inclusive specifying those who rank first as i am told in the several colony lists  i have transmitted the copy of a letter from mr john glover setting forth the nature and grounds of a dispute between him and a mr john bradford respecting their agency not conceiving myself authorized nor having the smallest inclination to interfere     in any degree in the matter it is referred to congress who will determine and give direction upon it in such manner as they shall judge best i will only observe that mr glover was recommended to me as a proper person for an agent when we first fitted out armed vessels and was accordingly appointed one and so far as i know discharged his office with fidelity and industry i received yesterday evening a letter from genl schuyler containing lt mcmichels report who had been sent a scout to oswego a copy of the report i have inclosed for the information of congress lest genl schuyler should have omitted it in his letter which accompanies this he was at the german flatts when he wrote which was the  d instt and the treaty with the indians not begun nor had the whole expected there arrived but of these things he will have advised you more fully i make no doubt the paymaster informs me he received a supply of money yesterday it came very seasonably for the applications and clamors of the troops had become incessant and distressing beyond measure there is now two months pay due em i have the honor c      george washington   august      new york governor trumbull to governor trumbull headquarters new york   august      sir by two deserters this day we have the following intelligence namely that general clinton and lord cornwallis with the whole southern army have arrived and landed on staten island from south carolina in number about three or four thousand that the fleet which came in a few days since are the hessians and scotch highlanders part of twelve thousand who were left off newfoundland in the whole making about thirty thousand men and that it is said by the officers of the navy and army they are to attack new york and long island c in the course of a week the uncommon movements of the fleet this day together with the above intelligence convince us that in all human probability there can but a very few days pass before a general engagement takes place  when i consider the weakness of     our army by sickness the great extent of ground we have to defend and the amazing slowness with which the levies come forward i think it absolutely necessary that the neighboring militia should be immediately sent to our assistance and agreeably to your letter of the  th of july i have ordered the colonels with their regiments to march with all convenient speed to this place the disgrace of the british arms at the southward and the season being far advanced will make them exert every nerve against us in this quarter to trust altogether in the justice of our cause without our own utmost exertions would be tempting providence and that you may judge of our situation i give you the present state of our army  by this you will see we are to oppose an army of thirty thousand experienced veterans with about one third the number of raw troops and these scattered some fifteen miles apart this will be handed you by mr root to him i must refer you for further particulars and have the pleasure to be your honors most obedient servant      george washington   august      new york to the new york convention new york   august      gentlemen i have been favored with your letter of the  th instant and am happy to find the nomination i made of general clinton in consequence of your request to appoint an officer to the command of the levies on both sides hudsons river has met the approbation of your honorable body his acquaintance with the country abilities and zeal for the cause are the motives that induced me to make choice of him     however i am led to conclude from that part of your letter which desires me to transmit him his apment with the resolution subjecting the levies on both sides of the river to his command that your honorable body entertain ideas of the matter somewhat different from what i do or ever did when i was honored with your letter of the   th ulto with the resolves of the convention upon this subject the state of the army under my command would not allow me to send a general officer in the continental service to command the levies you then proposed to raise supposing i had been authorized to do it but considering myself without power in this instance and the levies altogether of a provincial nature to be raised by you and subject to your direction i esteemed the nomination of a general officer over them entrusted to my choice a matter of favor and compliment and as such i gratefully fill it i am persuaded that i expressed myself in this manner to the gentlemen who were pleased to attend me upon the occasion and that they had the same ideas under the influence of this opinion all i expected was that an appointment would be made in conformity to my nomination if there was no objection to the gentleman i proposed conceiving then as i do now that if he was approved by the convention he was their officer and derived his appointment and authority from them in this light i presume general clinton must be viewed and his powers over the levies you allude to flow from you least accident may have mislaid the letter i wrote you on the subject     i have enclosed an extract of it so far as it had relation to it it is not in my power to send an experienced officer at this time to the post you mention i trust that colonel clinton  will be equal to the command of both the highland fortifications they are under his direction at present in respect to the two commissaries i thought the matter had been fixedâ€”but as it is not i have requested mr trumbull who has the charge of this to wait upon and agree with the convention on proper persons to conduct the business and in such a way that their purchases and his may not clash to him therefore i beg leave to refer you upon this subject i am extremely obliged by the order for the telescope i have obtained it and will try to employ it for the valuable purposes you designed it i shall pay proper attention to your members and persons employed in their service and give it in general orders that they be permitted to pass our guards without interruption before i conclude i cannot but express my fears lest the enemys army so largely augmented should possess themselves of the whole stock on long island when the further reinforcement arrives which they hourly expect they may do it without a possibility on our part of preventing them i wish the convention may not see cause to regret that they were not removed   0 george washington   august      new york to the officers and soldiers of the pennsylvania association  headquarters new york   august      gentlemen i had fully resolved to have paid you a visit in new jersey if the movements of the enemy and some intelligence indicating an early attack had not induced me to suspend it allow me therefore to address you in this mode as fellow citizens and fellow soldiers engaged in the same glorious cause to represent to you that the fate of our country depends in all human probability on the exertion of a few weeks that it is of the utmost importance to keep up a respectable force for that time and there can be no doubt that success will crown our efforts if we firmly and resolutely determine to conquer or to die i have placed so much confidence in the spirit and zeal of the associated troops of pennsylvania that i cannot persuade myself an impatience to return home or a less honorable motive will defeat my wellgrounded expectation that they will do their country essential service at this critical time when the powers of despotism are all combined against it and ready to strike their most decisive stroke if i could allow myself to doubt your spirit and perseverance i should represent the ruinous consequences of your leaving the service by setting before     you the discouragement it would give the army the confusion and shame of our friends and the still more galling triumph of our enemies but as i have no such doubts i shall only thank you for the spirit and ardor you have shown in so readily marching to meet the enemy and i am most confident you will crown it by a glorious perseverance the honor and safety of our bleeding country and every other motive that can influence the brave and heroic patriot call loudly upon us to acquit ourselves with spirit in short we must now determine to be enslaved or free if we make freedom our choice we must obtain it by the blessing of heaven on our united and vigorous efforts i salute you gentlemen most affectionately and beg leave to remind you that liberty honor and safety are all at stake and i trust providence will smile upon our efforts and establish us once more the inhabitants of a free and happy country i am gentlemen your most humble servant george washington   august      new york to the president of congress new york   august      sir by yesterday mornings post i was honored with your favor of the  d instant with sundry resolutions of congress to which i shall pay strict attention as the proposition for employing the stockbridge indians has been approved i have wrote mr edwards one of the commissioners and who lives among     them requesting him to engage them or such as are willing to enter the service i have directed him to indulge them with liberty to join this or the northern army or both as their inclination may lead  i wish the salutary consequences may result from the regulation respecting seamen taken that congress have in view from the nature of this kind of people and the privileges granted on their entering into our service i should suppose many of them would do it we want them much i yesterday transmitted the intelligence i received from the deserters from the solebay manofwar the inclosed copy of a letter by lastnights post from the honble mr bowdoin with the information of a captain kennedy lately taken corroborating their accounts respecting the hessian troops indeed his report makes the fleet and armament to be employed against us greater than what we have heard they would be however there remains no doubt of their being both large and formidable and such as will require our most vigorous exertions to oppose them persuaded of this and knowing how much inferior our numbers are and will be to theirs when the whole of their troops arriveâ€”of the important     consequences that may and will flow from the appeal that will soon be made i have wrote to connecticut and new jersey for all the succor they can afford and also to the convention of this state what i may receive and in what time the event must determine but i would feign hope the situation the exigency of our affairs will call forth the most strenuous efforts and early assistance of those who are friends to the cause i confess there is too much occasion for their exertions i confidently trust they will not be withheld i have enclosed a copy of a letter from mr bowdoin respecting the eastern indians congress will thereby perceive that they profess themselves to be well attached to our interest and the summary of the measures taken to engage them in our service i have the treaty at large between the honorable council of the massachusetts on behalf of the united states with the delegates of the st johns and micmac tribes the probability of a copys being sent already and its great length prevent one coming herewith if congress have not had it forwarded em i will send a copy by the first opportunity after notice that it has not been received august  thâ€”by a report received from general greene last night at sunset and a little after about a hundred boats were seen bringing troops from staten island to the ships three of which had fallen down towards the narrows having taken in soldiers from thirty of the boats he adds that by the best observations of several officers there appeared to be     a general embarkation i have wrote to general mercer for two thousand men from the flying camp colonel smallwoods battalion as part of them i expect this forenoon but where the rest are to come from i know not as by the generals last return not more than three or four hundred of the new levies had got in in my letter of the  th i inclosed a genl return of the army under my immediate command but i immagine the following state will give congress a more perfect idea tho not a more agreeable one of our situation for the several posts on new york long and governors islands and paulus hook we have fit for duty  0    sick present  0  â€”sick absent    â€”on command      on furlow   â€”total       in addition to those we are only certain of colo smallwoods battallion in case of an immediate attackâ€”our posts too are much divided having waters between many of them and some distant from others fifteen miles these circumstances sufficiently distressing of themselves are much aggravated by the sickness that prevails thro the armyâ€”every day more or less are taken down so that the proportion of men that may come in cannot be considered as a real and serviceable augmentation in the whole these things are melancholy but they are never the less true i hope for better under every disadvantage my utmost exertions shall be employed to bring about the great end we have in view and so far as i can judge from the professions and apparent disposition of my troops i shall have their support     the superiority of the enemy and the expected attack do not seem to have depressed their spirits those considerations lead me to think that tho the appeal may not terminate so happily in our favor as i could wish yet they will not succeed in their views without considerable loss any advantage they may get i trust will cost them dear by the reverend mr madison and a mr johnson two gentlemen of virginia who came from staten island yesterday and where they arrived the day before in the packet with colonel guy johnson i am informed that nothing material had taken place in england when they left it that there had been a change in the french ministry which many people thought foreboded a war that it seemed to be believed by many that congress would attempt to buy off the foreign troops and that it might be effected without great difficulty their accounts from staten island nearly corresponded with what we had before they say that every preparation is making for an attack that the force now upon the island is about fifteen thousand that they appear very impatient for the arrival of the foreign troops but a very small part having got in whether they would attempt any thing before they come they are uncertain but they are sure they will as soon as they arrive if not before they say from what they could collect from the conversation of officers c they mean to hem us in by getting above us and cutting off all communication with the country that this is their plan seems to be corroborated and confirmed by the circumstances of     some ships of war going out at different times within a few days past and other vessels it is probable that a part are to go round and come up the sound mr madison says lord howes powers were not known when he left england that general conway moved before his departure that they might be laid before the commons and had his motion rejected by a large majority i have the honor to be c      george washington    august      new york to the president of congress new york    august      sir i have been duly honored with your favors of the  th and  0th instant with their several inclosures i shall pay attention to the resolution respecting lieutenant josiah and attempt to relieve him from his rigorous usage  your letters to such of the gentlemen as were here have been delivered the rest will be sent by the first opportunity since my last of the  th and  th the enemy have made no movements of consequence they remain nearly in the same state nor have we any further intelligence of     their designs they have not been yet joined by the remainder of the fleet with the hessian troops colonel smallwood and his battalion got in on friday and colonel miles is also here with two battalions more of pennsylvania riflemen the convention of this state have been exerting themselves to call forth a portion of their militia to an encampment forming above kingsbridge to remain in service for the space of one month after their arrival and also half of those in king and queens counties to reinforce the troops on long island till the  st of september unless sooner discharged general morris too is to take post with his brigade on the sound and hudsons river for ten days to annoy the enemy in case they attempt to land and others of their militia are directed to be in readiness in case their aid should be required  upon the whole from the information i have from the convention the militia ordered are now in motion     or will be so in a little time and will amount to about three thousand or more from connecticut i am not certain what succors are coming by one or two gentlemen who have come from thence i am told some of the militia were assembling and from the intelligence they had would march this week by a letter from governor trumbull of the  th i am advised that the troops from that state destined for the northern army had marched for skenesborough general ward too by a letter of the  th informs me that the two regiments would march from boston last week having been cleansed and generally recovered from the smallpox i have also countermanded my orders to colonel elmore and directed him to join the northern army having heard after my orders to connecticut for his marching hither that he and most of his regiment were at albany or within its vicinity general ward mentions that the council of the massachusetts state will have in from two to three thousand of their militia to defend their lines and different posts in lieu of the regiments ordered from thence agreeably to the resolution of congress the enclosed copy of a resolve of this state passed the  0th instant will discover the apprehension they are under of the defection of the inhabitants of kings county from the common cause and of the measures they have taken thereupon i have directed general greene to give the committee such assistance as he can and they may require in the execution of their commission though at the same time i   0 wish the information the convention have received upon the subject may prove groundless i would beg leave to mention to congress that in a letter i received from general lee he mentions the valuable consequences that would result from a number of cavalry being employed in the southern department without them to use his own expressions he can answer for nothing with one thousand he would ensure the safety of those states i should have done myself the honor of submitting this matter to congress before at his particular request had it not escaped my mind from his acquaintance with that country and the nature of the grounds i doubt not he has weighed the matter well and presume he has fully represented the advantages that would arise from the establishment of such a corps all i mean is in compliance with his requisition to mention the matter that such consideration may be had upon it if not already determined that it may be deserving of     i am c      george washington    august      new york to the new york convention headquarters new york    august      gentlemen as the time is certainly near at hand and may be hourly expected which is to decide the fate of this city and the issue of this campaign i thought it highly improper that persons of suspected character should remain in places where their opportunities of doing mischief were much greater than in the enemys camp i therefore have caused a number of them to be apprehended and removed to some distance there to remain until this crisis is passed having formerly mentioned this subject to your honorable body i would not again trouble them in a business which former connexions obligations and interests must make very unpleasant and which i apprehend must have been in danger of failing in the execution unless done with all possible secrecy and despatch i postponed this most disagreeable duty until the last moment but the claims of the army upon me and an application from a number of well affected inhabitants concurring with my own opinion obliged me to enter upon it while time and circumstances would admit i have ordered a very strict attention to be paid to the necessities of the gentlemen apprehended and to their comfortable accommodation in every respect both here and at the places of their destination i have also written to the committee of queens county that this step is not to be considered as making their property liable to any injury or appropriation unless they should receive directions     from your honorable body to whom i have referred them on this subject being resolved in all cases where the most absolute necessity does not require it to confine myself wholly to that line which shall exclude every idea interfering with the authority of the state some of these gentlemen have expressed doubts and raised difficulties from engagements they lay under to your honorable body or to some committees they do not appear to me to deserve much attention as they cannot with any propriety be charged with a breach of any parole under their present circumstances but i beg leave to submit to your consideration the propriety of removing the pretence i am gentlemen with great respect and regard c      george washington    august      new york majorgeneral gates to majorgeneral gates new york    august      dear sir i yesterday morning received your letter by bennet the express and am extremely sorry to find that the army is still in a sickly and melancholy state the precaution taken to halt the reinforcements at skenesborough     which are destined for your succor is certainly prudent they should not be exposed or made liable to the calamities already too prevailing unless in cases of extreme necessity dr stringer has been here with dr morgan and is now at philadelphia i trust he will obtain some necessary supplies of medicines which will enable him under the smiles of providence to relieve your distresses in some degree by a letter from general ward two regiments whitcombs and phinnys were to march to your aid last week they have happily had the smallpox and will not be subject to the fatal consequences attending that disorder i am glad to hear that the vessels for the lakes are going on with such industry maintaining the superiority over the water is certainly of infinite importance i trust neither courage nor activity will be wanting in these to whom the business is committed if assigned to general arnold none will doubt of his exertions in answer to those parts of your letter which so highly resent the conduct of the general officers here i would observe sir that you are under a mistake when you suppose a council of officers had sat upon those who composed the board at crown point when intelligence was first brought that the post was evacuated it spread a general alarm and occasioned much anxiety to all who heard it as it was almost universally believed that it was a post of the last importance and the only one to give us in conjunction with our naval force a superiority over the lake and for preventing the enemys penetrating into this and the eastern governments as this matter     was occasionally mentioned the general officers some from their own knowledge and others from the opinion they had formed expressed themselves to that effect as did all i heard speak upon the subject added to this the remonstrance of the officers transmitted by general schuyler at the same time the account was brought did not contribute a little to authorize the opinion which was generally entertained they surely seemed to have some reasons in their support though it was not meant to give the least encouragement or sanction to proceedings of such a nature upon the whole no event that i have been informed of for a long time produced a more general chagrin and consternation but yet there was no council called upon the occasion nor court of inquiry nor courtmartial as has been suggested by some i will not take up more time upon the subject nor make it a matter of further discussion not doubting but those who determined that the post ought to be abandoned conceived it would promote the interest of the great cause we are engaged in the others have differed from them by the by i wish your description perfectly corresponded with the real circumstances of this army you will have heard before this comes to hand most probably of the arrival of clinton and his army from the southward they are now at staten island as are the whole or the greatest part of the hessian and foreign troops since monday ninetysix ships came in which we are informed is the last division of howes fleet which touched at halifax and by a deserter are not to land their troops we are in daily expectation     that they will make their attack all their movements and the advices we have indicating that they are on the point of it i am dear sir c      george washington    august      new york to the new york convention headquarters new york    august      gentlemen when i consider that the city of new york will in all human probability very soon be the scene of a bloody conflict i cannot but view the great numbers of women children and infirm persons remaining in it with the most melancholy concern when the menofwar passed up the river the shrieks and cries of these poor creatures running every way with their children were truly distressing and i fear they will have an unhappy effect on the ears and minds of our young and inexperienced soldiery can no method be devised for their removal many doubtless are of ability to remove themselves but there are others in a different situation some provision for them afterwards would also be a necessary consideration it would relieve me from great anxiety if your honorable body would immediately deliberate upon it and form and execute some plan for their removal and relief in which i will coÃ¶perate and assist to the utmost of my power in the mean time i have thought it proper to recommend to persons of the above description to convey themselves without delay to some place of safety with their most valuable effects  i have the honor to be c     george washington    august      new york lord howe to the right honorable lord howe headquarters new york    august      my lord being authorized by congress as their commanders in every department are to negotiate an exchange of prisoners and presuming as well from the nature of your lordships command as the information that general howe has been pleased to honor me with that the exchange in the naval line will be subject to your lordships directions i beg leave to propose the following mode of exchange for your lordships consideration namely officers for those of equal rank and sailors for sailors if this proposal should be agreeable to your lordship i am charged in a particular manner to exchange any officer belonging to the british navy in our hands and of equal rank for     lieutenant josiah who was lately made prisoner in a ship retaken by the cerberus frigate the reason my lord of my being charged to propose the exchange of lieutenant josiah in preference to that of any other officer is that authentic intelligence has been received that regardless of his rank as an officer he has not only been subjected to the duties of a common seaman but has experienced many other marks of indignity as a different line of conduct my lord has ever been observed towards the officers of your navy who have fallen into our hands it becomes not only a matter of right but of duty to mention this to your lordship to the end that an inquiry may be made into the case above referred to from your lordships character for humanity i am led to presume that the hardships imposed on lieutenant josiah are without either your knowledge or concurrence and therefore most readily hope that upon this representation your lordship will enjoin all officers under your command to pay such regard to the treatment of those who may fall into their hands as their different ranks and situations require and such as your lordship would wish to see continued by us to those who are already in our power or who may hereafter by the chance of war be subjected to it i have the honor to be my lord with great respect your lordships most obedient servant    0 george washington    august      new york lord drummond to lord drummond  new york    august      my lord i have your lordships favor of this day accompanied by papers on subjects of the greatest moment and deserving the most deliberate consideration i can allow much of your lordships wellmeant zeal on such an occasion but i fear it has transported you beyond that attention to your parole which comprehends the character of a man of strict honor how your lordship can reconcile your past or present conduct with your engagement so as to satisfy your own mind i must submit to your own feelings but i find myself under the disagreeable necessity of objecting to the mode of negotiation proposed while your lordships conduct appears so exceptionable i shall by express forward to congress your lordships letter and the papers which accompanied it the result will be communicated as soon as possible i am sorry to have detained your lordship so long but the unavoidable necessity must be my apology i am my lord c      george washington    august      new york governor trumbull to governor trumbull new york    august      sir i have been duly honored with your favor of the   th instant and at the same time that i think you and your honorable council of safety highly deserving of the thanks of the states for the measures you have adopted in order to give the most early and speedy succor to this army give me leave to return you mine in a particular manner when the whole     of the reinforcements arrive i flatter myself we shall be competent to every exigency and with the smiles of providence upon our arms and vigorous exertions we shall baffle the designs of our inveterate foes formidable as they are our situation was truly alarming a little while since but by the kind interposition and aid of our friends it is now much better you may rest assured sir that due consideration shall be had to the several militia regiments that have come and are marching to our assistance and that     they shall be dismissed as soon as circumstances will admit of it i trust so long as there is occasion for their services that the same spirit and commendable zeal which induced them to come will induce their continuance i sincerely wish it were in my power to ascertain the particular period when they would be needed that they may not be detained one unnecessary moment from their homes and common pursuits but as this cannot be done as the approaching contest and trial between the two armies will most unquestionably produce events of the utmost importance to the states as the issue if favorable will put us on such a footing as to bid defiance to the utmost malice of the british nation and those in alliance with her i have not a doubt but they will most readily consent to stay and cheerfully undergo every present and temporary inconvenience so long as they are necessary i am happy captain van buren has succeeded so well in the business he was upon it being of great consequence for us to fit out and maintain our vessels on the lakes  on the night of the   th two of our firevessels attempted to burn the ships of war up the river one of them boarded the phÅ“nix of fortyfour guns and was grappled with her for some minutes but unluckily she cleared herself the only damage the enemy sustained was the destruction of one tender it is agreed on all hands that our people engaged in this affair behaved with great resolution     and intrepidity one of the captains thomas it is to be feared perished in the attempt or in making his escape by swimming as he has not been heard of his bravery entitled him to a better fate though this enterprise did not succeed to our wishes i incline to think it alarmed the enemy greatly for this morning the phÅ“nix and rose with their two remaining tenders taking advantage of a brisk and prosperous gale with a favorable tide quitted their stations and have returned and joined the rest of the fleet as they passed our several batteries they were fired upon but without any damage that i could perceive  the whole of the british forces in america except those employed in canada are now here clintons arrival being followed the last week by that of lord dunmore who now forms a part of the army we are to oppose his coming has added but little to their strength i have the honor to be c      george washington  0 august      new york to the president of congress new york  0 august      sir i was yesterday morning favored with yours of the   th accompanied by several resolutions of congress and commissions for officers appointed to the late vacancies in this army i wrote some days ago to general schuyler to propose to generals carleton and burgoyne an exchange of prisoners in consequence of a former resolve of congress authorizing their commanders in each department to negotiate one that of major meigs for major french and captain dearborn for any officer of equal rank i submitted to general howes consideration by letter on the   th understanding their paroles had been sent to him by general carleton but have not yet received his answer upon the subject in respect to the exchange of prisoners in canada     if a proposition on that head has not been already made and i believe it has not the enclosed copy of general carletons orders transmitted to me under seal by major bigelow who was sent with a flag to general burgoyne from ticonderoga with the proceedings of congress on the breach of capitulation at the cedars and the inhuman treatment of our people afterwards will show it is unnecessary as he has determined to send them to their own provinces there to remain as prisoners interdicting at the same time all kinds of intercourse between us and his army except such as may be for the purpose of imploring the kings mercy the assassination which he mentions of brigadiergeneral gordon is a fact entirely new to     me and what i never heard of before i shall not trouble congress with my strictures upon this indecent illiberal and scurrilous performance so highly unbecoming the character of a soldier and gentleman only observing that its design is somewhat artful and that each boatman with major bigelow was furnished with a copy i have also transmitted congress a copy of the majors journal to which i beg leave to refer them for the intelligence reported by him on his return from the truce      by a letter from genl greene yesterday evening he informed me he had received an express from hog island inlet advising that   of the enemys small vessells had appeared at the mouth of the creek with some troops on boardâ€”also that he had heard two pettiaugers were off oister bay the whole supposed to be after live stock and to prevent their getting it he had detached a party of horse  two hundred  twenty men among em twenty rifle men i have not received further intelligence upon the subject i am also advised by the examination of a captain britton master of a vessel that had been taken     transmitted to me by general mercer that the general report among the enemys troops was when he came off that they were to attack long island and to secure our works there if possible at the same time that another part of their army was to land above this city this information is corroborated by many other accounts and is probably true nor will it be possible to prevent their landing on the island as its great extent affords a variety of places favorable for that purpose and the whole of our works on it are at the end opposite to the city however we shall attempt to harass them as much as possible which will be all that we can do i have the honor c    0 george washington    august      new york majorgeneral heath to majorgeneral heath new york    august      dear sir as the enemy must pass this place before they can attempt the posts above and as your troops there are now augmented i would have you pick out a body of about eight hundred or a thousand light active men and good marksmen including the light infantry and riflemen ready to move this way upon the appearance of the shipping coming up or upon the commencement of the cannonade of any of our works by the time these troops get into the flat grounds of haerlem they will be able especially if you send a horseman or two on before for intelligence which will be proper to determine whether the ships intend higher up than this neighborhood and regulate themselves accordingly there is a road out of the haerlem flat lands that leads up to the hills and continues down the north river by bloomingdale delanceys c which road i would have them march as they will keep the river in sight and pass a tolerable landingplace for troops in the neighborhood of bloomingdale this detachment should bring a couple of light fieldpieces i think two or even four pieces of cannon might be spared from fort washington to the post over the bridgeâ€”but query whether it might not do to run them from thence when occasion shall seem to require it as that post never can be attacked without sufficient notice to do this colonel knox will have four carriages ready for that place immediately if     we have not other employment upon hand which general putnam who is this instant come in seems to think we assuredly shall this day as there is a considerable embarkation on board of the enemys boats i shall therefore only add that you should delay no time in forming your detachment for our aid or your own defence as circumstances may require yours c in haste george washington    august      new york to the new york convention headquarters new york    august      gentlemen i am favored with yours of the   d acquainting me with a report now circulating that if the american army should be obliged to retreat from this city any individual may set it on fire i can assure you gentlemen that this report is not founded upon the least authority from me on the contrary i am so sensible of the value of such a city and the consequences of its destruction to many worthy citizens and their families that nothing but the last necessity and that such as should justify me to the whole world would induce me to give orders for that purpose the unwillingness shown by many families to remove notwithstanding your and my recommendations may perhaps have led some persons to propagate the report with honest and innocent intentions but as your letter first informed me of it i cannot pretend to say by whom or for what purpose it has been done as my views with regard to the removal     of the women and children have happily coincided with your sentiments and a committee appointed to carry them into execution i submit it to your judgment whether it would not be proper for the committee to meet immediately in this city and give notice of their attendance on this business there are many who anxiously wish to remove but have not the means i am with much respect and regard gentlemen yours c george washington    august      new york majorgeneral heath to majorgeneral heath headquarters new york    august      sir yesterday morning the enemy landed at gravesend bay upon long island from the best information i can obtain to the number of about eight thousand colonel hand retreated before them burning as he came along several parcels of wheat and such other matter as he judged would fall into the enemys hands our first accounts were that they intended by a forced march to surprise general sullivans who commands during the illness of general greene lines whereupon i immediately reinforced that post with six regiments but they halted last night at flatbush  if they should attack general sullivan     this day and should show no disposition to attack me likewise at the making of the next flood i shall send such further reinforcements to long island as i may judge expedient not choosing to weaken this post too much before i am certain that the enemy are not making a feint upon long island to draw our force to that quarter when their real design may perhaps be upon this  i am c     p s the flood tide will begin to make about eleven oclock at which time if the detachment ordered yesterday were to move to the high and open grounds about mr delanceys and bloomingdale they would be ready to come forward or turn back as occasion should require it would give them a little exercise and show them wherein they are wanting in any matter george washington    august      new york governor trumbull to governor trumbull new york    august      sir on thursday last the enemy landed a body of troops supposed to amount from the best accounts i have been able to obtain to eight or nine thousand men at gravesend bay on long island ten miles distance from our works on the island and immediately marched through the open lands to flatbush where they are now encamped they are distant about three miles from our lines and have woods and broken grounds to pass which we have lined before they can get to them some skirmishing has happened between their advanced parties and ours in which we have always gained an advantage  what the real designs of the enemy are i am not yet able     to determine my opinion of the matter is that they mean to attack our works on the island and this city at the same time and that the troops at flatbush are waiting in those plains till the wind and tide which have not yet served together will favor the movement of the shipping to this place others think they will bend their principal force against our lines on the island which if carried will greatly facilitate their designs upon this city this also being very probable i have thrown what force i can over without leaving myself too much exposed here for our whole number if the intelligence we get from deserters c be true falls short of that of the enemy consequently the defence of our own works and the approaches to them is all we can aim at this then in a manner leaves the whole island in possession of the enemy and of course of the supplies it is capable of affording them under these circumstances would it be practicable for your government to throw a body of one thousand or more men across the sound to harass the enemy in their rear or upon their flanks this would annoy them exceedingly at the same time that a valuable end to wit that of preventing their parties securing the stocks of cattle c would be answered by it the cattle to be removed or killed the knowledge i have of the extraordinary exertions of your state upon all occasions does not permit me to require this not knowing how far it is practicable i only offer it therefore as a matter for your consideration and of great public utility if it can be accomplished     the enemy if my intelligence from staten island be true are at this time rather distressed on account of provisions if then we can deprive them of what this island affords much good will follow from it the foreigners are yet upon staten island  the british troops are upon long island and on shipboard i remain c  george washington    august      majorgeneral putnam to majorgeneral putnam  instructions it was with no small degree of concern i perceived yesterday a scattering unmeaning and wasteful fire from our people at the enemyâ€”a kind of fire that tended to disgrace our own men as soldiers and to render our defence contemptible in the eyes of the enemy no one good consequence can attend such irregularities but several bad ones will inevitably follow from them had it not been for this unsoldierlike and disorderly practice we have the greatest reason imaginable to believe that numbers of deserters would have left the enemys army last year but fear prevented them from approaching our lines then and must for ever continue to operate in like manner whilst every soldier conceives himself at liberty to fire when and at what he pleases this is     not the only nor the greatest evil resulting from the practice for as we do not know the hour of the enemys approach to our lines but have every reason to apprehend that it will be sudden and violent whenever attempted we shall have our men so scattered and more than probable without ammunition that the consequences must prove fatal to us besides this there will be no possibility of distinguishing between a real and a false alarm i must therefore sir in earnest terms desire you to call the colonels and commanding officers of corps without loss of time before you and let them afterwards do the same by their respective officers and charge them in express and positive terms to stop these irregularities as they value the good of the service their own honor and the safety of the army which under god depends wholly upon the good order and government that is observed in it at the same time i would have you form proper lines of defence around your encampment and works on the most advantageous ground your guards which compose this defence are to be particularly instructed in their duty and a brigadier of the day is to remain constantly upon the lines that he may be upon the spot to command and see that orders are executed fieldofficers should also be appointed to go the rounds and report the situation of the guards and no person should be allowed to pass beyond the guards without special order in writing by restraining the loose disorderly and unsoldierlike firing before mentioned i do not mean to discourage partisans and scouting parties on the contrary i wish to see a spirit of that sort prevailing under proper regulations and officers either commissioned or noncommissioned as cases require to be directed by yourself or licensed by the brigadier of the day upon the spot to be sent upon this service such skirmishing as may be effected in this manner will be agreeable to the rules of propriety and may be attended with salutary effects inasmuch as it will inure the troops to fatigue and danger will harass the enemy and may make prisoners and prevent their parties from getting the horses and cattle from the interior parts of the island which are objects of infinite importance to us especially the two last all the men not upon duty are to be compelled to remain in or near their respective camps or quarters that they may turn out     at a moments warning nothing being more probable than that the enemy will allow little time enough to prepare for the attack the officers also are to exert themselves to the utmost to prevent every kind of abuse to private property and to bring every offender to the punishment he deserves shameful it is to find that those men who have come hither in defence of the rights of mankind should turn invaders of it by destroying the substance of their friends the burning of houses where the apparent good of the service is not promoted by it and the pillaging of them at all times and upon all occasions are to be discountenanced and punished with the utmost severity in short it is to be hoped that men who have property of their own and a regard for the rights of others will shudder at the thought of rendering any mans situation in whose protection he has come more insufferable than his open and avowed enemy would make it when by duty and every rule of humanity they ought to aid and not oppress the distressed in their habitations the distinction between a well regulated army and a mob is the good order and discipline of the first and the licentious and disorderly behavior of the latter men therefore who are not employed as mere hirelings but have stepped forth in defence of every thing that is dear and valuable not only to themselves but to posterity should take uncommon pains to conduct themselves with the greatest propriety and good order as their honor and reputation call loudly upon them to do it the wood next to red hook should be well attended to put some of the most disorderly riflemen into it the militia are the most indifferent troops those i mean which are least tutored and have seen least service and will do for the interior works whilst your best men should at all hazards prevent the enemys passing the wood and approaching your works the woods should be secured by abatis where necessary to make the enemys approach as difficult as possible traps and ambuscades should be laid for their parties if you find they are sent out after cattle c given under my hand at head quarters this   th day of august          george washington    august      new york to the president of congress new york    august      sir i have been duly honored with your favors of the  0th and   th and am happy to find my answer to lord drummond has met the approbation of congress whatever his views were most certainly his conduct respecting his parole is highly reprehensible since my letter of the   th almost the whole of the enemys fleet have fallen down to the narrows and from this circumstance and the striking of their tents and their several encampments on staten island from time to time previous to the departure of the ships from thence we are led to think they mean to land the main body of their army on long island and to make their grand push there i have ordered over considerable reinforcements to our troops there and shall continue to send more as circumstances may require there has been a little skirmishing and irregular firing kept up between their and our advanced guards in which colonel martin of the jersey levies has received a wound in his breast which it is apprehended will prove mortal a private has had his leg broken by a cannonball and another has received a shot in the groin from their musketry this is all the damage they have yet done us what they have sustained is not known the shifting and changing which the regiments have undergone of late have prevented their making proper returns and of course put it out of my power to transmit a general one of the army however i   0 believe our strength is much the same as it was when the last was made with the addition of nine militia regiments from the state of connecticut averaging about three hundred and fifty men each these are nine of the fourteen regiments mentioned in my letter of   th our people still continue to be very sickly the papers designed for the foreign troops have been put into several channels in order that they might be conveyed to em and from the information i had yesterday i have reason to believe many have fallen into their hands  i have enclosed a copy of lord drummonds second letter in answer to mine which i received since i transmitted his first and which i have thought it necessary to lay before congress that they may possess the whole of the correspondence between us and see how far he has exculpated himself from the charge alleged against     himâ€”the log book he mentions to have sent colo moylan proves nothing in his favor that shews he had been at bermuda and from thence to some other island and on his passage from which to this place the vessel he was in was boarded by a pilot who brought her into the hook where he found the british fleet which his lordship avers he did not expect were there having understood their destination was to the southward  george washington    august half past four am      long island to the president of congress long island    august half past four am      sir i was last night honored with your favor of the   th accompanied by sundry resolutions of congress those respecting the officers c that may be wounded in the service of the states are founded     much in justice and i should hope may be productive of many salutary consequences as to the encouragement to the hessian officers i wish it may have the desired effect perhaps it might have been better had the offer been sooner made before this you will probably have received a letter from mr harrison of the   th advising you of the engagement between a detachment of our men and the enemy on that day  i am sorry to inform congress that i have not yet heard either of general sullivan or lord stirling who were among the missing after the engagement nor can i ascertain our loss i am hopeful part of our men will yet get in several did yesterday morning that of the enemy is also uncertain the accounts are various i incline to think they suffered a good deal some deserters say five hundred were killed and wounded there was some skirmishing the greater part of yesterday between parties from the enemy and our people in the evening it was pretty smart the event i have not yet learned the weather of late has been extremely wet yesterday it rained severely the whole afternoon which distressed our people much not having a sufficiency of tents to cover them and what we have not got over yet i am in hopes they will all be got today and that they will be more comfortably provided for though the great scarcity of these articles distresses us beyond measure not having any thing like a sufficient number to protect     our people from the inclemency of the weather which has occasioned much sickness and the men to be almost broke down  i have the honor to be c  george washington    august      new york to the president of congress new york    august      sir inclination as well as duty would have induced me to give congress the earliest information of my removal     and that of the troops from long island and its dependencies to this city the night before last but the extreme fatigue which myself and family have undergone as much from the weather since as the engagement on the   th rendered me and them entirely unfit to take pen in hand since monday scarce any of us have been out of the lines till our passage across the east river was effected yesterday morning and for fortyeight hours preceding that i had hardly been off my horse and never closed my eyes so that i was quite unfit to write or dictate till this morning our retreat was made without any loss of men or ammunition and in better order than i expected from troops in the situation ours were we brought off all our cannon and stores except a few heavy pieces which in the condition the earth was by a long continued rain we found upon trial impracticable the wheels of the carriages sinking up to the hobs rendered it impossible for our whole force to drag them we left but little provisions on the island except some cattle which had been driven within our lines and which after many attempts to force across the water we found it impossible to effect circumstanced as we were i have enclosed a copy of the council of war held previous to the retreat to which i beg leave to refer congress for the reasons or many of them that led to the adoption of that measure  yesterday evening and last night     a party of our men were employed in bringing our stores cannon and tents from governors island which they nearly completed some of the heavy cannon remain there still but i expect they will be got away today in the engagement on the   th generals sullivan and stirling were made prisoners the former has     been permitted on his parole to return for a little time from my lord stirling i had a letter by general sullivan a copy of which i have the honor to transmit that contains his information of the engagement with his brigade it is not so full and certain as i could wish he was hurried most probably as his letter was unfinished nor have i been yet able to obtain an exact account of our loss we suppose it from seven hundred to a thousand killed and taken  general sullivan says lord howe is extremely desirous of seeing some of the members of congress for which purpose he was allowed to come out and to communicate to them what has passed between him and his lordship i have consented to his going to philadelphia as i do not mean or conceive it right to withhold or prevent him from giving such information as he possesses in this instance i am much hurried and engaged in arranging and making new dispositions of our forces the movements of the enemy requiring them to be immediately had and therefore i have only time to add that i am with my best regards to congress c      george washington   september      new york majorgeneral heath to majorgeneral heath new york   september      sir i received your favor of this date and intend this evening to go to haerlem and see whether the situation of things will admit of the several detachments and dispositions you mention so that every place necessary to be maintained should have measures taken for their defence i should suppose that hutchinsons regiment and the three hundred men you say are at mount washington will do to garrison it for the present and will be equal to any force that will be brought against it if they keep a good lookout and do not suffer a surprise this you must strongly press upon them to guard againstâ€” as it is of great consequence to gain intelligence of the enemys designs and of their intended operations i cannot but recommend your attention to this subject and that you will concert some measures with general clinton for establishing a channel of     information i apprehend that his general acquaintance with most of the people in the colony will give him an opportunity of fixing upon suitable persons and in whom a confidence may be reposed to embark in this business and who from their connections on the island and the assistance of their friends there might obtain frequent accounts that would be useful and of great advantage perhaps some might be got who are really tories for a reasonable reward to undertake it those who are friends would be preferable if they could manage it as well i will not add more upon the subject but heartily wish you and general clinton could fall upon some mode to carry into execution a scheme of this sort we are in extreme want here of a number of horses and teams to transport baggage c from place to place and therefore have enclosed a warrant authorizing you or any substituted by you to impress them if they can be procured immediately by hiring it would be better but if not i beg you will take the most early means to send them down by impressing them they must be had at all events if there is a possibility of procuring boats for the haerlem river it shall be done i am sir george washington   september      new york to the president of congress new york   september      sir as my intelligence of late has been rather unfavorable and would be received with anxiety and concern     peculiarly happy should i esteem myself were it in my power at this time to transmit such information to congress as would be more pleasing and agreeable to their wishes but unfortunately for me unfortunately for them it is not our situation is truly distressing the check our detachment sustained on the   th ultimo has dispirited too great a proportion of our troops and filled their minds with apprehension and despair the militia instead of calling forth their utmost efforts to a brave and manly opposition in order to repair our losses are dismayed intractable and impatient to return great numbers of them have gone off in some instances almost by whole regiments by half ones and by companies at a time this circumstance of itself independent of others when fronted by a wellappointed enemy superior in number to our whole collected force would be sufficiently disagreeable but when their example has infected another part of the army when their want of discipline and refusal of almost every kind of restraint and government have produced a like conduct but too common to the whole and an entire disregard of that order and subordination necessary to the welldoing of an army and which had been inculcated before as well as the nature of our military establishment would admit ofâ€”our condition is still more alarming and with the deepest concern i am obliged to confess my want of confidence in the generality of the troops all these circumstances fully confirm the opinion i ever entertained and which i more than once in my   0 letters took the liberty of mentioning to congress that no dependence could be put in a militia or other troops than those enlisted and embodied for a longer period than our regulations heretofore have prescribed i am persuaded and as fully convinced as i am of any one fact that has happened that our liberties must of necessity be greatly hazarded if not entirely lost if their defence is left to any but a permanent standing army i mean one to exist during the war nor would the expense incident to the support of such a body of troops as would be competent to almost every exigency far exceed that which is daily incurred by calling in succor and new enlistments which when effected are not attended with any good consequences men who have been free and subject to no control cannot be reduced to order in an instant and the privileges and exemptions they claim and will have influence the conduct of others and the aid derived from them is nearly counterbalanced by the disorder irregularity and confusion they occasion i cannot find that the bounty of ten dollars is likely to produce the desired effect when men can get double that sum to engage for a month or two in the militia and that militia frequently called out it is hardly to be expected the addition of land might have a considerable influence on a permanent enlistment  our number of men at present fit for duty is under twenty thousand they were so by the last returns and best accounts i could get after the engagement     on long island since which numbers have deserted i have ordered general mercer to send the men intended for the flying camp to this place about a thousand in number and to try with the militia if practicable to make a diversion upon staten island till of late i had no doubt in my own mind of defending this place nor should i have yet if the men would do their duty but this i despair of it is painful and extremely grating to me to give such unfavorable accounts but it would be criminal to conceal the truth at so critical a juncture every power i possess shall be exerted to serve the cause and my first wish is that whatever may be the event the congress will do me the justice to think so if we should be obliged to abandon the town ought it to stand as winterquarters for the enemy they would derive great conveniences from it on the one hand and much property would be destroyed on the other it is an important question but will admit of but little time for deliberation at present i dare say the enemy mean to preserve it if they can if congress therefore should resolve upon the destruction of it the resolution should be a profound secret as the knowledge of it will make a change in their plans  i have c     george washington   september      new york brigadiergeneral mercer to brigadiergeneral mercer new york   september      dear sir from the present complexion of our affairs it appears to me of the utmost importance and that the most salutary consequences may result from our having a strong encampment at the post on the jersey side of the north river opposite to mount washington on this island i therefore think it advisable and highly necessary that you detach such a force from amboy and its dependencies under the command of an officer of note authority and influence with a skilful engineer to lay out such additional works as may be judged essential and proper and the situation of the ground will admit of they should be begun and carried on with all possible diligence and despatch it will be necessary that a considerable quantity of provision should be collected for the maintenance and support of the camp and for this purpose i wish you to have proper measures adopted to procure it and have it deposited there and at places of security not far distant as the continental officers now at this post will take rank and the command probably of any one you may send unless he should be a general officer i think and wish if you have one that possibly can be spared and in whose judgment activity and fortitude you can rely that he may be appointed to the command rather than an officer of inferior rank i am c      george washington   september      new york fisher gay to colonel fisher gay new york   september      sir whether you do not get the general orders with that regularity which is to be wished or whether which is hard to suppose you do not attend to them i will not undertake to determine but it is a melancholy truth that returns essentially necessary for the commanding officer to govern himself by and which     might be made in an hour after they are called for where care and order are observed are obtained with so much difficulty nor can i help regretting that not only regular returns but that orders in instances equally important should be so little attended to i therefore address myself to you in this manner requesting in express and peremptory terms that you do without delay make out and return to the adjutant generals office immediately an exact state of the regiment or corps under your command and that the like return be given in every saturday at orderly time without fail i also desire in terms equally express that you do not suffer the men of your corps to straggle from their quarters or be absent from camp without leave and even then but a few at a time your own reputation the safety of the army and the good of the cause depend under god upon our vigilance and readiness to oppose a crafty and enterprising enemy who are always upon the watch to take advantages to prevent straggling let your rolls be called over three times a day and the delinquents punished  i have one thing more to urge and that is that every attempt of the men to plunder houses orchards gardens     c be discouraged not only for the preservation of property and sake of good order but for the prevention of those fatal consequences which usually follow such diabolical practices in short sir at a time when every thing is at stake it behoves every man to exert himself it will not do for the commanding officer of a regiment to content himself with barely giving orders he should see at least know they are executed he should call his men out frequently and endeavor to impress them with a just sense of their duty and how much depends upon subordination and discipline let me therefore not only command but exhort you and your officers as you regard your reputation your country and the sacred cause of freedom in which you are engaged to manly and vigorous exertions at this time each striving to excel the other in the respective duties of his department i trust it is unnecessary for me to add further and that these and all other articles of your duty you will execute with a spirit and punctuality becoming your station i am c george washington   september      new york to the president of congress new york   september      sir i was last night honored with your favor of the  d with sundry resolutions of congress and perceiving it to be their opinion and determination that no damage shall be done to the city in case we are obliged to abandon it i shall take every measure in my power     to prevent it since my letter of the  th nothing very material has occurred unless it is that the fleet seem to be drawing more together and all getting close in with governors island their designs we cannot learn nor have we been able to procure the least information of late of any of their plans or intended operations as the enemys movements are very different from what we expected and from their large encampments a considerable distance up the sound there is reason to believe they intend to make a landing above or below kingsbridge and thereby to hem in our army and cut off the communication with the country i mean to call a council of general officers today or tomorrow and endeavor to digest and fix upon some regular and certain system of conduct to be pursued in order to baffle their efforts and counteract their schemes and also to determine on the expediency of evacuating or attempting to maintain the city and the several posts on this island the result of their opinion and deliberations i shall advise congress by the earliest opportunity which will be by express having it not in my power to communicate any intelligence by post as the office is removed to so great a distance and entirely out of the way  i have enclosed a list of the officers who are prisoners and from whom letters have been received by a flag we know there are others not included in the list general sullivan having informed me that general howe was willing that an exchange of him     for general prescott should take place it will be proper to send general prescott immediately that it may be effected as the militia regiments in all probability will be impatient to return and become pressing for their pay i shall be glad of the direction of congress whether they are to receive it here or from the conventions or assemblies of the respective states to which they belong on the one hand the settlement of their abstracts will be attended with trouble and difficulty on the other they will go away much better satisfied and be more ready to give their aid in future if they are paid before their departure before i conclude i must take the liberty of mentioning to congress the great distress we are in for want of money two months pay and more to some battalions is now due to the troops here without any thing in the military chest to satisfy it this occasions much dissatisfaction and almost a general uneasiness not a day passes without complaints and the most importunate and urgent demands on this head as it may injure the service greatly and the want of a regular supply of cash produce consequences of the most fatal tendency i entreat the attention of congress to this subject and that we may be provided as soon as can be with a sum equal to every present claim i have wrote to general howe proposing an exchange of general mcdonald for lord stirling  and     shall be extremely happy to obtain it as well as that of general prescott being greatly in want of them and under the necessity of appointing pro tempore some of the colonels to command brigades i have the honor to be c p s as two regiments from n carolina and   regiments more from virginia are ordered here if they could embark at norfolk c and come up the bay with security it would expedite their arrival and prevent the men from a long fatiguing march this however should not be attempted if the enemy have vessels in the bay and which might probably intercept em  george washington   september      new york governor trumbull to governor trumbull new york   september      sir i have been honored with your favor of the   st ultimo and am extremely obliged by the measures you are taking in consequence of my recommendatory letter the exertions of connecticut upon this as well as upon every other occasion do great honor and i hope will be attended with successful and happy consequences in respect to the mode of conduct to be pursued by the troops that go over to the island i cannot lay down any certain rule it must be formed and governed by circumstances and the direction of those who command them i should have done myself the honor of transmitting to you an account of the engagement between a     detachment of our troops and the enemy on long island on the   th and of our retreat from thence before now had it not been for the multiplicity of business i have been involved in ever since and being still engaged i cannot enter upon a minute and particular detail of the affair i shall only add therefore that we lost in killed wounded and prisoners from seven hundred to one thousand men among the prisoners are general sullivan and lord stirling the enclosed list will show you the names of many of the officers that are prisoners  the action was chiefly with the troops from jersey pennsylvania the lower counties and maryland and colonel huntingtons regiment they suffered greatly being attacked and overpowered by numbers of the enemy greatly superior to them the enemys loss we have not been able to ascertain but we have reason to believe it was considerable as the engagement was warm and conducted with great resolution and bravery on the part of our troops during the engagement a deep column of the enemy descended from the woods and attempted an impression upon our   0 lines but retreated immediately on the discharge of a cannon and part of the musketry from the line nearest to them as the main body of the enemy had encamped not far from our lines and i had reason to believe that they intended to force us from them by regular approaches which the nature of the ground favored extremely and at the same time meant by the ships of war to cut off the communication between the city and island and by that means keep our men divided and unable to oppose them anywhere by the advice of the general officers on the night of the   th i withdrew our troops from thence without any loss of men and but little baggage  i am c george washington   september      new york to the president of congress headquarters new york   september      sir since i had the honor of addressing you on the  th inst i have called a council of the general officers in order to take a full and comprehensive view of our situation and thereupon form such a plan of future defence as may be immediately pursued and subject to no other alteration than a change of operations on the enemys side may occasion before the landing of the enemy in long island the point of attack could not be known nor any satisfactory judgment formed of their intentions it might be on long     island on bergen or directly on the city this made it necessary to be prepared for each and has occasioned an expense of labor which now seems useless and is regretted by those who form a judgment from afterknowledge but i trust that men of discernment will think differently and see that by such works and preparations we have not only delayed the operations of the campaign till it is too late to effect any capital incursion into the country but have drawn the enemys forces to one point and obliged them to decline their plan so as to enable us to form our defence on some certainty it is now extremely obvious from all intelligence from their movements and every other circumstance that having landed their whole army on long island except about four thousand on staten island they mean to enclose us on the island of new york by taking post in our rear while the shipping effectually protects the front and thus either by cutting off our communication with the country oblige us to fight them on their own terms or surrender at discretion or by a brilliant stroke endeavor to cut this army in pieces and secure the collection of arms and stores which they well know we shall not be able soon to replace having therefore their system unfolded to us it became an important consideration how it could be most successfully opposed on every side there is a choice of difficulties and every measure on our part however painful the reflection is from experience is to be formed with some apprehension that all our troops will not do their duty in deliberating     on this great question it was impossible to forget that history our own experience the advice of our ablest friends in europe the fears of the enemy and even the declarations of congress demonstrate that on our side the war should be defensive it has even been called a war of posts that we should on all occasions avoid a general action nor put any thing to risk unless compelled by a necessity into which we ought never to be drawn the arguments on which such a system was founded were deemed unanswerable and experience has given her sanction with these views and being fully persuaded that it would be presumption to draw out our young troops into open ground against their superiors both in number and discipline i have never spared the spade and pickaxe i confess i have not found that readiness to defend even strong posts at all hazards which is necessary to derive the greatest benefits from them the honor of making a brave defence does not seem to be a sufficient stimulus when success is very doubtful and the falling into the enemys hands probable but i doubt not this will be gradually attained we are now in a strong post but not an impregnable one nay acknowledged by every man of judgment to be untenable unless the enemy will make the attack upon lines when they can avoid it and their movements indicate that they mean to do so to draw the whole army together in order to arrange the defence proportionate to the extent of lines and works would leave the country open for an     approach and put the fate of this army and its stores on the hazard of making a successful defence in the city or the issue of an engagement out of it on the other hand to abandon a city which has been by some deemed defensible and on whose works much labor has been bestowed has a tendency to dispirit the troops and enfeeble our cause it has also been considered as the key to the northern country but as to that i am fully of opinion that by the establishing of strong posts at mount washington on the upper part of this island and on the jersey side opposite to it with the assistance of the obstructions already made and which may be improved in the water that not only the navigation of hudsons river but an easier and better communication may be more effectually secured between the northern and southern states this i believe every one acquainted with the situation of the country will readily agree to and it will appear evident to those who have an opportunity of recurring to good maps these and many other consequences which will be involved in the determination of our next measure have given our minds full employ and led every one to form a judgment as the various objects presented themselves to his view the post at kingsbridge is naturally strong and is pretty well fortified the heights about it are commanding and might soon be made more so these are important objects and i have attended to them accordingly i have also removed from the city all the stores and ammunition except what was absolutely     necessary for its defence and made every other disposition that did not essentially interfere with that object carefully keeping in view until it should be absolutely determined on full consideration how far the city was to be defended at all events in resolving points of such importance many circumstances peculiar to our own army also occur being only provided for a summers campaign their clothes shoes and blankets will soon be unfit for the change of weather which we every day feel at present we have not tents for more than twothirds many of them old and worn out but if we had a plentiful supply the season will not admit of continuing in them long the case of our sick is also worthy of much consideration their number by the returns forms at least onefourth of the army policy and humanity require that they should be made as comfortable as possible with these and many other circumstances before them the whole council of general officers met yesterday in order to adopt some general line of conduct to be pursued at this important crisis i intended to have procured their separate opinions on each point but time would not admit i was therefore obliged to collect their sense more generally than i could have wished all agreed that the town would not be tenable if the enemy resolved to bombard and cannonade it but the difficulty attending a removal operated so strongly that a course was taken between abandoning it totally and concentring our whole strength for its defence nor were some a little     influenced in their opinion to whom the determination of congress was known against an evacuation totally as they were led to suspect congress wished it to be maintained at every hazard  it was concluded to arrange the army under three divisions five thousand to remain for the defence of the city nine thousand at kingsbridge and its dependencies as well to possess and secure those posts as to be ready to attack the enemy who are moving eastward on long island if they should attempt to land on this side the remainder to occupy the intermediate space and support either that the sick should be immediately removed to orangetown and barracks be prepared at kingsbridge with all expedition to cover the troops there were some general officers in whose judgment and opinion much confidence is to be reposed that were for a total and immediate removal from the city urging the great danger of one part of the army being cut off before the other can support it the extremities being at least sixteen miles apart that our army when collected is inferior to the enemy that they can move with their whole force to any point of attack and consequently must succeed by weight of numbers if they have only a part to oppose them that by removing from hence we deprive the enemy of the advantage of their ships which will make at least one half of the force to     attack the town that we should keep the enemy at bay put nothing to hazard but at all events keep the army together which may be recruited another year that the unspent stores will also be preserved and in this case the heavy artillery can also be secured but they were overruled by a majority who thought for the present a part of our force might be kept here and attempt to maintain the city a little longer  i am sensible a retreating army is encircled with difficulties that declining an engagement subjects a general to reproach and that the common cause may be affected by the discouragement it may throw over the minds of many nor am i insensible of the contrary effects if a brilliant stroke could be made with any probability of success especially after our loss upon long island but when the fate of america may be at stake on the issue when the wisdom of cooler moments and experienced men have decided that we should protract the war if possible i cannot think it safe or wise to adopt a different system when the season for action draws so near to a close that the enemy mean to winter in new york there can be no doubt that with such an armament they can drive us out is equally clear     the congress having resolved that it should not be destroyed nothing seems to remain but to determine the time of their taking possession it is our interest and wish to prolong it as much as possible provided the delay does not affect our future measures the militia of connecticut is reduced from six thousand to less than two thousand and in a few days will be merely nominal the arrival of some maryland troops from the flying camp has in a great degree supplied the loss of men but the ammunition they have carried away will be a loss sensibly felt the impulse for going home was so irresistible that it answered no purpose to oppose it though i would not discharge them i have been obliged to acquiesce and it affords one more melancholy proof how delusive such dependences are inclosed i have the honor to transmit a general return the first that i have been able to procure for some time also a report of captain newell from our works at horns hook or hell gate their situation is extremely low and the sound so very narrow that the enemy have em much within their command i have c p s the inclosed information this minute came to hand i am in hopes we shall henceforth get regular intelligence of the enemies movements      george washington   september      new york governor trumbull to governor trumbull headquarters new york   september      sir i have the honor of your favor of the  th inst and am sorry to say that from the best information we have been able to obtain the people on long island have since our evacuation gone generally over to the enemy and made such concessions as have been required some through compulsion i suppose but more from inclination as a diversion upon the island has been impracticable under these circumstances i think you have done well in assisting the removal of the persons and effects of our friends     from thence i observe with great pleasure that you have ordered the remaining regiments of the militia that can be spared from the immediate defence of the seacoast to march toward new york with all expedition i cannot sufficiently express my thanks not only for your constant and ready compliance with every request of mine but for your own strenuous exertions and prudent forecast in ordering matters so that your force has generally been collected and put in motion as soon as it has been demanded with respect to the militia both horse and foot i am of opinion that they will render us more service by rendezvousing at different places along the sound in west chester county and thereabouts than by coming directly to this city it will not only give the enemy who are extending their encampments up the island an idea of our force along the coast but if they should attempt a landing above kingsbridge they will be in readiness to join our force about that place the horse particularly whose rapid motion enables them to be in a short time at any point of attack besides the difficulty of procuring forage upon this island for any number of horses is an objection to their being stationed here i fear that the militia by leaving their homes so suddenly and in a manner unprepared for a long absence have sustained some injury to this cause i must impute in a great measure their impatience to return and the diminution of their numbers at this time to about two thousand their want of discipline the indulgences they claim and have been allowed their unwillingness  00 i may add refusal to submit to that regularity and order essential to every army infecting the rest of our troops more or less have been of pernicious tendency and occasioned a good deal of confusion and disorder but sir these things are not peculiar to those from any one state they are common to all militia and what must be generally expected for men who have been free and never subject to restraint or any kind of control cannot be taught the necessity nor be brought to see the expediency of strict discipline in a day i highly approve of your plan and proposition for raising such a naval force as will be sufficient to clear the sound of the enemys ships of war if commodore hopkins will join you i should suppose it not only practicable but a matter of certainty and if it can be effected many valuable and salutary consequences must result from it as to drafting seamen from the continental regiments it cannot be done as their numbers have been reduced so low already by taking men from them for the galleys boats and other purposes that some of them have hardly any thing left but the name besides i must depend chiefly upon them for a successful opposition to the enemy if it can be done out of the militia i shall not have the least objection and heartily wish the enterprise whenever attempted may be attended with all possible success secrecy and despatch will be most likely to give it a happy issue the enemys ships can receive no reinforcements but such as go round long island our works at hell gate preventing their  0  sending ships that way they are sensible of their importance and yesterday opened two threegun batteries to effect their destruction but as yet have not materially damaged them and they must be maintained if possible i have the honor to be c p s the more the militia and horse keep on the sound towards kingsbridge the better as they will be ready to oppose any landing of the enemy and also to receive orders for reinforcing any posts on this side in case of necessity   0  george washington    september      new york to the president of congress new york    september      sir i have been duly honored with your favor of the  0th with the resolution of congress which accompanied it and thank them for the confidence they repose in my judgment respecting the evacuation of the city i could wish to maintain it because i know it to be of importance but i am fully convinced that it cannot be done and that an attempt for that purpose if persevered in might and most certainly would be attended with consequences the most fatal and alarming in their nature sensible of this several of the general officers since the determination of the  0  council mentioned in my last petitioned that a second council might be called to reconsider the propositions which had been before them upon the subject accordingly i called one on the   th when a large majority not only determined a removal of the army prudent but absolutely necessary declaring they were entirely convinced from a full and minute inquiry into our situation that it was extremely perilous and from every movement of the enemy and the intelligence received their plan of operations was to get in our rear and by cutting off the communication with the main oblige us to force a passage through them on the terms they wish or to become prisoner in some short time for want of necessary supplies of provision  we are now taking every method in our power to remove the stores in which we find almost insuperable  0  difficulties  they are so great and so numerous that i fear we shall not effect the whole before we meet with some interruption i fully expected that an attack somewhere would have been made last night in that i was disappointed and happy shall i be if my apprehensions of one tonight or in a day or two are not confirmed by the event if it is deferred a little while longer i flatter myself all will be got away and our force be more concentred and of course more likely to resist them with success yesterday afternoon four ships of war two of forty and two of twentyeight guns went up the east river passing between governors and long island and anchored about a mile above the city opposite mr stuyvesants where the rose manofwar was lying before the design of their going not being certainly known gives rise to various conjectures some supposing they are to cover the landing of a party of the enemy above the city others that they are to assist in destroying our battery at horns hook that they may have a free and uninterrupted navigation in the sound it is an object of great importance to them and what they are industriously trying to effect by a pretty constant cannonade and bombardment before i conclude i would beg leave to mention to  0  congress that the pay now allowed to nurses for their attendance on the sick is by no means adequate to their services the consequence of which is that they are extremely difficult to procure indeed they are not to be got and we are under the necessity of substituting in their place a number of men from the respective regiments whose service by that means is entirely lost in the proper line of their duty and but little benefit rendered to the sick the officers i have talked with upon the subject all agree that they should be allowed a dollar per week and that for less they cannot be had our sick are extremely numerous and we find their removal attended with the greatest difficulty it is a matter that employs much of our time and care and what makes it more distressing is the want of proper and convenient places for their reception i fear their sufferings will be great and many however nothing on my part that humanity or policy can require shall be wanting to make them comfortable so far as the state of things will admit i have the honor to be c   0  robert h harrison    september      to the president of congress headquarters at colonel morriss house    september       sir on saturday about sunset six more of the enemys ships one or two of which were menofwar passed between governors island and red hook and went up the east river to the station taken by those mentioned in my last in half an hour i received two expresses one from colonel sargent at horns hook hell gate giving an account that the enemy to the amount of three or four thousand had marched to the river and were embarked for barn or montresors island where numbers of them were then encamped the other from general mifflin that uncommon and formidable movements were discovered among the enemy which being confirmed by the scouts i had sent out i proceeded to haerlem where it was supposed or at morrisania opposite to it the principal attempt to land would be made however nothing remarkable happened that night but in the morning they began their operations three ships of war came up the north river as high as bloomingdale which put a total stop to the removal by water of any more of our provision and about eleven oclock  0  those in the east river began a most severe and heavy cannonade to scour the grounds and cover the landing of their troops between turtle bay and the city where breastworks had been thrown up to oppose them  as soon as i heard the firing i rode with all possible despatch towards the place of landing when to my great surprise and mortification i found the troops that had been posted in the lines retreating with the utmost precipitation and those ordered to support them parsonss and fellowss brigades flying in ever direction and in the greatest confusion notwithstanding the exertions of their generals to form them i used every means in my power to rally and get them into some order but my attempts were fruitless and ineffectual and on an appearance of a small party of the enemy not more than sixty or seventy their disorder increased and they ran away in the greatest confusion without firing a single shot   0  finding that no confidence was to be placed in these brigades and apprehending that another party of the enemy might pass over to haerlem plains and cut off the retreat to this place i sent orders to secure the heights in the best manner with the troops that were stationed on and near them which being done the retreat was effected with but little or no loss of men though of a considerable part of our baggage occasioned by this disgraceful and dastardly conduct   0  most of our heavy cannon and a part of our stores and provisions which we were about removing were unavoidably left in the city though every means after it had been determined in council to evacuate the post had been used to prevent it we are now encamped with the main body of the army on the heights of haerlem where i should hope the enemy would meet with a defeat in case of an attack if the generality of our troops would behave with tolerable bravery but experience to my extreme affliction has convinced me that this is rather to be wished for than expected however i trust that there are many who will act like men and show themselves worthy of the blessings of freedom i have sent out some reconnoitring parties to gain intelligence if possible of the disposition of the enemy and shall inform congress of every material event by the earliest opportunity i have the honor to be c robert h harrison sir the above letter is merely a copy of a rough one sketched out by his excellency this morning and who intended to sign it but having rode out and his return or where to find him uncertain i have sent it away without and have the honor c robert h harrison    0 george washington    september      governor cooke to governor cooke headquarters colonel morriss house    september      sir i received the honor of your favor of the  th inst by messrs collins babcock and stanton and should have acknowledged it before now had i not been prevented by the peculiar situation of our affairs i communicated my sentiments to those gentlemen upon the subject of your letter and the several propositions that were before us who i doubt not will make a full and due report of the same to you and your honorable assembly however i shall take the liberty of adding that the divided state of our army which when collected in one body is inferior to that of the enemy and that their having landed almost the whole of their force on long island and formed a plan of cutting off all communication between that and the city of new york which we had but too good reason to believe practicable and easy to effect with their ships of war made it necessary and prudent to withdraw our troops from the former that our chance of resistance and opposition might be more probable and likely to be attended with a happy issue i feel myself much concerned on account of your apprehensions for the town of newport and the island of rhode island and should esteem myself peculiarly happy were it in my power to afford means for their security and that of the state in general     or to point out such measures as would be effectual for that purpose but circumstanced as i am it is not possible for me to grant any assistance nor can i with propriety undertake to prescribe the mode which will best promote their defence this must depend on such a variety of circumstances that i should suppose you and the assembly who are in the state will be much more competent to the task than i or any person out of it can be and therefore i can only recommend that you will pursue such steps as you in your judgment shall think most conducive to that end observing that it appears to me a matter of extreme difficulty if practicable to prevent the enemys ships from doing damage to every island accessible to them unless the passes between them and the main are so narrow as to oblige them to come very near such batteries as may be erected for their annoyance on commanding ground i cannot sufficiently express my thanks for the readiness you and your assembly manifested in ordering troops c to long island on hearing of my request to governor trumbull upon that subject at the time that i made it i conceived the plan of much importance and that many valuable and salutary consequences might have resulted from it but as things have undergone a material change since it may not be improper to consider and be satisfied of some facts which ought to be clearly known previous to any attempt to carry it into execution and on which success of it will greatly depend such as an     intire conviction of the friendly disposition of the island the number that would join the troops that might be sent over the lengths they would go the support they would and can give and whether a retreat from thence could be safely effected in case it should be necessary these matters and others which a more minute consideration of the plan will present to your view should be well weighed and digested and which i thought it my duty to mention especially as the scheme had originated with me my anxiety and concern for the inhabitants of the east end of long island who have been represented always as friendly and well attached to the cause of the states prompt me to wish them every assistance but if the efforts you could make in conjunction with governor trumbull would not promise almost a certainty of success perhaps they might tend to aggravate their misfortunes the committee stated sundry propositions respecting this expedition such as if any thing was attempted where a stand should be made this must be left to the discretion of those who command nor can i spare an officer for that purpose nor recommend one what number of men should be sent and what proportion from the massachusetts the number necessary will depend upon the force they will have to oppose and the assistance they would derive from the islanders the proportion from the massachusetts on the will of the legislature or voluntary engagement of the people in the service what artillery they should have i am of     opinion the artillery would be subject to loss without any great advantage resulting from it they also asked whether any frigates should be sent c as the enemy have now the free and intire command of the sound and many shipsofwar in it they will be much more liable to be taken than they would have been some time ago and when it was proposed by governor trumbull to make an attempt upon the ships above hellgate in this instance however i do not conceive myself at liberty to say any thing peremptory one way or the other having no power over the frigates i am sensible of the force of your observation that the common cause might be benefitted by the several states receiving early and authentic intelligence of every material occurrence permit me at the same time to assure you that i often regret my incapacity in this instance and that the neglect does not arise from want of inclination or thro inattention but from the variety of important matters that are always pressing upon and which daily surround me before i conclude i shall take this opportunity to inform you that having received certain information that the enemys plan was to pass from long island and land in the country and for which they are making every possible disposition a council of general officers determined last week on a removal of the army from the city in order to prevent the fatal consequences which must inevitably ensue if they could have executed their scheme resolving at the same time that every appearance of defence     should be kept up till our sick ordnance and stores could be removed this was set about with the greatest industry and as to the sick was compleatly effected but on sunday morning   th before we had accomplished the removal of all our cannon provision and baggage they sent three ships of war up the north river whereby the water carriage was totally stopped    i am now encamped on the heights above mentioned which are so well calculated for defence that i should hope if the enemy make an attack and our men will behave with tolerable resolution they must meet with a repulse if not a total defeat they advanced in sight yesterday in several large bodies but attempted nothing of a general nature tho in the fore noon there were some smart skirmishes between some of their parties and detachments sent out by me in which i have the pleasure to inform you our men behaved with bravery and intrepidity putting them to flight when in open ground and forcing them from posts they had seized two or three times from some of wounded men which fell into our hands the appearance of blood in every place where they made their stand and on the fences as they passed we have reason to believe they had a good many killed and wounded tho they did not leave many on the ground in number our loss was very inconsiderable but in the fall of lieut colo knowlton i consider it as great being a brave and good officer and it may be increased by the death of major leitch of the virginia regiment who unfortunately     received three balls thro his sideâ€”having given you a summary account of the situation of our affairs and in such manner as circumstances will admit of i have only to add that i have the honor c p s the committee have expressed their apprehensions of being obliged to abandon the island of rhode island and newport and requested my opinion at present i can see no cause for it and the propriety of the measure must depend upon circumstances but i should suppose they ought to be very pressing and the necessity great before they ought to be given upâ€”most certainly no imaginary ills or necessity should lead to such a measure at this time the danger can only be ideal and if the enemy persevere in their plans and our men behave as they should do i am persuaded they will not have an opportunity to employ their attention elsewhere this campaign      george washington    september      to the president of congress headquarters at col morriss house    september      sir as my letter of the   th contained intelligence of an important nature and such as might lead congress to expect that the evacuation of new york and retreat to the heights of haerlem in the manner they were made would be succeeded by some other interesting event i beg leave to inform them that as yet nothing has been attempted upon a large and general plan of attack about the time of the posts departure with my letter the enemy appeared in several large bodies upon the plains about two and a half miles from hence i rode down to our advanced posts to put matters in a proper situation if they should attempt to come on when i arrived there i heard a firing which i was informed was between a party of our rangers under the command of lieutenantcolonel knowlton and an advanced party of the enemy our men came in and told me that the body of the enemy who kept themselves concealed consisted of about three hundred as near as they could guess i immediately ordered three companies of colonel weedons regiment from virginia under the command of major leitch and colonel knowlton with his rangers composed of volunteers from different newengland regiments to try to get in their rear     while a disposition was making as if to attack them in front and thereby draw their whole attention that way this took effect as i wished on the part of the enemy on the appearance of our party in front they immediately ran down the hill took possession of some fences and bushes and a smart firing began but at too great a distance to do much execution on either side the parties under colonel knowlton and major leitch unluckily began their attack too soon as it was rather in flank than in rear in a little time major leitch was brought off wounded having received three balls through his side and in a short time after colonel knowlton got a wound which proved mortal the men however persevered and continued the engagement with the greatest resolution finding that they wanted a support i advanced part of colonel griffiths and colonel richardsons maryland regiments with some detachments from the eastern regiments who were nearest the place of action these troops charged the enemy with great intrepidity and drove them from the wood into the plain and were pushing them from thence having silenced their fire in a great measure when i judged it prudent to order a retreat fearing the enemy as i have since found was really the case were sending a large body to support their party major leitch i am in hopes will recover but colonel knowltons fall is much to be regretted as that of a brave and good officer we had about forty wounded the number of slain is not yet ascertained     but it is very inconsiderable by a sergeant who deserted from the enemy and came in this morning i find that their party was greater than i imagined it consisted of the second battalion of light infantry a battalion of the royal highlanders and three companies of hessian riflemen under the command of brigadiergeneral leslie the deserter reports that their loss in wounded and missing was eightynine and eight killed in the latter his account is too small as our people discovered and buried double that number this affair i am in hopes will be attended with many salutary consequences as it seems to have greatly inspirited the whole of our troops  the sergeant further adds that a considerable body of men are now encamped from the east to the north rivers between the seventh and eighth mile stones under the command of general clinton general howe he believes has his quarters at mr apthorps house i have c      p s i should have wrote congress by express before now had i not expected the post every minute which i flatter myself will be a sufficient apology for my delaying it the late losses we have sustained in our baggage and camp necessaries have added much to our distress which was very great before i must therefore take the liberty of requesting congress to have forwarded as soon as possible such a supply of tents blankets kettles and other articles as can be collected we cannot be overstocked    0 george washington  0 september      to the president of congress headquarters heights of harlem  0 september      sir i have been honored with your favor of the   th with its inclosures to prevent the injury and abuses which would arise from the militia and other troops carrying away ammunition and continental property i have published the substance of the resolves upon the subject in general orders since my letter of yesterday nothing of importance has cast up the enemy are forming a large and extensive encampment in the plains mentioned in my last and are busily employed in transporting their cannon and stores from long island as they advance them this way we may reasonably expect their operations will not long be deferred    genls howe  and erskines proclamations shew     the measures that have been pursued to force  seduce the inhabitants of long island from their allegiance to the states and to assist in their destruction as the period will soon arrive when the troops composing the present army a few excepted will be disbanded according to the tenor of their enlistments and the most fatal consequences may ensue if a suitable and timely provision is not made in this instance i take the liberty of suggesting to congress not only the expediency but the absolute necessity there is that their earliest attention should be had to this subject in respect to the time that troops should be engaged for i have frequently given my sentiments nor have i omitted to express my opinion of     the difficulties that will attend raising them nor of the impracticability of effecting it without the allowance of a large and extraordinary bounty it is a melancholy and painful consideration to those who are concerned in the work and have the command to be forming armies constantly and to be left by troops just when they begin to deserve the name or perhaps at a moment when an important blow is expected this i am well informed will be the case at ticonderoga with part of the troops there unless some system is immediately come into by which they can be induced to stay genl schuyler tells me in a letter received yesterday that dehaas maxwells and wines regimts stand engaged only till the beginning of next month and that the men he is fearfull will not remain longer than the time of their inlistments i would also beg leave to mention to congress that the season is fast approaching when cloaths of every kind will be wanted for the army their distress is already great and will be encreased as the weather becomes more severe our situation is now bad but is much better than the militia that are coming to join us from the states of massachusetts bay and connecticut in consequence of the requisition of congress they i am informed have not a single tent nor a necessary of any kind nor can i conceive how it will be possible to support them these circumstances are extremely alarming and oblige me to wish congress to have all the tents cloathing of every kind and camp     necessaries provided and forwarded that are to be procured these eastern reinforcements have not a single necessary not a pan or a kettle in which we are now greatly deficient it is with reluctance that i trouble congress with these matters but to whom can i resort for relief unless to them the necessity therefore which urges the application will excuse it i am persuaded i have not been able to transmit congress a general return of the army this week owing to the peculiar situation of our affairs and the great shifting and changing among the troops as soon as i can procure one a copy shall be forwarded to congress i have c p s sept   st      things with us remain in the situation they were yesterday      george washington    september      kingsbridge to the president of congress camp near kingsbridge    september      sir i had flattered myself that the congress would before this time have forwarded the amended articles for the government of the army but as they have not i think it my indispensable duty to lay before     them the necessity the absolute necessity of forming an article against plundering marauding and burning of houses such a spirit has gone forth in our army that neither publick or private property is secureâ€”every hour brings the most distressing complaints of the ravages of our own troops who are become infinitely more formidable to the poor farmers and inhabitants than the common enemy horses are taken out off the continental teams the baggage of officers and the hospital stores even the quarters of general officers are not exempt from rapine some severe and exemplary punishment to be inflicted in a summary way must be immediately administered or the army will be totally ruined i must beg the immediate attention of congress to this matter as of the utmost importance to our existence as an army i am c george washington    september      john augustine washington to john augustine washington heights of haerlem    september      dear brother my extream hurry for some time past has rendered it utterly impossible for me to pay that attention to the letters of my friends which inclination and natural affection always inclines me to i have no doubt therefore of meeting with their excuse tho with respect to yourself i have had no letter from you since the date of my last saving the one of septr the  st with respect to the attack and retreat from     long island the public papers would furnish you with accounts nearly true i shall only add that in the former we lost about eight hundred men more than three fourths of which were taken prisoners this misfortune happened in a great measure by two detachments of our people who were posted in two roads leading thro a wood in order to intercept the enemy in their march suffering a surprise and making a precipitate retreat which enabled the enemy to lead a great part of their force against the troops commanded by lord stirling who formed a third detachment who behaved with great bravery and resolution as to the retreat from the island under the circumstances we then were it became absolutely necessary and was effected without loss of men and with but very little baggage a few heavy cannon were left not being movable on account of the ground being soft and miry thro the heavy and incessant rains which had fallen the enemys loss in killed we could never ascertain but have many reasons to believe that it was pretty considerable and exceeded ours a good deal our retreat from thence as i said before was absolutely necessary the enemy having landed the main body of their army to attack us in front while their ships of war were to cut off all communication with the city from whence resources of men and provisions were to be drawn having made this retreat not long after we discovered by the movements of the enemy and the information we received from deserters and others that they declined attacking our lines in the city     and were forming a plan to get in our rear with their land army by crossing the sound above us and thereby to cut off all intercourse with the country and every necessary supply the ships of war were to coÃ¶perate possess the north river and prevent succours from the jerseys c this plan appearing probable and but too practicable in its execution it became necessary to guard agt the fatal consequences that must follow if the scheme were effected for which purpose i caused a removal of a part of our troops and stores from the city and a council of general officers determined that it must be entirely abandoned as we had with an army weaker than theirs a line of sixteen or eighteen miles to defend to keep open our communication with the country besides the defence of the city we held up however every show of defence till our sick and all our stores could be brought away the evacuation being resolved upon every exertion in our power was made to baffle their designs and effect our own the sick were numerous amounting to more than the fourth part of our whole army and an object of great importance happily we got them away but before we could bring off all our stores on sunday morning six or seven ships of war which had gone up the east river some few days before began a most severe and heavy cannonade to scour the grounds and effect a landing of their troops three ships of war also ran up the north river that morning above the city to prevent our boats and small craft from carrying away our baggage c i had gone the evening before to the main body of     our army which was posted about these heights and the plains of haerlem where it seemed probable from the movements and disposition of the enemy they meant to land and make an attack the next morning however the event did not happen immediately on hearing the cannonade i rode with all possible expedition towards the place of landing and where breastworks had been thrown up to secure our men and found the troops that had been posted there to my great surprise and mortification and those ordered to their support consisting of eight regiments notwithstanding the exertions of their generals to form them running away in the most shameful and disgraceful manner i used every possible effort to rally them but to no purpose and on the appearance of a small part of the enemy not more than sixty or seventy they ran off without firing a single gun many of our heavy cannon would inevitably have fallen into the enemys hands as they landed so soon but this scandalous conduct occasioned a loss of many tents baggage and campequipage which would have been easily secured had they made the least opposition the retreat was made with the loss of a few men only we encamped and still are on the heights of haerlem which are well suited for defence against their approaches on monday morning they advanced in sight in several large bodies but attempted nothing of a general nature tho there were smart skirmishes between their advanced parties and some detachments from our lines which i sent out in     these our troops behaved well putting the enemy to flight in open ground and forcing them from posts they had seized two or three times a sergeant who deserted from them says they had as he was told eightynine wounded and missing besides slain but other accounts make the wounded much greater our loss in killed and wounded was about sixty but the greatest loss we sustained was in the death of lieutenantcolonel knowlton a brave and gallant officer major leitch of weedons regiment had three balls though his side and behaved exceedingly well he is in a fair way of recovery nothing material has happened since this the enemy it is said are bringing up their heavy cannon so that we are to expect another attack soon both by land and water as we are upon the hudson or north river at the place where we have attempted to stop the navigation by sinking obstructions in the river and erecting batteries the dependence which the congress have placed upon the militia has already greatly injured and i fear will totally ruin our cause being subject to no controul themselves they introduce disorder among the troops whom you have attempted to discipline while the change in their living brings on sickness this makes them impatient to get home which spreads universally and introduces abominable desertions in short it is not in the power of words to describe the task i have to act fifty thousand pounds should not induce me again to undergo what i have done our numbers by sickness desertion c are greatly   0 reduced  i have been trying these four or five days to get a return but have not yet succeeded i am sure however we have not more than twelve or fourteen thousand men fit for duty whilst the enemy who it is said are very healthy cannot have less than near twentyfive thousand with sincere love to my sister and the family and compliments to any inquiring friends i am c      george washington    september      lieutenantgeneral howe to lieutenantgeneral howe headquarters heights of haerlem    september      sir i yesterday evening received the favor of your letter of the   st by your aiddecamp captain montresor in consequence of which i this morning despatched an express to elizabethtown with orders that majorgeneral prescott should be permitted to return in the boat that carried general sullivan over to that place i most readily concur in the proposition which you are pleased to make for the exchange of brigadiergeneral lord stirling for governor montfort brown and have sent for him accordingly i should hope that lord stirling will be immediately set at liberty on my promise that governor brown shall be sent to you as soon as he arrives i had no     doubt but mr mcdonalds title would have been acknowledged having understood that he received his commission from the hands of governor martin nor can i consent to rank him as major till i have proper authority from congress to whom i shall state the matter upon your representation  agreeably to your request i shall transmit to lieutenantcolonel campbell a copy of the list of officers of the fortysecond and seventyfirst regiments taken by us last spring that it may be rectified in the instances in which it may be wrong and will then place opposite to their names the officers i would wish in return for them the exchange of privates i shall take the earliest opportunity in my power to carry into execution but their being greatly dispersed through the new england governments in order to their better accommodation will prevent it for some time having the fullest confidence in your assurance that mr lovell will be released when he arrives from halifax i have written for governor skene to come to headquarters that he may proceed immediately to you as to the exchange of prisoners settled between captain foster and general arnold i beg leave to inform you that it was a transaction in which i had not the smallest concern nor have i authority to give directions in any degree respecting the matter the information you have received concerning the illtreatment     of your officers i would fain hope is not generally well founded  the letters from them which have passed through my hands hold forth a different language in particular instances it is true there are some who have been restricted to a closer confinement and severer treatment than they otherwise would have been for breaking or refusing to give their paroles such i am confident will not be countenanced by your excellency and i am persuaded that by a closer investigation of the enquiry you will discover that there have been no other persons whatever who have experienced the smallest harshness from us i shall however obtain all the information on the subject in my power that every ground of complaint if any exists may be entirely removed it being my most earnest wish that during this unhappy contest there be every exercise of humanity which the nature of the case will possibly admit      your aiddecamp delivered to me the ball you mention which was the first of the kind i ever saw or heard of you may depend the contrivance is highly abhorred by me and every measure shall be taken to prevent so wicked and infamous a practice being adopted in this army i have the honor to be c  george washington    september      governor trumbull to governor trumbull headquarters heights of haerlem    september      sir       i must beg your excuse for not having wrote you of late upon the situation of our affairs and such events as have occurred in the military line i shall only add that the important concerns which have commanded my closest attention have been the     cause and i am fully persuaded will furnish me with a sufficient apology of the evacuation of the city of new york on sunday sennight and the retreat to this place you will have heard before now and of the manner in which it was conducted i am certain a minute relation of them would only increase the uneasiness which would naturally arise upon hearing the events and therefore as i have not time i shall not enter upon it the enemy by their movements having unfolded their plan of operations and discovered that they declined making a direct attack upon the town and that their designs were to land in our rear and cut off all intercourse with the country at the same time to prevent any communication with the jersey and states south of the north river by means of their ships of war it became necessary to adopt such     measures as seemed best calculated to baffle their schemes and promote the common interests to these ends a council of officers determined the evacuation of the city absolutely necessary and i have only to wish that it had been made in a way more honorable and with less loss of baggage which might have been the case had the troops that remained there for the defence of the lines not betaken themselves to a most precipitate and disgraceful flight contrary to the exertions of their general officers and every effort in my power to prevent and form them having gone from hence as soon as the ships began their cannonade and whither i had come the night before to the main body of our army in expectation of an attack that night or the next morning as the parade of the enemy and the unusual stir amongst them strongly indicated one the next morning several large columns of them appeared on the plains at the distance of about two miles and a half below us and some smart skirmishes ensued between their advanced parties composed of the  d battalion of infantry a regiment of royal highlanders and three companies of the hessian chasseurs or rifle men and the detachments which i sent out to oppose them upon this occasion our men behaved with great spirit and intrepidity putting the enemy to flight and forcing them from their posts two or three times our people buried sixteen or eighteen of their dead as they say and a sergeant who has since deserted reports they had eighty nine missing and wounded our loss in     number is inconsiderable but must be considered as great in the fall of lieut colo knowlton of your state who commanded a party of rangers composed of volunteers from the several new england regiments and who was a brave and good officer every honor was paid to his merit in his interment that the situation of things would admit of the enemy have formed a large encampment in the plains or rather heights below us extending across as it were from the east to the north river but have attempted nothing as yet of a general nature we are making every disposition in our power for defence and i should hope from the ground we are on if they make an attack and our men behave with tolerable resolution and firmness that they will meet with a repulse or at least any advantage they gain will be attended with sorrow and a considerable loss major leitch who led on a detachment of the virginia regiment in the affair of monday received three balls through one side he still retains his spirits and seems as if he would recover  on friday night about eleven or twelve oclock a fire broke out in the city of new york which burning rapidly till after sunrise next morning destroyed a great number of houses by what means it happened we do not know but the gentleman who brought the letter from general howe last night and who was one of his aidedecamps informed colonel reed that several of our countrymen had been punished with various deaths on account of it some     by hanging others by burning c alleging that they were apprehended when committing the fact i am c p s i would choose that governors brown  skene should be stopt when they come within ten or twelve miles and detained until one of the escort can inform me of their coming and receive my directions respecting them george washington    september      to the president of congress  colo morriss on the heights of haerlem    september      sir from the hours allotted to sleep i will borrow a few moments to convey my thoughts on sundry important matters to congress i shall offer them with     the sincerity which ought to characterize a man of candor and with the freedom which may be used in giving useful information without incurring the imputation of presumption we are now as it were upon the eve of another dissolution of our army  the remembrance of the difficulties which happened upon that occasion last year and the consequences which might have followed the change if proper advantages had been taken by the enemy added to a knowledge of the present temper and situation of the troops reflect but a very gloomy prospect in the appearances of things now and satisfy me beyond the possibility of doubt that unless some speedy and effectual measures are adopted by congress our cause will be lost it is in vain to expect that any more than a trifling part of this army will again engage in the service on the encouragement offered by congress when men find that their townsmen and companions are receiving twenty thirty and more dollars for a few months service which is truly the case it cannot be expected without using compulsion and to force them into the service would answer no valuable purpose   0 when men are irritated and their passions inflamed they fly hastily and cheerfully to arms but after the first emotions are over to expect among such people as compose the bulk of an army that they are influenced by any other principles than those of interest is to look for what never did and i fear never will happen the congress will deceive themselves therefore if they expect it a soldier reasoned with upon the goodness of the cause he is engaged in and the inestimable rights he is contending for hears you with patience and acknowledges the truth of your observations but adds that it is of no more importance to him than to others the officer makes you the same reply with this further remark that his pay will not support him and he cannot ruin himself and family to serve his country when every member of the community is equally interested and benefitted by his labors the few therefore who act upon principles of disinterestedness comparatively speaking are no more than a drop in the ocean it becomes evident to me then that as this contest is not likely to be the work of a day as the war must be carried on systematically and to do it you must have good officers there are in my judgment no other possible means to obtain them but by establishing your army upon a permanent footing and giving your officers good pay this will induce gentlemen and men of character to engage and till the bulk of your officers is composed of such persons as are actuated by principles of honor and a spirit of enterprise you have little to expect from them     they ought to have such allowances as will enable them to live like and support the character of gentlemen and not be driven by a scanty pittance to the low and dirty arts which many of them practise to filch from the public more than the difference of pay would amount to upon an ample allowance besides something is due to the man who puts his life in your hands hazards his health and forsakes the sweets of domestic enjoyment why a captain in the continental service should receive no more than five shillings currency per day for performing the same duties that an officer of the same rank in the british service receives ten shillings for i never could conceive especially when the latter is provided with every necessary he requires upon the best terms and the former can scarce procure them at any rate there is nothing that gives a man consequence and renders him fit for command like a support that renders him independent of every body but the state he serves  with respect to the men nothing but a good bounty can obtain them upon a permanent establishment and for no shorter time than the continuance of the war ought they to be engaged as facts incontestably     prove that the difficulty and cost of enlistments increase with time when the army was first raised at cambridge i am persuaded the men might have been got without a bounty for the war after this they began to see that the contest was not likely to end so speedily as was imagined and to feel their consequence by remarking that to get in their militia in the course of the last year many towns were induced to give them a bounty foreseeing the evils resulting from this and the destructive consequences which unavoidably would follow short enlistments i took the liberty in a long letter written by myself date not now recollected as my letter book is not here  to recommend the enlistments for and during the war assigning such reasons for it as experience has since convinced me were well founded at that time twenty dollars would i am persuaded have engaged the men for this term but it will not do to look back and if the present opportunity is slipped i am persuaded that twelve months more will increase our difficulties fourfold i shall therefore take the freedom of giving it as my opinion that a good bounty should be immediately offered aided by the proffer of at least a hundred or a hundred and fifty acres of land and a suit of clothes and blanket to each noncomissioned officer and soldier as i have good authority for saying that however high the mens pay may appear it is barely sufficient in the present scarcity and dearness of all kinds of goods to keep them in clothes much less afford support to their families     if this encouragement then is given to the men and such pay allowed the officers as will induce gentlemen of character and liberal sentiments to engage and proper care and precaution are used in the nomination having more regard to the characters of persons than to the number of men they can enlist we should in a little time have an army able to cope with any that can be opposed to it as there are excellent materials to form one out of but while the only merit an officer possesses is his ability to raise men while those men consider and treat him as an equal and in the character of an officer regard him no more than a broomstick being mixed together as one common herd no order nor discipline can prevail nor will the officer ever meet with that respect which is essentially necessary to due subordination  to place any dependence upon militia is assuredly resting upon a broken staff men just dragged from the tender scenes of domestic life unaccustomed to the din of arms totally unacquainted with every kind of military skill which being followed by want of confidence in themselves when opposed to troops regularly trained disciplined and appointed superior in knowledge and superior in arms makes them timid and ready to fly from their own shadows besides the sudden change in their manner of living     particularly in the lodging brings on sickness in many impatience in all and such an unconquerable desire of returning to their respective homes that it not only produces shameful and scandalous desertions among themselves but infuses the like spirit in others again men accustomed to unbounded freedom and no control cannot brooke the restraint which is indispensably necessary to the good order and government of an army without which licentiousness and every kind of disorder triumphantly reign to bring men to a proper degree of subordination is not the work of a day a month or even a year and unhappily for us and the cause we are engaged in the little discipline i have been laboring to establish in the army under my immediate command is in a manner done away by having such a mixture of troops as have been called together within these few months relaxed and as unfit as our rules and regulations of war are for the government of an army the militia those properly so called for of these we have two sorts the sixmonths men and those sent in as a temporary aid do not think themselves subject to them and therefore take liberties which the soldier is punished for this creates jealousy jealousy begets dissatisfaction and these by degrees ripen into mutiny keeping the whole army in a confused and disordered state rendering the time of those who wish to see regularity and good order prevail more unhappy than words can describe besides this such repeated changes take place that all     arrangement is set at nought and the constant fluctuation of things deranges every plan as fast as adopted these sir congress may be assured are but a small part of the inconveniences which might be enumerated and attributed to militia but there is one that merits particular attention and that is the expense certain i am that it would be cheaper to keep fifty or a hundred thousand in constant pay than to depend upon half the number and supply the other half occasionally by militia the time the latter are in pay before and after they are in camp assembling and marching the waste of ammunition the consumption of stores which in spite of every resolution or requisition of congress they must be furnished with or sent home added to other incidental expenses consequent upon their coming and conduct in camp surpasses all idea and destroys every kind of regularity and economy which you could establish among fixed and settled troops and will in my opinion prove if the scheme is adhered to the ruin of our cause the jealousy of a standing army and the evils to be apprehended from one are remote and in my judgment situated and circumstanced as we are not at all to be dreaded but the consequence of wanting one according to my ideas formed from the present view of things is certain and inevitable ruin for if i was called upon to declare upon oath whether the militia have been most serviceable or hurtful upon the whole i should subscribe to the latter i     do not mean by this however to arraign the conduct of congress in so doing i should equally condemn my own measures if i did not my judgment but experience which is the best criterion to work by so fully clearly and decisively reprobates the practice of trusting to militia that no man who regards order regularity and economy or who has any regard for his own honor character or peace of mind will risk them upon this issue  no less attention should be paid to the choice of surgeons than of other officers of the army they should undergo a regular examination and if not appointed by the directorgeneral and surgeons of the hospital they ought to be subordiate to and governed by his directions the regimental surgeons i     am speaking of many of whom are very great rascals countenancing the men in sham complaints to exempt them from duty and often receiving bribes to certify indispositions with a view to procure discharges or furloughs but independent of these practices while they are considered as unconnected with the general hospital there will be nothing but continual complaints of each other the director of the hospital charging them with enormity in their drafts for the sick and they him with the same for denying such things as are necessary in short there is a constant bickering among them which tends greatly to the injury of the sick and will always subsist till the regimental surgeons are made to look up to the directorgeneral of the hospital as a superior whether this is the case in regular armies or not i cannot undertake to say but certain i am there is a necessity for it in this or the sick will suffer the regimental surgeons are aiming i am persuaded to break up the general hospital and have in numberless instances drawn for medicines and stores in the most profuse and extravagant manner for private purposes  another matter highly worthy of attention is that other rules and regulations may be adopted for the government of the army than those now in existence     otherwise the army but for the name might as well be disbanded for the most atrocious offences one or two instances only excepted a man receives no more than thirtynine lashes and these perhaps through the collusion of the officer who is to see it inflicted are given in such a manner as to become rather a matter of sport than punishment but when inflicted as they ought many hardened fellows who have been the subjects have declared that for a bottle of rum they would undergo a second operation it is evident therefore that this punishment is inadequate to many crimes it is assigned to as a proof of it thirty or forty soldiers will desert at a time and of late a practice prevails as you will see by my letter of the   d of the most alarming nature and which will if it cannot be checked prove fatal both to the country and army i mean the infamous practice of plundering for under the idea of tory property or property that may fall into the hands of the enemy no man is secure in his effects and scarcely in his person in order to get at them we have several instances of people being frightened out of their houses under pretence of those houses being ordered to be burnt and this is done with a view of seizing the goods nay in order that the villany may be more effectually concealed some houses have actually been burnt to cover the theft i have with some others used my utmost endeavors to stop this horrid practice but under the present lust after plunder and want of laws to punish offenders i might almost as well attempt to remove mount atlas     i have ordered instant corporal punishment upon every man who passes our lines or is seen with plunder that the offenders might be punished for disobedience of orders and enclose to you the proceedings of a courtmartial held upon an officer ensign matthew mccumber who with a party of men had robbed a house a little beyond our lines of a number of valuable goods among which to show that nothing escapes were four large pier lookingglasses womens clothes and other articles which one would think could be of no earthly use to him he was met by a major of brigade box who ordered him to return the goods as taken contrary to general orders which he not only peremptorily refused to do but drew up his party and swore he would defend them at the hazard of his life on which i ordered him to be arrested and tried for plundering disobedience of orders and mutiny for the result i refer to the proceedings of the court whose judgment appeared so exceedingly extraordinary  that i ordered a reconsideration of the matter upon which and with the assistance of a fresh evidence they made a shift to cashier him i adduce this instance to give some idea to congress of the current sentiments and general run of the officers which compose the present army and to show how   0 exceedingly necessary it is to be careful in the choice of the new set even if it should take double the time to complete the levies  an army formed of good officers moves like clockwork but there is no situation upon earth less enviable nor more distressing than that persons who is at the head of troops which are regardless of order and discipline and who are unprovided with almost every necessary in a word the difficulties which have for ever surrounded me since i have been in the service and kept my mind constantly upon the stretch the wounds which my feelings as an officer have received by a thousand things which have happened contrary to my expectation and wishes the effect of my own conduct and present appearance of things so little pleasing to myself as to render it a matter of no surprise to me if i should stand capitally censured by congress added to a consciousness of my inability to govern an army composed of such discordant parts and under such a variety of intricate and perplexing circumstancesâ€”induces not only a belief but a thorough conviction in my mind that it will be impossible     unless there is a thorough change in our military system for me to conduct matters in such a manner as to give satisfaction to the public which is all the recompense i aim at or ever wished for before i conclude i must apologize for the liberties taken in this letter and for the blots and scratchings therein not having time to give it more correctly with truth i can add that with every sentiment of respect and esteem i am yours and the congresss most obedient c      george washington    september      brigadiergeneral mercer to brigadiergeneral mercer heights of haerlem    september      dear sir if the troops at this post can be prevailed upon to defend it as they should do it must cost general howe a great many men to carry it if he succeeds at all if this should happen to be his opinion there is scarce a doubt that he will turn his thoughts another way as inactivity is not to be expected from him whither his operations may be directed is uncertain perhaps an irruption into the jerseys possibly he may bend his course towards philadelphia for i conceive that two thousand men with the assistance of their shipping will effectually preserve new york against our whole strength or what in my judgment is exceedingly probable knowing that the troops are drawn     off from the southern colonies he may detach a part of the army to the southward for a winters campaign as was recommended to him last fall by lord dunmore in either of these cases it behoves us to keep the best lookout and to obtain the earliest intelligence possible of the enemys motions and as it is now the current opinion that the shipping are greatly thinned i earnestly recommend to you the necessity of having sensible and judicious persons in different places to observe the movements of the shipping among others at the neversinks for if they should send out a fleet without our giving notice of it to congress we shall be thought exceedingly remiss in short i entreat you to exert your best endeavors to obtain all the useful intelligence you possibly can of the enemys motions by sea and land in doing     this money may be required and do not spare it communicate every thing of importance to me with despatch and be assured that i am c  george washington    september      to the president of congress heights of haerlem    september      sir being about to cross the north river this morning in order to view the post opposite and the grounds between that and paulus hook i shall not add much more than that i have been honored with your favor of the   th and its several enclosures and that since my letter of yesterday no important event has taken place  as colonel hugh stephenson of the rifle regiment lately ordered to be raised is dead according to the information i have received i would beg leave to recommend to the particular notice of congress captain daniel morgan just returned among the prisoners from canada as a fit and proper person to succeed to the vacancy occasioned by his death the     present fieldofficers of the regiment cannot claim any right in preference to him because he ranked above them and as a captain when he first entered the service his conduct as an officer on the expedition with general arnold last fall his intrepid behavior in the assault upon quebec when the brave montgomery fell the inflexible attachment he professed to our cause during his imprisonment and which he perseveres in added to these his residence in the place colonel stephenson came from and his interest and influence in the same circle and with such men as are to compose such a regimentâ€”all in my opinion entitle him to the favor of congress and lead me to believe that in his promotion the states will gain a good valuable officer for the sort of troops he is particularly recommended to command should congress be pleased to appoint captain morgan in the instance i have mentioned i would still beg leave to suggest the propriety and necessity of keeping the matter close and not suffering it to transpire until he is exonerated from the parole he is under his acceptance of a commission under his present circumstances might be construed a violation of his engagement and if not the difficulty attending his exchange might be increased the enemy perhaps would consider him as a fieldofficer of which we have but very few in our hands and none that i recollect of that rank  i am c      george washington  0 september      lund washington to lund washington  col morriss on the heights of harlem  0 september      dear lund your letter of the   th which is the only one received and unanswered now lies before me the amazement which you seem to be in at the unaccountable measures which have been adopted by â€”  would be a good deal increased if i had time to unfold the whole system of their management since this time twelve months i do not know how to account for the unfortunate steps which have been taken but from that fatal idea of conciliation which prevailed so longâ€”fatal i call it because from my soul i wish it may prove so though my fears lead me to think there is too much danger of it this time last year i pointed out the evil consequences of short enlistments the expenses of militia and the little dependence     that was to be placed in them i assured congress that the longer they delayed raising a standing army the more difficult and chargeable would they find it to get one and that at the same time that the militia would answer no valuable purpose the frequent calling them in would be attended with an expense that they could have no conception of  whether as i have said before the unfortunate hope of reconciliation was the cause or the fear of a standing army prevailed i will not undertake to say but the policy was to engage men for twelve months only the consequence of which you have had great bodies of militia in pay that never were in camp you have had immense quantities of provisions drawn by men that never rendered you one hours service at least usefully and this in the most profuse and wasteful way your stores have been expended and every kind of military discipline destroyed by them your numbers fluctuating uncertain and forever far short of reportâ€”at no one time i believe equal to twenty thousand men fit for duty at present our numbers fit for duty by this days report amount to       besides      on command and the enemy within stones throw of us it is true a body of militia are again ordered out but they come without any conveniences and soon return i     discharged a regiment the other day that had in it fourteen rank and file fit for duty only and several that had less than fifty in short such is my situation that if i were to wish the bitterest curse to an enemy on this side of the grave i should put him in my stead with my feelings and yet i do not know what plan of conduct to pursue i see the impossibility of serving with reputation or doing any essential service to the cause by continuing in command and yet i am told that if i quit the command inevitable ruin will follow from the distraction that will ensue in confidence i tell you that i never was in such an unhappy divided state since i was born to lose all comfort and happiness on the one hand whilst i am fully persuaded that under such a system of management as has been adopted i cannot have the least chance for reputation nor those allowances made which the nature of the case requires and to be told on the other that if i leave the service all will be lost is at the same time that i am bereft of every peaceful moment distressing to a degree but i will be done with the subject with the precaution to you that it is not a fit one to be publicly known or discussed if i fall it may not be amiss that these circumstances be known and declaration made in credit to the justice of my character and if the men will stand by me which by the by i despair of i am resolved not to be forced from this ground while i have life and a few days will determine the point if the enemy should not change their plan of operations for they certainly will notâ€”i am     sure they ought notâ€”to waste the season that is now fast advancing and must be precious to them i thought to have given you a more explicit account of my situation expectation and feelings but i have not time i am wearied to death all day with a variety of perplexing circumstancesâ€”disturbed at the conduct of the militia whose behavior and want of discipline has done great injury to the other troops who never had officers except in a few instances worth the bread they eat my time in short is so much engrossed that i have not leisure for corresponding unless it is on mere matters of public business i therefore in answer to your last letter of the   th shall say with respect to the chimney i would not have you for the sake of a little work spoil the look of the fireplaces tho that in the parlor must i should think stand as it does not so much on account of the wainscotting which i think must be altered on account of the door leading into the new building as on account of the chimney piece and the manner of its fronting into the room the chimney in the room above ought if it could be so contrived to be an angle chimney as the others are but i would not have this attempted at the expence of pulling down the partitionâ€”the chimney in the new room should be exactly in the middle of itâ€”the doors and every thing else to be exactly answerable and uniformâ€”in short i would have the whole executed in a masterly manner   0 you ought surely to have a window in the gable end of the new cellar either under the venitian window or one on each side of it let mr herbert know that i shall be very happy in getting his brother exchanged as soon as possible but as the enemy have more of our officers than we of theirs and some of ours have been long confined and claim ye right of being first exchanged i do not know how far it may be in my power at this time to comply with his desires remember me to all our neighbors and friends particularly to colo mason to whom i would write if i had time to do it fully and satisfactorily without this i think the correspondence on my part would be unavailingâ€” i am with truth and sincerity dr lund yr affecte friend      george washington   october      to the president of congress heights of haerlem   october      sir i do myself the honor of transmitting to you the enclosed letter from lieutenantcolonel livingston with sundry copies of general delanceys orders which discover the measures the enemy are pursuing on long island for raising recruits and obtaining supplies of provisions in consequence of the intelligence they contain and authentic advices through other channels respecting these matters i have sent brigadiergeneral george clinton to meet general     lincoln who has got as far as fairfield with part of the troops lately ordered by the massachusetts assembly to concert with him and others an expedition across the sound with these troops three companies under colonel livingston  and such further aid as governor trumbull can afford in order to prevent if possible their effecting these important objects and to assist the inhabitants in the removal of their stock grain c or in destroying them that the enemy may not derive any advantage or benefit from them      the recruiting scheme they are prosecuting with uncommon industry nor is it confined to long island alone having just now received a letter from the committee of westchester county advising that there are several companies of men in that and duchess county preparing to go off and join the kings army i have given directions to our guardboats and the sentries at our works at mount washington to keep a strict lookout in case they attempt to come down the north river also to general heath at kingsbridge that the utmost vigilance may be observed by the regiments and troops stationed above there and down towards the east river that they may intercept them should they take that route with a view of crossing to long island i will use every precaution in my power to prevent these parricides from accomplishing their designs but i have but little hope of success as it will be no difficult matter for them to procure a passage over some part or other of the sound i have been applied to lately by colo weedon of virginia for permission to recruit the deficiency of men in his regiments out of the troops composing     the flying camp informing me at the same time that some of those from maryland had offered to engage colo hand of the rifle batallion made a similar application today if the inlistments could be made they would have this good consequence the securing of so many in the service however as the measure might occasion some uneasiness in their own corps and be considered as a hardship by the states to which they belong and the means of their furnishing more than the quota exacted from them in the general arrangement and would make it more difficult for em to compleat their own levies i did not consider myself at liberty to authorize it without submitting the propriety of it to the consideration of congress and obtaining their opinion whether it should be allowed or not    by a letter just received from the committee of safety of the state of new hampshire i find a thousand of their militia were about to march on the   th ulto to reinforce this army in consequence of the requisition of congress previous to their march genl ward writes me he was obliged to furnish them with  00 lbs of powder and  000 lbs of musket ball and i have little reason to expect that they are better provided with other articles than they were with ammunition in such case they will only add to our present distress which is already far too great  become disgusted with the service tho the time they are engaged for is only till the first of decemrâ€”this will injure their inlisting for a longer term if not wholly prevent it     from three deserters who came from the galatea man of war about five days ago we are informed that several transports had sailed before they left her for england as it was generally reported in order to return with a supply of provisions of which they say there is a want genl mercer in a letter informed me that genl thompson said he had heard they were going to dismiss about a hundred of the ships from the serviceâ€”i am also advised by a letter from mr derby at boston of the   th ulto that the day before a transport had been taken and sent into piscatawa by a privateer in her passage from n york to the west indiesâ€”she sailed with five more under the convoy of a man of war in order to bring from thence the troops that are there to join genl howeâ€”they were all victualled for four months from this intelligence it would seem as if they did not apprehend anything to be meditating against them by the court of france octr the  d i have nothing in particular to communicate respecting our situation it being much the same as when i wrote last we had an alarm this morning a little before four oclock from some of our out sentries who reported that a large body of the enemy was advancing towards our linesâ€”this put us in motion however it turned out entirely prematureâ€”or at least we saw nothing of them      george washington   october      to the president of congress heights of haerlem   october      sir before i knew of the late resolutions of congress which you did me the honor to enclose in your letter of the   th and before i was favored with the visit of your committee i took the liberty of giving you my sentiments on several points which seemed to be of importance i have no doubt that the committee will make such a report of the state and condition of the army as will induce congress to believe that nothing but the most vigorous exertions can put matters upon such a footing as to give this continent a fair prospect of success give me leave to say sir i say it with due deference and respect and my knowledge of the facts added to the importance of the cause and the stake i hold in it must justify the freedom that your affairs are in a more unpromising way than you seem to apprehend your army as i mentioned in my last is upon the eve of its political dissolution true it is you have voted a larger one in lieu of it but the season is late and there is a material difference between voting of battalions and raising of men in the latter there are more difficulties than congress are aware of which makes it my duty as i have been informed of the prevailing sentiment of this army to inform them that unless the pay of the officers especially that of the fieldofficers is raised the chief part of those that are worth retaining will leave the service at the expiration of the present term as the soldiers     will also if some greater encouragement is not offered them than twenty dollars and one hundred acres of land nothing less in my opinion than a suit of clothes annually given to each noncommissioned officer and soldier in addition to the pay and bounty will avail and i question whether that will do as the enemy from the information of one john marsh who with six others was taken by our guards are giving ten pounds bounty for recruits and have got a battalion under major rogers nearly completed upon long island nor will less pay according to my judgment than i have taken the liberty of mentioning in the enclosed estimate retain such officers as we could wish to have continued the difference per month in each battalion will amount to better than a hundred pounds to this may be added the pay of the staffofficers for it is presumable they will also require an augmentation but being few in number the sum will not be greatly increased by them and consequently is a matter of no great moment but it is a matter of no small importance to make the several offices desirable when the pay and establishment of an officer once become objects of interested attention the sloth negligence and even disobedience of orders which at this time but too generally prevail will be purged off but while the service is viewed with indifference while the officer conceives that he is rather conferring than receiving an obligation there will be a total relaxation of all order and discipline and every thing will move heavily on to the great     detriment of the service and inexpressible trouble and vexation of the general the critical situation of our affairs at this time will justify my saying that no time is to be lost in making fruitless experiments an unavailing trial of a month to get an army upon the terms proposed may render it impracticable to do it at all and prove fatal to our cause as i am not sure whether any rubs in the way of our enlistments or unfavorable turn in our affairs may not prove the means of the enemys recruiting men faster than we do to this may be added the inextricable difficulty of forming one corps out of another and arranging matters with any degree of order in the face of an enemy who are watching for advantages at cambridge last year where the officers and more than a sufficiency of them were all upon the spot we found it a work of such extreme difficulty to know their sentiments each having some terms to propose that i once despaired of getting the arrangements completed and i do suppose that at least a hundred alterations took place before matters were finally adjusted what must it be then under the present regulation where the officers are to negotiate this matter with the state he comes from distant perhaps two or three hundred miles some of whom without leave or license from me set out to make personal application the moment the resolve got to their hands what kind of officers these are i leave congress to judge if an officer of reputation for none other should be applied to is asked to stay what answer can he give but in the first place that     he does not know whether it is at his option to do so no provision being made in the resolution of congress even commendatory of this measure consequently that it rests with the state he comes from surrounded perhaps with a variety of applications and influenced probably by local attachments to determine whether he can be provided for or not in the next place if he is an officer of merit and knows that the state he comes from is to furnish more battalions than it at present has in the service he will scarcely after two years faithful services think of continuing in the rank he now bears when new creations are to be made and men appointed to office no ways superior in merit and ignorant perhaps of service over his head a committee sent to the army from each state may upon the spot fix things with a degree of propriety and certainty and it is the only method i can see of bringing matters to a decision with respect to the officers of the army but what can be done in the mean while towards the arrangement in the country i know not in the one case you run the hazard of losing your officers in the other of encountering delay unless some method could be devised of forwarding both at the same instant upon the present plan i plainly foresee an intervention of time between the old and the new armies which must be filled up with militia if to be had with whom no man who has any regard for his own reputation can undertake to be answerable for consequences i shall also be mistaken in my conjectures   0 if we do not lose the most valuable officers in this army under the present mode of appointing them consequently if we have an army at all it will be composed of materials not only entirely raw but if uncommon pains are not taken entirely unfit and i see such a distrust and jealousy of military power that the commanderinchief has not an opportunity even by recommendation to give the least assurances of reward for the most essential services in a word such a cloud of perplexing circumstances appears before me without one flattering hope that i am thoroughly convinced that unless the most vigorous and decisive exertions are immediately adopted to remedy these evils the certain and absolute loss of our liberties will be the inevitable consequence as one unhappy stroke will throw a powerful weight into the scale against us enabling general howe to recruit his army as fast as we shall ours numbers being disposed and many actually doing so already some of the most probable remedies and such as experience has brought to my more intimate knowledge i have taken the liberty to point out the rest i beg leave to submit to the consideration of congress i ask pardon for taking up so much of their time with my opinions but i should betray the trust which they and my country have reposed in me were i to be silent upon a matter so extremely interesting with the most perfect esteem i have the honor to be c     george washington   october      patrick henry to patrick henry governor of virginia heights of haerlem   october      dear sir your obliging favor of the  0th ultimo came duly to hand and demands my best acknowledgments i congratulate you sir most cordially upon your appointment to the government and with no less sincerity on your late recovery your correspondence will confer honor and satisfaction and whenever it is in my power i shall write to you with pleasure our retreat from long island under our peculiar circumstances became an act of prudence and necessity and the evacuation of new york was a consequence resulting from the other indeed after we discovered that the enemy instead of making an attack upon the city were endeavouring by means of their ships and superior land force either to intercept our retreat by getting in our rear or else by landing their forces between our divisions at kingsbridge and those in the town to separate the one from the other it became a matter of the last importance to alter the disposition of the army these measures however although of the most evident utility have been productive of some inconveniences the troops having become in some measure dispirited by these successive retreats which i presume has also been the case among several of our friends in the country in order to recover that military ardor which is of the utmost moment to an army almost immediately on my arrival at this place i formed a design of cutting off some of the enemys     light troops who encouraged by their successes had advanced to the extremity of the high ground opposite to our present encampment to effect this salutary purpose colonel knowlton and major leitch were detached with parties of riflemen and rangers to get in their rear while a disposition was made as if to attack them in front by some unhappy mistake the fire was commenced from that quarter rather on their flank than in their rear by which means though the enemy were defeated and pushed off the ground yet they had an opportunity of retreating to their main body this piece of success though it tended greatly to inspire our troops with confidence has been in some measure embittered by the loss of those two brave officers who are dead of the wounds they received in the action since this skirmish excepting the affair at montresors island where major henly another of our best officers was slain there has been nothing of any material consequence  indeed the advantage obtained     over the enemys light troops might have been improved perhaps to a considerable extent had we been in a proper situation to make use of this favorable crisis but a want of confidence in the generality of the troops has prevented me from availing myself of that and almost every other opportunity which has presented itself i own my fears that this must ever be the case when our dependence is placed on men enlisted for a few months commanded by such officers as party or accident may have furnished and on militia who as soon as they are fairly fixed in the camp are impatient to return to their own homes and who from an utter disregard of all discipline and restraint among themselves are but too apt to infuse the like spirit into others the evils of short enlistments and of employing militia to oppose regular and well appointed troops i strongly urged to congress before the last army was engaged indeed my own situation at cambridge about the close of the last campaign furnished the most striking example of the fatal tendency of such measures i then clearly foresaw that such an armament as we had good reason to expect would be sent against us could be opposed only by troops enlisted during the war and where every action would add to their experience and improvement and of whom if they were unsuccessful in the beginning a reasonable hope might be entertained that in time they would become as well acquainted with their business as their enemies this method i am convinced would have been attended     with every good consequence for besides the militia being altogether unfit for the service when called into the field they are much more expensive than any other kind of troops and the war could have been conducted on more moderate terms by establishing a permanent body of forces who were equal to every contingency than by calling in the militia on imminent and pressing occasions i would not wish to influence your judgment with respect to militia in the management of indian affairs as i am fully persuaded that the inhabitants of the frontier counties in your colony are from inclination as well as ability peculiarly adapted to that kind of warfare at the same time i should think it would be highly advisable in case you should conceive yourselves to be in danger from any detachment of the british army or from their marines not to depend on any troops but such as are well officered and enlisted during the war i make no doubt but your state have turned their views towards forming some obstacles against the enemys ships and tenders who may go up your rivers in quest of provisions or for the purpose of destroying your towns if they have depended on batteries to prevent them without any other obstructions a trial of the matter has taught us to believe that it will be altogether ineffectual as when under sail with wind and tide in their favor any damage they may receive from a battery will be of very little consequence at the same time i must observe that this kind of opposition is exceedingly proper for the defence of a     town or in any case where it is necessary that the ships should come to anchor before the batteries for the purpose of silencing them in the first instance i would strongly recommend rowgalleys which if officered with brave and determined men and conducted with prudence would in my opinion be productive of the greatest advantage and be the most likely means in your situation of securing your towns and houses on the navigable waters from any impression from the shipping i imagine before this congress have made you acquainted with their resolutions for raising the new army and that your colony is to furnish fifteen battalions to be enlisted during the war as this will occasion the choosing a number of new officers i would in the most urgent manner recommend the utmost care and circumspection in your appointments i do not suppose that there are many experienced gentlemen now left with you as from what i have understood those who have served in the last war are chiefly promoted however i am satisfied that the military spirit runs so high in your colony and the number of applicants will be so considerable that a very proper choice may be made indeed the armys being put upon such a permanent footing will be a strong inducement for them to step forth on the present interesting occasion one circumstance in this important business ought to be cautiously guarded against and that is the soldiers and officers being too nearly on a level discipline and subordination add life and vigor to military movements     the person commanded yields but a reluctant obedience to those who he conceives are undeservedly made his superiors the degrees of rank are frequently transferred from civil life into the departments of the army the true criterion to judge by when past services do not enter into the competition is to consider whether the candidate for office has a just pretension to the character of a gentleman a proper sense of honor and some reputation to lose perhaps sir you may be surprised at my pressing this advice so strongly as i have done in this letter but i have felt the inconveniences resulting from a contrary principle in so sensible a manner and this army has been so greatly enfeebled by a different line of conduct that i hope you will readily excuse me i am sir with sincere regard your affectionate humble servant george washington   october      to the president of congress head quarters heights of haerlem   october      sir i was last night honored with your favor of the  d with sundry resolutions of congress the officers that concurred in the acquittal of ensign macumber shall be called upon to assign their reasons for their first judgment which shall be sent as soon as they are collected in respect to the exchange of prisoners i fear it will be a work of great difficulty owing to their dispersed and scattered situation throughout the states in order to effect it i have written to the eastern     governments to have them collected and to transmit me an account of their number distinguishing the names and ranks of the field and commissioned officers and the corps they belong to i have also written to governor livingston of the jerseys upon the subject and must take the liberty of requesting congress to give directions that a similar return may be made of those in pennsylvania and maryland and for their being brought to brunswick that they may be ready to be exchanged for an equal number of those of the same rank i observe by the resolve of the   th ultimo that the exchange is particularly directed to be made of the officers and soldiers taken on long island but should not that follow the exchange of those officers and men who have lately returned from quebec whose imprisonment has been much longer whose service has not been less severe and who in many instances conducted with great intrepidity i have had many applications since their arrival by which they claim a kind of preference as far as their number and the circumstances of their rank will allow and which i thought it my duty to mention that i may obtain some direction upon the subject  you will observe by a paragraph of a letter received yesterday from general howe a copy of which you have at length that the nonperformance of the agreement between captain forster and general arnold by which the latter stipulated for the     return of an equal number of officers and prisoners in our hands for those delivered to him is considered in an unfavorable light and entirely imputed to me as having the chief command of the armies of the states and a controlling power over general arnold  the pointed manner in which general howe is pleased to express himself could not personally affect me supposing there had been no good grounds for the treaty not being ratified having been nothing more than an instrument of conveying to him the resolutions formed upon the subject yet as there were but too just reasons his censure could have no weight was it not directed against me however i would beg leave to observe that from the letters from the hostages from what has been reported by others respecting captain forsters having used his endeavors to restrain the savages from exercising their wonted barbarities though in some instances they did his purchasing some of the prisoners for a considerable premium but above all from the delicate nature of such treaties and because the nonobservance of them must damp the spirits of the officers who make them and add affliction to the misfortunes of those whom necessity and the nature of the case force into captivity to give them a sanction by a long and irksome confinementâ€”for these reasons and many more that     will readily occur that i could wish congress to reconsider the matter and to carry it into execution i am sensible the wrong was originally in their employing savages and that whatever cruelties were committed by them should be esteemed their own acts yet perhaps in point of policy it may not be improper to overlook these infractions on their part and to pursue that mode which will be the most likely to render the hardships incident to war most tolerable and the greatest benefits to the state i have ventured to say thus much upon the subject from a regard to the service and because such gentlemen of the army as i have heard mention it seem to wish the treaty had been ratified rather than disallowed  enclosed is a list of vacancies in the third regiment of virginia troops in part occasioned by the death of major leitch who died of his wounds on   0 tuesday morning and of the gentlemen who stand next in regimental order and who are recommended to succeed to emâ€”you will observe that captn john fitzgerald is said to be appointed to the duty of major this i have done in orders being the eldest captain in the regiment and i believe an officer of unexceptionable merit and as it was highly necessary at this time to have the corps as well and fully officered as possible there is also a vacancy in the   th continental battallion by the promotion of lieut clark to a majority in the flying camp to which colo hand has recommended william patten to succeed as you will perceive by his letter enclosed i have taken the liberty to transmit a plan for establishing a corps of engineers artificers c sketched out by col putnam and which is proposed for the consideration of congress how far they may incline to adopt it or whether they may chuse to proceed upon such an extensive scale they will be pleased to determine however i conceive it a matter well worthy of their consideration being convinced from exterience and from the reason suggested by colo putnam who has acted with great diligence and reputation in this business that some establishment of the sort is highly necessary and will be productive of the most beneficial consequencesâ€”if the proposition is approved by congress i am informed by good authority that there is a gentleman in virginia in the colony service john stadler esq a native of germany whose abilities in this way are by no means inconsiderableâ€”i am told he     was an engineer in the army under genl stanwix and is reported to be of skill and ingenuity in the professionâ€”in this capacity i do not know him myself but i am intimately acquainted with him in his private character as a man of understanding and of good behaviour i would submit his merits to the enquiry of congress and if he shall answer the report i have had of him i make no doubt but he will be suitably provided for the convention of this state have lately seized and had appraised two new ships valued at     Â£  s curry which they have sent down for the purpose of sinking and obstructing the channel opposite mount washington the price being high and opinions various as to the necessity of the measure some conceiving the obstruction nearly sufficient already and others that they would render it secure i would wish to have the direction of congress upon the subject by the earliest opportunity thinking myself that if the enemy should attempt to come up that they should be used sooner than to hazard their passing i must be governed by circumstances yet hope for their sentiments before any thing is necessary to be done sundry disputes having arisen of late between officers of different regiments and of the same rank respecting the right of succession to such vacancies as happen from death or other causes some suggesting that it should be in a colonial line and governed by the priority of their commissions others that it should be regimentally and there being an instance     now before me between the officers of the virginia regiments occasioned by the death of major leitch it has become absolutely necessary that congress should determine the mode by which promotions are to be regulated whether colonially  by priority of commissions or regimentally reserving a right out of the general rule they adopt to reward for particular merit or of withholding from office such as may not be worthy to succeed i have only proposed two modes for their consideration being satisfied that promotions thro the line as they are called can never take place without producing discord jealousy distrust and the most fatal consequences in some of my letters upon the subject of promotions and one which i had the honor of addressing the board of war on the  0th ult i advised that the mode should be rather practised than resolved on but i am fully convinced now of the necessity there is of settling it in one of the two ways i have taken the liberty to point out and under the restrictions i have mentioned or the disputes and applications will be endless and attended with great inconvenience i have c george washington   october      to the president of congress heights of haerlem   october      sir i do myself the honor of transmitting to you a copy of a letter from the comte demery governorgeneral of the french part of st domingo which i received yesterday and also my answer which i have     enclosed and left open for the consideration of congress wishing that it may be sealed if they approve of the sieur dechambaults releasement which i think may be attended with many valuable consequences if congress concur in sentiment with me they will be pleased to give direction for his passage by the first opportunity to the french islands if they do not i shall be obliged by your returning my letter  i have also the pleasure of enclosing a copy of a letter from monsieur penet which came to hand last night and which contains intelligence of an agreeable and interesting nature for which i beg leave to refer you to the copy the polite manner in which monsieur penet has requested to be one of my aidsdecamp demands my acknowledgments as the appointment will not be attended with any expense and will show a proper regard for his complaisance and the attachment he is pleased to express for the service of the american states i shall take the liberty of complying with his requisition and transmit to him a brevet commission provided the same shall be agreeable     to congress their sentiments upon this subject you will be kind enough to favor me with by the first opportunity the enclosed letter for the sieur dechambault you will please to forward to him if he is to be enlarged after closing it before i conclude i must take the liberty to observe that i am under no small difficulties on account of the french gentlemen that are here in consequence of the commissions they have received having no means to employ them or to afford them an opportunity of rendering that service they themselves wish to give or which perhaps is expected by the public their want of our language is an objection to their being joined to any of the regiments here at this time were there vacancies and not other obstacles these considerations induce me to wish that congress would adopt and point out some particular mode to be observed respecting them what it should be they will be best able to determine but to me it appears that their being here now can be attended with no valuable consequences and that as the power of appointing officers for the new army is vested in the several states it will be necessary for congress to direct them to be provided for in the regiments to be raised according to the ranks they would wish them to bear for i am convinced they will never be taken in let their merit be what it may or to form them into a distinct corps which may be increased in time they seem to be genteel sensible men and i have no doubt of their making good officers as soon as they can learn so much of our     language as to make themselves well understood but unless congress interfere with their particular direction to the states they will never be incorporated into any of the regiments to be raised and unless they are they will be entirely at a loss and in the most irksome situation for something to do as they now are george washington   october      to the president of congress head quarters heights of haerlem   october      sir  since i had the honor of writing you yesterday i have been favored with a letter from the honble council of massachusetts bay covering one from richard derby esq a copy of which is herewith transmitted as it contains intelligence of an important and interesting character as an exchange of prisoners is about to take place i am induced from a question stated in a letter i received from governor trumbull this morning to ask the opinion of congress in what manner the states that have had the care of them are to be reimbursed the expenses incurred on their account my want of information in this instance or whether any account is to be sent in with the prisoners would not allow me to give him an answer as nothing that i recollect has ever been said upon the subject he also mentions another matter namely whether such privates as are mechanics and others who may desire to remain with us     should be obliged to return  in respect to the latter i conceive there can be no doubt of our being under a necessity of returning the whole a proposition having been made on our part for a general exchange and that agreed to besides the balance of prisoners is greatly against us and i am informed it was particularly stipulated by general montgomery that all those that were taken in canada should be exchanged whenever a cartel was settled for the purpose under these circumstances i should suppose the several committees having the care of them should be instructed to make the most exact returns of the whole however willing a part should be to continue with us at the same time i should think it not improper to inform them of the reasons leading to the measure and that they should be invited to escape afterwards which in all probability they may effect without much difficulty if they are attached to us extending their influence to many more and bringing them away also the situation of our affairs and the present establishment of the army requiring our most vigorous exertions to engage a new one i presume it will be possible with money to pay the bounty lately resolved on to such men as will inlist prompt pay perhaps may have a happy effect and induce the continuance of some who are here but without it i am certain that nothing can be done nor have we time to lose in making the experiment but then it may be asked     who is to recruit or who can consider themselves as officers for that purpose till the conventions of the different states have made the appointments yesterday afternoon the exchange between lord stirling and governor brown was carried into execution and his lordship is now here he confirms the intelligence mentioned by captain souther about the transports he met by the arrival of the daphne manofwar a twentygun ship a few days ago with twelve ships under her convoy having lighthorse on board they sailed with about twenty in each and lost about eighty in their passage besides those in the vessel taken by captain souther he further adds that he had heard it acknowledged more than once that in the action of the   th ultimo the enemy had a hundred men killed about sixty highlanders of the fortysecond regiment and forty of the light infantry this confession coming from themselves we may reasonably conclude did not exaggerate the number in pursuance of the resolve which you were pleased to transmit me i called upon the members who concurred in the acquittal of mccumber to assign their reasons inclosed you have their answer by which you will perceive the direction has given them great uneasiness and from the information i have received it has become a matter of much more general concern than could have been expected in so much that i will take the liberty to advise that it may rest where it is having heard that most of the officers have become party to it and consider that the resolve materially affects the whole october  thâ€”about eight oclock this morning     two ships of fortyfour guns each supposed to be the roebuck and phÅ“nix and a frigate of twenty guns with three or four tenders got under way from about bloomingdale where they had been lying some time and stood with an easy southerly breeze towards our chevauxdefrise which we hoped would have intercepted their passage while our batteries played upon them but to our surprise and mortification they ran through without the least difficulty and without receiving any apparent damage from our forts though they kept up a heavy fire from both sides of the river their destination or views cannot be known with certainty but most probably they are sent to stop the navigation and cut off the supplies of boards c which we should have received and of which we are in great need they are standing up and i have despatched an express to the convention of this state that notice may be immediately communicated to general clinton at the highland fortifications to put him on his guard in case they should have any designs against them and that precautions may be taken to prevent the craft belonging to the river from falling into their hands i have the honor to be c      george washington   october      kingsbridge majorgeneral heath to majorgeneral heath kingsbridge haerlem heights   october      dear sir you letter of yesterday is before me with the list enclosed but this is doing the matter by halves only and the delay must inevitably defeat the end as it is impossible from the nature of things that the different governments can withold the nomination of officers much longer i therefore entreat you to delay not a moments time in summoning the officers under sanction from me to consider of this matter that the lists may be forwarded the committee of congress directed this general lincoln earnestly recommended it governor trumbull has requested it in precise terms in short the good of the service and our duty render it necessary let it be received in never so unfavorable a light which by the by i do not conceive to be the case by the states they are sent to i think you would do well to consult the field officers with respect to the captains c i beseech you once more to delay no time and i beseech you to exhort the officers you consult to lay aside all local prejudices and attachments in their choice the salvation of their country and all we are contending for depends under providence   0 upon a good choice of officers to make this army formidable to the enemy and serviceable to the cause we are endeavoring to support men who have endeavored to support the character of officers and who have not placed themselves upon a level with the common soldiery are fit to be preferred officers of the latter class will neverâ€”in short they cannotâ€”conduct matters with propriety but i need not point out the qualifications necessary to constitute a good officer your own observations and good judgment will readily point out who are and who are not fit for the new appointment i would have you confine yourself to the massachusetts bay officers    george washington   october      governor trumbull to governor trumbull headquarters harlem heights   october      sir agreeable to your request and the promise contained in my letter of yesterday i beg leave to transmit you the enclosed list comprehending the names of such gentlemen as are recommended by the general officers from your state as proper persons to be promoted in the regiments you are about to raise with the ranks which they conceive they ought to bear sensible that the very existence that the welldoing of every army depends upon good officers i urged i pressed the gentlemen to whom the business was confided and whose situation has given them an opportunity of being better acquainted through the different ranks than i am to pay their     most serious attention to the matter and to return such and only such as will in their estimation by their fidelity attachment and good conduct promote the great end we have in viewâ€”the establishment of our rights and the happiness of our country by that mode which sad necessity has compelled us to pursue this i hope they have done they have taken no notice of any officer in the northern army or of those of the seventeenth regiment huntingtons who were taken on long island whose imprisonment i should suppose if they have merit should be no objection to their having promotion nor do they mean by the list they have given in to preclude others of greater merit than those they have mentioned if they are to be found congress by a late resolution have allowed a paymaster to each regiment in the appointment of which i would recommend that particular care be had to the choosing men intimately acquainted with and well versed in accounts and who will be able to keep them in a fair and distinct manner as they will have not only to receive the regiments pay but to keep accounts of every transaction incident to themâ€”such as respect their clothes c in some appointments lately made by the field officers to whom i submitted the matter they nominated men who could not write their names legibly as our present army is upon the eve of their dissolution it behooves us to exert every nerve to enlist immediately for the new one without i am convinced we shall have none to oppose the enemy and     who will have it in their power to spread havoc and devastation wheresoever they will i would therefore submit it to your consideration whether it may not be proper as soon as you have made choice of your officers and which i think should be effected as early as possible to appoint a committee with power to repair to this place and make such arrangements as may be necessary with respect to those who are now in the service in order that they may begin to recruit out of the present corps without any loss of time i perceive the generals in the list they have made have set down the commissary for a regiment in this i think they have done exceedingly right and that it is nothing more than a reward justly due his merits in case he should quit his present department however i hope the apprehensions which have given rise to this step will never become realities and that he will continue in his office and upon such terms as may be agreeable to him but lest he should decline the provision they have made is extremely proper i this minute saw general spencer who informed me that they had never taken the officers prisoners on long island into consideration in making out their arrangements not knowing whether they could be noticed in their present situation i have made out a list of them and as i have before observed if they are men of merit their imprisonment most certainly should not operate to their prejudice if it can be avoided if a principle of that sort was adopted it would give the greatest discouragement and have     a direct tendency to suppress every brave and manly enterprise which might be attended with captivity       on yesterday morning three ships of war two of fortyfour and the other of twenty guns with two or three tenders passed up the north river without meeting any interruption from the chevauxdefrise or receiving any material damage from our batteries tho they kept a heavy fire at them from both sides of the river their views most probably are to cut off all supplies of boards c which might come down the river and of which we shall have great need i have given directions to proceed as fast as possible in carrying on the obstructions and i would fain hope if they allow us a little more time that they will be so far completed as to render the passage dangerous if not altogether insecure i have the honor c      p s in respect to the appointment of officers i would beg leave to add that the merit of the officers who went through the canada expedition with general arnold should in my opinion be particularly     noticed they are now upon their parole and cannot act but should not suitable provision be made for them against their releasement which i should suppose ought to be among the first     george washington    october      governor trumbull to governor trumbull heights of haerlem    october      sir i was last night favored with your letter of the  th inst with the return of prisoners in your state for which i thank you it is properly made out every days intelligence from the convention of this state mentions plots and conspiracies which are in agitation     among the disaffected  the enclosed copy of a letter which i received yesterday from robert r livingston one of the members and who is also of the continental congress will show you his ideas of the situation of affairs in this government and their apprehensions of insurrections the observations he has been pleased to favor me with through the whole of his letter seem to me to be too well founded  the movements of the enemy their having     sent up some of their ships in the north river their landing a large proportion if not the main body of their army on frogs point or rather island as it is surrounded by water every flood tide nine miles above this on the soundâ€”  added to these the information     of desertersâ€”all afford a strong presumption nay almost a certainty that they are pursuing their original plan of getting in our rear and cutting off all our supplies our situation here is not exactly the same as it was at new york it is rather better however as we are obliged to divide our force and guard every probable place of attack as well as we can as most of our stores are here and about kingsbridge and the preservation of the communication with the states on the other side of hudsons river is a matter of great importance it will not be possible for me to detach any more assistance than what i have already done for the purpose of securing the passes in the highlands i have sent colonel tash lately from new hampshire with his regiment upon the business and as it is of the utmost consequence to possess those passes and to hold them free and open i would beg leave to submit to your consideration whether you can spare any aid upon this interesting occasion i know your exertions already are great i know you have a large number of men engaged in the service in this and the northern army and nothing could have induced me to mention this matter to you were it not for the alarming and melancholy consequences which would result from the enemys possessing themselves of those communications the regiment i have ordered up is to receive directions from the convention as to the posts they are to occupy supposing them to be much better acquainted with the places where they should be stationed than i am if it is in your  00 power to afford any assistance in this instance you will be pleased to give such instructions to those you send as you shall judge necessary i am just despatching an engineer to the convention to throw up some small works i have sent two regiments of the massachusetts militia up the river to watch the motions of the ships and to oppose any landing of men that they may attempt i am also extending every part of my force that i possibly can towards east and west chester to oppose the enemy and prevent their effecting their plan if it shall be practicable but our numbers being far inferior to the demands for men i cannot answer for what may happen the most in my power shall be done i am c   0  george washington    october

to be lamented than avoided but it is the duty of every one to alleviate these as much as possible far be it from me then to add to the distresses of a lady who i am but too sensible must already have suffered much uneasiness if not inconvenience on account of colonel philips absence no special order has gone forth from me for removal of the stock of the inhabitants but from the nature of the case and in consequence of some resolutions of the convention of this state the measure has been adopted however as i am satisfied it is  0  not meant to deprive families of their necessary support i shall not withhold my consent to your retaining such parts of your stock as may be essential to this purpose relying on your assurances and promise that no more will be detained with great respect i am madam c george washington    october      majorgeneral schuyler to majorgeneral schuyler headquarters valentines hill    october      dear sir from my remote situation and my ignorance of the country in which the army under your command to the northward is to act it is impossible for me to give my peremptory orders or scarcely my opinion as to the direction of matters in your quarter i am confident your own good sense zeal and activity will suggest to you the most probable means of making amends for the heavy loss we have sustained by the destruction of general arnolds fleet upon lake champlain but my experience of the many evils attending the calling in of a body of raw militia obliges me to give you my sentiments upon that head and to tell you that i fear they will render you more disservice than any real good from their want of every camp necessary when they join a regular army they commit an intolerable waste of stores which once put into their hands can scarcely be regained and are so much dead loss to the public and for want of regularity in their drafts of ammunition provision and other necessaries they consume much  0  more than it is convenient to spare from a garrison even near a source of supplies much less from one at such a distance that it requires every exertion to keep up the magazines in the best of times i have been informed that ticonderoga properly garrisoned and supplied with provision and ammunition is almost impregnable even at a season of the year when an army can lie before it with the greatest conveniency if so instead of calling up a number of useless hands and mouths for such i deem the militia generally i would advise the collecting of as much provision as can possibly be got together which if sufficient for nine thousand effective men of which number your army consisted by general arnolds letter i should imagine you could keep burgoyne and carleton at bay till the rigor of the season would oblige them to raise the siege not only from want of conveniences to keep the field but from the fear that the freezing of the lake would make their return impracticable in case of accident i would recommend the removal of carriages and draftcattle of all kinds from the country adjacent that if they should attempt to slip by ticonderoga by any other route and come down upon the settlements the plan should be rendered abortive for want of the means of conveyance for their baggage and stores i am unacquainted with the extent of your works and consequently ignorant of the number of men necessary to man them if your present numbers should be insufficient for that purpose i would then by all means advise your making up the deficiency out of  0  the best regulated militia that can be got some might likewise be useful in bringing up supplies and fill the places of men who would render more service with arms in their hands you will always be kind enough to bear in mind that i am giving my opinion not issuing my orders the vexation i have experienced from the humors and intolerable caprice of militia at a critical time makes me feel sensibly for the officer who is to depend on them in the day of trial  upon the whole i beg you may not be influenced  0  by any thing i have thrown out you have had experience of the temper of the people who will probably march to your assistance and therefore know whether they differ in character from those who have reinforced the army under my command in full confidence that you will do what seems best to your judgment i submit the matter entirely to you esteeming myself happy if any hints of mine should be serviceable to you i am c end of vol iv   thomas i presume you know is made a major general and ordered to canada where old wooster was throwing every thing into confusion and a superior officer was necessary to keep the peace i do not much like their thus taking away the men in whom you can most trust but your camp is considered a school and

congress the only tribute which a free people will ever consent to pay the tribute of thanks and gratitude to their friends and benefactors the disinterested and patriotic principles which led you to the field have also led you to glory and it affords no little consolation to your countrymen to reflect that as a peculiar greatness of mind induced you to decline any compensation for serving them except the pleasure of promoting their happiness they may without your permission bestow upon you the largest share of their affections and esteem those pages in the annals of america will record your title to a conspicuous place in the temple of fame which shall inform posterity that under your direction an undisciplined band of husbandmen in the course of a few months became soldiers and that the desolation meditated against the country by a brave army of veterans commanded by the most experienced generals but employed by bad men in the worst of causes was by the fortitude of your troops and the address of their officers next to the kind interposition of providence confined for near a year within such narrow limits as scarcely to admit more room than was necessary for the encampments and fortifications they lately abandoned accept therefore sir the thanks of the united colonies unanimously declared by their delegates to be due to you and the brave officers and troops under your command and be pleased to communicate to them this distinguished mark of the approbation of their country the congress have ordered a golden medal adapted to the occasion to be struck and when finished to be presented to you i have the honor to be with every sentiment of esteem sir your most obedient and very humble servant hancock to washington   april      a private letter from mr adams

gold should be struck in commemoration of it congress have been pleased to appoint me with two other gentlemen to prepare a device i should be very happy to have your excellencys sentiments concerning

general wooster left montreal for quebec march   th the command of the former place devolved on colonel hazen who wrote to general schuyler on the  st of april as followsâ€” you are not unacquainted with the friendly disposition of the canadians when general montgomery first penetrated into the country the ready assistance which they gave on all occasions by men carriages or provisions was most remarkable even when he was before quebec many parishes offered their services in the reduction of that fortress which were at that time thought unnecessary but his most unfortunate fate added to other incidents has caused such a change in their disposition that we no longer look upon them as friends but on the contrary waiting an opportunity to join our enemies that no observations of my own may remain obscure i beg leave to observe that i think the clergy or guardians of the souls and conductors of the bodies of these enthusiasts have been neglected perhaps in some instances illused be that as it will they are unanimous though privately against our cause and i have too much reason to fear many of them with other people of some consequence have carried on a correspondence the whole winter with general carleton in quebec and are now plotting our destruction the peasantry in general have been illused they have in some instances been dragooned with the point of the bayonet to supply wood for the garrison at a lower rate than the current price for carriages and many other articles furnished certificates have been given not legible without signature the one half of consequence rejected by the quartermastergeneral it is true payment has been promised from time to time yet they look upon such promises as vague their labor and property lost and the congress or united colonies bankrupt and in a more material point they have not seen sufficient force in the country to protect them these matters furnish very strong arguments to be made use of by our enemies with respect to the better sort of people both french and english seven eighths are tories who would wish to see our throats cut and perhaps would readily assist in doing it you may remember sir in a conversation with you at albany i urged the necessity of sending immediately to canada able generals a respectable army a committee of congress a suitable supply of hard cash and a printer indeed i had before represented those measures in person to congress at least to the committee of congress and we have since been flattered from time to time that we should have one or all of these essentialsâ€”ms letter all persons serving in the continental army without commissions from congress are desired to give in their names and employments in writing that the propriety of their

incidents have hitherto conspired to prevent their embarkation the men had scarcely recovered themselves from the fatigues of their march from boston and are quite unprovided with necessaries the colonels of the regiments though repeatedly called upon for that purpose had neglected making out the abstracts for their pay all obstacles however are now removed and i hope to begin the embarkation this day indeed it would have been best in my opinion to have sent the regiments raised in this province and new jersey upon the service had not the peculiar circumstances under which they were raised prevented it by the terms of their enlistment they are to serve during the war and at five dollars per month on condition as i am informed that they shall not be sent out of these provinces besides they are very ill provided with arms some companies not having any it must be a great burthen upon the continent to keep such a number of useless men in pay and yet if they should be dismissed and an unexpected supply of arms should arrive it may be found very difficult to replace themâ€”washington to the president of congress    april        colonel hazen had written from montreal to general schuylerâ€”the savages hereabouts are cool they keep aloof from us we are to expect little or no friendship from them and indeed little or no precaution has been taken for that purpose it is expected by some that numbers will come from the interior country and fall on our frontiers early in the spring the canadians taking up arms so early against us is of the most important consequence we have ourselves brought about by mismanagement what governor carleton himself could never effect you will please to notice what colonel hazen says of the disposition of the indians in my opinion it will be impossible to keep them in a state of neutrality they must and no doubt soon will take an active part either for or against us and i submit it to the consideration of congress whether it would not be best immediately to engage them on our side and to use our utmost endeavors to prevent their minds being poisoned by ministerial emissaries which will ever be the case while a kings garrison is suffered to remain in their country would it not therefore be advisable to send a sufficient force from the back counties of pennsylvania to take possession of the garrisons of niagara and detroit this i think might easily be effected and would answer the most salutary purposes the seneca indians who have hitherto appeared friendly to us might be usefully employed in this business i am in hopes most of the difficulties mentioned in colonel hazens letter will be obviated by the appearance of the respectable committee of congress in canada and the forces that have been and will be sent there the security of that country is of the utmost importance to us this cannot be done so effectually by conquest as by taking strong hold of the affections and confidence of the inhabitants it is to be lamented that any conduct of the continental troops should tend to alienate their affections from us the honorable congress will be able to judge from the papers sent them by general schuyler and the information they may receive of the designs of the enemy whether it is expedient to send a further reinforcement to canada if such should be their determination i stand ready to execute their

their several situations and as i am now arranging that part of the business of the army it will i presume be proper that directions be given to the commanding officers of the several corps to take the stations that i shall assign by the orders they may in time of danger receive from me or the brigadier generals of the continental army the like measure will be equally necessary with regard to the militia of kings county and part of queens county on long island and also the militia of staten island and i am persuaded that the mention of a matter so obviously necessary will be sufficient to

calculated to ruin me than to disunite and create jealousies in the friends to america your excellency will therefore please to order a court of inquiry the soonest possible for i cannot sit easy under such an infamous imputation since on this extensive continent numbers of the most respectable characters may not know what your excellency and congress do of my principles and exertions in the

time when i had taken measures and given orders some of which are actually executed to secure the tories and to send them down to your excellency a set of pretended whigs for such they are that have

charges of the people against general schuyler address of the committees of safety and inspection for several towns in the county of berkshire massachusetts bay bordering on the colony of new york and with the approbation of kings district in said colony may it please your excellency we beg leave to lay before your excellency the distresses of our minds with all humility fear of injuring our common cause by writing as well as speaking on the one hand or by silence on the other has filled us with peculiar concern the purport of this epistle is so delicate that we write with fear and trembling lest when we mean to serve our country we do it an irreparable injury purity of intention will not always secure us against wrong steps we beg leave to assure your excellency that it is our hearty intention to support you in the defence of america against the tyranny and usurpation of great britain to the last extremity and if that is the pleasure of the continental congress to the building up of a distinct republic or american empire but what has filled our minds with a peculiar sense of danger to the common cause are the following things which we take to be facts though we may be deceived as to some of them that general schuyler has had the superintending oversight of our canadian army that after the defeat of december   st      at quebec in an attempt to take it by storm recruits were forwarded in the slowest and most dilatory manner that our army before the walls of quebec during a long and tedious winter underwent every kind of hardship and their spirits were broken by being neglected that about the  th of may so inconsiderable was the army so miserably provided with provisions and ammunition in a word so greatly neglected that it was obliged precipitately to raise the siege and disgracefully to retreat so as not only to leave those five hundred valiant sons of america taken within the walls of quebec to the mercy of our enemies but an additional number of sick to be disposed of at their pleasure that general schuyler some time last winter went on an expedition to subdue the internal enemies of this country collected in arms against the country at johnstown and after the suppression of the said rebellion the ringleader sir john johnson was not so much as put under moderate confinement that the said sir john johnson has since collected a number of said enemies as we suppose and joined some of the kings forces in the upper forts and raised a number of canadians and indians and come down upon colonel bedels regiment stationed at the cedars and taken them to a man not less than about five hundred in number many of whom were shot and others tomahawked in cool blood by the insatiable savages after they were made prisoners this we have from men of credibility who were made prisoners at the same time but found means to get away the colonel of said regiment being necessarily absent at the time of said fight that our army has long been in a most deplorable situation in canada as to provisions and intrenching tools and we view them as in danger of being driven wholly out of those territories which event we have too much reason to fear will decide the fate of new england and be of the most dangerous consequence to all the united colonies that the minds of many officers soldiers and others are greatly dissatisfied with the conduct of general schuyler and have great fears respecting his fidelity to his country though they may be wholly without foundation and we find a great backwardness in men to enlist in this expedition on this account god forbid that we should harbor ungrounded jealousies of the deliverers and in a sense saviours of our country or wilfully shut our eyes against the greatest dangers we beg leave to assure your excellency that we consider all the united colonies but as one and observe no other distinctions than those of friends and enemies to their country we indulge no private disgust or resentment we are of no faction or party we wish not to injure the reputation and glory of general schuyler were it in our power we sincerely hope his name may be handed down with immortal honor to the latest posterity as one of the great pillars of the american cause we must not conclude without assuring your excellency of the utmost confidence placed in you by persons of all ranks and conditions within the sphere of our knowledge we can cheerfully rest in your wisdom under the direction of him who ruleth over all for directing the military operations in general through this great continent in conformity with the advice of the continental congress we heartily pray for success to your arms and salvation to america and that your disinterested services may meet with a glorious reward by order of the committee   as the oldest majorgeneral in the army at new york general putnam was left in command during washingtons absence at the call of congress   the machinations of disaffected persons or tories as they began universally to be called in the lower counties of new york had for some time excited serious apprehensions as to their effects on the army and particularly when the british forces should arrive on the coast governor tryon was at the head of this party and by his talents his former popularity in the province and his emissaries among the people he was maturing designs which it was found necessary to take speedy and efficient measures to counteract the provincial congress had appointed a secret committee of their number to confer with general washington from time to time on all such matters as required the cooperation of the civil and military powers for the common safety the subject of the tories had occupied their deliberations and it was agreed that a strong and decided course ought immediately to be pursued in regard to them general washington had promised military aid for carrying into effect any resolves which might be adopted to attain this object the following is an extract from the proceedings of the congress on the   th of may mr morris from the committee who conferred with general washington informed the congress that sundry matters of great importance had come before the committee and the general that the general wished for the advice and assistance of this congress to carry into execution his own powers if not also the assistance of the powers of this congress that the matters conferred on are of such importance that in order to preserve secrecy it is necessary that each particular member be sworn not to reveal to any person out of the congress the matters to be mentioned or the subjects of this days debate the president then put the question whether every member is willing to take an oath of secrecy and the same was unanimously agreed to ordered that mr scott and mr morris wait on general washington and inform him that the congress have taken an oath of secrecy and the nature thereof and receive of him such papers as may be necessary to communicate to this congress messrs scott and morris returned from general washington and delivered to the president such papers as they had received of the general they reported that a scheme of a junction is forming between the disaffected in connecticut and on long island in order to join the ministerial army and oppress the friends of liberty in these colonies after further consideration the congress passed a series of resolutions setting forth the unjustifiable acts of disaffected persons the dangers threatened by them to the liberties of the country and the necessity of seizing and securing all such as manifested hostile intentions and an open resistance to the newly established civil authority the committee appointed to execute these resolves of whom gouverneur morris was chairman were instructed to proceed with vigilance and firmness to employ the militia where occasion required and if necessary to solicit additional force from general washington the names of several persons residing in kings queens new york richmond and westchester counties had been reported to the congress concerning whom the committee were required to collect evidence and examine them in person as well as to send out agents to search for others who were concealed or unknown the committee were directed to commit to safe custody such persons as they should think proper and to send them for this purpose into the neighboring colonies where the infection of their influence could not be diffused a similar course of proceeding was recommended to the county committees several

ammunition to be examined according to the orders of the   th instant which last mentioned officers are to see that their ammunition and accoutrements are complete and the men dressed in a soldierlike manner the adjutants are then to march them to the parade of the brigade and to deliver them over to the major of their respective brigade who is very minutely to inspect and see that the guards are compleat in the particulars abovementioned the brigade majors are then to march them to the grand parade on the common in the artillery park and from thence the several out guards are to be relievedâ€”on the grand parade the brigadiers with the field officers of the day will attend to see the guards paraded and marchd to their several destinations the brigade major of the day is also to attend on the grand parade and make up the guards before he repairs to head quarters for the purpose of reporting the same and to receive any orders from the commander in chief to the brigadier general of the day and to the other brigadiers of the line the brigadier general of the day will give his orders on the parade to the field officers of the day at what time he would have them go the

esteemed field officers of the day who are to see that the guards are properly placed and that every thing is in good order for defence in case of an attack the brigadier general will on the parade assign to each field officer of the day the posts he is to visit for this purpose the artillery guard is to parade at the same time and placeâ€”the matrosses and gunners necessary to be constant at each battery are with their proper implements to march off from the grand parade at the head of the guards to be stationed at the respective batteries the field officer who goes the grand rounds is to visit the camp guards as well as the guards stationed in the town and at the batteries the other two field officers of the day are to do the like at such hours of the night as will be assigned them by the brigadier of the day by the present demand for flints by some of the troops the general has reason to apprehend that due care has not been taken of those lately delivered to the soldiers who have had no occasion to make an extraordinary use of themâ€”and it is well known that a good flint well screwd in will stand the firing of sixty rounds after which it may still be repairedâ€”tis therefore presumed that the men have either lost their flints through negligence or abused them by that worst of practices snapping their pieces continually which not only spoils their lock softens the hammer and destroys the flint but frequently causes the death of many a man by the gun being unknowingly loaded the officers are therefore required to pay a very strict attention to this particular and have their mens flints examined when they review their ammunition for men being surprized with bad flints in their guns may be attended with fatal consequences the officers are also desired to be careful that when their men turn out to exercise their flints be taken out and a wooden snapper screwd into their gun until their exercise be over when the flint is again to be well screwd in and their arms immediately put in proper fighting order after which no man is on any account to snap his piece one flint pr man will be delivered to the troops and tis expected more care will be taken of them than has been done heretofore the sentries in fort george and on the battery are to keep a sharp lookout towards the narrows staten island red hook c to observe if any signals are given from thence and

wilkinsons memoirs vol   p      it was resolved june  st that six thousand militia should be employed from massachusetts new hampshire connecticut and new york to reinforce the army in canada   congress had voted the raising of two thousand indians for the canada service in reply general schuyler very naturally inquired where they were to be found and added that instead of raising this number for the american cause he thought that if they could be prevented from joining the enemy it was more than could be expected the indians had but one maxim in their alliances with the whites which was to adhere to the strongest side where they were paid the most liberally and ran the least risk congress had small means and were parsimonious from necessity they were moreover averse at first to employing this kind of aid and sought only to keep the savages in a peaceful neutrality as this was not possible from the fierce and warlike nature of these sons of the forest and as the enemy has no scruples on the subject it was deemed necessary by congress to seek their assistance no moment however could have been more unpropitious for such an attempt than the present when the declining state of affairs in canada held out feeble encouragements to a people who acted upon the principle and with the ultimate aim of the savages   general schuyler soon afterwards went to the

editor of that volume claimed to have received the letters from a friend serving in a loyal corps under brigadiergeneral de lancey of new york this friend gave the following explanation of the manner in which he had become possessed of them among the prisoners at fort lee i espied a mulatto fellow whom i thought i recollected and who confirmed my conjectures by gazing very earnestly at me i asked him if he knew me at first he was unwilling to own it but when he was about to be carried off thinking i suppose that i might perhaps be of some service to him he came and told me that he was billy and the old servant of general washington he had been left there on account of an indisposition which prevented his attending his master i asked him a great many questions as you may suppose but found very little satisfaction in his answers at last however he told me that he had a small portmanteau of his masters of which when he found that he must be put into confinement he intreated my care it contained only a few stockings and shirts and i could see nothing worth my care except an almanack in which he had kept a journal or diary of his proceedings since his first coming to new york there were also two letters from his lady one from mr custis and some pretty long ones from a mr lund washington and in the same bundle with them the first draughts or foul copies of answers to them i read

knew a man so much to be pitied if i remember right you have seen and have some knowledge of him but it is impossible you could form so just an estimate as these letters will give you they contain also as you will find a deal of information not to be had anywhere else i assure myself therefore you will thank me for the trouble i have taken in copying them for your perusal the publication was

washington could his claim to them be indisputably established the critical review expressed the same doubt of their reliability it is difficult to determine their authenticity from any intrinsic evidence they contain no facts of a private nature and they discover not only sentiment but a correctness of composition the letters were reprinted in america in      but the volume has no publisher

you represent his letter to his lady and the whole complexion of the case afford a strong presumption nay much more full evidence that he means to escape if possible he says in his letter that during his respite the time between his writing and getting an answer from congress something may turn up to make his removal improper and at any rate to gain time will be of advantage i have wrote to the captain of his guard upon the subject and as mr franklin has evidenced a most unfriendly disposition to our cause as the colony convention have ordered him to connecticut for refusing to comply with such terms as they deemed necessary and proper for him to enter into to procure his liberty as he does not propose to sign the parole which they formed but has proposed several alterations i am of opinion your committee should interfere in the matter and give immediate orders to the officer of the guard to proceed with him in execution of the duty wherewith he is charged and further that if you apprehend there is the least danger of his being rescued or of the guard appointed to escort him being remiss in their duty that your committee should appoint a strong escort for the purpose and

their posts their gallantry and spirit extorted applause from their enemies who dejected and defeated have retired to their former station out of the reach of our troops this glorious example of our troops under the like circumstance with us the general hopes will animate every officer and soldier to imitate and even out do them when the enemy shall make the same attempt on us with such a bright example before us of what can be done by brave and spirited men fighting in defence of their country we shall be loaded with a double share of shame and infamy if we do not acquit ourselves with

colonel patterson adjutant general of the army under general howe july  0      after usual compliments in which as well as through the whole conversation colonel patterson addressed general washington by the title of excellency col patterson entered upon the business by saying that general howe much regretted the difficulties which had arisen respecting the address of the letters to general washington that it was deemed consistent with propriety and founded upon precedents of the like nature by ambassadors and plenipotentiaries where disputes or difficulties of rank had arisen that general washington might recollect he had last summer addressed a letter to general howe to the hon william howe esq that lord howe and general howe did not mean to derogate from the respective rank of general washington that they held his person and character in the highest esteem that the direction with the addition of c c c implied everything that ought to follow he then produced a letter which he did not directly offer to general washington but observed that it was the same letter which had been sent and laid it on the table with a superscription to george washington c c c the general declined the letter and said that a letter directed to a person in a public character should have some description or indication of it otherwise it would appear a mere private letter that it was true the c c c implied everything and they also implied anything that the letter to general howe alluded to was an answer to one received under a like address from him which the officer on duty having taken he did not think proper to return but answered in the same mode of address that he should absolutely decline any letter directed to him as a private person when it related to his public station colonel patterson then said that general howe would not urge his delicacy further and repeated his assertions that no failure of respect was intended he then said he would endeavor as well as he could to recollect general howes sentiments on the letter and resolves of congress sent him a few days before respecting the treatment of our prisoners in canada that the affairs of canada were in another department not subject to the control of general howe but that he and lord howe utterly disapproved of every infringement of the rights of humanity colonel patterson then took a paper out of his pocket and after looking it over said he had expressed nearly the words general washington then said that he had also forwarded a copy of the resolves to general buigoyne to which colonel patterson replied he did not doubt a proper attention would be paid to them and that he general washington was sensible that cruelty was not the characteristic of the british nation colonel patterson then proceeded to say he had it in charge to mention the case of general prescott who they were informed was treated with such rigor that under his age and infirmities fatal consequences might be apprehended general washington replied that general prescotts treatment had not fallen under his notice that all persons under his particular direction he had treated with kindness and made their situation as easy and comfortable as possible that he did not know where general prescott was but believed his treatment very different from their information general washington then mentioned the case of colonel allen and the officers who had been confined in boston gaol as to the first colonel patterson answered that general howe had no knowledge of it but by information from general washington and that the canada department was not under his direction or control that as to the other prisoners at boston whenever the state of the army at boston admitted it they were treated with humanity and even indulgence that he asserted this upon his honor and should be happy in an opportunity to prove it general washington then observed that the conduct of several of the officers would well have warranted a different treatment from what they had received some having refused to give any parole and others having broke it when given by escaping or endeavoring so to do colonel patterson answered that as to the first they misunderstood the matter very much and seemed to have mistook the line of propriety exceedingly and as to the latter general howe utterly disapproved and condemned their conduct that if a remonstrance was made such violations of good faith would be severely punished but that he hoped general washington was too just to draw public inferences from the misbehavior of some private individuals that bad men were to be found in every class and society that such behavior was considered as a dishonor to the british army col patterson then proceeded to say that the goodness and benevolence of the king had induced him to appoint lord howe and general howe his commissioners to accommodate this unhappy dispute that they had great powers and would derive the greatest pleasure from effecting an accommodation and that he colonel patterson wished to have this visit considered as making the first advances to this desirable object general washington replied he was not vested with any powers on this subject by those from whom he derived his authority and power but from what had appeared or transpired on this head lord howe and general howe were only to grant pardons that those who had committed no fault wanted no pardon that we were only defending what we deemed our indisputable right colonel patterson said that would open a very wide field for argument he then expressed his apprehensions that an adherence to forms was likely to obstruct business of the greatest moment and concern he then observed that a proposal had been formerly made of exchanging governor skene for mr lovell that he now had authority to accede to that proposal general washington replied that the proposition had been made by the direction of congress and having been then rejected he could not now renew the business or give any answer till he had previously communicated it to them colonel patterson behaved with the greatest attention and politeness during the whole business expressed strong acknowledgements that the usual ceremony of blinding his eyes had been dispensed with at the breaking up of the conference general washington strongly invited him to partake of a small collation provided for him which he politely declined alledging his late breakfast and an impatience to return to general howe though he had not executed his commission so amply as he wished finding he did not propose staying he was introduced to the general officers after which he took his leave and was safely conducted to his own boat which waited for him about four miles distant

against us or to go into any port or harbor in america where the enemy themselves were or had a fleet or to go on board their ships the late conduct of lord drummond is as extraordinary as his motives are dark and mysterious to judge the most favorably of his intentions it would seem that an overweening vanity has betrayed him into a criminal breach of honor but whether his views were upright or intended only to mislead and deceive cannot at present be a matter of any importance in the mean time i have the pleasure to acquaint you that congress highly approve the manner in which you have checked the officious and intemperate zeal of his lordship whether his designs were hostile or friendly he equally merited the reproof you gave him and i hope for the future he will be convinced that it is highly imprudent to attract the attention of the public to a character which will only pass without censure when it passes without notice the congress having considered the matter thoroughly are of opinion to decline taking any public or further notice of his lordship or his letters and particularly as you have so fully expressed their sentiments on the subject in your letter to himâ€”hancock

prisoner in new york the summer following he became acquainted with lord drummond and was prevailed upon by him to solicit from washington a reexamination of the affair stating that his lordship felt wounded at the treatment he had received and expressing a conviction of his innocence washington replied with his usual firmness that he had thoroughly investigated the subject at the time that he had no disposition to injure lord drummond that the impression left on his mind was deep and decided and that no circumstances had since come to light which tended to alter his opinion sparks i do myself the honor to transmit the enclosed letter from major french and at the same time to inform you that his exchange for major meigs whose parole i am advised you have will meet my approbation i would take the liberty also to propose an exchange of any captain you may choose for captain dearborn whose parole i have heard was delivered to you with major meigss give me leave to assure you sir that i

transmitted yesterday or that genl burgoyne has not made such progress as was expected to form a junction of their two armies or what i think equally probable they mean to procrastinate their operations for some time trusting that the militias which have come to our succor will soon become tired and return home as is but too usual with them congress will make their observations upon these

damage was done by the rifles grapeshot were fired from the vessels as they passed but without injury except to a tent the phÅ“nix and rose had been five weeks in the river and by the aid of their tenders and small boats soundings had been taken in every part as far up as the entrance of the highlands the tender which had been burnt by one of the fireships was towed on shore the next day although under the fire of the enemys cannon this was effected by a lieutenant and two men in a manner that reflected great credit upon their enterprise and courage a sixpound cannon three smaller

regularity cheerfulness and alacrity as one means of accomplishing this he desires that no regiment brigade or division will interfere with the duties of another but walk in their own proper line the colonels taking care not to contravene the orders of their brigadiers the brigadiers of their major generals and that the whole pay due attention to the general orders which can only be set aside or be dispensed with by orders of equal dignity the army under such a regulation will soon become respectable in itself and formidable to the foeâ€”it is an incumbent duty upon every officer of every rank to be alert and attentive in the discharge of the several duties annexed to his office his honor his own personal safety and for ought he knows the salvation of his country and its dearest privileges may depend upon his exertions particular causes may and doubtless will happen to render it necessary for the good of the service that a change of officers câ€”should be made from one brigade to another but whenever there appears cause for this it will be notified by general or special ordersâ€” the general cannot quit the subject as this may possibly be the last opportunity previous to an attack without advising the private men and exhorting the troops in general to be profoundly silent and strictly obedient to orders before they come to and also while they are in action as nothing can contribute more to their success than a cool and deliberate behavior nor nothing add more to the discouragement of the enemy than to find new troops calm and determined in their manner the general has no doubt but that every good soldier and all the officers are sufficiently impressed with the necessity of examining the state and condition of their arms but his own anxiety on this head impels him to remind them of it after every spell of wet weather least we should at any time be caught with arms unfit for immediate use the regiments of militia from connecticut are to be formed into a brigade under the command of brigadier general wolcott who is hourly expected and in the mean time to be under the command of col hinman the eldest colonel of the militia though the fire ships which went up the north river last friday evening were not so successful as to destroy either of the men of war yet the general thanks the officers and men for the spirit and resolution which they shewed in grappling the vessels before they quitted the fire ships and as a reward of their merit presents each of those who stayed last and were somewhat burnt fifty dollars and forty to each of the others and had the enterprize succeeded so as to have destroyed either of the ships of war the general could have been generous in proportion to the serviceâ€”orderly book    august        the events

deliver into our hands the authors abettors and perpetrators of the horrid murder committed on the prisoners to suffer such punishment as their crime deserves and also to make indemnification for the plunder at the cedars taken contrary to the faith of the capitulation and that until such delivery and indemnification be made the said prisoners be not delivered journals july  0th this was in effect

and by the other officers at length the messenger came back from st johns with a letter directed to george washington esquire which was handed to major bigelow and with which he returned immediately up the lake to ticonderoga being escorted on his way as far as gillelands by a boat with two british officers and nine canadians this letter general gates sent off by express to general washington when opened it was found to be a mere envelope enclosing a paper purporting to be a military order issued by general carleton at chamblee on the  th of august without signature or address and unaccompanied by any remarks the contents of this paper were of so singular a character and comported so little with the spirit and temper of a highminded officer that they might well have excited a strong suspicion as to their being genuine had not the despatch been formally entrusted to major bigelow as coming from general burgoyne or general carleton who was commanderinchief the order prohibits all intercourse with rebels traitors rioters disturbers of the public peace plunderers robbers assassins or murderers and adds that should emissaries from such lawless men again presume to approach the army whether under the name of flagoftruce men or ambassadors except when they come to implore the kings mercy their persons shall be immediately seized and committed to close confinement and proceeded against as the law directs after a good deal more in the same style of rodomontade the order concludes by directing all the prisoners from the rebellious provinces who choose to return home to hold themselves in readiness to embark at a short notice and that the commissary should visit the transports destined for them and see that wholesome provisions and necessary clothing with all possible conveniences for their passage be prepared and that the prisoners were to look on their respective provinces as their prisons there to remain till further enlarged or summoned to appear before the commanderinchief in canada with no other explanation than the order itself it is now impossible to decide what degree of credit ought to be ascribed to it from the tenor of washingtons letter above and from the circumstance of his transmitting the paper to congress it is obvious that he considered it genuine general schuyler and general gates were of the same opinion it is remarkable that a copy of the same paper was put into the hands of each of major bigelows men when he left isleauxnoix if the order actually proceeded from general carleton it must be allowed to

near the road leading from st johns to laprairie while they were in that concealment general gordon passed alone on horseback and in full uniform the lieutenant deliberately fired at him and shot him through the body the wound was mortal but the general was able to ride to st johns where he soon expired this act of atrocity kindled the indignation of the british officers and occurring but two or

fortified with some strong redoubts yet a great part of them were weak being only abbattied with bush and affording no strong cover so that there was reason to apprehend they could be forced which would have put our troops in confusion and having no retreat they must have been cut to pieces or made prisoners  th the divided state of the troops rendered our defence very precarious and the duty

duty and divided into many detachments while the enemy had their main body on the island and capable of receiving assistance from the shipping in these circumstances it was thought unsafe to transport the whole of an army on an island or to engage them with a part and therefore unequal numbers whereas now one whole army is collected together without water intervening while the enemy can receive little assistance from their ships their army is and must be divided into many bodies and fatigued with keeping up a communication with their ships whereas ours is connected and can act together they

heights to a friend general greene saidâ€”we made a miserable disorderly retreat from new york owing to the disorderly conduct of the militia who ran at the appearance of the enemys advanced guard fellowss and parsonss brigades ran away from about fifty men and left his excellency on the ground within eighty yards of the enemy so vexed at the infamous conduct of the troops that he sought death rather than lifeâ€”letter september   th dr gordon relates the incident nearly in the same way though a little enlarged and as he was in camp soon afterwards he probably derived his information from a correct source the generals attempts to stop the troops were fruitless though he drew his sword and threatened to run them through cocked and snapped his pistols on the appearance of a small party of the enemy not more than sixty or seventy their disorder was increased and they ran off without firing a single shot and left the general in a hazardous situation so that his attendants to extricate him out of it caught the bridle of his horse and gave him a different directionâ€”gordons history vol ii p     on the   th instant in the morning the ships of war passed up the north river as far as bloomingdale to draw the enemys attention to that side and the first division of troops consisting of the light infantry the british reserve the hessian grenadiers and chasseurs    embarked at the head of newtown creek and landed about noon upon new york island three miles from the town at a place called kipps bay under the fire of five ships    the rebels had troops in their works round kipps bay but their attention being engaged in expectation of the kings troops landing at stuyvesants cove horens hook and at harlem which they had reason to conclude kipps bay became only a secondary object of their care the fire of the shipping being so well directed and so incessant the enemy could not remain in their works and the descent was made without the least oppositionâ€”general howe to lord george germaine    september      the americans had thrown up breastworks at this place of landing which makes the panic the more disgraceful the incident appeared in london much magnified accounts are received that gen washington had written to the provincial congress that three regiments belonging to massachusetts bay had left the army in a body upon the landing of the kings troops in kipps bay and that he had been obliged to send six of the southern regiments after them who fired upon them repeatedly and killed several before they could bring them back to their dutyâ€”london

thanks the troops commanded yesterday by major leitch who firstadvanced upon the enemy and the others who so resolutely supported themâ€”the behavior of yesterday was such a contrast to that of some troops the day before as must shew what may be done where officers and soldiers will exert themselvesâ€”once more therefore the general calls upon officers and men to act up to the noble cause in which they are engaged and to support the honor and liberties of their country the gallant and brave col knowlton who would have been an honor to any country having fallen yesterday while gloriously fighting capt brown is to take the command of the party lately led by col knowltonâ€”officers and men are to obey him accordingly the loss of the enemy yesterday would undoubtedly have been much greater if the orders of the commander in chief had not in some instances been contradicted by inferior officers who however well they may mean ought not to presume to directâ€”it is therefore ordered that no officer commanding a party and having received orders from the commander in chief depart from them without counter orders from the same authority and as many may otherwise err through ignorance the army is now acquainted that the generals orders are delivered by the adjutant general or one of his aidsdecamp mr tilghman or col moylan the quarter master generalâ€”orderly book

under the command of major price are to join col smallwoods battalion and genl mcdougalls brigade and it is expected that the commanding officer of every corps will together with all the officers therein exert themselves in seeing good order and discipline observed they are to consider that it is the duty of a good officer to see or at least to know that orders are executed and not to content themselves with being the mere vehicles thro which they are conveyed to the menâ€”we are now arrived at an important crisis which calls loudly for the zeal and activity of the best of officersâ€”we see we know that the enemy are exerting every nerve not only by force of arms but the practices of every art to accomplish their purposes and that among other pieces of policy which is also founded on justice we find them exceedingly careful to restrain every kind of abuse of private property whilst the abandoned and profligate part of our own army countenanced by a few officers who are lost to every sense of honor and virtue as well as their countrys good are by rapine and plunder spreading ruin and terror wherever they go thereby making themselves infinitely more to be dreaded than the common enemy they are come to oppose at the same time that it exposes men who are strolling about after plunder to be surprised and taken the general therefore hopes it will be unnecessary on any future occasion for him to repeat the orders of yesterday with respect to this matter as he is determined to shew no favor to officer or soldier who shall offend herein but punish without exception every person who shall be found guilty of this most abominable practice which if continued must prove the destruction of any army on earthâ€”orderly book    september      it is probable in a little

ships of war in the north river which it is said are to cannonade our right flank when they open their batteries against our front every disposition is making on our part for defence and congress may be assured that i shall do every thing in my power to maintain the post so long as it shall appear practicable and conducive to the general goodâ€”washington to the president of congress    september        i received yesterday the enclosed declaration by a gentleman from elizabethtown who told me many copies were found in the possession of the soldiers from canada that were landed there a day or two ago by general howes permission i shall not comment upon it it seems to be founded on the plan that has been artfully pursued for some time pastâ€”washington to congress    september      this declaration dated september   th recited the disavowal of congress of every purpose of reconciliation not consonant with their extravant and inadmissible claim of independence and continued the king being most graciously pleased to direct a revision of such of his royal instructions to his governors as may be construed to lay an improper restraint on the freedom of legislation in any of his colonies and to concur in the revisal of all acts by which his majestys subjects there may think themselves aggrieved it is recommended to the inhabitants at large to reflect seriously upon their present condition and expectations and to judge for themselves whether it be more inconsistent with their honor and happiness to offer up their lives as a sacrifice to the unjust and precarious cause in which they are engaged or return to their allegiance accept the blessings of peace and to be secured in a free enjoyment of their liberties and properties upon the principles of the constitution this declaration occasioned not a little surprise in parliament among the opposition to government cavendish characterized it as a most extraordinary declaration which if genuine required the attention and consideration of this house that parliament had limited the power of the commissioners to granting pardons and receiving submissions yet they were found reducing parliament to a cipher and promising that the king will concur in the revision of all acts by which his american subjects are aggrieved fox also complained that the penner of the declaration had virtually and he would add audaciously engaged for the sentiments of parliament in america all was peace conciliation and parental tenderness in england nothing but subjugation unconditional submission and a war of conquest   the general hopes that soldiers fighting in such a cause as ours will not be discouraged by any difficulties that may offer and informs them that the grounds he now possesses are to be defended at all events any officer or soldier therefore who upon the approach or attack of the enemys forces by land or water presumes to turn his back and flee shall be instantly shot down and all good officers are hereby authorized and required to see this done that the brave and gallant part of the army may not fall a sacrifice to the base and cowardly part or share their disgrace in a cowardly or unmanly retreat the heights we are now upon may be defended against double the force we have to contend with and the whole continent expects it of us but that we may assist the natural strength of the ground as much as possible and make our posts more secure the general most earnestly recommends it to the commanding officers of every brigade and regiment to turn out every man they have off duty for fatigue and apply to col putnam for tools and directions how and where to work this measure is also earnestly recommended to the men as it will tend greatly to their own security and ease as the guards will be lessened in proportion as the grounds get strengthenedâ€”orderly book  0 sept      it is earnestly recommended to all brigadiers and commanding officers of corps to see or know that the orders relative to their respective brigades c are complied with and they as well as commanding officers of regiments c are requested to attend particularly to the state of the mens health that those that are really sick may be supplied in the best manner our situation and circumstances will admit of whilst such as feign themselves sick merely to get excused from duty meet with no kind of countenance or favor as it only tends to throw the burden upon the spirited and willing men who disdain such scandalous practices the general would remind all officers of the indispensible necessity there is of each of them exerting himself in the department he acts and that where this is the case of the advantages resulting from it as an army let it be ever so large then moves like clock work whereas without it it is no better than an ungovernable machine that seems only to perplex and distract those who attempt to conduct itâ€”orderly book    september      some wild stories were current in london when the movements of the connecticut troops after the battle of long island were known based upon some letters from the british army the london chronicle october     th related how three persons passing from new york to long island informed the british general that washington had ordered three battalions of new york provincials to leave the city to be replaced by an equal number of connecticut troops but the former assured that the connecticutians would burn and destroy all the houses peremptorily refused to give up their city declaring that no cause or exigence whatsoever should induce them to intrust the defence of it to any other than her own inhabitantsâ€”this spirited and stubborn resolution prevailed over the orders of their commander and the new yorkers continue snugly in possession of the place in the next issue of this sheet there was a circumstantial account of a most dreadful fray in the town of new york between the new yorkers and the pennsylvanians and new englanders the last wishing to set fire to the town and retreat that the new yorkers had won and in consequence the forces from new england and pennsylvania had withdrawn themselves then rumor said that howe sent to washington not to burn new york but received for answer that he would keep new york as long as it was tenable and when he could defend it no longer he should certainly burn it and retire so as to cut off all supplies the climax was reached on the   d when it was strongly reported the british took possession of the town on september  0th and general washington was taken prisoner   the thirteen militia regiments from connecticut being reduced to a little more than  00 men rank and file fit for duty i have thought proper to discharge the whole to save the states the immense charge that would arise for officers pay there are too many militia that have just come in and on their way from that state none of which are provided with a tent or a single camp utensil this

pauls church as it is said which continued to burn pretty rapidly till after sunrise the next morning i have not been informed how the accident happened nor received any certain account of the damage report says many of the houses between the broadway and the river were consumedâ€”washington to the president of congress    september      there is no evidence whatever that any responsible officer or public body was concerned in this attempt to fire the city and it was probably started to cover a loot of the houses at the time it was charged that some of the new england men were principally concerned a survival of that sentiment expressed in the note on page     but direct evidence is also wanting in this opinion an english officer wrote on the   d it was set on fire towards the north river in a part of the town where the laboring people lived as also where the english protestant churches were as well as the college some persons caught in the act of firing buildings were shot on

west side of broad street as far as verlattenberg hill consuming all the blocks from the whitehall up the flames extended across the broadway from the house of mr david johnson to beaver lane or fischers alley on the west and carried all before it a few buildings excepted to the house at the corner of barclay street wherein the late mr adam vandenberg lived sweeping the cross streets in the way    the cause of the fire is not known we imagine about a  thpart of the whole city is destroyed pennsylvania journal  0 october      in describing this catastrophe the british commander wrote to lord george germaine on the   d that the town was set on fire in several places with matches and combustibles that had been prepared with great art and ingenuity he addedâ€”many were detected in the fact and some killed upon the spot by the enraged troops in garrison and had it not been for the exertions of majorgeneral robertson the officers under his command in town and the brigade of guards detached from the camp the whole must infallibly have been consumed as the night was extremely windy the destruction is computed to be about one quarter of the town washington makes no mention of nathan hale the martyr spy of the revolution who was hung in new york by the british on the morning of    september      col knowlton was requested by the general to find a man willing and capable to penetrate the enemys lines and obtain information of their plans and hale a captain of his troop volunteered he had succeeded so far as to be on his return to the american camp when he was arrested on suspicion identified by a tory relative and after an examination hung as a spy   the british commander declined exchanging mcdonald for a brigadier on the ground that he had commissioned him as major but congress decided that as he had been commissioned a brigadier by governor martin of north carolina he should not be exchanged for an officer of lower rank   general howe had writtenâ€”it is with much concern that i cannot close this letter without representing the illtreatment which i am too well informed the kings officers now suffer in common gaols throughout the provinces of new england i apply to your feelings alone for redress having no idea of committing myself by an act of retaliation upon those in my power   the number of prisoners according to these returns is greater than we expected however i am inclined to believe that among those in the list from long island are several militia of general woodhulls party who were never arranged in this army as to those taken on the   th they greatly exceed the number that i supposed fell into their hands in the retreat from the city at the time that i transmitted an account of that affair i had not obtained returns and took the matter upon the officers reports they are difficult to get with certainty at any time in the skirmish of monday sennight they could have taken but very few before i conclude i shall take occasion to mention that those returns made with such precision and the difficulty that will attend the proposed exchange on account of the dispersed and scattered state of the prisoners in our hands will clearly evince the necessity of appointing commissaries and proper persons to superintend  conduct in such instances this i took the liberty of urging more than once as well on account of the propriety of the measure and the saving that would have resulted from it as that the prisoners might be treated with humanity and have their wants particularly attended toâ€”washington to the president of congress

spoken as follows in his letter my aiddecamp will present to you a ball cut and fixed to the end of a nail taken from a number of the same kind found in the encampment quitted by your troops on the   th instant i do not make any comment upon such unwarrantable and malicious practices being well assured that the contrivance has not come to your knowledge by the following extract from a letter written to lord george germaine by general howe dated september   th it would appear that he was not very sanguine as to the success of the campaign the enemy is too strongly posted he writes to be attacked in front and innumerable difficulties are in our way of turning him on either side though his army is much dispirited from the late success of his majestys arms yet have i not the smallest prospect of finishing the combat this campaign not until the rebels see preparations in the spring that may preclude all thoughts of further resistance to this end i would propose eight or ten lineofbattle ships to be with us in february with a number of supernumerary seamen for manning boats having fully experienced the want of them in every movement we have made we must also have recruits from europe not finding the americans disposed to serve with arms notwithstanding the hopes held out to me upon my arrival in this port the general here alludes to a letter which he had written to lord george germaine july  th soon after his arrival at staten island in which he saidâ€”i met with governor tryon on board of a ship at the hook and many gentlemen fast friends to government attending him from whom i have had the fullest information of the state of the rebels and added there is great reason to expect a numerous body of the inhabitants to join the army from the provinces of new york the jerseys and connecticut who in this time of universal oppression only wait for opportunities to give proofs of their loyalty and zeal for government in these anticipations after two months experience general howe found himself deceived and he advised the minister to prepare for sending out european reinforcements for the next campaign   he soon grew worse and died of his wounds on the  st of october   in his journey to staten island john adams noted the straggling and loitering soldiers on the road and in the public houses and conceived but a poor opinion of the discipline of our forces and excited as much indignation as anxiety upon his return to congress at his instance and through the board of war a resolution for enforcing and perfecting discipline in the army was adopted that the commander in chief of the forces of these states in the several departments be directed to give positive orders to the brigadiergenerals and colonels and all other officers in their several armies that the troops under their command may every day be called together and trained in arms in order that officers and men may be perfected in the manual exercise and manÅ“uvers and inured to the most exemplary discipline and that all officers be assured that the congress will consider activity and success in introducing discipline into the army among the best recommendations for promotion journals of congress    september      this officious resolution must have reached washington before the   d and was the cause of the letter of the   th which was written by his own hand and shows no sign of resentment at the criticism thus levelled against him by adams and the congress the extreme difficulties to be overcome in obtaining even the semblance of discipline in such an army as congress gave to washington are described in the letters of reed now adjutantgeneral who soon after sent in his resignation john sloss hobart saw washington on the evening of the   th and spoke of him as much indisposed   the term of service for almost the whole army was to expire at or before the end of the year samuel adams passed through new york on the   th and found the general and his family in health and spirits indeed every officer and soldier appears to be determined    i see now more than ever i did the importance of congress attending immediately to enlistments for the next campaign it would be a pity to lose your old soldiers i am of opinion that a more generous bounty should be givenâ€”twenty dollars and one hundred acres of land for three years at least but enough of thisâ€”samuel adams to john adams    august        we want nothing but good officers to constitute as good an army as ever marched into the field our men are much better than the officersâ€”general greene   october      the success of the cause the defeat of the enemy the honor of the state and the reputation of the army altogether depends upon the establishing of a good core or corps of officers my little experience has fully convinced me that without more attention is paid by the different states in the appointment of the officers the troops never will answer their expectations    there has been it must be confessed some shameful conduct in this army this campaign in a great measure owing to the bad conduct of the officersâ€”general greene to governor cooke    october        vol iii  0    to attempt to introduce discipline and subordination into a new army must always be a work of much difficulty but where the principles of democracy so universally prevail where so great an equality and so thorough a levelling spirit predominates either no discipline can be established or he who attempts it must become odious and detestable a position which no one will choose it is impossible for any one to have an idea of the complete equality which exists between the officers and men who compose the greater part of our troopsâ€”reed to his wife    october        general greene was more outspoken in his opinion of where the blame should rest the policy of congress has been the most absurd and ridiculous imaginable pouring in militiamen who come and go every month a military force established upon such principles defeats itself    the congress goes upon a penurious plan the present pay of the officers will not support them and it is generally determined by the best officers to quit the service unless a more adequate provision is made for their support the present establishment is not thought reputable the congress has never furnished the men voted by near one half certainly by above a third had we numbers we need not have retreated from long island or new york    we must have an army to meet the enemy everywhere to act offensively as well as defensively our soldiers are as good as ever were and were the officers half as good as the men they would beat any army on the globe of equal numbersâ€”   september      in a letter to general gates dated october   th general lee expressed his opinion of congress and of the army in a laconic but characteristic manner i write this scrawl he says in a hurry colonel wood will describe the position of our army which in my own breast i do not approve inter nos congress seem to stumble at every step i have been very free in delivering my opinion to them general washington is much to blame in not menacing them with resignation unless they refrain from unhinging the army by their absurd interference   a resolution was passed by congress on receiving this letter requesting the several states to appoint skilful surgeons and physicians to examine the surgeons and surgeons mates who offered themselves to serve in the army or navy and declaring that no commission should be issued to any who should not produce a certificate from such examiners that they were qualified for the duties of their office journals  0 september        the court decided that the prisoner was not guilty of plundering or of robbery nor of mutiny but that he is guilty of offering violence to and disobeying major box his superior officer he was sentenced to ask pardon of major box and to be severely reprimanded at the head of his regiment washington had added note it is to be observed that the men who were to share the plunder became the evidences for the prisoner   the general thanks the colonels and commanding officers of regiments for their care in examining the tents and knapsacks of the soldiers after plunder he directs that what has been found be sent to the house on the road below head quarters and that regimental courts martial immediately sit to try every one who cannot prove that he came honestly by what is found in his possessionâ€”the offenders to be punished as soon as the sentence is approved by the colonel or commanding officerâ€”as a little wholesome severity may put a stop to such ruinous practices in future the general hopes a very strict inquiry will be made and no favor shown the general does not admit of any pretence for plundering whether it is tory property taken beyond the lines or not it is equally a breach of orders and to be punished in the officer who gives orders or the soldier who goes withoutâ€”orderly book    september        read in congress    september      and referred to a committee of five wythe hopkinson rutledge j adams and stone washingtons

persuaded will afford you pleasure as the only means left to defend our country in its present critical situation hancock to washington    september      in making them known to the states hancock

long been impressing on congress the necessity of revising the old rules and late in july the judge advocate of the armyâ€”william tudorâ€”was sent to philadelphia to confer with congress on the subject reed to the president of congress    july      tudor was in philadelphia until the  0th engaged on this business but there is no entry on the journals of the submission to congress of the new articles the first definite mention being that on august   th when the consideration of them was begun john adams and thomas jefferson were appointed by congress to confer with tudor and drew up the report substantially adopting the british articles of war totidem verbis according to adams they met with so great opposition on the floor that to this day   0  i scarcely know how it was possible that these articles could have been carried works iii    the articles are printed in journals of congress  0 september      on the  0th a committee of threeâ€”sherman gerry and lewisâ€”was appointed

as he is desirous of having again engaged in the service specifying the states to which they belong and the general thinks it will be necessary to obtain the same from the northern army the use which we intend to make of this is to send it by a member of congress to the assembly of each respective state who is to be ordered to impress the necessity of appointing gentlemen of education to military offices as a measure absolutely essential for saving the country and to urge the assemblies to apportion the men on the towns and raise them by recruiting or drafting that they may be in readiness for reinforcing or forming the army by the  st of decemberâ€”ms letter the committee reported to congress on october  d and it is very probable that the resolution adopted on the  th recommending the

should be effectually counteracted in this instance or in a little time they will levy no inconsiderable army of our own people the influence of their money and their artifices has already passed the

favors will not be wanting in this instance i have only time to add that i have the honor to be â€”washington to governor trumbull  0 september      the general also thinks it proper to acquaint the officers and soldiers who have stayed and faithfully attended to their duty that he has wrote to the respective states to order back all officers and soldiers who have absented themselves with or without leave and that he will take the most effectual measures for the purpose from the movements of the enemy and other corroborating circumstances to say nothing of the advanced season and the necessity which must induce them to bring on a decisive engagement the general has abundant reason to believe that an attack may be hourly expectedâ€”he exhorts every commanding officer therefore of corps to pay particular attention to the state of the arms and ammunition of their men that nothing may be amiss whenever we are called upon however sudden it may happenâ€”at the same time he once more recommends to every officer and soldier the importance of the cause they are engaged in and the necessity there is of their behaving like men who are contending for every thing that freemen should valueâ€”he assures the whole that it is his first determination to defend the posts we now hold to the last extremity and nothing but unpararelled cowardice can occasion the loss of them as we are superior in number and have a better cause to contend in than the enemy haveâ€”he further declares that any spirited behavior in officers or soldiers shall meet with its reward at the same time that misbehavior and cowardice shall find exemplary punishment every brigadier or officer commanding brigade is hereby enjoined and ordered to select some good officers to be in the rear of their battalions and these officers are positively ordered to shoot any officer or soldier who shall presume to quit his ranks or retreat unless the retreat is ordered by proper authority and to prevent the

protect the wellaffected inhabitants in that quarter and prevent the enemy from landing and driving off the cattle but after the success of the british arms near brooklyn parties of the enemy marched to the interior of the island the people generally submitted to their authority some from inclination others from fear and colonel livingston was obliged to retreat with his remaining forces across the sound to connecticut it was thought advisable to make a descent upon the island with a larger force but generals clinton and lincoln not finding that a body of men could be collected sufficient to warrant the enterprise upon a large scale joined the main army in a few days without having attempted it the project was not immediately abandoned however and governor trumbull concerted a plan with colonel livingston which promised favorably at first but was finally given up as impracticable on account of a deficiency both of men and of watercraft to transport them across the sound in one of his letters to colonel livingston on this subject governor trumbull wroteâ€”i have received intelligence which i believe may be depended on that major rogers now employed by general howe and who you know was a famous partisan or ranger in the last war is collecting a battalion of tories on long island and from the main many of whom have joined him at huntington and that he proposes soon to make a sudden attack in the night on norwalk to take the continental stores and lay waste the town i hope we shall be able to frustrate his designs i have no need to apprize you of the art of this rogers he

captains commission and the power of appointing a lieutenant and ensign to any person properly recommended who should raise a company of seventy men he added that he hoped the people would cheerfully come forward in the service as he should otherwise be obliged to fill up the companies by drafts thus no alternative was left and as the inhabitants of long island were entirely in the power of the

particular manner in which you rest upon me by your letter of the  th instant a performance of the agreement between general arnold and captain forster was entirely unexpected as i enclosed to you some time ago the resolutions of congress upon the subject by which you would perceive that they to whom i am amenable had taken upon themselves the consideration of the matterâ€”washington to general howe   october        general howe had writtenâ€”with relation to the nonperformance of your part of the agreement between captain forster and general arnold that general being immediately under your command from your situation made known to me under your own subscription it rests with you to see it fulfilled agreeably to the plighted faith of the general which no doubt to save his honor he has a right to expect or that you will return the prisoners given up by captain forster meanwhile i trust from the declaration in your letter that you will not allow of any delay in the exchange of the officers and soldiers in your possession belonging to his majestys troops brigadiergeneral woodhull was yesterday reported to have died of his wounds a letter from a gentleman at montreal dated    august      stated that when captain forster had taken the american party prisoners his provisions proved insufficient for such a number and he was obliged to put his own men and the indians with him on half allowance this made the indians discontented and they insisted upon putting their prisoners to death but were prevailed upon by captain forster after the utmost entreaty to spare them to be sent to the colonies to be exchanged general burgoyne allowed the hostages to write to their friends   i yesterday had the honor of receiving your favor of the  th of august and i take the earliest opportunity of testifying the pleasure i have in complying with your request by immediately ordering the release of monsieur dechambault he shall be accommodated with a passage in the first vessel that sails from philadelphia to the french colonies in the west indies had it not been for your interposition monsieur dechambault must have remained in prison till released by a cartel but i could

october   th   the board of war reported that all prisoners captured by the army of the united states whether mechanics or not be included in the exchange to be made between general washington and the enemy but congress postponed the consideration   the commanding officer of the rangers having represented that soldiers are continually straggling down to harlem and other places frequently without armsâ€”and that when he has apprehended and sent them to their regiments no farther notice has been taken of them as this is a plain breach of general orders the general hopes there is some mistake in the matter however to prevent it in future he now orders that no officer or soldier rangers excepted go on any pretence beyond the lines without leave from himself a major general the brigadier of the day or the adjutant general in writing unless either of those officers are with them in person and in order to distinguish the rangers they are to wear something white round their arms if any such straggler is found hereafter he is to be sent to the quarterguard of the regiment tried by a regimental court martial and receive ten lashes immediately the general to prevent any plea of ignorance again repeats his order against all kinds of gaming as destructive and pernicious to the service he hopes the officers will set no examples of this kind and that they will punish it among the menâ€”orderly book   october        i shall therefore beg leave to add only that as the welldoing nay the very existence of every army to any profitable purposes depends upon it too much regard cannot be had to the choosing of men of merit and such as are not only under the influence of a warm attachment to their country but who also possess sentiments and principles of the strictest honor men of this character are fit for office and will use their best endeavors to introduce that discipline and subordination which are essential to good order and inspire that confidence in the men which alone can give success to the interestingand important contest in which we are engaged i would also beg leave to subjoin that it appears to me absolutely necessary that this business should have your earliest attention that those who are nominated may employ their interest and influence to recruit men out of your corps who are now here and without loss of time in respect to the officers that were in the canada expedition their behavior and merit and the severities they have experienced entitle them to a particular notice in my opinion however as they are under their paroles i would recommend that vacancies should be reserved for such as you think fit to promote not wishing them to accept commissions immediately nor to do the least act which may be interpreted as a violation of their engagement their releasement i hope will be soon obtained as i think them entitled to the first exchange and this i have mentioned to congress i flatter myself that the freedom i have taken in the instances above will have the indulgence and pardon of your state when i assure you that the list you will receive is not intended to exclude gentlemen of greater merit nor transmitted with other views than to assist you and promote the general good and also that the measure has been recommended by a committee of congress who were pleased to honor me with a visitâ€”washington to governor cooke

uponâ€”it is hereby directed by the general that no horse or waggon shall be taken by any officer of whatever rank without an order from head quarters the qr m general or waggon master general but where either are wanted for regimental uses the application shall go from the commanding officer of the regiment in writing to the q m gl or w m glâ€”who will issue his orders therefor and if wanted for the dispatch of public business the application to be made by the engineer in writingâ€”all teams belonging to the public or in their pay are to be delivered to the quarter master general registered and under his directionâ€”the quarter master general is to take especial care of all grain and hay belonging to the public and see that none of it is delivered but by his order and as these articles are scarce it is ordered that all officers whose duty does not oblige them to be on horseback dispose of the horses or send them out of camp immediately as provender cannot be spared for them on any pretence no boards are to be taken for the use of any brigade or regiment without orders nor delivered but by order of the quarter master general who is to make as equal a distribution among

that the men have four days provisions ready dressed at all times for which purpose the commissaries or the deputies are to keep the butchers constantly killing till such supply is had and one man from every mess is to be keep cooking the commanding officers of regiments and others are most earnestly requested to see this order carried into immediate execution as the enemy seems now to be endeavoring to strike some stroke before the close of the campaign the general most earnestly conjures both officers and men if they have any love for their country and concern for its liberties regard to the safety of their parents wives children and countrymen that they will act with bravery and spirit becoming the cause in which they are engaged and to encourage and animate them so to do there is every advantage of ground and situation so that if we do not conquer it must be our own faultsâ€”how much better will it be to die honorable fighting in the field than to return home covered

the obstructions in the river which should be increased as fast as possible genl spencer is to take charge of all the works from head quarters to our front lines to the south and attend particularly to all weak places seeing they are secured as well as time and circumstances will permit but as there may be more fatigue men wanted in one division than the other they are each to furnish for such

his regiment lately from new hampshire in addition to the militia mentioned in his last with directions to receive orders from the convention as to the station and post he is to occupy there are now in our possession several persons inhabitants of this state who had engaged to join the enemy and who were interrupted in going to them there are also two who confess they have been with them and that they had actually engaged in their service but finding the terms the bounty pay c not so advantageous as they expected from the information they had received they were induced to return as the affairs of this government are in a precarious situation and such as the convention themselves seem to think forbid their interposition farther than taking measures to apprehend them his excellency would wish to obtain the sentiments of congress and their direction upon a subject so extremely critical and delicate and which in the consideration of it involves many important consequences   the enclosed copy of a letter received last night from the convention of this state will show you the apprehensions they are under on account of the disaffected among them i have ordered up a part of the militia from massachusetts under general lincoln to prevent if possible the consequences which they suggest may happen and which there is reason to believe the conspirators have in contemplation i am persuaded that they are upon the eve of breaking out and that they will leave nothing unessayed that will distress us and favor the designs of the enemy as soon as their schemes are ripe for itâ€”washington to the president of congress    october        the grounds from frogs point are strong and defensible being full of stone fences both along the road and across the adjacent fields which will render it

last nightâ€”washington to the president of congress    october      october   th i am directed by his excellency to acquaint you that we are again obliged to change our disposition to counteract the operations of the enemy declining an attack upon our front they have drawn the main body of their army to frogs point with a design of hemming us in and drawing a line in our rear to prevent the consequences which would but too probably follow the execution of their scheme the general officers determined yesterday that our forces must be taken from hence and extended towards east  west chester so as to out flank them genl lee who arrived on monday has strongly urged the absolute necessity of the measure it is proposed to leave a garrison at fort washington and to maintain it if possible in order to preserve the communication with the jerseys they are landing their artillery and wagons upon the point and there are now several boats passing up the sound full of them from the proceedings of the council of war october   thâ€”after much consideration and debate the following question was put whether it having appeared that the obstructions in the north river have proved insufficient and that the enemys whole force is in our rear at frogs point it is now deemed possible in our present situation to prevent the enemy from cutting off the communication with the country and compelling us to fight them at all disadvantages or surrender prisoners at discretion agreed with but one dissenting voice namely general clinton that it is not possible to prevent the communication from being cut off and that one of the consequences mentioned in the question must certainly follow agreed that fort washington be retained as long as possible this last decision appears to have been partly in consequence of a resolve of congress passed five days before desiring general washington by every art and at whatever expense to obstruct effectually the navigation of the river between fort washington and mount constitution as well to prevent the regress of the enemys frigates lately gone up as to hinder them from receiving succour   the brigades are now to be formed into

informed of what is expected from them that no confusion may arise in case we should be suddenly called to action which there is no kind of doubt is near at hand and he hopes and flatters himself that the only contention will be who shall render the most acceptable service to his country and his posterity the general also desires that the officers will be particularly attentive to the mens arms and ammunition that there may be no deficiency or application for cartridges when we are called into the fieldâ€”orderly book    october      at half past one on the afternoon of the  0th harrison wrote the enemy are pursuing with great industry their plan of penetrating the country from the sound and of forming a line in our rear they are now extended from frogs point to new rochelle from whence it is generally conjectured they mean to take their route by way of the white plains and from thence to draw a line to the north riverâ€”we on our part have drawn our whole force except the regiments intended to garrison fort washington from the island of new york and have possessed ourselves of the heights passes and advantageous grounds between new rochelle where the van of their army now lies and the north river they will in all probability attempt to effect their purpose by moving higher up if they do our forces will move accordingly it being a principal object to prevent their out flanking us on friday one of their advanced parties near east chester fell in with part of colo glovers brigade and a smart and close skirmish ensued in which i have the pleasure to inform you our men

col glover and the officers and soldiers who were with him in the skirmish on friday last that their merit and good behavior deservedâ€”he flatters himself that his thanks tho delayed will nevertheless be acceptable to them as they are offered with great sincerity and cordialityâ€”at the same time he hopes that every other part of the army will do their duty with equal duty and zeal when ever called upon and that neither dangers difficulties or hardships will discourage soldiers engaged in the cause of liberty and contending for all that free men hold dear and valuableâ€”orderly

regularity if officers of the army undertake to seize waggons and compel them to go where they please the general therefore absolutely forbids any officer or soldier taking a waggon by his own authority and more especially stopping them when sent on other services as it is easy to see that the greatest confusion must in that case ensueâ€”when teams are wanted application must be made to the quartermastergeneral or his deputy and every brigade or regiment must wait till the service adjusts their having them in that channel the commanding officers of regiments are also required to appoint some spirited resolute officer to attend the loading of the waggons and prevent their being filled with lumber and improper articles tents and the proper baggage of the regiment are only to be put into the waggons all others must be left behind and the general calls upon the general officers and the commanding officers of regiments to set an example to the soldiersâ€”orderly book    october      the general observing that the army seems unacquainted with the enemys horse and that when any parties meet with them they do not oppose them with the same alacrity which they show in other cases thinks it necessary to inform the officers and soldiers that in such a broken country full of stone walls there is no enemy more to be despised as they cannot leave the road so that any party attacking them may be always sure of doing it to advantage by taking post in the woods by the roads or along the stone walls where they will not venture to follow them and as an encouragement to any brave parties who will endeavor to surprise some of them the general offers  00 dollars for every trooper with his horse and accoutrements which shall be brought in and so in proportion for any part to be divided according to the rank and pay of the partyâ€”orderly book    october      the communication between this and the grand division of the army is in great measure cut off therefore it will be some time before you have any account from his excellency general washingtonâ€”greene to the president of congress    october      the general positively forbids any person going down to the lines and firing upon the enemy without an order from a general officerâ€”proper scouting parties are to be kept out by each major general for intelligence the general in a ride he took yesterday to reconoitre the grounds about this way was surprised and shocked to find both officers and soldiers straggling all over the country under one idle pretence or other when they cannot tell the hour or minute the camp may be attacked and their services indispensably necessary he once more positively orders that neither officer or soldier shall stir out of camp without leave the first from the brigadier under whom he serves and the latter from the commanding officer of the corps they belong to the provost marshal is to take up all stragglers and it is enjoined upon all officers to seize every man who fires his gun without leave and to have him tied up immediately and receive  0 lashes it is with astonishment the general hears that some officers have taken horses between the enemys camp and ours and sent them into the country for their private use can it be possible that persons bearing commissions and fighting in such a cause can degrade themselves into plunderers of horses he hopes every officer will set his face against it in future and does insist that the colonels and commanding officers of regiments immediately enquire into the matter and report to him who have been guilty of these practices and that they take an account of the horses in their respective encampments and send to the quartermastergeneral all that are not in some public serviceâ€”orderly book   st
