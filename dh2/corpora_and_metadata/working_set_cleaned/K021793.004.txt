people as could have been wished but as it is an object too curious to be passed over in silence we shall give our readers the most particular account that could be procured they articulated their words very distinctly though they made a great motion with their lips when they were speaking and their utterance was rather vociferous particularly when they intended to show their disapprobation of any thing when they were pleased they would manifest their satisfaction by saying he with a long flexion of the voice in a loud and shril tone they frequently repeated the word tut when in company with the english several times together which was supposed to be an expression of astonishment and admiration upon the whole their language was neither harsh nor inharmonious as will appear from the

happened on their landing on the last mentioned country  early in the morning of the   th of august    0 the cable broke near the ring in the attempt to weigh the anchor on which another anchor was dropped which prevented the ships driving as the loss of an anchor might have been attended with future ill consequences the boats were sent to sweep for it but their first attempt being unsuccessful they were dispatched again in the afternoon when it was found and the ship being brought up to it they weighed it yet unfortunately just as they were going to ship it the hawser slipped and all their labor was frustrated determined however not to lose the anchor they reapplied their endeavors on the following morning when they were attended with success  soon after the anchor was weighed the ship got under sail steering northwest and in a few hours one of the boats which was ahead made the signal for shoalwater the ship instantly brought to with all her sails standing and a survey being taken of the sea around her it was found that she had met with another narrow escape as she was almost encompassed with shoals and was likewise so situated between them that she must have struck before the boats crew had made the signal if she had been half the length of a cable on either side in the afternoon she made sail with the ebb tide and got out of danger before sunset when she brought to for the night  the meeting with these shoals having determined the captain to alter his intended course he sailed again the next morning sunday the   th and soon got into deep water they now steered a westward course and as no land was within sight held it on till the dusk of the evening when they shortened sail and made opposite tacks during the night the next morning they pursued their voyage again shortening sail at night and tacking till daybreak of the   th when they steered due north in search of new guinea  they now observed many parts of the sea covered with a kind of brown scum to which the sailors gave the name of spawn it is formed of an incredible number of minute particles each of which when seen through the microscope was found to consist of a considerable number of tubes and these tubes were subdivided into little cells the scum being burnt and yiedling no smell like what is produced by animal substances it was concluded that it was of the vegetable kind this scum which has been often seen on the coast of brazil generally makes its appearance near the land  a bird which is called the noddy was found this evening among the rigging of the ship land having been seen this day from the masthead they stood off and on all night and at daybreak they sailed toward it with a brisk gale  between six and seven oclock they had sight of a small island distant about three miles from the main land which has already been distinguished by the names of st bartholomew and whermoysen it is a very flat island clothed with trees among which is the cocoanut and was judged to be inhabited by the smoke of fires which were seen on several parts of it the boats were now sent out to sound as the water was shallow but as the ship in sailing two leagues had found no increase in its depth signals were made for the boats to return on board and the vessel stood out to sea till midnight and then tacked and stood in for land till the morning when they were about four leagues distant from it they had sight of it from the deck and its appearance was still flat and woody abundance of the brown scum was still seen on the surface of the sea and the tars convinced that it was not spawn gave it the whimsical name of seasawdust  the ship now held a northward course barely within sight of land till the  d of september and as the water was but just deep enough to navigate the vessel many unsuccessful attempts were made to bring her near enough to get on shore it was therefore determined to land in one of the boats while the ship kept plying off and on  in consequence of this resolution on the  d of september the captain accompanied by messrs banks and solander and attended by the boats crew and mr bankss servants set out in the pinnace but when they came within two hundred yards of the shore the water was so shallow that they were obliged to leave the boat in the care of two of the sailors and wade to land they were no sooner clear of the water than they saw several prints of human feet on the sand below highwatermark from whence it was evident that the natives had been very lately there about one hundred yards from the water there was a thick wood along the borders of which they walked till they arrived on the banks of a brook of water on which was situated a fine grove of cocoanut trees which abounded with fruit  at a small distance from the trees stood an indian hut which had been thatched with their leaves of which some yet remained and round the hut were scattered many cocoanutshells the fruit of which seemed to have been lately gathered not far from this grew the breadfruit tree and a number of plantains  our adventurers were now near a quarter of a mile from the pinnace when three of the natives ran out of the woods about one hundred yards beyond them shouting in the most violent manner they instantly ran toward our countrymen the first of the three throwing something out of his hand which flew on one side of him burning in the same manner as gunpowder but making no noise while the other two threw their lances the english now fired when the natives stopped and cast another lance on which the muskets were loaded with ball and again fired  the poor indians now ran off with expedition having most probably been wounded in the unequal conflict captain cook and his companions unwilling farther to injure those who could not originally have intended them any harm retreated hastily to the boat while the men that had been left in the care of her made signals that more of the natives were advancing toward the coast several of these were soon seen and stood still as if waiting for the main body of their companions captain cook and the party having reached the boat rowed abreast of the natives who by this time were assembled to the number of about eighty their stature was nearly the same with that of the inhabitants of new south wales but their color was not quite so dark but like them they wore their hair cropped short during the survey that was taken of them they continued letting off their fires a few at a time in a kind of regular platoons they were discharged by means of a piece of stick almost like a hollow cane which being swung sideways produced fire and smoke exactly like that occasioned by the firing of small arms the crew on board the ship saw this strange phenomenon and thought the natives had firearms the gentlemen having satisfied their curiosity by attentively looking at these people fired some muskets above their heads the balls from which being heard to rattle among the trees the natives deliberately retired the lances which had been thrown soon after the gentlemen landed were made of a reed or bamboo cane and the points were made of hard wood barbed in several places it is imagined that these lances were discharged by means of a throwing stick as they flew with great swiftness above sixty yards  when this party returned to the ship some of the officers entreated the captain to send men on shore to cut down the cocoanut trees in order to procure the nuts but this with equal wisdom and humanity he refused sensible that the poor indians who could ill brook even the landing of a small party on their coast would risk their lives and of course sacrifice them in defense of their property the whole coast of this country is lowland but clothed with a richness of trees and herbage which exceeds all description  on monday the  d of september    0 the ship got under sail and early in the morning of the  th passed two small islands on the latter of which captain cook would have landed but as they had then only ten fathom water and as the ground was rocky and the wind blew fresh he might have endangered the safety of the ship they now sailed at a moderate rate with various soundings till three oclock the next morning after which they had no ground with one hundred and twenty fathom before noon they had sight of land which was conjectured to be either the arrou islands or timor laoet but they are not accurately laid down in any of the charts hitherto published  on the evening of the  th they saw what had the appearance of land and the next morning were convinced that the first land they had seen was timor and the last timor laoet the ship stood off and on during the night when a number of fires were seen on the island and the next morning smoke was seen in several places from whence it was conjectured that the place was well peopled the land near the shore was covered with high trees not unlike pines farther back were cocoatrees and mangroves there were many salt water creeks and several spots of ground which appeared to have been cleared by art and the whole country rose by gradual slopes into hills of a very considerable height  as the land and sea breezes were now very slight they continued in sight of the island for two days when it was observed that the hills reached in many places quite to the sea coast and where that was not the case there were large and noble groves of the cocoanut tree which ran about a mile up the country at which distance great numbers of houses and plantations were seen the plantations were surrounded with fences and extended nearly to the summits of the most lofty hills yet neither the natives nor cattle were seen on any of them which was thought a very extraordinary circumstance fine groves of the fanpalm shaded the houses from the rays of the sun  on the   th they had sight of the little island called rotte and the same day saw the island semau at a distance to the southward of timor the island of rotte is chiefly covered with brushy wood without leaves but there are a number of fanpalm trees on it growing near the sandy beaches and the whole consists of alternate hills and valleys the island of semau is not so hilly as timor but resembles it greatly in other respects  at ten oclock this night a dull reddish light was seen in the air many parts of which emitted rays of a brighter color which soon vanished and were succeeded by others of the same kind this phenomenon which reached about ten degrees above the horizon bore a considerable resemblance to the aurora borealis only that the rays of light which it emitted had no tremulous motion it was surveyed for two hours during which time its brightness continued undiminished  as the ship was now clear of all the islands which had been laid down in such maps as were on board they made sail during the night and were surprised the next morning at the sight of an island to the west southwest which they flattered themselves was a new discovery before noon they had sight of houses groves of cocoanut trees and large flocks of sheep this was a welcome sight to people whose health was declining for want of refreshments and it was instantly resolved to attempt the purchase of what they stood so much in need of the second lieutenant was immediately dispatched in the pinnace in search of a landingplace and he took with him such things as it was thought might be acceptable to the natives  during mr gores absence the people on board saw two men on horseback upon the hills who frequently stopped to take a view of the vessel the lieutenant soon returned with an account that he had entered a little cove near which stood a few houses that several men advanced and invited him to land and that they conversed together as well as they could by signs he reported that these people were very like the malays both in person and dress that they had no other arms but a knife which each of them wore stuck in his girdle  as the lieutenant could not find any place in which the ship might come to an anchor he was dispatched again with money and goods to buy such necessaries as were immediately wanted for those who were sick dr solander attended the lieutenant and during their absence the ship stood on and off the shore soon after the boat had put off two other horsemen were seen from the ship one of whom had a laced hat on and was dressed in a coat and waistcoat of the fashion of europe these men rode about on shore taking little notice of the boat but regarding the ship with the utmost attention as soon as the boat reached the shore some other persons on horseback and many on foot hastened to the spot and it was observed that some cocoanuts were put into the boat from whence it was concluded that a traffic had commenced with the natives a signal being made from the boat that the ship might anchor in a bay at some distance she immediately bore away for it  when the lieutenant came on board he reported that he could not purchase any cocoanuts as the owner of them was absent and that what he had brought were given him in return for which he had presented the natives with some linen the method by which he learnt that there was a harbor in the neighborhood was by the natives drawing a kind of rude map on the sand in which the harbor and a town near it were represented it was likewise hinted to him that fruit fowls hogs and sheep might be there obtained in great abundance he saw several of the principal inhabitants of the island who wore chains of gold about their necks and were dressed in fine linen the word portuguese being frequently repeated by the indians it was conjectured that some natives of portugal were on the island and one of the boats crew being of that kingdom he spoke to the islanders in his own language but he soon found that they had only learnt a few words of which they did not know the meaning while the natives were endeavoring to represent the situation of the town near the harbor one of them in order to be more particular in directions informed the english that they would see something which he endeavored to describe by placing his fingers across each other and the portuguese sailor took it for granted that he could mean nothing but a cross when the boats crew were on the point of returning to the ship the gentleman who had been seen on horseback in the dress of europe came down to the beach but the lieutenant did not think it proper to hold a conference with him because he had left his commission on board the ship  in the evening when the ship had entered the bay to which they had been recommended an indian town was seen at a small distance upon which a jack was hoisted on the foretopmast head presently afterward three guns were fired and dutch colors were hoisted in the town the ship however held on her way and came to an anchor at seven in the evening  the colors being seen hoisted on the beach the next morning the captain concluded that the dutch had a settlement on the island he therefore dispatched the second lieutenant to acquaint the governor or other principal resident who they were and that the ship had put in for necessary refreshments the lieutenant having landed he was received by a kind of guard of something more than twenty indians armed with muskets who having taken down the colors from the beach proceeded without the least military order and thus escorted him to the town where the colors had been hoisted the preceding evening  the lieutenant was now conducted to the raja or king of the island to whom by means of a portuguese interpreter he made known his business the raja said he was ready to supply the ship with the necessary refreshments but that he could not trade with any other people but the dutch with whom he was in alliance without having first obtained their consent but that he would make application to the dutch agent who was the only white man among them to this agent whose name was lange and who proved to be the person that was seen from the ship in the european dress a letter was dispatched and in a few hours he came to the town behaved politely to the lieutenant and told him he might buy what he thought proper of the inhabitants of the island  this offer being freely made and readily accepted the raja and mr lange intimated their wishes to go on board the ship and that two of the boats crew might be left as hostages for their safe return the lieutenant gratified both these requests and took them on board just before dinner was served it was thought that they would have sat down without ceremony but after some hesitation the raja intimated his doubts whether being a black they would permit him to sit down with them the politeness of the officers soon removed his scruples and the greatest good humor and festivity prevailed among them as dr solander and another gentleman on board were tolerable proficients in dutch they acted as interpreters between mr lange and the officers while some of the sailors who understood portuguese conversed with such of the rajas attendants as spoke that language the chief part of the dinner was mutton which the raja having tasted he begged an english sheep and the only one which they had left was given him he then asked for a dog and mr banks gave him his greyhound and a spyingglass was presented to him on mr langes intimating that it would be acceptable  the visitors now told captain cook that there was great plenty of fowls hogs sheep and buffaloes on the island numbers of which should be conveyed to the sea shore on the following day that he might purchase what was necessary for the recovery of the sick and for sea stores this welcome news gave great spirits to the company and the bottle went so briskly round that mr lange and his companions became almost intoxicated they had however the resolution to express a desire to depart before they were quite drunk when they came upon deck the marines were under arms to receive them and the raja intimating that he should be glad to see them exercise the captain gave orders that he should be indulged and three rounds were fired he was equally pleased and surprised at their maneuvers and particularly charmed when they cocked their firelocks exclaiming violently that all the locks made but one click this being ended messrs solander and banks went ashore with the visitors who were saluted at their departure with nine guns which they returned with three cheers  when they came to the town the english gentlemen tasted their palm wine which was sweet and not unpleasant it is made of the fresh juice of the tree without being fermented the houses of the natives consisted of nothing more than a floor of boards over which was a roof of thatch supported by pillars about four feet in height  on the following day the captain attended by several gentlemen went on shore to return the rajas visit but their principal intention was to buy the refreshments which had been mentioned the preceding day when they landed they were chagrined to find that the cattle had not been driven down to the beach they went on to the town where they observed that the house of assembly and some few other houses which had been built by the dutch east india company were distinguished from the houses of the natives by having a piece of wood almost in the shape of cows horns fixed at each end of the roof and these they concluded were what the portuguese sailor had imagined to be crosses from the indian having crossed his fingers when he was describing the town  the raja was at the house of assembly surrounded by many of his principal subjects and mr lange also attended captain cook having informed them that he had loaded his boat with goods which he wished to exchange for necessary refreshments permission was given him to land his effects the captain now endeavored to make an agreement for the hogs sheep and buffaloes which were to be paid for in cash but this business was no sooner hinted at than mr lange took his leave having first told the captain that he must make his agreement with the natives and adding that he had received a letter from the governor of concordia in timor the contents of which should be disclosed at his return  as they had now no fresh provisions on board the gentlemen were unwilling to return to the ship before they had dined they therefore requested the rajas permission to buy a small hog and some rice and hoped he would order his people to dress the dinner to this the raja very obligingly replied that if the gentlemen had stomachs to eat of indian cookery he would have the honor of considering them as his guests a dinner being thus procured the captain sent off the boat to bring liquors from the ship  late in the afternoon the company sat down on mats which had been spread for them on the floor having been first conducted to a servant who had a vessel made of the leaves of the fanpalm containing water to wash their hands in which the indian assisted them having waited some time for the raja they enquired the reason of his absence and were informed that the person who gave the entertainment never partook of it but that the raja was ready to come and taste of what was provided if the gentlemen entertained any idea that the meat was unwholesome having assured the natives that they did not harbor any such suspicion they began their dinner which consisted of pork and rice very excellent of their kinds served up in thirtysix dishes and three earthen bowls filled with a kind of broth in which the pork had been boiled the spoons were formed of leaves but were so small that the hunger of the guests would scarcely allow them patience to use them  when dinner was ended the captain invited the raja to drink wine with him but this he declined saying that the man who entertained company should never get drunk with his guests and that the only certain way to avoid drunkenness was to refrain from tasting the liquor the gentlemen left the remains of their dinner to their servants and the boats crew who not being able to eat it all the rajas female servants who came to take away the utensils insisted that they should take with them all that remained  when the bottle had circulated some time captain cook began to enquire after the cattle that were promised to be driven down to the beach when mr lange informed him that in the letter which he had received from the governor of concordia instructions were given that if the ship should touch at the island and be in want of provisions she should be supplied but that he was not to permit her to remain longer than was absolutely necessary that no presents were to be made to the natives of low rank nor even left with their superiors to be divided among them after the ship had sailed but he added that any trifling civilities received from the indians might be acknowledged by a present of beads or other articles of very small value it is a very probable conjecture that the whole of this story was of mr langes own manufacture and solely calculated to draw all the presents of any value into his own pocket  soon after this the captain was informed that some sheep had been driven down to the beach but had been conveyed away before the men could get money from the ship to pay for them and that not a single hog or buffaloe had been driven down but that a small number of fowls and a quantity of the palmsyrup had been bought heartily vexed to be thus disappointed of the chief articles which were wanted the captain remonstrated with mr lange who told him that if he and his officers had gone to the spot they might have purchased any thing they pleased but that the indians imagined the seamen would impose on them with counterfeit money  this story was no more credited than the former but not to lose more time in a case of such urgency the captain instantly repaired to the beach but there were no cattle to be bought during his absence lange informed mr banks that the indians were offended that the seamen had not offered gold for what they had to sell and that no other metal would purchase their commodities but mr banks disdaining to hold farther conversation with a man who had been guilty of such repeated subterfuges left him abruptly some hours before this the raja had assigned a much more probable reason for the cattle not being brought to the beach saying that the buffaloes were too far up the country to be driven thither in the time in the evening the gentlemen returned to the ship not a little displeased at their disappointment  on the  0th the captain and doctor solander went again on shore and while the latter proceeded to the town in search of lange the captain staid on the beach with a view to buy cattle at this place was an old man who had been distinguished by the name of the prime minister because he appeared to be invested with considerable authority and the captain now presented him with a spyingglass in order to make a friend of him at present there was nothing brought for sale but a small buffaloe for which five guineas were demanded though the captain knew that this was double its value yet he bid three guineas as he was willing to begin dealing at any rate the person who had it to sell said he could not take the money till the raja had been informed what was offered on which a man was sent to him who soon came back with a massage that five guineas would be the lowest price this the captain refused to give on which a second messenger was dispatched who staying a long time captain cook was anxiously expecting his return when he saw dr solander coming toward the beach escorted by more than a hundred persons some of whom had lances in their hands and the rest were armed with muskets when the doctor arrived at the marketingplace he informed the captain that lange had interpreted to him a message from the raja the substance of which was that the natives were averse to all traffic with the english because they would not give above half the real worth of the things which were offered for sale and that all trading whatever should be prohibited after that day  a native of timor whose parents were portuguese came down with this party and delivered to the captain what was pretended to be the order of the raja and which was in substance the same as what lange had told dr solander but it was afterward discovered that this man was a confederate of langes in the scheme of extortion the english gentlemen had at the same time no boubt but that the supposed order of the raja was a contrivance of these men and while they were debating how they should act in this critical conjuncture anxious to bring the affair to a speedy issue the portuguese began to drive away such of the natives as had brought palmsyrup and fowls to sell and others who were now bringing sheep and buffaloes to the market  just at this juncture captain cook happening to look at the old man who had been distinguished by the name of prime minister imagined that he saw in his features a disapprobation of the present proceedings and willing to improve the advantage he grasped the indians hand and gave him an old broad sword this welltimed present produced all the good effects that could be wished the prime minister was enraptured at so honorable a mark of distinction and brandishing his sword over the head of the impertinent portuguese he made both him and a man who commanded the party sit down behind him on the ground the whole business was now accomplished the natives eager to supply whatever was wanted brought their cattle in for sale and the market was soon stocked for the first two buffaloes captain cook gave ten guineas but he afterward purchased them by way of exchange giving a musket for each and at this rate he might have bought any number he thought proper there seems to be no doubt but that lange had a profit out of the first two that were sold and that his reason for having said that the natives would take nothing but gold for their cattle was that he might the more easily share in the produce captain cook purchased of the natives of this island some hundred gallons of palmsyrup a small quantity of garlic a large number of eggs some limes and cocoanuts thirty dozen of fowls three hogs six sheep and nine buffaloes  having at length obtained these necessary refreshments captain cook prepared for sailing from this place but before we attend him on his voyage it may be proper to give a description of the island with an account of its produce and the customs and manners of its inhabitants  the island of savu is situated in  0 degrees    minutes south latitude and     degrees  0 minutes west longitude and has hitherto been very little known or very imperfectly described its length is between twenty and thirty miles but its breadth could not be ascertained by captain cook who saw only the north side of it the harbor in which the ship lay was called seba from a district of the country so denominated and there are two other bays on different parts of the island at the time the endeavor lay there it was near the end of the dry season when it had not rained for almost seven months nor was there a running stream of fresh water to be seen and the natives were supplied only by small springs situated at a distance up the country yet even in this dry season the appearance of the island was enchanting beyond description near the coast the land is level and well clothed with the palm called arecas and cocoanut trees farther off the ground rises in the most gradual ascent and is covered with fan palm trees even to the tops of the hills so as to present a regular grove to the eye the rains in this country cease in march or april and fall again in october or november and these rains produce abundance of indico millet and maize which grow beneath the noblest trees in the universe  besides these articles the island produces tobacco cotton betle tamarinds limes oranges mangoes guinea corn rice callevances and water melons a trifling quantity of cinnamon was seen and some european herbs such as garlic fennel cellery and marjoram besides which there are fruits of various kinds and particularly the blimbi which has a sharp taste and is said to be a very fine pickle but it is not eaten raw its length is from three to four inches it is nearly as thick as a mans thumb of an oval form covered with a very thin skin of a light green and contains a number of seeds ranged in the shape of a star  several buffaloes were seen on this island which were almost as large as an ox and from a pair of enormous horns of this animal which mr banks saw it was conjectured that some of them were much larger yet they did not weigh more than half as much as an ox of the same apparent size having lost the greater part of their flesh through the late dry weather the meat however was juicy and of a delicate flavor the horns of these animals bend backwards they have no dewlaps nor scarce any hair on their skins and their ears are remarkably large the other tame animals on the island are dogs cats pigeons fowls hogs goats sheep asses and horses  few of the horses are above twelve hands high yet they are full of mettle and pace naturally in an expeditious manner the natives ride them with a halter only the hogs of this country are fed on the husks of rice and palmsyrup mixed with water and are remarkably fine and fat the sheep are not unlike a goat and are therefore called cabritos their ears which are long hang down under their horns their noses are arched and their bodies are covered with hair the fowls are of the game kind and though they are rather large the hen lays a very small egg the seacoast furnishes the inhabitants with turtle but not in any great abundance  the natives of the island of savu are rather below the middle stature their hair is black and strait and persons of all ranks as well those that are exposed to the weather as those that are not have one general complexion which is the dark brown the men are well formed and sprightly and their features differ much from each other the women on the contrary have all one set of features and are very short and broad built  the men have silver pincers hanging by strings round their necks with which they pluck out the hair of their beards and both men and women root out the hair that grows under the arms the hair of the womens heads is tied in a club behind while that of the men is fastened by a comb to the top of the head the men wear a kind of turban on the head formed of muslin cotton or even silk handkerchiefs but the heads of the women have no covering  the dress of the men consists of two pieces of cotton cloth one of which is bound round the middle and the lower edge of it being drawn pretty tight between the legs the upper edge is left loose so as to form a kind of pocket in which they carry their knives and other things the other piece being passed under the former on the back of the wearer the ends of it are carried over the shoulders and tucked into the pocket before the women draw the upper edge of the piece round the waist tight while the lower edge dropping to the knees makes a kind of petticoat the other piece of cloth is fastened across the breast and under the arms this cloth which is manufactured by the natives is died blue while in the yarn and as it is of various shades its look when it comes to be worn is very beautiful  the ornaments of the natives of savu are very numerous and consist of rings beads worn round the neck and on the wrists and chains of plaited gold wire likewise worn round the neck these things were worn by both sexes but the women had likewise girdles of beads round their waists which helped to keep up the petticoat many of the boys wore brass wire passed several times round the arms above the elbow and some of the men who were said to be the sons of the rajas wore rings of ivory above an inch thick and two inches broad on the same part of the arm one man possessed a silverheaded cane supposed to have been a present from the dutch east india company as their mark was engraven on the silver the raja and the principal officer of his household were commonly habited in night gowns of ordinary chintz but one time when captain cook waited on the raja he was dressed in a black stuff robe  most of the men had their names marked on their arms and the women a black ornament just under the bend of the elbow impressed so that it could not be rubbed out on enquiry it was found that this practice had been common among the indians long before they were visited by any europeans and it was said that the necks and breasts of the inhabitants of the adjacent islands were marked with circles  it could not be certainly known how these black marks were impressed but the following extract from m bossus account of some indians who dwell on the banks of the akanza a river in north america will afford a very probable conjecture how the operation is performed  the akanzas says this writer have adopted me and as a mark of my privilege have imprinted the figure of a roebuck upon my thigh which was done in this manner an indian having burnt some straw diluted the ashes with water and with this mixture drew the figure upon my skin he then retraced it by pricking the lines with needles so as at every juncture just to draw the blood and the blood mixing with the ashes of the straw forms a figure which can never be effaced  the houses on the island of savu are of different lengths from twenty feet to four hundred according to the rank of the inhabitant and are fixed on posts about four or five feet from the ground the houses are generally divided into three rooms of equal size the center room being set apart for the use of the women and sometimes smaller rooms are enclosed from the sides of the building the whole of which is thatched with the leaves of the palm tree  the natives eat of all the tame animals which the island produces but they prefer the hog to all the rest next to hogs flesh they admire that of the horse to which succeeds the buffalo and then the poultry and they like the flesh of cats and dogs much better than that of goats and sheep fish is not eaten but by the poorer people nor even by them but when some business demands their attendance near the seacoast and then each man has a small casting net which he wears tied round his body when he has not occasion to use it  the fanpalm is the most remarkable and most useful tree that grows on the island its uses being equally great and various soon after the buds put forth the natives cut them and tying under them little baskets formed of the leaves of the tree a liquor drops into them which has the taste of a light wine and is the common liquor of all the inhabitants the men climb the trees twice a day to bring down this liquor but as a great deal more is thus obtained than can be consumed by drinking a part of the remainder is made into coarse sugar very excellent of its kind and the rest is boiled in earthen pots till it is reduced to a syrup resembling treacle but of a much finer flavor and with this syrup the natives fatten their hogs and dogs the leaves of the tree are applied to the various uses of making tobaccopipes umbrellas cups baskets and the thatching of houses the fruit of this tree is nearly of the size of a full grown turnip but the natives are not fond of it nor do they suffer much of it to come to perfection as they wound the blossoms for the sake of the liquor that distills from them the kernels of the fruit must be eaten before it is ripe otherwise they are so hard that the teeth will not penetrate them  as wood for firing is very scarce on the island the natives by the following method make a very little of it answer the ends of cookery and distillation a hollow is dug under ground in a direct line about two yards long with a hole at each end one of which is large and the other small the fire is put in at the largest hole while the smaller one serves for a draught circular holes are made through the earth which covers this cavity and on these holes are set earthen pots which being large in the middle and smaller toward the bottom the fire acts upon a considerable part of their surface these pots contain most commonly about eight or nine gallons each and they are kept continually boiling with a very trifling quantity of fuel such as a palmleaf or a dry stalk in this manner all their victuals are boiled as well as their syrup and sugar  both the men and women chew betle and areca mixed with a sort of lime composed of shells and coral stones and as they frequently add tobacco to the other ingredients and acquire this disgustful practice almost in their infancy there is not a sweet breath or a sound set of teeth in the whole island they sometimes smoke tobacco and the women particularly swallow the smoke their pipes are made of the palmleaf about the size of a goose quill and half a foot long in one end of which they put the tobacco designed for smoking  the island consists of five divisions each of which has a raja or chief governor of its own these divisions are called timo massara regeeua laai and seba it was on this last division that our english adventurers went on shore the raja of which was between thirty and forty years of age and remarkable for his corpulency he governs his people with the most absolute authority but takes on him very little of the parade or pomp of royalty the prime minister who has been heretofore mentioned appeared to be invested with great power and almost wholly to direct the actions of the raja yet such were the abilities and integrity of this man that the people universally adored him when any dispute happens among the natives it is instantly settled by the raja and his counselors in the most equitable and satisfactory manner  the history of this island depends chiefly on the authority of mr lange the dutch factor who informed captain cook that it was able to raise seven thousand three hundred fighting men on the shortest notice these are armed with lances spears muskets targets and poleaxes which last are not unlike a woodbill only that they are much heavier and have strait edges the natives are so expert in the use of their lances that they will throw them with such force and exactness as to pierce a man through the heart at the distance of sixty or seventy yards notwithstanding this skill and disposition for war it is said that the rajas have lived in the most perfect harmony for several ages  while captain cook was on the island he saw a great gun before the townhouse and some swivels and pateraroes but the great gun which was almost consumed by rust lay with the touchhole to the ground and the swivels and pateraroes were not in their carriages in the townhouse were a number of spears and targets of as many different sizes as there were weapons and with these the natives were armed when they came down with dr solander with a view to influence the market the insides of the muskets were almost destroyed by rust though their outsides were kept clean and bright the men had very little if any powder or ball in their cartridgeboxes but a piece of paper was put into each hole as if they had been properly furnished it has been already mentioned that they marched in the most irregular manner and each man brought with him a little tobacco a fowl or some other trifle for sale  the inhabitants of savu are divided into five ranks the rajas the landowners manufacturers laborers and slaves the landowners are respected in proportion to the extent of their lands and the number of their slaves which last are bought and sold with the estates to which they belong but when a slave is bought separately a fat hog is the price of the purchase though a man may sell his slave in this manner or convey him with his lands yet his power over him extends no farther for he must not even strike him without the rajas permission the estates of these landowners are of very different extent for some of them possess not above five slaves and some five hundred when a man of rank goes abroad one of his slaves follows him with a silver hilted sword or hanger ornamented with horse hair tassels while another is furnished with a little bag containing tobacco betle areca and lime and even the rajas themselves take no farther state upon them  the natives of savu entertain a veneration for antiquity superior perhaps to that of any other people in the world their principal boast is a long line of venerable ancestors the houses that have been well tenanted for successive generations are held in the highest esteem and even the stones which are worn smooth by having been sat upon for ages become valuable from that very circumstance the man whose progenitors have bequeathed him any of these stones or whose opulence has enabled him to purchase them causes them to be ranged round his habitation for his servants and slaves to sit upon  in the chief town of each district the raja causes a huge stone to be set up as a monument of his reign thirteen such stones were seen in the province of seba and the remains of many others that have suffered greatly by the wasting hand of time these stones are all placed on the top of a hill and some of them are so enormously large that it is impossible to conceive by what contrivance they could have been placed in such a situation nor could any information in this respect be obtained from the natives from these monuments it is evident that the island has been regularly governed for a series of ages past  on the death of a raja proclamation is made that all his subjects shall hold a solemn festival on which they proceed to the hill where these stones are erected and feast for several weeks or months killing every animal that can be found to furnish out the treat which is daily served upon the monumental stones when the whole stock is exhausted they are compelled to a severe fast and when it happens that the feast ends in the dry season when they cannot get vegetables to eat they have no other subsistence than the palm syrup and water till the few animals that escape the general massacre have bred a sufficient number for a fresh supply except indeed that the adjacent districts may afford some relief the natives of savu have an instrument with which they clear the cotton of its seeds which is only about seven inches in height and fourteen in length but is constructed on common mechanical principles they have likewise a machine with which they spin by hand in the same manner as the women of england did before the use of spinningwheels was known the yarn they make is dyed as beforementioned and they were once observed to be dying some girdles for the women of a deep red color  the natives in general are robust and healthy and had the appearance of being longlived the smallpox has found its way to this island and is as much dreaded as the pestilence when this disorder attacks any person he is carried to some spot at a great distance from any house where his food is conveyed to him by means of a long stick for no one will venture very near the invalid who is thus left to take his chance of life or death  the island of savu having been visited by the portuguese almost at their first sailing into this part of the world they established a settlement upon it but in a little time they were succeeded by the dutch who though they did not formally possess themselves of the island sent a number of trading vessels to establish a commerce with the natives it is thought that the dutch purchases are chiefly confined to provisions for the supply of the spice islands the inhabitants of which cultivating almost every spot of ground for the spice trade breed but a small number of cattle a few years ago the dutch east india company made an agreement with the several rajas of the island by which it was covenanted that a quantity of rice maize and calevances should be annually furnished to the dutch who in return supply the rajas with arrack cutlery wares linen silk and some other things small vessels each of which is manned by ten indians are sent from timor to bring away the maize and calevances and a ship which brings the articles which are furnished by the dutch receives the rice on board once a year and there being three bays on the coast this vessel anchors in each of them in its turn the rajas accept the dutch articles of commerce as a present and they and their chief attendants drink incessantly of the arrack till it is all gone in the agreement abovementioned the rajas stipulated that a dutch resident should be constantly on the island to observe that their part of the contract was fulfilled  the dutch having thus concluded the treaty sent mr lange to act as their resident and a kind of assistant to him whose father was a portuguese and his mother a native of timor with one frederick craig whose father was a dutchman and his mother an indian once every two months lange is attended by fifty slaves on horseback and in this state visits each of the rajas and if the crops are ripe orders vessels to convey them immediately to timor so that they are not even housed on the island it is a part of langes business to persuade the landowners to plant if he sees that there has been any neglect on their part he constantly takes with him a quantity of arrack by the help of which he does not fail of making advantageous bargains with the rajas  lange had been on this island ten years during all which time he had not seen a white person except those who came annually in the dutch ship to carry off the rice he is married to an indian woman a native of the island of timor and he lives in the same manner as the inhabitants of savu whose language he speaks better than any other like them too he sits on the ground and chews betle and has so perfectly adopted their manners that he is an absolute indian except in dress and complexion  mr craig is employed in teaching the children to write and read and instructing them in the principles of christianity the new testament a catechism and some other small books of divinity have been printed in the language of savu and the adjacent islands at the expense of the dutch mr craig said there were six hundred christians in the township of seba only yet there is neither a church nor a clergyman throughout the island  the religion of such of the natives of savu as have not embraced christianity is a singular sort of paganism as every man makes choice of his own god and worships him according to his own fancy so that the variety of deities and the methods of adoring them are scarcely fewer than the number of inhabitants the morality of these people however is of the purest kind a robbery is scarce ever committed and a murder is never perpetrated when any disputes arise between the natives they instantly submit the point in debate to the decision of the raja and rest perfectly satisfied with his determination no man is permitted to marry more than one wife yet a violation of the marriage bed or even the crime of simple fornication is almost wholly unknown among them happy people the purity of whose morals renders them fit objects of the envy and emulation of the christian world  of the islands in the neighborhood of savu the principal is timor which is annually visited by the dutch residents on the other islands in order to make up their accounts some of the towns on the north side of timor are in the hands of the portuguese but the dutch possess the far greater proportion of the island on which they have built a fort and erected several storehouses  there are three small islands called the solars which produce a great abundance of the various necessaries of life that are carried in small vessels to the dutch settlement on the island of timor these islands are low and flat and one of them has a commodious harbor  westward from the solars lies the little island of end which is yet in the possession of the portuguese who have built a considerable town called larntuca on the northeast point of it and close to the town is an harbor where ships may ride in safety  the island of rotte has a dutch resident on it whose business is similar to that of mr lange on the island of savu rotte produces besides such things as are common to the other islands a considerable quantity of sugar which is now made to a great degree of perfection  there is likewise a small island lying to the westward of savu the chief produce of which is arecanuts of which the dutch receive in exchange for european commodities as large a quantity every year as will load two vessels  a french ship was wrecked on the coast of timor about two years before the endeavor was in these seas she had been lodged on the rock several days when the wind tore her to pieces in an instant and the captain with the greater number of the seamen were drowned but a lieutenant and about eighty men having reached the shore traveled across the country of concordia where their immediate necessities were relieved after which they returned to the wreck in company with some dutch and indians who assisted them in recovering all their chests of bullion some of their guns and other effects which being done they returned to concordia where they remained several weeks but in this interval death made such havoc among them that not above half their number remained to be sent to their native country which was done as soon as a vessel could be fitted out for that purpose  to close the account of the island of savu it now only remains to give the following specimen of the language of its inhabitants  specimen of the language of the inhabitants of the island of savu momonne a man monama an old man monecopai a boy anawuneekee a child madda the

island of savu on the   st of september    0 and bent her course westward in the afternoon of this day a little flat island was discovered in  0 degrees    minutes south latitude and     degrees    minutes west longitude which has not been laid down in any of the charts hitherto published  when the ship got clear of the several islands beforementioned there was a continual swell of the sea from the south which captain cook imputed to the position of the coast of new south wales imagining it to have determined the sea in that direction  on the   th they steered northwest the whole day in order to get sight of the land of java and on the  0th the captain received from most of the officers and seamen their respective journals of the voyage regarding which he advised them to observe the most profound secrecy and he likewise possessed himself of the logbook in the night following there was a storm of thunder and lightning when the land of java was seen to the eastward by the brightness of the lightning in the morning they had sight of the island of cracatoa which is singular for the height of its peak  early in the morning of the  d of october when the ship was in fifteen fathom water she was close in with the coast of java along which they now steered as their faithful indian friend tupia was at this time extremely ill the captain dispatched a boat to the shore to endeavor to bring him some refreshing fruits and likewise to procure grass for the buffaloes as soon as the boat landed the inhabitants assisted the seamen in cutting grass for the cattle and in gathering a bunch of plantains and a few cocoanuts for which they received a shilling and which were brought off to the ship the land of java had a delightful appearance being every where well covered with trees  this day they had sight of two dutch vessels and an officer being dispatched to one of them to learn any interesting intelligence he brought word back that the swallow had reached the english channel in safety that disputes were carried to great lengths at home in regard to the ministers and in america on account of taxes and that the russians poles and turks were embroiled in a war the officer said that the vessels were dutch east indiamen bound from batavia one of them to the coast of malabar and the other to the island of ceylon he said likewise that there was a kind of packetboat which he had been told was appointed to carry letters from such dutch ships as came thither to batavia but captain cook conjectured that her business was to examine such ships as should pass the straight  the ship had now been some hours at anchor but a light breeze springing up in the evening they got under sail and continued to proceed at a slow rate during the night on the  d in the morning the dutch packetboat was observed sailing after the endeavor but she bore away again on the shifting of the wind  this changing of the wind obliging the endeavor to come to an anchor the master of the packetboat came alongside of her in one of the boats belonging to the country bringing with him ricebirds monkies parrots parroquets ducks fowls turtle and other things with an intention to sell them but as the stock which had been laid in at savu was not yet consumed and he had fixed very high prices on his commodities very few articles were purchased the captain however bought twenty or thirty fowls and a small turtle  the master of the packetboat had brought with him two books in one of which he wrote down the captains name and that of the vessel to be sent to the governor and council of the indies and in the other book he requested that some of the gentlemen on board would likewise write down the name of the vessel with that of the captain where she came from to what port she was bound and as many particulars respecting any person on board as themselves might think necessary to satisfy the curiosity of any of their friends who might afterward enquire for them in this book many portuguese vessels and some of other countries had made entries of the same kind but a lieutenant on board the endeavor having written the ships name added only the words from europe yet of this the master of the packet took no other notice than by saying he was content with whatever they were pleased to write which was intended solely for the information of their friends  they now weighed the anchor and made repeated attempts to sail but the wind not blowing so as to enable the vessel to stem the current she lay to till the morning of the  th when a dutch officer came alongside the ship and sent a printed paper to the captain in exceeding bad english the contents of which were to enquire   st the ships name and to what nation she belonged   d whether she came from europe or any other place   d what place she had last departed from   th to what place she was bound   th how many ships belonging to the dutch company had been seen at the last coast the ship had left and their names   th if one or more of these ships had been in company with the endeavor and was or were sailed for that or any other place   th if during the voyage any thing remarkable had happened or been seen   th if any ships had been seen and hailed at sea or in the straight of sunda and what they were   th if they had brought any other news worthy of attention from the place whence the ship took her last departure or if any thing else had happened during the voyage that was worth communicating  these questions were undersigned batavia in the castle by order of the governor general and the counselors of india j brander bungl sec  it was observed that the officer had many other papers of the same kind in french dutch and other languages captain cook did not think proper to answer any of the above questions except the first and the fourth when the dutchman observed this he said that answers to the other questions were not material yet he seemed to contradict what he had just advanced by saying that he must dispatch the paper to batavia and that it would reach that place by noon on the following day this incident is particularly recorded because the examining the ships which sail through the straight is said to be a piece of dutch policy of very modern date  as soon as the dutch officer was departed the anchor was weighed but the ship was obliged to come to an anchor again in about four hours for want of wind to enable her properly to stem the current a breeze soon springing up the vessel held on her way till the following morning when she was again obliged to be brought to an anchor owing to the rapidity of the current this day and the next they weighed the anchor and brought to several times on the  th they weighed and stood clear of a large ledge of rocks which they had been near running fowl of the preceding day but before noon this day they were once more obliged to anchor near a little island which was not laid down in any chart that they had on board it is one of those that bear the name of the milles isles and messrs solander and banks having landed upon it collected a few plants and shot a bat which was a yard long being measured from the extreme points of the wings they also killed a few plovers in all respects like the english golden plover on this island the breadth of which does not exceed one hundred yards and the length five hundred they found a house and a little spot of cultivated ground and on it grew the palma christi from which the west indians make the castor oil  in a little time after the gentlemen came back to the ship some malays came alongside in a boat bringing with them some pumpkins dried fish and turtle for sale one of the turtles which weighed near one hundred and fifty pounds they sold for a dollar and seemed to expect the same piece of money for their pumpkins but it being hinted to them that a dollar was too much they desired that one might be cut and a piece of it given to them but this not being complied with they at length sold six and twenty pumpkins for a portuguese petacka when they departed they intimated their wishes that this transaction might not be mentioned at batavia  the ship now made but slow way till night when the land breeze springing up they sailed to the east southeast and on the following day by the assistance of the sea breeze they came to an anchor in the road of batavia at this place they found a number of large dutch vessels the harcourt east indiaman from england which had lost her passage to china and two ships belonging to the private trade of our india company  the endeavor had no sooner anchored than a ship was observed with a broad pendant flying from which a boat was dispatched to demand the name of the vessel with that of the commander etc to these enquiries captain cook gave such answers as he thought proper and the officer who commanded the boat departed this gentleman and the crew that attended him were so worn down by the unhealthiness of the climate that they appeared but as the shadows of men which the captain deemed a sad presage of the havoc which death would soon make among his crew yet at present there was not one invalid on board except the indian tupia the english tars whose want of foresight and defiance of danger is notorious seemed not to entertain the least idea that even sickness would attack a set of men so hardened as they were by different climates but alas they had very little idea of the fatal contagion which impregnates the air of batavia  the captain now dispatched an officer to the governor of the town to apologize for the endeavours not saluting for he had but three guns proper for the purpose except swivels and he was apprehensive that they would not be heard  the ship was at this time so leaky that she made about nine inches water an hour on the average part of her false keel was gone one of her pumps was totally useless and the rest so very much decayed that they could not last long the officers and seamen concurring in opinion that the ship could not safely put to sea again in this condition the captain resolved to solicit permission to heave her down but as he had learnt that this must be done in writing he drew up a petition and had it translated into dutch  on wednesday the  0th of october    0 the captain and the rest of the gentlemen went on shore and applied to the only english gentleman then resident at batavia this gentleman whose name was leith received his countrymen in the politest manner and entertained them at dinner with great hospitality mr leith informed them that a public hotel was kept in the town by order of the dutch government at which place merchants and other strangers were obliged to lodge and that the landlord of the hotel was bound to find them warehouses for their goods on the condition of his receiving ten shillings on every hundred pounds of their value but that as the endeavor was a kings ship her officers and the other gentlemen might reside where they thought proper only asking leave of the governor whose permission would be instantly obtained mr leith added that they might live cheaper in this way than at the hotel if they had any person who spoke the malay tongue on whom they could rely in the purchase of their provisions but as there was no such person among the whole ships crew the gentlemen immediately bespoke beds at the hotel  in the afternoon captain cook attended the governor general who received him politely and told him to wait on the council the next morning when his petition should be laid before them and every thing he solicited would be readily granted  late in the evening of this day there happened a most terrible storm of thunder and lightning accompanied with very heavy rain in this storm the mainmast of a dutch east indiaman was split and carried away by the deck and the maintopmast and topgallantmast were torn to pieces it is supposed that the lightning was attracted by an iron spindle at the maintopgallantmasthead the endeavor which was at a small distance from the dutch ship escaped without damage owing in captain cooks opinion to an electrical chain which conducted the lightning over the side of the vessel and he recommends chains of the same kind to be taken on board all ships to whatever part of the globe they may be bound a sentinel on board the endeavor who was charging his musket at the time of the storm had it shaken out of his hand and the rammerrod was broken in pieces the electrical chain looked like a stream of fire and the ship sustained a very violent shock  on tuesday the   th captain cook waited on the gentlemen of the council who informed him that all his requests should be complied with in the interim the other gentlemen made a contract with the master of the hotel to furnish them and their friends with as much tea coffee punch and tobacco as they might have occasion for and to keep them a separate table for nine shillings a day english money but on the condition that every person who should visit them should pay at the rate of four shillings and six pence for his dinner and the same sum for his supper and bed if he chose to sleep at the hotel they were likewise to pay for every servant that attended them fifteen pence a day  it was soon discovered that they had been vilely imposed on for these charges were above twice as much as would have been demanded at a private house they appeared to live elegantly but at the same time were but ill supplied their dinner consisted of fifteen dishes all served up at once and their supper of thirteen but of these nine or ten were of the most ordinary because the cheapest poultry that could be purchased and even some of these dishes were observed to be served up four times successively a duck which was hot at dinner was brought cold in the evening the next day it appeared in the form of a fricasee and was converted to forced meat at night our countrymen however only fared as others had done before them it was the constant custom of the conscientious master of the hotel to treat all his guests in the same manner when they first took up their residence at his house if they took no notice of it all was well for the landlord had the better customers of them if they remonstrated against such treatment the table was better and better supplied from time to time till in the end they had no reason to complain  the gentlemen having found fault with their fare were afterward supplied in a better manner but mr banks not approving the conduct of the master of the hotel he hired lodgings for himself and his attendants at the adjoining house for which he agreed to pay five and forty shillings a month but here mr banks was disappointed in the hope he had formed of living retired for scarce a dutch man had occasion to pass by the house but he ran in without ceremony to enquire what was to be sold for it is a very unusual thing at batavia for strangers who are in a private capacity not to be furnished with some articles of traffic in this house no person was permitted to sleep as a guest of mr banks without his bed being separately paid for it is the universal custom here to hire a carriage and mr banks engaged two for which he paid eighteen shillings a day these carriages are open chaises in which two persons sit commodiously and are driven by a man sitting on a kind of coachbox  their indian friend tupia had been till this time on board very dangerously ill yet persisted to refuse every medicine that was offered him mr banks now sent for him to his house in the hope that he might recover his health while he was in the ship and even after he was put into the boat he was indisposed and low spirited in the utmost degree but the moment he came into the town his whole frame appeared as if reanimated the houses the carriages the people and many other objects were totally new to him and astonishment took possession of his features at sights so wonderful but if tupia was astonished at the scene his boy tayota was perfectly enraptured dancing along the streets in an extacy of joy and examining the several objects as they presented themselves with the most earnest inquisitiveness and curiosity  of all the circumstances which engaged the attention of tupia nothing struck him so much as the vast variety of dresses worn by the inhabitants of batavia he enquired the reason of what appeared so very extraordinary in his eyes and being informed that the people were of a variety of nations and that all were dressed according to the mode of their own country he requested permission to follow the fashion this request being readily complied with a person was dispatched to the ship for some south sea cloth with which he soon clothed himself in the dress of the inhabitants of otaheite the people of batavia who had seen an indian brought thither in m bougainvilles ship named otourou mistook tupia for that man and frequently enquired if he was not the same  as the necessary repairs of the ship were to be made at ourust captain cook obtained an order to the superintendant of that island to receive her and he wrote to the secretary of the admiralty an account of the safe arrival of the endeavor in the road of batavia and dispatched his letter by a dutch ship that was bound to europe  captain cook now applied to several persons to advance him money sufficient to defray the expense of repairing the ship but not one could be found in the whole town who had the requisite sum in his possession or if he had was willing to advance it he therefore made application to the governor who issued his orders that he should be supplied out of the treasury of the dutch east india company  early in the morning of the   th of october    0 the ship got under sail and proceeded to ourust and in a day or two the crew began to take out her stores which were deposited in the wharf on coopers island but this business was rendered unavoidably tedious by several dutch ships being at the same wharf taking in their ladings of pepper  after little more than a week spent at batavia the ill effects of the climate began to be severely felt dr solander and mr banks were indisposed with fevers mr bankss two servants were exceedingly ill the indian boy tayota had an inflammation on his lungs and tupia was so bad that his life was despaired of their indisposition was attributed partly to the heat of the climate and partly to the swampy situation of the town and the stench of the dirty canals with which it abounds  by the   th of the month very few of the crew were well enough to do duty and on this day a tent was erected for their reception tupia now requested to be conveyed to the ship in the hope of breathing a purer air than in the town but his request could not be granted as she was unrigged and preparations were making to lay her down in order that she might undergo a thorough repair on the   th however mr banks attended tupia to coopers island where a tent was pitched for him in such a situation where he was alternately refreshed by the land and sea breezes and the poor creature was extremely thankful that he was so agreeably lodged by this time the surgeon was so ill that he could not leave his bed mr bankss fever was greatly increased and dr solander grew worse every day  the ship was at length laid down on the  th of november on which day died mr monkhouse the surgeon whose loss was the more severely felt as he was a man of skill in his profession and fell a sacrifice to the pestiferous air of the country at a time when his abilities were most wanted dr solander though extremely ill had strength sufficient to see his remains committed to the ground but mr banks was unable even to pay this last sad duty to a worthy man  death now advanced with hasty strides among our adventrous countrymen who were equally unable to resist his power or shun his embraces several malay servants were engaged to wait on those who were ill but these people were so remiss in their duty that it was no uncommon thing for the sick man to leave his bed in search of his attendant the indian boy tayota paid the debt of nature on the  th of this month and tupia whose tender affection for the youth can be equalled only by that of a parent for a favorite child was so shocked at the loss that it was evident he could not long survive him  by this time the ships bottom having been carefully surveyed our countrymen had ample reason to be grateful to that providence by which they had been preserved during a passage of several hundred miles through the most dangerous seas on the face of the globe for the sheathing in several places was torn from the vessel the false keel was in a great measure gone the main keel was damaged in many parts several of the planks had received great injury and a part of three of them was thinner than the sole of a shoe  messis solander and banks were now so worn down by their disorders that the physician who attended them recommended the country air as the only thing that could possibly restore them to the wishes of their friends in consequence of this advice they hired a country house of the master of the hotel who engaged to supply them with slaves and to furnish their table but as they had sufficiently experienced the worthlessness of these slaves they bought two malay women who soon became excellent nurses from that tenderness of nature which does so much honor to the sex while these gentlemen were taking measures for the recovery of their health poor tupia fell a victim to the ravages of his disorder and to his grief for the deceased tayota when tayota was first seized with the fatal disorder he seemed sensible of his approaching end and frequently said to those that were about him tyau mate see my friends i am dying he was very tractable and took any medicines that were offered to him they were both buried in the island of edam  captain cook bestows great encomiums on the officers and workmen of the marine yard at ourust by whose skill and diligence the bottom of the ship was perfectly repaired by the   th of the month and he warmly recommends the heaving down with two masts instead of one which he says is undoubtedly the more expeditious as well as the safer method  by this time not above ten men out of the whole ships crew were able to do duty and these were employed in getting the water and stores aboard and in putting up the rigging the water was purchased at batavia at the rate of one hundred and fifty gallons for six shillings and eight pence  captain cook was now taken ill and mr sporing and a sailor who attended messrs banks and solander at their country house were attacked with intermitting fevers but those two gentlemen grew something better though their recovery was very slow their house was situated on the borders of a rivulet which of course assisted the circulation of the air and it was likewise open to the sea breeze  in the night of the   th there fell such a shower of rain for the space of four hours as even our voyagers had scarce ever remembered the water poured through every part of mr bankss house and the lower apartments admitted a stream sufficient to have turned a mill as this gentleman was now greatly restored in health he went to batavia the following day and was surprised to see that the inhabitants had hung out their bedding to dry the westerly monsoon set in about the   th of this month it blows in the daytime from the north or northwest and from the southwest during the night previous to this there had been violent thunder and hard showers of rain for several nights  the musquitos and gnats whose company had been sufficiently disagreeable in the dry weather now began to swarm in immense numbers rising from the puddles of water like bees from a hive they were extremely troublesome during the night but the pain arising from their sting though very severe seldom lasted more than half an hour and in the daytime they seldom made their attacks the frogs kept a perpetual croaking in the ditches a certain sign that the wet season was commenced and that daily rain might be expected  the ship being repaired the sick people being received on board her and the greater part of her water and stores taken in she sailed from ourust on the  th of december and anchored in the road of batavia twelve days were employed in receiving the remainder of her provisions water and other necessaries though this business would have been done in much less time but that some of the crew died and the majority of the survivors were so ill as to be unable to give their assistance  on the   th captain cook took leave of the governor and some other gentlemen who had distinguished themselves by the civilities they showed him but at this juncture an incident occurred that might have produced consequences by no means desirable a sailor belonging to one of the dutch ships in the road of batavia deserted from that vessel and entered himself on board the endeavor the captain of the dutch ship having made application to the governor claiming the delinquent as a subject of the states general the governor issued his order for the restoration of the man captain cook had but just taken a formal leave of the governor when this order was delivered to him and he said that the man should be given up if it appeared that he was a dutchman as the captain was at this time on shore and did not intend going on board till the following day he gave the dutch officer a note to the lieutenant who commanded on board the endeavor to deliver the deserter on the condition abovementioned on the following day the dutchman waited on captain cook informing him that the lieutenant had absolutely refused to give up the seaman saying that he was an irishman and of course a subject of his britannick majesty captain cook applauded the conduct of his officer and added that it could not be expected that he should deliver up an english subject the dutch officer then said he was authorized by the governor to demand the fugitive as a danish subject adding that his name was entered in the ships books as having been born at elsineur to this captain cook very properly replied that the governor must have been mistaken when he gave this order for delivering the deserter who had his option whether he would serve the dutch or the english but that in compliment to the governor the man should be given up as a favor if he appeared to be a dane but that in this case he should by no means be demanded as a right and that he would certainly keep him if he appeared to be a subject of the crown of great britain the dutchman now took his leave and he had not been long gone before the captain received a letter from the commanding officer on board containing full proof that the man was an english subject this letter the captain carried to the shebander desiring him to lay it before the governor and to inform him that the man should not be delivered up on any terms whatever this spirited conduct on the part of captain cook had the proper effect and thus the matter ended  this day the captain attended by mr banks and the other gentlemen who had hitherto lived in the town repaired on board the ship which got under sail the next morning the endeavor was saluted by the fort and by the elgin east indiaman which then lay in the road but soon after these compliments were returned the sea breeze setting in they were obliged to come to an anchor since the arrival of the ship in batavia road every person belonging to her had been ill except the sailmaker who was more than seventy years old yet this man got drunk every day while they remained there the endeavor buried seven of her people at batavia viz tupia and his boy three of the sailors the servant of mr green the astronomer and the surgeon and at the time of the vessels sailing forty of the crew were sick and the rest so enfeebled by their late illness as to be scarcely able to do their duty  the town of batavia is situated in six degrees ten minutes south latitude and one hundred and six degrees fifty minutes east longitude from the meridian of greenwich it is built on the bank of a large bay something more than twenty miles from the straight of sunda on the north side of the island of java in low boggy ground several small rivers which rise forty miles up the country in the mountains of blaeuwen berg discharge themselves into the sea at this place having first intersected the town in different directions there are wide canals of nearly stagnated water in almost every street and as the banks of these canals are planted with rows of trees the effect is very agreeable but these trees and canals combine to render the air pestilential some of the rivers are navigable more than thirty miles up the country and indeed the dutch appear to have chosen this spot to build the town on for the sake of watercarriage in which convenience batavia exceeds every place in the world except the towns of holland  a writer who published an account of this place near fifty years ago makes the number of houses at that time    0 viz      dutch houses and   00 chinese houses within the walls and  0   dutch houses and    0 chinese houses without the walls with twelve houses for the vending of arrack the streets of batavia being wide and the houses large it stands on more ground than any other place that has only an equal number of houses  in dry weather a most horrid stench arises from the canals and taint the air to a great degree and when the rains have so swelled the canals that they overflow their banks the groundfloors of the houses in the lower parts of the town are filled with stinking water that leaves behind it dirt and slime in amazing quantities the running streams are sometimes as offensive as the stagnant canals for the bodies of dead animals are frequently lodged on the shallow parts where they are left to putrify and corrupt the air except a flood happens to carry them away this was the case with a dead buffaloe while the crew of the endeavor were there which lay stinking on the shoal of a river in one of the chief streets for several days  they sometimes clean the canals but this business is performed in such a manner as scarcely to make them less a nuisance than before for the bottom being cleared of its black mud it is left on the side of the canal till it is hard enough to be taken away in boats and as there are no houses for necessary retirement in the whole town the filth is thrown into the canals regularly once a day so that this mud is a compound of every thing that can be imagined disagreeable and offensive  there is a new church in batavia which is a fine piece of building and the dome of it may be seen far off at sea this church is illuminated by chandeliers of the most superb workmanship and has a fine organ most of the other public buildings are ancient constructed in an ill taste and give a very complete idea of dutch clumsiness  their method of building their houses seems to have been taught them by the climate on the groundfloor there is no room but a large hall a corner of which is parted off for the transaction of business the hall has two doors which are commonly left open and are opposite each other so that the air passes freely through the room in the middle of which there is a court which at once increases the draft of air and affords light to the hall the stairs which are at one corner lead to large and lofty apartments above the female slaves are not permitted to sit in any place but in the alcove formed by the court and this is the usual diningplace of the family  the town of batavia is encompassed by a river of shallow water the stream of which is very rapid within this river which is of different widths in various places is an old stone wall much decayed in many places and within the wall is a canal that is likewise much wider in some places than in others so that there is no entering the gates of the town but by crossing two drawbridges there are but few guns on the ramparts and no persons are permitted to walk there there is a kind of citadel or castle in the northeast corner of the town the walls of which are both broader and higher than they are in other parts it is furnished with a number of large guns which command the landingplace  apartments are provided in this castle for the governor general and all the council and in case of a siege they have orders to retire thither  in the castle are likewise a number of storehouses in which the effects belonging to the company are deposited the company have in their possession large quantities of gunpowder which is kept in different places that the lightning may not destroy the whole stock at once a great number of cannon are likewise laid up within the castle  there are a great many forts built in different parts of the country several miles distant from batavia most probably erected to keep the natives in submission and besides these there are a number of fortified houses each mounting eight guns and these are so stationed as to command the canals and the roads on their borders there are houses of this kind in many parts of the island of java and the other islands in its neighborhood of which the dutch have obtained the possession the chinese having rebelled against the dutch in the year    0 all their principal houses were demolished by the cannon of one of these fortified houses which is in the town of batavia where likewise there are a few more of them  the roads of this country are simply banks between the ditches and canals and the fortified houses being erected among the morasses near these roads nothing is easier than to destroy them and consequently to prevent an enemy from bringing any heavy artillery near the town if indeed an enemy be only hindered a short time in his approach he is effectually ruined for the climate will preclude the necessity of the use of weapons for his destruction before the endeavor had been a week at batavia they began to feel the ill effects of the climate half the crew were rendered incapable of doing their duty before the expiration of a month they were informed that it was a very uncommon thing for fifty soldiers out of a hundred brought from europe to be alive at the expiration of the first year and that of the fifty who might happen to be alive not ten of those would be in sound health and probably not less than half of them in the hospital one would imagine that no man of common sense would be tempted to reside at batavia for any consideration of interest whatever yet such is the insatiable thirst of gold that men will voluntarily rsk the loss of life to obtain it and even ensure the loss of that health without which the most splendid fortune cannot be enjoyed  all the white inhabitants of batavia are soldiers and at the expiration of five years service they are bound to hold themselves in readiness to go to war if they should be wanted and the younger inhabitants are frequently mustered but as they are neither trained nor exercised after the expiration of the five years abovementioned the little they have learnt is soon forgotten and they would probably if called to action make as good soldiers as the militia of the city of london the portuguese who live in this country employ themselves very much in shooting the deer and the wild hog whence they become excellent marksmen the indians of whatever nation who reside here and have either been made free or were born so are called mardykers but neither these nor the chinese are acquainted with the use of firearms yet as these people are said to possess great personal bravery much might be expected from their expert use of their daggers swords and lances  from what has been above written it is evident that it would be a laborious task to attack batavia by land and it is not possible to make any attack at all by sea for the shallowness of the water would hinder any vessels from advancing within cannon shot of the walls indeed there is barely depth of water for a ships longboat excepting a narrow channel called the river which extends about half a mile into the harbor and is strongly bounded on each side with piers the other end of it being directly under the fire of the castle while its communication with the canals of the town is prevented by a boom of wood which is every night shut precisely at six oclock and never opened till the following day  any number of ships may anchor in the harbor of batavia the ground of which is so excellent that the anchor will never quit its hold this harbor is sometimes dangerous for boats when the sea breeze blows fresh but upon the whole it is deemed the best and most commodious in all india  there are a considerable number of islands which are situated round the outside of the harbor and all these are in the possession of the dutch who destine them to different purposes on one of them which is called purmerent an hospital is erected on account of the air being purer than it is at batavia in a second the name of which is kuyper are erected a number of warehouses in which are lodged the rice and some other commodities the property of the dutch east india company at this island those ships belonging to different nations which are to be repaired at ourust unlade their cargoes and it was here that the stores of the falmouth man of war were laid up when she was condemned on her return from manilla her warrant officers of whom mention has been made in the account of captain walliss voyage were sent to europe in dutch ships about half a year before the endeavor anchored in the road of batavia a third of these islands the name of which is edam is appropriated to the reception of such offenders whose crimes are not deemed worthy of death and hither they are transported from holland and detained from five to forty years in proportion to the turpitude of the offense they have committed the making of ropes is the principal part of the employment of these criminals  the environs of batavia have a very pleasing appearance and would in almost any other country be an enviable situation gardens and houses occupy the country for several miles but the gardens are so covered with trees that the advantage of the land having been cleared of the wood that originally covered it is almost wholly lost while these gardens and the fields adjacent to them are surrounded by ditches which yield not the most fragrant smell and the bogs and morasses in the adjacent fields are still more offensive  for the space of more than thirty miles beyond the town the land is totally flat except in two places on one of which the governors countryseat is built and on the other they hold a large market but neither of these places are higher than ten yards from the level of the plain at near forty miles from the town the land rises into hills and the air is purified in a great degree to this distance the invalids are sent by their physicians when every other prospect of their recovery has failed and the experiment succeeds in almost every instance for the sick are soon restored to health but they no sooner return to the town than their former disorders visit them on these hills the most opulent of the inhabitants have countryseats to which they pay an annual visit those who reside constantly on the hills enjoy an almost perpetual flow of health and most of the vegetables of europe grow as freely here as in their native ground the strawberry in particular flourishes greatly which is a sufficient proof of the coolness of the air  the rice of this country is very plentiful and in order to be brought to perfection should lie under water more than half the time it is growing but they have a sort which grows on the sides of the hills which is unknown in the west india islands this sort is planted when the wet season commences and the crop is gathered in soon after the rains are over  the maize which grows near batavia is gathered while young and toasted in the ear the land likewise produces carrots pigeonpea celery parsley asparagus onions rhadishes cabbages lettuces cucumbers lentiles kidneybeans hysop sage rue chinese white rhadishes which when boiled are not unlike a parsnip common potatoes sweet potatoes wet and dry yams millet and the egg plant the fruit of which when broiled and eaten with salt and pepper is most exquisite food  amazing quantities of sugar are produced here and while the quantity is beyond comparison greater the care of cultivation is inconceivably less than in the west india islands white sugar is retailed at twopence and twopence halfpenny the pound and arrack is made of the molasses with a small addition of rice and the wine of the cocoanut the inhabitants likewise raise a little indigo for their own use but do not export it  the fruits of this country are near forty in number and of some of these there are several kinds pine apples grow in such abundance that they may be purchased at the first hand for the value of an english farthing and they bought some very large ones for a halfpenny a piece at the fruit shops though they are excellent eating it is imagined they are reared to equal perfection in the hothouses of england they grow so luxuriantly that seven or eight suckers have been seen adhering to one stem  the sweet oranges of batavia are good of their kind but very dear at particular times the shaddocks of the west indies called here pumplemoeses have an agreeable flavor lemons were very scarce when the endeavor lay in the harbor but limes were altogether as plentiful and sold at little more than twopence the score there are many kinds of oranges and lemons but none of them excellent of mangos there are plenty but their taste is far inferior to that of the meltingpeach of england to which they have been compared it is said that the heat and extreme dampness of the climate does not agree with them yet there are many different kinds of them of bananes there is an amazing variety of sorts some of which being boiled are eaten as bread while others are fried in batter and are a nutrimental food but of the numerous sorts of this fruit three only are fit to be eaten one indeed is remarkable because it is filled with seeds which are not common to the rest grapes are sold from one shilling to eighteenpence the pound though they are far from being good  the tamarinds are equally cheap and plentiful but as the method of preserving them which is in salt renders them a mere black lump they are equally nauseating to the sight and the palate the water melons are excellent of their kind and are produced in great abundance the pumpkins are boiled as turnips and eaten with salt and pepper this fruit is admirably adapted to the use of voyagers as it will keep many months without care and makes an excellent pie when mixed with the juice of lemons and sugar the papaws of this country are superior to turnips if the cores are extracted after paring them when they are green the guava has a strong smell and a taste not less disagreeable it is probable that the guava of the west indies which many writers have distinguished by their praises has a very different flavor the sweet sop is a fruit that has but little flavor it abounds in large kernels from which the pulp is sucked the taste of the custardapple very much resembles the dish from which its name is taken the cashewapple produces a nut which is not unknown in england but the fruit has such an astringent quality that the batavians seldom eat of it the nut grows on the top of the apple the cocoanut is plentiful in this country and there are several kinds of this fruit the best of which is very red between the shell and the skin the jamboo is a fruit that has but little taste but is of a cooling nature it is considerably less than a common sized apple and those that have grown to their full size are always the best its shape is oval and its color the deep red of the jambueyer there are two kinds the white and the red they are shaped like a bell and are something bigger than a cherry they have no kind of taste but that of a watery acid the jambueyer mauwar smells like a rose and its taste is not unlike that of conserve of roses the mangostan is of a dark red color and not larger than a small apple to the bottom of this fruit adhere several little leaves of the blossom while on its top are a number of triangles combined in a circle it contains several kernels ranged in a circular form within which is the pulp a fruit of most exquisite taste it is equally nutritious and agreeable and is constantly given to persons who are troubled with inflammatory or putrid fevers the sweet orange of this country is likewise given in the same disorders the pomgranate of these parts differs in nothing from that generally well known in england the durion takes its name from the word dure which in the language of the country means prickle and this name is well adapted to the fruit the shell of which is covered with sharp points shaped like a sugar loaf its contents are nuts not much smaller than chestnuts which are surrounded with a kind of juice resembling cream and of this the inhabitants eat with great avidity the smell of this fruit is more like that of onions than any other european vegetable and its taste is like that of onions sugar and cream intermixed the inside of the durion when ripe is parted lengthways into several divisions the nanca is a fruit which smells like garlic and apples mixed together its size in the gardens of batavia is not greater than that of a middling sized pumpkin and its shape is nearly the same it is covered with prickles of an angular form they were informed that at a place called madura it has been known to grow to such an enormous size as to require the strength of two men to carry it the champada is in all respects like the nanca only that it is not so large the rambutan contains a fruit within which is a stone that is perhaps the finest acid in the world this fruit is not unlike a chestnut with its husk on and it is covered with small prickles of a dark red color and so soft as to yield to the slightest impression the jambolan resembles a damascen both in color and size and is of a very astringent nature the boa bidarra tastes like an apple but is likewise extremely astringent its size is that of a gooseberry its form round and its color yellow the nam nam makes an excellent fritter if fried in batter but is not esteemed when raw the rind of it is rough its length is about three inches and its shape not unlike that of a kidney the catappa and the canare are two species of nuts the kernels of which are like those of an almond but so hard that it is almost impossible to break them the madja contains a pulp of a sharp taste which is eaten with sugar this fruit is covered with a very hard shell the suntal is a fruit scarcely fit to be eaten being at once astringent acid and of a most unpleasant taste yet it is publicly sold in the streets of batavia it contains a number of kernels which are enclosed in a thick skin the salack is nearly of the size of a small golden pippin and contains a few kernels of a yellow color the taste of which is not unlike that of a strawberry but the covering of this fruit is very remarkable as it consists of a number of scales resembling those of a fish the cherrema and the blimbing are two sour fruits exceedingly well adapted to make sour sauce and pickles the blimbing besse is another fruit of the same kind but considerably sweeter  of the fruits not in season when captain cook was at batavia he mentions the boa atap and the kimkit which he saw preserved in sugar and there are several other sorts which the batavians are fond of but they are never eaten by strangers among those are the moringa the guilindina the kellor and the soccum this last has the appearance of the breadfruit which is produced in the islands of the south seas but it is not near so good though the tree on which it grows is also exactly like the bread fruit tree  the fruit sold at the common shops is generally too ripe but in a street named passar pissang which is inhabited by chinese fruiterers only that which is very good may be obtained but at a price greatly exceeding its value the gardens of gentlemen near the town furnish these chinese fruitsellers but the other dealers are supplied from a greater distance up the country where the inhabitants live by the cultivation of large tracts of land for the sole purpose of raising fruit  it is astonishing to conceive what quantities of fruit are eaten at batavia two large markets are held weekly at distant places for the accommodation of persons residing in different parts of the country and at these markets the fruitsellers of the town meet the gardeners and purchase their goods at very low rates but as the markets are held on mondays and saturdays those who wish to be supplied with what is fresh in the middle of the week must apply to the chinese dealers abovementioned as the heat of the climate renders it unfit for eating in a few days at these markets it is common to see fifty or sixty cartloads of the finest pineapples carelessly tumbled together  the batavians and the natives of other parts of the island of java strew an immense number of flowers about their houses and are almost always burning aromatic woods and gums which it is imagined is done by way of purifying the air the stench that arises from the canals and ditches being exceeding nauseous and disagreeable  the sweet scented flowers of this country are very numerous many of which being totally unknown in england we shall mention a few of the most remarkable  the combang tonquin and combang caracnassi are very fragrant flowers but unlike any thing seen in the gardens of europe they are very small seem to be of the dogsbane kind and both in smell and shape are very much alike  the cananga looks more like a bunch of leaves than a flower its smell is singular but extremely pleasant  the bonja tanjong is of a pale yellow color and delightful smell it is about an inch and a half in circumference and consists of pointed leaves which give it the form of a star  the champaa smells somewhat like a jonquil and is otherwise not unlike it though rather of a deeper yellow this flower is produced by a large tree  the dal malam is only mentioned on account of its name which implies the intriguer of the night this flower has no kind of smell during the daytime but on the approach of the night its sweets begin to disclose themselves and its fragrancy is almost unequalled in other respects it is the same as the tuberose of england  all the abovementioned kinds of flowers being made into nosegays of various shapes or strung on a piece of thread are carried through the streets of an evening for sale the gardens of the gentlemen afford many flowers besides those abovementioned but they do not grow in numbers sufficient to be offered to sale  this country produces a plant called pandang the leaves of which being shred small and mixed with a variety of flowers the natives both men and women fill their clothes and hair with this fragrant mixture which they likewise sprinkle on their beds and sleep beneath a profusion of sweets a single sheet of fine chintz being all the other covering of the bed  formerly the island of java produced no kind of spices but pepper and the quantity which the dutch bring annually from thence is very considerable but the quantity that is made use of in the country is very small as the people there give the preference to cayan pepper the inhabitants are extremely fond of nutmegs and cloves but they bear too high a price to be much in use as the trees which produce them are all become dutch property  cloves are now grown no where but on the island of amboina and some little islands near it the artful hollanders having possessed themselves of all the trees in consequence of several subsequent treaties of peace with the several kings of the other islands for at the conclusion of every war the conquerors left the poor indians still fewer trees by way of punishment for their opposition till in the end they have destroyed them all  there are scarce any nutmegs except on the island of banda where they originally grew this island however produces a plenty equal to the demand of all the world on the coast of new guinea there are a small number of nutmegtrees  the island of java produces goats sheep hogs buffaloes and horses the horse which is said to have been met with here when the country was originally discovered is a small but nimble animal being seldom above thirteen hands high the horned cattle of this country are different from those of europe the flesh is extremely lean but of a very fine grain both the chinese and the natives of the island feed on the buffaloe but the dutch will neither taste the flesh nor the milk from a ridiculous idea that they are productive of fevers the sheep are tough and illtasted their skins are hairy and they have long hangingears a few sheep from the cape of good hope being at batavia captain cook bought some of them at the rate of a shilling a pound  the hogs especially those of the chinese breed are exquisitely fine food but so extravagantly fat that the lean is always sold separately the butchers who are chinese have no kind of objection to taking off the fat which they melt and sell to their countrymen who eat it with their rice though these hogs are such fine food yet the dutch prefer the breed of holland which are consequently sold at extravagant rates  the  of java   the portuguese make a practice of shooting the wild hog and deer of two kinds with which the neighborhood of batavia abounds these are all good eating and are purchased at very moderate prices the goats of this country are as bad food as the sheep dogs and cats abound on the island and wild horses and other cattle are found on the mountains at a considerable distance from batavia  few monkies are seen near the town but there are many of them on the mountains and desert places where also are a few rhinoceroses and great numbers of tigers  the quantity of fish taken here is astonishingly great and all the kinds of them are fine food except a few which are very scarce yet such is the false pride of the inhabitants that these few scarce sorts are sold at very high rates while those that are good are sold for a mere trifle nor are they eaten but by the slaves a gentleman with whom captain cook dined told him he could have bought a finer dish of fish for a shilling than what he had given ten for but that he should have been the ridicule of all the politer people if he had gone to so good a market  the dutch will not taste of the turtle which are taken here captain cook acknowledges that they are fine eating though not equal to those catched in the west indies even when they are dressed in london mr banks shot a lizard five feet in length which was extremely well tasted our adventurers were informed that some of these animals had been seen which were full as thick as the thigh of a man  this country produces an abundance of poultry as excellent of their kinds as those of england the turkies are immoderately dear and the pigeons not much less so but the geese ducks and fine large fowls are altogether as cheap  the neighborhood of batavia produces snipes of two kinds one of which was the same as the english of the portuguese who appear to be the only dealers in wild fowl any number of thrushes might have been purchased our adventurers once and once only saw a wild duck in the fields but never observed any of these birds exposed to sale and indeed wild fowl in general are far from being plentiful at batavia captain cook observes as a singularity respecting the snipe that he is to be met with in all the quarters of the globe and is seen in a greater variety of places than any other of the whole feathered creation  the liquors of the island of java are palmwine and arrack of the former they have three sorts the first of which is drunk within a few hours after it is drawn from the tree and almost in its original state when it has a moderate sweetness the second and third sorts are made by fermenting it and putting various herbs and roots into it the first of these liquors will not occasion drunkenness but the two latter will the arrack is so generally known as not to demand any description  the natives of java profess the religion of mahomet and of course do not indulge in wine at least publicly but not to be exceeded in the vice of drunkenness by their christian neighbors they are almost constantly chewing opium which is well known to intoxicate in a high degree  exclusive of the chinese and the indians of many different nations who inhabit the town of batavia and the country in its neighborhood the inhabitants are proportionably a very small number and even of these not a fifth part are dutch or descended from natives of holland the portuguese are more in number than all the other europeans  the troops in the dutch service are composed of the natives of almost all the kingdoms of europe but of these the germans outnumber all the others when a person of any country goes to reside at batavia it is necessary that he first enter as a soldier in the service of the dutch east india company binding himself to serve five years which being done he applies to the council for leave of absence which being granted of course he then engages in any business he thinks proper thus the dutch have always an army ready to be called forth on any emergency no foreigner of whatever nation has any share in the management of public affairs all places of power trust and profit being held by the dutch  though the men of other countries are bound to the observation of the abovementioned conditions women from any part of the globe may reside and traffic at batavia unmolested captain cook was informed that at the time he was there the whole place could not furnish fifty women who were natives of europe yet the town abounded with white women who were descended from europeans who had settled there at different times all the men having paid the debt of nature for so it is that the climate of batavia destroys the men much faster than the women these women follow the delicate custom of chewing betel after the example of the native javanese whose dress they imitate and whose manners they copy in all other respects  mercantile business is conducted at batavia with the slightest trouble imaginable when a merchant receives an order for goods of any kind he communicates the contents of it to the chinese who are the universal manufacturers the chinese agent delivers the effects on board the ship for which they are bespoke and taking a receipt for them from the master of the vessel he delivers it to the merchant who pays the chinese for the goods and reserves a considerable profit without the least trouble risk or anxiety but when a merchant imports goods of any kind he receives them himself and lodges them in his own warehouses it may be wondered that the chinese do not ship the goods on their own account but from this they are restricted and compelled to sell them to the merchants only  the inhabitants of java distinguish the portuguese by the name of oranserane that is nazareen men but they use the general term of caper or casir respecting all who do not profess the religion of mahomet and in this they include the portuguese but the portuguese of batavia are so only in name for they have neither any connection with or knowledge of the kingdom of portugal and they have changed the religion of the church of rome for that of luther with the manners of the javanese they are wholly familiarized and they commonly speak their language though they are able to converse in a corrupt kind of portuguese they dress in the habit of the country with a difference only in the manner of wearing their hair their noses are more peaked and their skin of a deeper cast than that of the natives some of them are mechanics and artificers others subsist by washing of linen and the rest procure a maintenance by hunting  the indian inhabitants of batavia and the country in its neighborhood are not native javanese but are either born on the several islands from whence the dutch bring their slaves or the offspring of such as have been born on those islands and these having been made free either in their own persons or in the persons of their ancestors enjoy all the privileges of freemen they receive the general appellation of oranm which implies believers of the true faith  the various other indian inhabitants of this country attach themselves each to the original  of that in which either themselves or their ancestors were born keeping themselves apart from those of other nations and practicing both the virtues and vices peculiar to their own countries the cultivation of gardens and the consequent sale of flowers and fruit afford subsistence to great numbers of them these are the people who raise the betel and areca which being mixed with lime and a substance which is called gambir the produce of the indian continent is chewed by persons of all ranks women as well as men indeed some of the politer ladies make an addition of cardamum and other aromatics to take off the disagreeable smell with which the breath would be otherwise hunted some of the indians are very rich keep a great number of slaves and live in all respects according to the customs of their respective countries while others are employed to convey goods by water and others again subsist by fishing  the oranslams feed principally on boiled rice mixed with a small quantity of dried shrimps and other fish which are imported from china and a little of the flesh of buffaloes and chicken they are fond of fruit of which they eat large quantities and with the slower of the rice they make several sorts of pastry they sometimes make very superb entertainments after the fashion of their respective countries bur in general they are a very temperate people of wine they drink very little if any as the religion of mahomet which they profess forbids the use of it  when a marriage is to be solemnized among the oranslams all the gold and silver ornaments that can be procured are borrowed to deck out the young couple who on these occasions never fail to make the most splendid appearance sumptuous entertainments are given by those who can afford them which continue twelve or fourteen days and frequently more during all which time the women take care that the bridegroom shall not visit his wife privately though the wedding takes place previous to the festival  all these indians though they come from different countries speak the malay language if it deserves that name on the island of java there are two or three different dialects and there is a language peculiar to every small island it is conjectured that the malay tongue is a corruption of the language of malacca  the hair of the people which is black without a single exception grows in great abundance yet the women make use of oils and other ingredients to increase the quantity of it they fasten it to the crown of the head with a bodkin having first twisted it into a circle round which circle they place an elegant wreath of flowers so that the whole headdress has the most beautiful appearence that imagination can form an idea of  it is the universal custom both with the men and women to bathe in a river once every day and sometimes oftener which not only promotes health but prevents that contraction of filth which would be otherwise unavoidable in so hot a climate  the teeth of the oranslams have some particularities in them well worthy of notice with a kind of whetstone they rub the ends of them till they are quite flat and even they then make a deep groove in the teeth of the upper jaw in the center between the bottom of each tooth and the gum and horizontally with the latter this groove is equal in depth to a quarter of the thickness of the teeth yet none of these people have a rotten tooth though according to the dentists of england and france such a thing must be unavoidable as the tooth is pierced much deeper than what we call the enamel the teeth of these people become very black by the chewing of betel yet a slight washing will take off this blackness and the teeth are then perfectly white but they are very seldom washed as the depth of the color is very far from being thought disagreeable  almost every person has read or heard of the mohawks and these are the people who are so denominated from a corruption of the word amock which will be well explained by the following story and observations to run a muck is to get drunk with opium and then seizing some offensive weapon to sally forth from the house kill the person or persons supposed to have injured the amock and any other person that attempts to impede his passage till he himself is taken prisoner or killed on the spot  while captain cook was at batavia a person whose circumstances in life were independent becoming jealous of his brother intoxicated himself with opium and then murdered his brother and two other men who endeavored to seize him this man contrary to the usual custom did not leave his own house but made his resistance from within it yet he had taken such a quantity of the opium that he was totally delirious which appeared from his attempting to fire three muskets neither of which had been loaded or even primed  during the time that captain cook was at batavia several instances of the like kind occurred and he was informed by an officer whose duty it was to take such offenders into custody that hardly a week passed in the year in which he was not obliged to exercise his authority the captain was also told that jealousy of the women is the usual reason of these poor creatures running a muck and that the first object of their vengeance is always the person whom they suppose to have injured them the officer whole business it is to apprehend these unhappy wretches is furnished with a long pair of tongs in order to take hold of them at such a distance from the point of their weapons as to insure his personal safety when he takes one of them alive he is amply rewarded but this is not often the case as they are so desperate as not to be easily apprehended when they are killed in the attempt to take them the officer has only the customary gratification those who are taken alive are broken on the wheel as near as possible to the place where the first murder was perpetrated and as they are seldom apprehended without being previously wounded the time of their execution is sooner or later according to the opinions of the physicians whether the wounds are or are not mortal  the oranslams believe that the devil is the author of sickness and other misfortunes on which account they make an oblation of meat money and other things to him when they are either sick or in trouble when they dream successively for several nights they have no doubt but that the devil has enjoined the performance of some act to discover which they torture their brains in vain and then apply to the priest who never fails to interpret the dream in a satisfactory manner in consequence of this interpretation by which it appears that the devil is in want of money and food a quantity of each is placed in the leaves of the cocoanut tree and being hung on the bough of a tree by the side of a river is left till some passenger shall find and take away the money which is considered not so much an offering to the devil as a fine due for some crime committed with regard to the food they imagine that the devil comes and sucks out the nutritious parts of it without moving it out of its place from this part of the story it seems reasonable to conclude that the priest having previous knowledge where the oblation is to be made takes the money and leaves the victuals  this instance of the superstition of these people may be thought very extraordinary but the following will appear much more so they are possessed with an idea that when one of their wives is brought to bed a crocodile is born as a brother to the infant and they imagine that the midwife conveys the young crocodile to an adjacent river into which she puts it with the utmost care and tenderness those who suppose themselves honored by the birth of this new relation fail not to put food in the river for his subsistence but this is the peculiar duty of the twin brother who performs this service regularly at fixed periods during the whole course of his life firmly believing at the same time that sickness or death would be the consequence of an omission on his part  in the islands of boutou and celebes the natives keep crocodiles in their families and it is conjectured that the strange idea of the twin crocodile was first conceived in one of those islands it extends however to java and sumatra westward and among the islands to the eastward as far as ceram and timor it is a matter of perfect astonishment how even the most ignorant and credulous of the human race should firmly believe an utter impossibility to occur daily yet it is certain that not one of the indians whom captain cook questioned on the subject entertained the least doubt about the matter the crocodiles supposed to be thus born are distinguished by the name of sudaras and our readers cannot fail of being entertained with the following story respecting them which mr banks heard from a young woman who was born at bnco and having lived among the engsh at that place had learnt to speak as much of our language as was sufficient to make her story intelligible  she said that when her father was on his deathbed he laid the strongest injunctions on her to feed a crocodile that was his sudara that he told her the name by which he might be called up and the particular part of the river where she would find him soon after the death of her father she hastened to the river and calling radja pouti which signifies white king the sudara crocodile made his appearance and she fed him with her own hands she described him as being more beautiful than crocodiles are in general for he had a red nose and spots on his body his ears were adorned with rings and his feet with ornaments of gold this story will appear the more extravagantly ridiculous when it is recollected that crocodiles have not any ears  a man whose mother was a native of the island of java and whose father was a dutchman was engaged in the service of mr banks during his residence at batavia this man told his master that several dutchmen and many javanese as well as himself had seen such a crocodile as was described by the girl who told the preceding story and that like here is its feet were adorned with gold on mr bankss remarking the absurdity of these tales and saying that crocodiles had not ears he replied that the sudaras differed considerably from other crocodiles that they had ears though he acknowledged they were small that their tongues filled their mouths and that on each foot they had five toes  there are three tribes of indians on the island of batavia who are called boetons macassars and bougis these people are firm believers in the existence of the sudara crocodiles and they have a custom among them which however ridiculous in itself seems to do honor to their filial and fraternal affections at fixed periods they assemble together and having laden a large boat with various sorts of provisions they launch her at a spot most likely to be frequented by crocodiles here they row about sometimes singing and sometimes weeping while a variety of musical instruments are played on till they get sight of a crocodile the moment this happens they throw tobacco betel and victuals of several sorts over the side of the boat as a friendly offering to the sudara crocodiles of their own country imagining that by this means they conciliate the affections and good will of their relations whom they fail not to invoke during the whole of the ceremony  the chinese inhabitants of batavia are like those of their own country some of the most industrious people on the face of the earth they act as embroiderers dyers of cotton tailors carpenters joiners smiths and makers of slippers some of them are shopkeepers and deal largely in the manufactures of europe and china a few of these people live within the walls of the town but the majority of them take up their residence in a district named campang china which is situated without the walls those of the chinese who live in the country either keep buffaloes and other cattle the milk of which they sell daily at batavia or they procure a subsistence by the raising of rice and sugar canes and the cultivation of gardens  captain cook observes that the danger of being hanged for any crime being excepted there is nothing however infamous which a chinese will refuse to do for gain and in this opinion he concurs with every preceding writer so that these people must have taken no small pains to establish their reputation for knavery they labor with unwearied diligence but the moment they have completed their work they sit down to dice cards or some other of the very numerous games which they are expert at and they follow their sports with such eagerness that the business of eating and sleeping is frequently suspended  the clothes of the chinese whether rich or poor are singularly clean and decent their behavior is civil even to humility they are such temperate eaters that gluttony is unknown among them but as their religion does not command them to refrain from any particular food they eat a variety of things which are denied to those indians who profess the mohammedan faith exclusive of vegetables and fish of various kinds their principal food consists of dogs cats lizards frogs serpents of several sorts and hogs  the chinese have purchased of the dutch at a very large expense several hundred acres of land in the vicinity of batavia for the interment of their dead for it is a rule from which they never depart not to open a grave which has once received the body of one of their countrymen and hence arises an enormous expense in the purchase of land which greatly distresses the living to pay an imaginary honor to the dead in order to preserve the body as long as possible from decay the coffin consists of a piece of solid timber hollowed out and this being covered with a kind of mortar several inches thick petrifies in the ground till it is as hard as a flint the funeral is attended by the near relations of the deceased and by a train of women who are paid for making lamentations  in these expensive customs absurd as they are the chinese are equalled by the rest of their batavian neighbors for every person is buried with a degree of splendor proportioned to the rank he has held in life and there is a positive law which enjoins the observance of this custom in consequence of which it frequently happens that those who have not money sufficient to pay the just demands on them are buried in a pompous manner merely because they have lived elegantly in this case persons are employed to take an account of what the man died worth and when the funeral expenses are defrayed the surplus is divided among the creditors  the various inhabitants of the island of java whether dutch portuguese or indians are all waited on by slaves whose number is proportioned to the circumstances of the master but there are laws in force that no native of the island shall serve as a slave these people the number of which is very great are bought at sumatra and the other eastern islands at various prices from ten to twenty pounds but there have been instances of very beautiful girls being sold at above five times the common market price they are fed on boiled rice and such fish as can be purchased at the lowest rates a little of which satisfies them nor indeed do they deserve even the little they eat for they are idle and sluggish in the highest degree  the negroes of africa are purchased at a lower price than any other slaves and indeed any price whatever exceeds their merit for they are of the most obstinate dispositions and thieves without a single exception those slaves which are purchased from the island of celebes are most intolerably lazy and of so ferocious a disposition that their employers run the hazard of their personal safety the island of bali furnishes the most useful slaves and the little island nias near sumatra supplies female slaves of exquisite beauty but to these illfated women death is the almost certain consequence of even a short residence at batavia  the masters of any of these slaves may punish them in whatever way they choose so as not to deprive them of life but when it happens that a slave dies of the punishment he has received the master is tried and commonly suffers as a murderer from this circumstance it is reasonable to suppose that the masters are cautious how they beat the slaves with undue severity it is not indeed very common for them to strike them at all but they pay an officer who is called the marineu for inflicting the punishment the marineu having heard what is alleged against the delinquent determines how many stripes he shall receive and these are given by slaves whose particular business it is to obey the commands of the marineu these strokes are laid on with rods made of rattans split very small for a severe whipping the marineu receives a ducatoon and a rixdollar for a slighter punishment the women slaves are whipped in the house of the master but the men publicly in the streets in order that these slaves may not be under too great temptations to steal their masters are compelled to allow them seven pence halfpenny weekly for pocketmoney  there is something singular in the subordination observed among the inhabitants of batavia and the adjacent country the man who has been longest in the dutch east india companys service is permitted to gild his coach while others are allowed to ride in coaches differently painted according to the length of their services and others again ride in those that are quite plain in like manner the coachmen are dressed in liveries that have a greater or less quantity of lace on them or without any lace at all  the lawyers of batavia are partial in their administration of justice to a very reprehensible degree when an indian has committed any crime deemed worthy of death he is impaled hanged or broken on the wheel without ceremony on the contrary if a christian is capitally convicted execution very seldom follows the sentence and what is more extraordinary no pains are taken to apprehend the offender till time enough has been allowed him to run away if he thinks proper  the civil officers of justice among the chinese and malays are called captains and lieutenants but their decisions are not final if the party against whom they may decide thinking himself aggrieved should appeal to the dutch lawyers in which case the decision of the latter must be abided by  the dutch have laid considerable taxes on these people among which is one for the permission to wear their hair when these taxes become due which is once a month they hoist a flag on the top of a house nearly in the center of batavia and the man who does not speedily go and pay his money has reason to repent the omission  the current money of this country is of different value from a dutch doit to a ducat when captain cook was at batavia spanish dollars sold at five shillings and fivepence each and the price is seldom much lower the chinese would give only the value of twenty shillings for an english guinea that was almost new and for those that were old and much worn only seventeen shillings  the milled ducatoons of batavia are valued at eighty stivers those that are unmilled at seventytwo the ducat at one hundred and thirtytwo the imperial rixdollars at sixty the rupees at thirty the schellings at six the double cheys at two and a half and the doits at a quarter of a stiver  we shall now proceed to a recital of the incidents which occurred during their passage from batavia to the cape of good hope in which we shall trace them with the utmost fidelity omitting not a single circumstance that may either entertain or instruct the reader  early in the morning of the   th of december    0 the endeavor left the road of batavia and after several hindrances occasioned by the wind being contrary she stood over for the shore of java on the first day of january      as many of the ships crew who had been very ill while at batavia were now become much worse the vessel was brought to an anchor in the afternoon of the  th near princes island with a view to get some necessary refreshments and likewise to take in wood and water  messieurs solander and banks now went ashore with the captain and they were no sooner landed than some of the natives conducted them to the king of the island with whom they endeavored to make a bargain for some turtle but the price could not be agreed on as our adventurers had no doubt but that they should purchase on their own terms the following day they left the indians and proceeded in search of a proper place to fill water which was soon found as they were about to embark for the ship they purchased three turtle from some of the natives but with the strictest injunction that their sovereign should not be informed of the transaction  on sunday the  th of january they purchased at very moderate prices as many turtle as they had occasion for and the whole ships company fed on this delicious fish the king was at this time at a house situated in a rice field where mr banks waited on him and found him cooking his own victuals  on monday the inhabitants brought vegetables deer fish fowls and monkies for sale and on the following day they brought down a farther number of turtle  a servant that mr banks had hired at batavia having acquainted him that there was a town on the island his curiosity determined him to have a view of it and one of the officers of the ship accompanied him on his visit as he was apprehensive that the natives would not be pleased at his going to the town he told such of them as he met that he was seeking for plants which in fact was a part of the business of the day having come to a kind of village consisting of a very few houses they asked an indian the way to the town and some other particulars respecting it but he endeavored to prevent their proceeding by representing it as at a very great distance when he saw they were resolved to go forward he proceeded with them making frequent attempts to mislead them when they were within sight of the town the indian changed his behavior at once and led the way to it  this place which contains between three and four hundred houses is called samadang and is parted by a river into the old and the new town some of the natives whom the gentlemen remembered to have seen among those who had brought provisions for sale agreed to carry them from the old town to the new for a trifling gratification this was done by means of two little canoes which were lashed together and they had no sooner reached the opposite shore than the indians showed them the houses of their chiefs and behaved otherwise in the most friendly manner but as this was the season when the natives live in their ricegrounds to save their corn from the depredations of the monkies and birds most of the houses were shut when the gentlemen had seen every thing that they thought worthy of notice they hired a sailingboat which conveyed them to the ship time enough for dinner for the town of samadang though at a considerable distance from the place where the endeavor lay at anchor is situated at only a small distance from the seacoast  on the   th while the captain was on shore giving orders to the people who were cutting wood and filling water he was told that one of the natives had stolen an ax the thief was unknown but the captain resolved not to pave the way for future depredations of this kind by taking no notice of the first offense immediately applied to the king and in consequence of this application the ax was brought down to the wateringplace the next day the indian who brought it back said it was left at his house in the night but it was suspected that himself was the thief  mr banks having several times visited on the king of the island and given him some trifles that were very acceptable he waited on him for the last time on the   th of january and gratified him very much by a present of a small quantity of paper the king asked the reason why the english ships did not touch at the island as was formerly their custom when mr banks attributed the omission to the scarcity of turtle and advised the king to breed buffaloes sheep and cattle for the accommodation of his future visitants  after a stay of ten days at princes island during which they purchased vegetables of various kinds fowls deer turtle etc the anchor was weighed and the vessel once more put to sea  we shall now proceed to a description of the island which lies in the western mouth of the straight of sunda it is a small woody island and has been cleared only in very few places our india ships used to touch at princes island to take in water but they have omitted this practice for some years since on account as it is said of the water being brackish yet captain cook says it is exceeding good if filled toward the head of the brook  the fowls which were purchased at this place cost about fivepence each the turtle threefarthings a pound and other fish were proportionably cheap one hundred of the best cocoanuts cost only a dollar and pumpkins pineapples and other fruits were equally cheap and plenty  the natives profess the religion of mahomet and are so strict in the observance of the feast called ramadan that they not only abstain from food till the sun is down but even from the chewing of betel the manners of these people are not unlike those of the javanese but they are much more jealous of their wives during the ten days that the endeavor lay here only one woman was seen and she ran away the moment she was discovered  the houses are constructed in the form of an oblong square they are built on pillars four feet above the ground and well thatched with palmleaves as a defense from the sun and rain the flooring is of bamboo canes placed at a distance from each other to admit the air these houses consist of four rooms one of which is destined for the reception of visitants the children sleep in a second and the two others are allotted the one for the purpose of cookery and the other for the bedchamber of the owner and his wife the residence of the king of the island and that of another person of great authority has boards on the sides while the houses of all the inferior people have walls made of the bamboo cane slit into small sticks and wrought across the beams of the building in the manner of a hurdle the king of the island is subject to the sultan of bantam  captain cook represents the natives as very honest in their dealings with the single exception of demanding more than double the sum they intended to sell for the goods of each sort which different persons brought to market were all sold together and the purchasemoney divided among the several contributors in proportion to the quantity that each had given in to the general stock when they changed money they gave two hundred and forty dutch doits for a spanish dollar  the natives speak a language which they call catta gunung that is the language of the mountains and they say that their ancestors came from the mountains of java where this language is spoken that they first settled at new bay where the tigers were so numerous that they could not live in safety and therefore took up their residence on princes island all these people however are capable of conversing in the malay language  at the time the endeavor left princes island her crew began to feel in all its force the ill effects of the putrid air of batavia and soon afterward the ship was a mere hospital filled with unhappy wretches sinking under the rage of fevers and dysenteries in the space of six weeks twentythree persons died exclusive of the seven which had been buried at batavia these were nine seamen the corporal of the marines the ships cook two of the carpenters crew the carpenter and his mate a midshipman the old sailmaker who was in perfect health when all the rest were ill at batavia and his mate the boatswain mr monkhouse a midshipman mr sporing who accompanied mr banks mr parkinson draughtsman to that gentleman and mr green the astronomer  after a passage in which nothing remarkable occurred the ship was brought to an anchor off the cape of good hope on the   th of march      the captain repaired instantly to the governor who said that such refreshments as the country supplied should be cheerfully granted him on which a house was hired for the sick who were to have their board and lodging on the payment of two shillings a day for each man  at the time the endeavor lay at anchor here an english east indiaman sailed for the port of london who had buried above thirty of her crew while she was in india and at that time had many others severely afflicted with the scurvy so that the sufferings of the crew of the endeavor considering her long absence from england is a circumstance not at all to be wondered at  we shall now proceed to a description of the cape of good hope in which we shall only mention such particulars as are either wholly new or such as have been misrepresented by other writers the land over the cape is mountainous and totally barren beyond these mountains the country is covered with a light sand which will not admit of cultivation there are indeed a few cultivated spots but they are hardly more than a thousandth part of the whole country provisions are brought to the cape from a distance nine hundred miles up the country which is an evident proof of its extreme sterility notwithstanding what has been heretofore written to the contrary while captain cook lay here a farmer came to the cape bringing his young children with him from a distance that took him fifteen days journey and on his being asked why he had not left his children with some neighbor he said there was no inhabitant within five days journey of his farm there are no trees that are even two yards in height except in some plantations in the vicinity of cape town  this town consists of near a thousand brick houses the outsides of which being generally plaistered they have a very pleasing appearance there is a canal in the main street with two rows of oaktrees on its borders which are in a more flourishing state than the other trees of this country the streets which cross each other at right angles are very spacious and handsome the inhabitants are chiefly dutch or of dutch extraction the women are beautiful in a high degree and possess those blooming countenances which denote the most perfect health they are most of them mothers of many children and captain cook says they are the best wives in the world  the air of the cape of good hope is so pure and salubrious that a sick person who goes thither from europe whatever be his disorder almost always recovers his health in a little time but those who bring diseases with them from the east indies have not an equal chance of recovery  although this country is naturally so barren as scarcely to produce any thing yet the unceasing industry of its inhabitants has so effectually combated the sparing hand of nature that there are few places where the necessaries of life are more plentiful and even what are generally deemed luxuries are by no means scarce the constantia wine is known to be excellent but the genuine sort is made only at one particular vineyard a few miles from the town the gardens produce many sorts of european and indian fruits and almost all the common kinds of vegetables the cultivated fields yield wheat and barley of equal quality with that of the growth of england the sheep of this country have tails of a very extraordinary size many of which weigh upwards of a dozen pounds the meat of this animal as well as of the ox is very fine food the wool of the sheep is rather of the hairy kind and the horns of the black cattle spread much wider than those of england while the beast himself is handsomer and lighter made the cheese has a very indifferent flavor but the butter is extremely good the pork of this country is nearly the same as that of europe and there are abundance of goats but the inhabitants do not eat their flesh the country abounds in hares altogether like those of england there are several species of the antelope a plenty of bustards and two kinds of quails  when a stranger arrives at the cape it is customary for him to board in a private house and he pays from two shillings to a crown a day according to the accommodations he expects if he appears and behaves as a gentleman he is invited to the private entertainments which are given by the more opulent of the inhabitants and this cannot fail of being the more acceptable as there are no places of public diversion in the country horses are here let to hire at six shillings a day and coaches at one pound four  the dutch company have a garden at the extremity of the high street which is more than half a mile in length in the center walk of which are a number of fine oak trees a small part of this garden is covered with botanical plants but all the rest is allotted to the production of the common vegetables for the kitchen the whole is divided into squares by the form of its walks and each square is fenced in by oaks cut into small hedges there is a menagerie of beasts and birds many of them known in europe at the upper end of this garden and among the rest is the coe do a beast not less than a horse which has those curious spiral horns that have frequently found a place in the cabinets of the curious  the native inhabitants of this country are usually dressed in a sheep skin thrown across the shoulders and a little pouch before them to which is fixed a kind of belt ornamented with little bits of copper and beads round the waists of the women is a broad piece of leather and rings of the same round their ancles to protect them from the thorns which grow in abundance all over the country a few of them wear a kind of shoe made of the bark of a tree but the major part of them go barefooted both sexes adorn themselves with bracelets and necklaces made of beads none of these people reside at a less distance than four days journey from cape town except a number of the poorer sort who look after the cattle belonging to the dutch farmers and are employed in various other menial offices their stature is about the same as that of the people of england from five to six feet in height but scarce any of them are corpulent their skins are dark but this is in a great degree owing to their extreme indelicacy their hair curls naturally and falls in finglets of above six inches in length they are singular for their strength and agility  most of the hottentots speak the dutch language without any thing remarkable in their manner yet when they converse in their native language they frequently stop and make a clucking with their tongues which has a most singular and ridiculous effect to the ears of a stranger and exclusive of this clucking their language itself is scarcely sounded articulately  these people are modest to the utmost degree of bashfulness and though they are fond of singing and dancing can hardly be prevailed on to divert themselves with their favorite amusements before strangers both their singing and dancing are alternately quick and slow in the utmost extreme  some of the hottentots understand the art of melting and preparing copper with which they make plates and wear them on their foreheads as an article of finery they are also capable of making knives superior to those they can purchase of the dutch from whom they procure the iron  they have the art of making butter by shaking milk in the skin of a beast with this butter they anoint their skins or when they cannot procure butter they use the fat of the sheep the principal people are owners of immense herds of cattle and these clothe themselves with the skins of lions and other beasts which are adorned with fringes elegantly designed  the hottentots are so dextrous in throwing stones that they will hit a mark not larger than a crown piece at the distance of an hundred yards they are likewise expert in the use of arrows and of the lance called an assagay the points of which they poison sometimes with the venom of a serpent and sometimes with the juice of particular herbs so that a wound received from either of these weapons is almost always mortal  exclusive of what is above recited they met with nothing respecting these people but such particulars as have been previously mentioned by various other voyagers and which will of course be found in the preceding volumes we shall therefore accompany the ship in her voyage to england  on the   th of april      the anchor of the endeavor was weighed and she once more put to sea but came to an anchor again before night near robin island as a few vegetables were wanted which they had neglected to take in at the cape the captain sent off a boat to the island but when she reached the shore some dutch soldiers forbad her crew landing at the hazard of their lives and the officer who commanded very prudently returned to the ship for some time they were puzzled to account for this behavior on the part of the dutch but it was at length recollected that the dutch government at the cape of good hope had assigned this island for the reception of such offenders whose crimes were not deemed worthy of death where their slavery consists in digging limestone for such a number of years as are thought proportionable to the heinousness of their offenses and that a ship belonging to denmark which had buried most of her hands had called at this island and taken on board a number of these criminals in order to navigate the vessel to europe hence the conduct of the dutch soldiers was easily accounted for  the ship sailed again on the following day when the master of her died having hastened his death by hard drinking though in other respects he left behind him an excellent character  on monday may day they came to an anchor off the island of st helena and as they proposed to remain three days mr banks employed the interval in surveying every object that was thought worthy of notice  the island of st helena rises out of the immense atlantic ocean is about eighteen hundred miles from the coast of america and twelve hundred from that of africa it has the appearance of a huge mountain the foundation of which is probably at the center of the globe it had formerly volcanoes in several parts of it as is evident from the appearance of the earth and stones in many places and it looks like a cluster of rocks bounded by precipices of immense height as a vessel sails along the coast the cliffs perpend over her head so as to threaten her instant destruction and nothing in nature can be conceived more awful than their appearance  close to the seaside stands the town which had formerly a church of very indifferent architecture but it is now little better than a heap of ruins nor is the markethouse in a much better condition most of the houses are also constructed in a vile taste  as this island is the property of the english east india company the inhabitants are not suffered to carry on any trade for their own emolument but get their livelihood by selling the productions of the island to the crews of the vessels which anchor there for a supply of refreshments  st helena is so happily situated with regard to climate that it would if properly cultivated produce the trees fruits plants and flowers of all the different parts of the world on the summit of the highest ridges the cabbagetree flourishes in the parts below these grow the gumwood and redwood and in the valleys many of the plants of the indies and almost all those of europe yet these several productions will not grow but on the spots of ground peculiarly adapted to each  the only white inhabitants of the island are subjects of the king of great britain these employ slaves who transport goods of all kinds from place to place on their heads and we are sorry to say that the inhumanity of our countrymen to these slaves in a disgrace to those who profess the christian faith there are a small number of horses at st helena but they are never employed in draught there being no such thing as a wagon or cart on the island though in many places the land is not so steep but that such carriages might easily be drawn  ebonytrees are a natural production of the island of st helena but there have not been many of them within the memory of any person now living there snails are found in abundance on the summits of the highest mountains but the other insects of the island are very few in number  on saturday the  th of may      the endeavor sailed from the road of st helena together with the portland man of war and several sail of indiamen they kept company with the man of war and indiamen till friday the  0th but captain cook observing that they were outsailed by all the other ships and consequently imagining that some of them would reach england before him made signals to speak with the portland when the captain of that vessel came on board and received from captain cook a letter to the lords of the admiralty together with a box in which were deposited the journals of many of the officers and the ships log books  on the   d they lost sight of all the ships they sailed in company with from st helena and in the afternoon of the same day mr hicks the first lieutenant died of a consumption with which he had been afflicted during the whole voyage  no single occurrence worth recording happened from this time till the ship came to an anchor in the downs which was on the   th of june following  whoever has carefully read and duly considered the wonderful protection of this ship in cases of danger the most imminent and astonishing particularly when encircled in the wide ocean with rocks of coral her sheathing beaten off and her falsekeel floating by her side a hole in her bottom and the men alternately fainting at the pumps and will yet deny the existence of a particular providence and the most gracious and merciful interposition of the deity in behalf of our adventrous countrymen will deserve some share of that censure which the thinking part of mankind have so liberally and justly bestowed on the compiler of the account of the voyage of the endeavor there is a comfort in the reflection that god is good which can be felt only by those who acknowledge his mercy and adore his power  account of mons de bougainvilles voyage round the world performed by order of the french king in the years                     a settlement having been commenced for the french king on falklands islands m bougainville every where calls these islands the isles malues but we shall call them by the name of falklands islands which was given them by our countryman strong in       in the month of february      the spaniards demanded them as their right as an appendage to the continent of south america and france having allowed the propriety of the demand mons bougainville was ordered to yield possession of the islands to the spaniards  in consequence of the orders he had received he sailed from the port of mindin on the   th of november      having under his command the frigate la boudeuse  la esmeralda and la liebre two frigates belonging to spain were to join him in the river de la plata to the commanding officer of which he was to deliver the settlement and the letoile a french storeship was to carry him such provisions as were necessary for the long voyage on which he was bound and to meet him at falklands islands but the voyage was necessarily several months longer in completing than it might have been on account as will appear hereafter of the delay which prevented the letoile from joining mons bougainville  the boudeuse had been at sea only two days when she encountered such a violent storm of wind as carried away the clue of the foresail broke the topmast and maintopmast and took off the head of the mainmast thus situated mons bougainville found it necessary to put into breast to refit and to make some necessary alterations in the stowage of his ship which was ill calculated for withstanding the fury of those seas he was to pass and particularly so for the navigation of the seas round cape horn  and here a reflection will naturally arise on that fatality by which those who have the appointment of naval equipments almost always destine for services of the most imminent danger vessels totally inadequate for the purpose hence arise orders and counterorders till the proper season for performing the most hazardous parts of the voyage is lost in the necessary preparation for making it  on the  th of december mons bougainville sailed from the harbor of breast having on board the prince of nassauseighen three gentlemen who went as volunteers eleven officers in commission and warrantofficers seamen soldiers servants and boys to the number of two hundred  on the   th they were in sight of the salvages a small flat island which at each end rises into a hillock the next day they saw the island of palma and that of ferro on the   th mons bougainville was now convinced of a great error in his reckoning which he attributes to the rapidity of the currents opposite the streights of gibraltar having corrected his reckoning he took a fresh departure and arrived at rio de la plata without meeting with any thing worthy of notice  on the evening of the   th of january they had sight of rio de la plata but as the night was dark and tempestuous they lay to with the head of the vessel toward the offing the next morning they had a view of the mountains of maldonado which after a ship enters the rio de la plata are the first high lands seen to the north at the maldonados the spaniards have a small garrisoned town in the vicinity of which are picked up some beautiful transparent stones and there is likewise a gold mine near it which has been worked for a few years past but has yielded little profit  on the morning of the   st the boudeuse came to an anchor in the bay of montevideo where the two spanish ships which were to take possession of falklands islands had been at anchor for some weeks  don philip ruis puente the principal in command of the spanish vessels having been appointed governor of the islands which were to be surrendered by the french he accompanied mons bougainville to buenos airs to settle with the governor general the mode of making the cession and the prince of nassausieghen attended them in this expedition  the gentlemen made the voyage in a schooner but a contrary wind preventing their passage by sea they went on shore above the colony of san sacramento and traveled over a prodigious extent of country in which there were no roads and where the eye was their only guide during this expedition they slept in little hovels constructed with leather while the tigers howled round them on every side mons bougainville particularly mentions the manner and the danger of their passing the river st lucia which is wide and deep yet amazingly rapid  being placed in a long narrow canoe one side of which was beyond all proportion higher than the other a horse was fastened on each side the vessel the master of which pulling off monsieur de bougainville crossing the river st lucia in a canoe drawn by horses all his clothes got into it and supporting the heads of the horses above the surface of the stream drove them across it in the best manner he was able and with some difficulty they stemmed the rapidity of the torrent it is necessary for travelers who pass this wild and extensive country to be very careful in finding the fordable parts of the rivers they usually drive before them a considerable number of horses in order to take fresh ones as often as those they ride on are jaded  monsieur bougainville having transacted his business at buenos airs returned to montevideo on the   th of february and was followed in a few days by the spanish governor don puente some necessaries of various kinds being taken on board the vessels were prepared for sailing to falklands islands  our author now gives a long account of the establishment of the spaniards in rio de la plata of which we shall take no notice because similar accounts are to be found in a great number of volumes some or other of which are in the hands of almost every reader  our voyagers having caused a small vessel to be laden with cattle for the use of the ships companies they sailed in company on the   th of february      a pilot acquainted with the coast of falklands islands having been previously put on board each of the spanish ships but this day they were obliged to bring their vessels to an anchor on account of the thickness of a fog which prevented their seeing land  the winds now proving contrary the ships remained at anchor the following day but as the current of the river ran strongly in their favor mons bougainville sent to acquaint the spanish commander that his vessel being too near the english sandbank off the isle of flores he thought it would be proper to sail on the following day even if the wind should not change in their favor to this the spanish officer replied that his pilot refused to weigh the anchor till the wind became fair and blew steady on which don puente was acquainted that the anchor of the boudeuse would certainly be weighed early the next morning and that she would either anchor more to the north or ply to the windward waiting for the spanish ships unless they should be unavoidably separated by the violence of the wind  the small vessel laden with cattle had not come to an anchor during the preceding night nor was she seen any more during the voyage but it was afterward learnt that she went back to montevideo after an absence of three weeks from that place the night had been so tempestuous that all the ships dragged their anchors and in the morning the spanish vessels were observed with their mainyards lowered and their topmasts handed the boudeuse however got under sail and got out of the river before night leaving the spaniards still at anchor mons bougainville had variable but chiefly bad weather till the   d of the month when he came to an anchor in the bay of falklands islands where the spanish vessels also anchored on the day following these last had suffered extremely through the inclemency of the weather the cabin windows of don puentes ship had been broke by the violence of the waves so that the sea for some time poured into her in torrents and a number of cattle destined for the use of the colony at falklands island died on the passage  on the  st of april mons bongainville in the name of the french king surrendered the island to don puente who received it for his most catholic majesty with the ceremony of hoisting the spanish colors and the firing of guns from the ships and on shore mons bougainville then read a letter in which his sovereign granted leave to such of the inhabitants as chose to continue their residence to be under the dominion of spain this offer was accepted by some while others embarked with the garrison and were conveyed to montevideo in the spanish ships the whole expense of the french settlement to the time of its being delivered to the spaniards was six hundred and three thousand livres but as his most catholic majesty took the ships provisions and all the stores of every kind he reimbursed this sum to france  mons bougainville now proceeds to make some historical remarks respecting falklands islands in which we shall trace him with all possible fidelity he says that in the year   0  when americo vespucius was on his third voyage for the discovery of america he sailed along the northern coasts of the islands and to him therefore he allows the honor of being the first discoverer yet he says that vespucious knew not whether what he saw was an island or a part of the main land gouin a french commander came to an anchor on these islands in the year   00 as he was returning from a voyage into the south seas but gouin mistook them for sebalds isles which he very near them falklands islands being between those and the island of beauchesne so that a ship at anchor on the east side of sebalds isles is within sight of falklands  besides beauchesnes description of what he took to be sebalds exactly answers to these for he says there are no woods that the country is swampy that there are many fresh water lakes and marshes on it and that it abounds in ducks snipes wild geese and teals  mons bougainville justly observes that falklands islands have been but little known and ill described till within a few years past they are commonly represented as being covered with woods but this mistake might very well happen in the accounts of those who only saw them from on board a ship for what are taken for woods are tall rushes which grow very close together and the stalk being dry to the height of five feet from the ground a large tuft springs from the top of it so that their number and the manner in which they grow form no ill resemblance of a wood great part of the hills on the island are covered with heath while the rushes grow only on some small isles and near the sea coast  in the year      sir richard hawkins had sight of these islands and called them hawkinss maidenland he says he saw fires on them and that they were then inhabited about the commencement of the present century a french ship called the st louis came to an anchor on this coast under the shelter of the isles of anican which are some small islands so called after the privateer of that name but the commander of the st louis did not think it worth his while to examine the country yet mons bougainville observes that the navigators of all nations have remarked how conveniently they are situated for affording shelter and refreshment to vessels bound to the southseas  france having come to a resolution of sending a colony to settle on falklands islands mons bougainville toward the beginning of the year      made an offer to establish the settlement at his own expense with the assistance of two of his near relations mons de arboulin and mons de nerville this offer being accepted the adventrous frenchman gave orders for the building and equipment of a vessel of twenty and another of twelve guns the former of which was called the eagle and the latter the sphinx and as soon as these vessels had taken in such stores as were necessary for the voyage and for making the settlement mons bougainville having previously engaged some acadian families embarked his officers seamen and settlers and sailed from the port of st malo on the   th of september       in the course of the voyage he touched on the coast of brazil and at montevideo at which last place he took a number of horned cattle and horses on board in order to stock the island to which he was destined on the   st of january      mons bougainville was within fight of sebalds isles and came to an anchor in a large bay on the eastermost point of falklands islands on the third of february  it was soon resolved to form the settlement on the coast of this bay and mons bougainville immediately began to take a survey of the island to learn what it produced for the support and convenience of life he observes that various kinds of water and landfowl and fish were all its edible productions and that the reader already knows that there grows no wood either for firing or other purposes but this deficiency in mons bougainvilles opinion might be tolerably well supplied by an excellent kind of turf which was almost every where to be found in great abundance  on the first arrival of our adventurers it was a sight not less pleasing than astonishing to behold the birds flock round them with evident curiosity but without the least signs of timidity these harmless animals used to perch on those who were standing still and would at all times submit to be taken with the hand but they very soon learnt to be shy of the company of those who sought only their destruction  the colony consisted of nineteen men five women and three children and mons bougainville having fixed on the spot for their residence they lost no time in erecting huts which they covered with rushes to protect them from the inclemency of the weather they likewise built a magazine and erected a small fort in the center of which they raised an obelisk under which they had placed several pieces of money and a medal on one side of which was the head of the french king with the following motto tibi serviat ultima thule and on the other side of the medal was an inscription of which the following is a translation  settlement of the isles malouines situated in    degrees  0 minutes of south latitude  0 degrees  0 minutes west longitude from the meridian of paris by the eagle frigate captain p duclos guyot captain of a fireship and the sphinx sloop captain f chenard de la giraudais lieutenant of a frigate equipped by louis antoine de bougainville colonel of infantry captain of a ship chief of the expedition g de nerville captain of infantry and p d arboulin postmaster general of france construction of a fort and an obelisk decorated with a medallion of his majesty louis xv after the plans of a lhuillier engineer and geographer of the field and army serving on this expedition during the administration of e de choiseul duke of stainville in february       mons de bougainville having promised the settlers that he would soon bring them more companions and give them farther assistance his relation mons de nerville agreed to stay till his return from france as well to be an hostage for the performance of de bougainvilles promise as to encourage the young colonists by participating in every hardship and danger to which they might be exposed in a station so far removed from all communication with the rest of mankind in return for mons de nervilles kind compliance with the wish of the settlers he was to be considered as their governor  on the  th of april      mons bougainville weighed his anchor and sailed for europe having first taken possession of the islands in the name and for the use of his most christian majesty  in the month of january      mons bougainville again visited falklands islands where he found the settlers in good health and pleased with their situation after he had debarked the stores which he had brought for their use he sailed to the streights of magellan where he took in timber and pallisadoes and a number of young trees for planting on falklands islands which place he again left on the   th of april when the whole number of colonists was only twentyfour  while monsieur de bougainville was on the abovementioned expedition in the streights of magellan he saw the ships under commodore byrons command the reader will recollect this circumstance in the account of mr byrons voyage related in the twentyfirst page of the preceding volume  the colonists on falklands islands were increased to about one hundred and fifty by a number of fresh settlers which sailed from france in the eagle in the year      this ship was accompanied by the etode storeship which carried provisions to the island by this time the governor and an officer who took care of the stores had good houses built of stone and the rest of the colonists were lodged in commodious huts having walls composed of sods of earth with the wood which mons bougainville had brought from the streights of magellan they had built several small vessels adapted to examine the coasts of the island and three magazines were by this time erected in which to deposit the public and private stores several kinds of grain which had been brought from france grew very well and promised a sufficient increase and some trainoil had been made and sealsskins turned by the settlers with which the eagle was loaded and returned to france  in the year      when an english colony had settled at port egmont captain macbride of the jason frigate visited the french settlement and to use mons bougainvilles own words pretended that those parts belonged to his britannic majesty threatened to land by force if he should be any longer denied that liberty visited the governor and sailed away again the same day  the above according to bougainvilles account was the state of falklands islands when the french surrendered them to spain and he pretends that the prior claim of spin was confirmed by such surrender of those who had made the first settlement and perhaps there might be some force in this reckoning if the prior claim of spain was founded in justice and warranted by the laws which have hitherto directed the discoverers of unknown countries an englishman however will be glad to see this argument stated in its proper light by which it will appear that the right to the possession of these islands is undoubtedly vested in the crown of these realms  the plain state of facts then is as follows as early as the voyage under sir thomas cavendish in the year      captain davis had sight of these islands they were seen a second time in      as beforementioned by sir richard hawkins who gave them the name of hawkinss maiden land the third person who saw them was the dutch voyager sebald de waert who called them sebalds isles and under this name they are laid down in the dutch charts in the year      they were seen by dampier and in      by strong who gave them their present english name of falkland islands which dr halley the celebrated astronomer adopting they are now so called in all the maps and charts of this country during the reign of william and mary the english privateers often saw these islands whereas according to mons bougainvilles own account the first frenchman who ever saw them was gouin no longer ago than the year   00 from this state of the evidence it does not appear that the spaniards visited them at all and that the french were the last visitors yet would mons bougainville have his readers believe that the spaniards have the prior claim to their possession and that this claim has been ratified by the french  this reasoning may sound admirably well in the ears of the slaves of two arbitrary monarchs but will be equally ridiculed and contemned by every sensible subject of our happier because limited monarchy  monsieur bougainville now proceeds to give an account of the natural history of and other particulars respecting falklands islands which he says are the result of the observations of his kinsman mons de nerville who resided at the settlement three years the picture our ingenious voyager gives of the first appearance of the islands is very striking and his arguments for and against settling them are very conclusive on their first arrival not an object struck their view except the commodiousness of the port in which the ship lay which could tempt them to take up their residence on so inhospitable a shore the land was in many places broke in upon by the sea the mountains unclothed with wood had the most barren appearance the fields looked dreary for want of houses and inhabitants an universal silence reigned except when the howling of some sea monster disturbed the solemn stillness while a dull and gloomy sameness of appearance added horror to the whole picture  discouraging as this scene appeared our adventurers knew that all would yield to time and diligence and that the labor of the industrious would not go unrequited indeed some consolation arose in their breasts on viewing the place in a more favorable light the climate had that kind of temperature likely to afford health strength and long life and was therefore preferable to the noxious air of those regions where the sickening inhabitant faints under the scorching heat of the vertical sun the island produced a number of plants admirable in the cure of the scurvy and other disorders incident to the sailors life the fish and the birds were most exquisitely delicious and there were amphibious animals in immense numbers while there were none of the fierce or the poisonous kind cascades and rivulets fell from the mountains which at the same time sheltered the fisherman from the violence of the winds so that he could sport or labor in the spacious bay in perfect security meadows of an immense extent promised constant pasturage for any number of flocks and herds which might feed at pleasure undisturbed by any tyrant lord of the soil these various advantages in the opinion of our adventurers were sufficient to recompense them for the dangers and fatigue of the voyage and a pledge for the full reward of their future labors  the situation of falklands islands is between fiftyone and fiftytwo degrees and a half of south latitude and sixtyfive degrees and a half of west longitude from paris from the entrance of the streights of magellan and from the coast of patagonia their distance is about   0 miles  the harbors are large and well defended by small islands most happily disposed and even the smallest vessels may ride in safety in the creeks while fresh water is easily to be obtained as the small rivers which descend from the mountains discharge themselves into the sea the tides do not rise and fall at any stated times but depend on the force with which the wind agitates the waves of the sea it was however observed that just before high water the sea rises and subsides with a quick motion three times within the space of fifteen minutes and that at the full of the moon and during the equinoxes and solstices this motion is much greater than at any other time  those winds that blow from between the south and west and the north and west points prevail more than others but in general the winds vary as in most other countries in summer time the winds usually blow from some point between the northwest and southwest it is remarkable that these winds rise with the rising sun increase in force as the sun advances to the meridian blow most violently just at noon decrease again with the declining sun and totally cease about the time of its setting the tides also frequently add to the violence of these winds and not unfrequently change their direction  the blowing of the winds in winter is a certain indication of the weather if they come from the southeast they are not so violent as the summer winds from the same quarter but they are accompanied with slight fogs when they blow between the south and west points hoar frost hail and snow are the certain consequences and the weather is wet and foggy when they come from the points between the north and the west the snow which comes with the south and west winds is but small in quantity and commonly disappears from the ground in a day or two except what lodges on the summits of the high mountains where it will remain about two months the running streams are never frozen and the lakes and stagnatepools have seldom been covered with ice strong enough to bear the weight of a man two days together in the spring and autumn there are slight hoar frosts which being changed to a kind of dew by the warmth of the sun are rather nutrimental than prejudicial to the vegetable productions there is seldom any thunder or lightning nor is the climate hot or cold in any extraordinary degree throughout the year the nights are in general starlight serene and fair and upon the whole the climate is very favorable to the constitution  the fresh water of these islands is extremely good and in great plenty the beds of some of the rivers are a kind of tuft which gives a yellowish cast to the water yet does not affect its taste but the bottom of most of the rivers is either sand or gravel  the depth of the soil in the valleys is more than sufficient for the purposes of plowing but before our adventurers could proceed to cultivation they were obliged to extract the roots of plants which every where intersected and choked up the ground for near a foot deep these roots they dried and burnt and they then made a rich manure for the ground from which they had been cleared under the first land is a layer of black earth ten inches or more in depth under that again a yellow soil beneath which are stones and slate but these stones are not found on the little adjacent islands the seacoast is in most places composed of stones which are very fit for the purposes of building and there are beds of a hard fine grained stone in several spots on the island likewise another kind of stones in which are particles of tale our settlers found a kind of stone which split in pieces easily and with which they made grindstones to give an edge to their instruments in the quarries they met with a stone of a yellowish hue which when first taken out was so soft as to be cut with a knife but it soon grew hard when exposed to the open air the island likewise yielded earth fit for making bricks and pottersware and plenty of sand and clay  in many parts of the country there are marshy places which produce a sort of rushes with sharp points the remains of the roots of which being continually wasting form the turf that was used for firing which burnt exceeding well and had nothing offensive in its smell  a plant of the gramen kind grows on a stalk which has a sweetish flavor and is extremely nutrimental for cattle who like it better than any other kind of pasturage this plant flourishes on the seacoasts and on the little isles where it bends till the stalks unite forming a kind of harbor to which the sealions and the seals occasionally retreat our adventurers in several excursions found these natural built houses a very agreeable defense against the inclemency of the weather and the more so as the dry leaves which had fallen off formed a bed by no means to be despised  the above mentioned plant is the largest that grows on the island which likewise produces many shrubs that were very useful in heating ovens and other purposes of firing a kind of heath which grows in great plenty bears a red fruit which is eaten by the fowls and birds  a plant was discovered which resembles a shrub but having been tasted it was thought fit for the brewing of beer happily our colonists were supplied with malt and molasses to which they added the beerplant and were enabled at all times to brew a very wholesome kind of sprucebeer which was an admirable specific for the scurvy this plant was likewise infused in water in which those who had contracted any illness while out at sea bathed themselves and it was found to be a fine restorative when pressed it yielded a mealy substance of a fragrant smell and a glutinous nature the leaves of this plant are small of a clear bright green and dentated  other vegetables in abundance were found which were used as antiscorbutics particularly watercresses sorrel wild parsley a kind of maidenhair and a species of celery  but the most extraordinary vegetable production of falklands islands is a kind of resinous gumplant of which we shall speak more particularly as it is wholly unknown in these parts of the globe though this is called a plant it is without leaves branches or any apparent stalk and except in color which is that of a bright green it more resembles a lump of earth rising from the common surface of the ground it does not grow to the height of more than eighteen inches and its breadth in different plants is from two feet to two yards and upwards the smaller plants have the form of an hemisphere and their circumference is regular but when they come to the full size they terminate in irregular bunches and hollows there are drops of a tough yellow matter as big as a pea on different parts of its surface which smell like turpentine mons bougainville having cut this plant close to the ground found that it arose from a stalk from which grew an immense number of shoots consisting of leaves resembling stars laying one within the other the outsides of these shoots which are exposed to the air are green and the insides white they contain a viscid milky juice which is likewise found in the roots and the stalk the roots extending horizontally frequently produce fresh shoots at a distance so that there is no instance of one of these plants being found alone the resin of this plant was found to be a good medicine for the cure of slight wounds but this resin was often washed away by the rains or wasted by the influence of the air yet however contradictory it may appear it would not dissolve except in spirits some of the seeds were brought to europe in order to attempt the cultivation of so singular a curiosity in the vegetable world  the island on which our colonists had taken up their residence is divided from east to west by a chain of hills to the south of which they found another plant not unlike the resinous gumplant which however did not yield any resin but produced beautiful yellow flowers neither was it of so firm a texture nor was its green of the same shade yet in other respects the resemblance was very strong on the hills was found a species of maidenhair which grew to a great height and the leaves of it were shaped like the blade of a sword the hills likewise abounded with various kinds of plants which had the appearance of holding a middle station between stones and vegetables it was apprehended that these might have been successfully used in dying and our colonists proposed to have made the experiment if they had remained longer on the island  the place produces flowers in a considerable variety but only one of them has any smell which is like that of a tuberose this flower is perfectly white a true violet was seen which was of a regular light yellow color  a fruit was found of the size of a pea which received the name of the lucet from its resemblance to the north american fruit of that name its color is white but the side which is exposed to the sun changes to a red it has the smell of orangeblossoms and a very agreeable flavor its branches which creep along the ground produce leaves of dark green which are round and shining and these leaves infused into milk give it a delicious taste the flowers grow in large numbers on the borders of lakes and the plant delights in a moist soil besides the lucet only one other fruit was found which grows on long branches in the same manner as the strawberry but it has the appearance of a mulberry which name it received and its leaves are like those of the hornbeam  our colonists found but few seaplants which they could apply to any use but all the coast of the harbor was lined with seaweeds which were serviceable in breaking the force of the waves in stormy weather many kinds of coralines of various beautiful colors and a great number of curious shells and spunges were washed on shore by the force of the tides among the shells were the smooth and striated muscle scallops whelks and a bivalve shell of a very singular kind named la poulette  sea lions and seals are the only amphibious animals found in these parts but there are great varieties of fish on the coasts scarce any of which are known in europe it sometimes happens that the whales getting too near the shore are stranded in the bays where their remains have been seen bones of great magnitude have been found far up the country where the force of the waters could not have conveyed them which mons bougainville deems a proof that the soil is increased or the sea diminished  the only quadruped found on falklands island is of a species between the fox and the wolf and our author therefore calls him the wolffox the tail of this animal is more bushy than that of the wolf and he lives in a kennel which he digs in the ground on the downs by the seaside at one time of the year the wolffox is so lean as to appear almost starved from whence it is imagined that he fasts for a considerable time he is about as large as a sheepdog and barks very much like one only that his yelp is not so loud he subsists principally on wild fowl in search of which he travels in such a direct line from one day to another that when our adventurers first beheld his track they imagined that the island was inhabited and that the natives had made the path mons bougainville makes it a matter of wonder how the wolffox can have been conveyed to these islands without considering that landanimals having got on large pieces of ice which being broken by the sea they have frequently been conveyed to places very remote from those of their first residence the circumstance of ice so broken from the shore is not uncommon on the coast of greenland  these islands and their coasts produce land and waterfowls in incredible numbers many of which are the prey of falcons hawks eagles and owls while the eggs and the young birds are destroyed by the wolffox  the smaller fish are destroyed by the whales the amphibious animals and the voracious birds some of which are constantly flying close over the surface of the waters while others perch themselves on the rocks to watch the event  mons bougainville now proceeds to a description of such birds as were found on the islands which could be applied to any kind of use omitting those that could not be rendered serviceable to the colonists  the swan is perfectly white except its feet and its neck the former of which are of a fleshcolors and the latter as black as jet  of wild geese there are four kinds only one of which feeds on dry ground it has very high legs and a neck of great length its flight is much more free than that of the english goose it walks with equal ease and does not cackle like the common goose the feathers of the male are white except on the wings which have a mixture of ash color and black the wings of the female are of various colors and its body is yellow it seldom lays more than six eggs the flavor of these birds is agreeable and they were found to be very nutritious exclusive of those which are hatched on the island large flocks fly thither with a westerly wind which blows in the autumn so that they were generally to be taken in great abundance and formed a principal part of the subsistence of the settlers those which came in the autumn were easily known from those resident on the island by their not being shy  the other three kinds are of various colors yellow white black and ash color they are not by far so beautiful as those above described and as they live entirely on fish their flesh acquires a disagreeable taste one of these three species seldom rises from the surface of the water and is almost constantly making a very disagreeable noise a soft thick down either gray or white grows under the feathers of all these geese as it does likewise under those of the swan  the rivers and ponds of falklands islands abound in teals of two species and two of wild ducks of the latter some are perfectly white and others totally black but in other respects they resemble those of england and france these birds are all exquisite fine food and to be procured in any numbers one kind of the teal is very small but the other is as large as the duck and its bill is blue the bellies of some of them are also covered with feathers of a fleshcolors  the island produces a bird which mons bougainville calls the diver but from the description he gives of it it is conjectured to be the grebe which abounds on the lake of geneva and of the skin of which the most elegant muffs and tippets are made of these diverse there are two kinds of which the most plentiful has brown feathers with no other variation than that the feathers on the belly are of a somewhat lighter color than those on the back the belly of the other kind is white and the back gray and the feathers on the belly are very thick shining and soft the eyes of these birds are as bright as rubies and are encircled with a ring of white feathers the female hatches only two young birds at a time which she carries on her back not subjecting them to the coldness of the water till feathers have taken place of the down with which they are hatched the toes of this bird are thin and of a green color and being round toward the claw they are not unlike the leaves of some plants their feet are not webbed as is common among waterfowl but their toes are separate having a strong membrane on each side  the colonists gave the name of sawbills to two kinds of birds which bore a great similitude to each other the chief difference consisting in their size and in the bellies of most of them being white while a few were observed to have brown feathers on the belly the feathers on the rest of the body are of a dark blue as soft as silk and grow very close together their feet are webbed and flesh colored and their bills pointed they lay their eggs on the rocks where great numbers of them live together and they subsist on fish thousands of which they destroy our settlers not only ate the eggs of these birds but frequently killed many scores of them at a time and their flesh was found to be excellent food they had so little apprehension of being catched that it was an easy matter to knock them down with a stick and in this manner they were usually taken a bird called by the spaniards quebrantahuessos which measures more than two yards from the extremity of its wings destroys the sawbills this bird of prey has a long bill with two hollow tubes of the same kind of substance as the bill and its feet are webbed some of the seamen called this bird the albatross but it differs considerably from the common bird of that name nor is it an easy matter to determine precisely on its species from the imperfect account which mons bougainville has given of it  gulls mews and terns of different beautiful plumage served to direct our colonists what was the proper time for taking of pilchards these birds flying in large flocks over the surface of the water dart on the pilchard and swallow it presently they catch another of these fish and then they disgorge the one which had been previously swallowed and so on when the pilchards are not in season they feed on various other sorts of small fish the eggs of these birds were found in great abundance upon the leaves of a plant on the borders of the marshes and they proved to be very good eating  three kinds of penguins breed on the island one of these is a remarkably grand and elegant bird the belly of which is a clear white the back a kind of blue and it has a ruff round its neck near the head of a bright yellow which descending toward the belly separates the white feathers from the blue ones these birds do not live together in numbers but seek the most quiet and retired places of abode one of them being caught with an intention of being brought to france soon grew so tame that it followed the person who fed it its food was bread fish and flesh but there was something more wanting for its sustenance for it gradually lost its fatness till it died the second kind of penguin answers to the description of that bird in ansons voyage this description will of course be found when we come to give an account of that voyage  the third kind of penguins lay their eggs among the high cliffs of the rocks where they reside together in immense numbers never seeking that solitude of which the first kind are so fond they are much smaller than the others and were named hopping penguins from their method of moving which is very much like hopping they have goldcoloured feathers which form a kind of eyebrows and a tuft of the same color which they raise when they are displeased this bird has a very cheerful look and its general color is a deep yellow  at different times but not frequently three kinds of petrels were seen by our adventurers these birds build their nests on the seacoasts where their young were sometimes found covered with down one sort of them is quite white their bills red and not unlike a pigeon a second sort is larger and the third smaller than the pigeon and these two sorts have white feathers on the belly while every other part of the body is black  eagles were also seen of three different species two of which are black with white and yellow feet and the other is of a dull white all these subsist on snipes and other small birds which they seize every opportunity to destroy  egrets a species of the heron were frequently seen on the island they make a disagreeable noise not much unlike the barking of a little dog and they never take any food till toward the evening  two kinds of the thrush came regularly to the island in the autumnal months one of which was of the same color as the european thrush and the other yellow except on the belly which was spotted with black there was a third kind of thrush which lived on the island throughout the year the feathers on the belly of which are of a bright red this was called the redbird and though mons bougainville ranks it among the thrushes it is probably no other than the redbreast of america  a bird which they called the seapie was constantly seen on the coasts the feet of which were white the bill red and the feathers black and white this bird whistles a kind of note which the colonists found it easy to imitate and by that means they came near enough to catch them without much trouble they subsist on shrimps which they pick up after the ebbing of the tide  such is mons bougainvilles description of the seapie but if it be the true bird of that kind oysters form a part of its subsistence for when the tide is out these fish are left on the sand and the seapie forcing open the shell with his bill swallows the oyster whence he is also called oystercatcher  great numbers of curlews the same as those of europe were constantly seen in the summer and snipes of the european kind were found in abundance it is easy to shoot these birds as they fly in a regular manner at the time when they are breeding they ascend to a great height and having sung some time in the air they drop at once into their nests which are built on the ground in the open field where it is most free from grass or other herbage so that these nests are very easily found the snipes are excellent food if dressed toward the decline of the year but in the breeding season they are lean and not so fit to eat  the amphibious animals of falklands islands are seals and sealions which having been beforementioned and being described in many books of voyages we shall only add that they frequently travel in very numerous companies three or four miles up the country to feast on the herbs and repose themselves in the warmth of the sun  of the fish which were found on the coasts of falklands islands one that was taken in the greatest plenty was called the mullet from the likeness it bears to the european fish of that name the colonists dried many of these which were full a yard in length the seals prey on these fish whenever they can catch them but by a natural instinct they are taught to avoid these voracious enemies by sheltering themselves in holes among slimy ground on the banks of the rivers and in these places they were frequently taken a fish called the gradeau about twelve inches in length was found in great abundance and another named the sardine was found only at the commencement of the winter season some white porpoises were taken in the bays when the weather was fair and some eels in those cavities of the rocks which were filled with water a fresh water fish was found about the size of a trout without scales the color of which was green many smaller fish were catched with the hook and line among them was one species the head of which resembled that of a pike and it had no scales a few soals were found and mons bougainville is of opinion that a greater number of those and many other different kinds of fish might have been procured if there had been hands sufficient to have constantly spared a proper number to attend the seafishery the shellfish found at this place were muscles a very small kind of shrimp a crab the feet of which were blue and a kind of crayfish or prawn the color of which was naturally red without boiling but our author says these were only taken through curiosity as their taste was much inferior to those european fish which are nearly of the same species  the above is a faithful detail of the natural history of falklands islands as far as it could be learnt by the french settlers during a residence of three years if they had continued longer in the country there is no doubt but that their discoveries would have been greater and their account more accurate from such as it is however it will probably be thought by the english reader that these islands are by no means so barren and inhospitable a spot as our ministerial writers took the pains to represent them as soon as it was known that our people in power had formed the disgraceful resolution of permitting the prior claim of england to this extensive country to yield to the imperious demand of the haughty spaniards  it must indeed appear evident to the unprejudiced view of the intelligent reader that these islands might in the course of a few years be made a very valuable possession as they abound in fowl and fish of various useful kinds while their amphibious animals the sealions and seals would yield a quantity of grease and trainoil which might make no inconsiderable articles of commerce and what astonishing crops of wheat barley and every kind of european grain might not be raised on a tract of land that is many hundred miles in extent it is true the islands do not naturally produce any trees but it would be easy to carry thither the seeds of some and young trees of other kinds and there is no doubt but that they would flourish in a country situated with regard to the south pole nearly as ireland is with regard to the north  as true englishmen we cannot help expressing a wish that the day may yet arrive when some statesman of sense and spirit may reurge and insist on the right of great britain to the possession of falklands islands the reader will excuse this digression and prepare to attend mons bougainville in the course of his voyage  after waiting at these islands till the  d of june      in expectation of the etoile storeship and finding that she did not arrive mons bougainville considered that as his vessel would hold no more than six months provisions and that he had only two on board it would be an act of rashness to attempt the crossing the great pacific ocean alone he therefore resolved to steer to rio janeiro at which place he had appointed the etoile to join him in case any unforeseen accident should prevent her reaching falklands islands before he left the harbor of that place  they had fine weather from the  d till the  0th of june on which day they had sight of the mountains on the main land of brasil and they saw the entrance of rio janeiro on the day following a number of fishingboats being observed near the shore mons bougainville hoisted portuguese colors and ordered a cannon to be fired on which a boat put off to the ship and a pilot was engaged to conduct her into the road  the coast of this country is broken by a number of small hills which serve to give an agreeable variety to the prospect the country is rather mountainous and well clothed with woods  the ship having arrived off the port of santa cruz a portuguese officer was sent to enquire the reason of her sailing into it on which mons bougainville sent one of his officers to acquaint the viceroy of the brasils with the motives for his touching there and to enquire whether if he should salute the fort the compliment would be returned  the answer which the french officer received from count dacunha marks that singular haughtiness and arrogance for which some of the portuguese governors are not a little famous  the count said that when a person bowed to another whom he might casually meet in the street he was not previously certain that his compliment would be returned and that if mons bougainville should fire his guns by way of salute he the viceroy had then to consider what was proper to be done as this answer was by no means satisfactory to mons bougainville he with that spirit of pride becoming a gentleman and an officer disdained to fire a single gun  about the same time a canoe was dispatched from the captain of the etoile to inform mons bougainville of the safe arrival of that vessel which now lay in the port the commander mons de la giraudais sent word that instead of leaving france in the month of december various accidents had combined to detain him two months beyond that time that when he had been three months at sea his rigging was so greatly damaged and his vessel admitted so much water that he was obliged to make the harbor of montevideo whence he sailed for his present station and had come to an anchor but a few days before mons bougainvilles arrival  the etoile had at this time salt provisions sufficient to supply both the vessels for almost a year and a half but as her stock of bread and legumes was insufficient for the consumption of more than seven weeks mons bougainville resolved on sailing to rio de la plata to take in a stock of those articles as neither flour wheat nor biscuit could be purchased at rio janeiro  on the   d of june      mons bougainville and his officers paid a visit to the viceroy of the brasils which was returned three days afterward on board the boudeuse when the viceroy gave permission for the purchase of a sloop which our adventurers imagined might be very serviceable during the long voyage they proposed to make the chaplain of the etoile having been murdered some days before the arrival of the boudeuse under the windows of the viceroys palace that gentleman promised that he would endeavor to find out and severely punish the perpetrators of the horrid deed but mons bougainville complains much of his remissness in the execution of this necessary piece of justice  the viceroy contrary to his usual custom continued to behave with politeness to the french officers for several days after this visit and acquainted them that he proposed to honor them with an elegant collation in bowers of orange trees and jasmine on the banks of the river and he actually gave orders that a box at the opera should be assigned for their reception here says our author a band of mulatoes performed the best pieces of metastasio while the compositions of the greatest geniuses italy ever produced were executed by an orchestra which was under the direction of a humpbacked priest in his canonicals  we cannot avoid making a remark on the illiberal and ungentlemanlike manner in which monsieur bougainville recites this part of his narrative for it would be in a high degree ridiculous to suppose that the priest because he had the misfortune to be crooked should be by that circumstance the less qualified to conduct a band nor can we see if the works represented were as our author calls them divine the great impropriety of their being under the direction of a priest nor of that priests being dressed in the habit of his order the french are ambitious of being accounted the best bred people in the world they claim a kind of exclusive right to politeness but they are only the smugglers and monopolizers of that commodity to the injury of the fair traders the english the scots the hibernians whose open sincerity and manly freedom of behavior gives the lie to the french assumption of a superior gentility it is evident from many instances in mons bougainvilles voyage that a frenchman can when he pleases be guilty of a savage illiberality of conduct that would disgrace the untutored boor of the wilds of siberia or the still more uncultivated savage of the uncivilized parts of america  at this time there lay in the harbor of rio de janeiro a french ship called the morning star and a spanish man of war named the diligent and while the viceroy behaved with all imaginable politeness to the frenchman he had artfully protracted the stay of the spaniard no less than eight months during all which time her commander had not been able to procure the articles necessary for the repair of his vessel and without which she could not proceed on her voyage in this dilemma don francesco de medina captain of the diligent applied to mons bougainville for the assistance of his carpenters and caulkers who were immediately sent both from the boudeuse and the etoile  the complaisance with which the viceroy treated the gentlemen on board the french vessels surprised the spaniards who told them that they must not long expect so great a share of his favor and they had soon reason to be convinced that the prediction was founded in truth for though the viceroy had permitted mons bougainville to purchase a sloop and he had actually agreed for one his excellency thought proper to forbid the delivery of it and notwithstanding they had contracted with this tyrannical viceroy for the purchase of some timber from the royal dockyards he afterward changed his mind and would not let them have it he even went so far as to refuse mons bougainville and the gentlemen on board his ships permission to lodge in a house near the town while the boudeuse was repairing notwithstanding the owner of the house had consented to accommodate the french officers  mons bougainville piqued at these repeated instances of the viceroys want of good manners and his total inattention to the common rights of humanity determined to pay him a visit to remonstrate with him on the glaring impropriety of his conduct taking with him therefore two of his officers he repaired to the house of the viceroy who was agitated with the most furious passion the moment mons bougainville began to speak and commanded him to leave the house this however he refused to do but kept his seat for some time even after the viceroy had called his guards who with more prudence than their master had shown neglected to obey his summons and the french gentlemen left the house without seeming to have caused any disturbance not long after their departure an additional number of guards were placed round the palace and orders were issued that if any frenchman should be seen in the streets after the sun was down he should be taken into custody the viceroy likewise commanded the captain of the french ship named the morning star to quit his present situation and anchor his vessel under the fort of villagahon which order was complied with on the following day  one of the portuguese officers was exiled and another imprisoned because they had behaved with civility to mons bougainville and it was easy to foresee that such of the inhabitants of the place as traded with the french would experience the consequences of the viceroys indignation every preparation was therefore made to quit a place which the tyranny of the count de acunha had rendered so disagreeable the captain of the spanish man of war supplied mons bougainville with timber proper for the repair of his ship and an inhabitant of rio janeiro privately sold him a number of planks which he was in great want of and indeed the inhabitants in general behaved with a kindness and civility which fully proved the sense they entertained of the impropriety of the viceroys conduct  mons bougainville now proceeds to give an account of the riches of rio janeiro and the amount of the revenues arising to the king of portugal from the mines of brasil these mines we have already given some account of in the former part of this work but as mons bougainvilles account is very interesting and contains many particulars there unnoticed we make no doubt but the reader will approve our tracing him with the pen of accuracy and fidelity  the mines which lie nearest to the city of rio janeiro are not less distant than two hundred and twenty miles and are called the general mines his most faithful majesty having a fifth part of the produce of these mines seldom receives less than one hundred and twelve arobas of gold from their annual produce and sometimes considerably more  there are mines at serofrio sabara and rio des mortes which are under the jurisdiction of the managers of the general mines near serofrio is a river the stream of which being turned out of its usual channel diamonds topazes chrysolites and other valuable stones are found among the pebbles in the bed of the river nor are any diamonds brought from the brasils but what are found in this particular spot  the stones thus found are deemed the property of the owners of the mines but the king of portugal has appointed a surveyor to whom they must give in an account of what diamonds are found with the utmost exactness these the surveyor puts into a casket which has three locks and is enclosed in iron plates the viceroy keeping one of the keys the provador de hazienda reale the second and the surveyor the third this casket and the keys with which it is locked are then enclosed in a second casket on which these three gentlemen affix their seals and this again is placed in a third on which the viceroy puts his seal and thus ships the treasure for portugal where the coffers are opened in the presence of his most faithful majesty who having selected such of the diamonds as he pleases the owners of the mines are paid for them at a rate stipulated by a previous agreement  the number of slaves employed in searching for diamonds is about eight hundred and for every days labor of each of these slaves the king of portugal receives a spanish dollar from the proprietors of the mines  it is extremely dangerous for any person to secret a diamond yet the practice is very common as the smuggled goods can be so easily hidden when a person is detected in this illicit trade if he is rich he is sentenced to deliver up the diamonds pay twice their value suffer one years imprisonment and then be banished to the coast of africa for life but if the offender be poor he is generally doomed to suffer capitally  in every district of the brasils where gold is found a house is erected to which it must be carried and the kings share paid the rest is sent to rio janeiro where it is melted into wedges and in that state returned to the owners these wedges being numbered and stamped with the kings arms the weight is marked on each wedge the gold is likewise assayed and the alloy stamped on it for the greater expedition when it comes to be coined  about ninety miles from rio janeiro is a place called praybuna where there is an office for the registering the ingots which are the property of private people and as all persons coming from the mines must necessarily pass this place two military officers are stationed here who have fifty men under their command whose business it is strictly to examine that no illicit trade is carried on so that every one who passes is obliged to submit to the strictest search at this place exclusive of the tax to the king men and beasts of burden are taxed with a farther toll of a real and a half each the half of which becomes the property of the officers and soldiers and the other half goes to his portuguese majesty  the ingots of gold which belong to private people having been registered at praybuna are then carried to rio janeiro where the proprietors are paid their value in demidoubloons which are worth about thirty shillings each o english money but there is a profit to the king for alloy and for coining these demidoubloons of about four shillings and sixpence on each the mint at rio janeiro is a most noble building admirably adapted for the purpose of coining money which is performed with the most astonishing expedition and this indeed is rendered necessary because two portuguese fleets usually arrive nearly at the same time that the gold is brought from the mines  the fleet which arrives from porto brings coarse cloth several articles of food with brandy wines and vinegar and this with the fleet which comes from lisbon occasions rio janeiro to be a place of very considerable trade the effects on being landed are charged with a duty of ten per cent to his portuguese majesty  soon after the earthquake at lisbon in the year      an impost of two and a half per cent under the denomination of a free gift to the king was laid on all goods landed at rio janeiro so that the whole duty paid is no less than twelve and a half per cent the latter duty is instantly paid on the goods being brought on shore but the officers of the customhouse will take security for the payment of the former at the expiration of half a year  there are two districts named pratacon and quiaba the mines of which produce diamonds but no person is permitted to seek for them that the market may not be overstocked for it is evident that to make diamonds plentiful would be to render them of little value  his portuguese majesty is at an expense of about one hundred and fortyfive thousand pounds sterling annually for repairing of the ships and public buildings working the mines and paying all his servants civil and military  the following account will show what value in sterling money arises annually to his most faithful majesty from the royal revenues of rio de janeiro  dollars the kings fifths are generally one year with another about one hundred and fifty arobas of gold which make in spanish dollars     000 the duty on diamonds amounts to   0000 the profit arising from the coinage of money is  00000 the duty of ten per cent paid at the custom house is   0000 the free gift of two and a half per cent amounts to about   000 various produces of the mines with the poll tax and moneys arising from the sale of offices and employments    000 dollars a duty laid on negro slaves produces   0000 a tenth on all the food of the country and the taxes on soap salt and trainoil bring in a revenue of   0000 total value in dollars     000  hence it will appear that the revenues arising to the king of portugal from rio janeiro are something more annually than four hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling reckoning the dollars at four shillings and sixpence each  mons bougainville now proceeds to give an account of his leaving rio janeiro and his second voyage to montevideo of which we shall carefully select as many particulars as may afford either instruction or entertainment to the reader  on the   th of july      the anchors of the boudeuse and etoile were weighed but as the wind abated soon afterward they were obliged again to bring to before they could get out of the harbor they sailed however on the following day and in the night of the   th the maintopsail of the boudeuse was carried away by the violence of the wind  on board of mons bougainvilles ship was a professor of astronomy who had made the expedition with a view of discovering the longitude at sea and as an eclipse of the sun was to happen on the   th of the month great hopes were formed that an opportunity would thereby be obtained of making the wishedfor discovery but it happened that these sanguine hopes were all frustrated by the intervention of clouds which obscured the face of the sun almost during the whole time of the eclipse  on the morning of the   th our adventurers had sight of the castilles at the distance of something more than thirty miles they saw the entrance of a bay which mons bougainville conjectures to be the same on the banks of which the spaniards have erected a fort the vessels sailed into the rio de la plata and were within fight of the maldonados on the   th early in the morning of the   st they had a view of the isle of lobos and before night came to an anchor in the bay of montevideo  the ships were no sooner anchored than the governor sent a gentleman on board mons bougainvilles vessel who acquainted him that most of the jesuits in those parts had been lately seized and their estates confiscated in consequence of an order received from the court of spain that these devoted victims of superior power had scarcely made the least resistance that they bore their misfortunes with a degree of patience and calm submission that did them honor and that no less than forty of them had been taken away in the vessel which brought the orders for their disgrace  as it was necessary that mons bougainville should remain in his present station till the equinox was passed his first care was to build an hospital for the sick and to take lodgings at montevideo this being done he repaired to buenos airs in order to hasten the provision of such necessaries as he wanted for which he was to pay the same price as the king of spain usually gave for the same commodities  mons bougainville was also desirous of conversing with the governorgeneral don francisco buccarelli on the behavior of the governor of rio janeiro and he soon learnt that don buccarelli instead of making reprisals on the viceroy of the brasils which he could have done very much to the prejudice of portugal had more prudently only sent a narrative of his proceedings to the court of spain  don buccarelli was so obligingly ready to supply mons bougainville with such articles as he stood in need of that in less than three weeks two small vessels sailed for montevideo with ladings of flour and biscuit for the use of the french ships mons bougainville also sailed to montevideo leaving an inferior officer at buenos airs to see the remainder of their provisions shipped  they now expected to sail in a short time when an accident happened that detained them some weeks beyond the intended period a spanish registership being at anchor a violent hurricane arose in the night and driving her against the etoile carried away part of the head of that vessel and broke her bowsprit on a level with the deck  the leaks of the etoile being increased by this accident it was absolutely necessary that she should undergo a thorough repair but as there was not timber enough at montevideo for this purpose mons bougainville obtained don buccarellis permission that she might sail up the river to the encenada de baragan which is a little bay formed by its mouth and in this bay by the   st of october she was put in a condition proper for sailing and began to take in the necessary provisions  in the road of encenada mons bougainville found a frigate and several merchantships which were bound for europe and two spanish vessels which having taken in a store of ammunition and provisions were bound to falklands islands and from thence to the south seas to take on board the jesuits of peru and chili two xebecks likewise lay here one of which was loaded with presents from his most catholic majesty to the inhabitants of terra del fuego in grateful testimony of his sense of their generous conduct toward the crew of the ship conception which was wrecked on their coasts about two years before  the inhabitants of the country on the banks of the encenada de baragan live in poor mean huts which are constructed with rushes having a covering of leather these are built in a very irregular manner on a miserably barren soil and the country around them is so poor that the people find it very difficult to procure the necessaries of life  from the road of encenada de baragan five ships sailed for spain having on board most of the french families which had quitted falklands islands and two hundred and fifty jesuits about this time two spanish register ships arrived one of them had been no less than seven months in her passage from europe above six weeks of which were expended in the doubling of cape horn where the fury of the winds was such as to carry away her rudder and lay her under the necessity of seeking shelter in this port when she arrived she had buried no less than thirtynine of her men and almost all the rest were so enfeebled by the scurvy that only a few of the officers and three of the fore mastmen were able to do their duty toward navigating the vessel mons bougainville with the greatest humanity sent a number of his crew on board her by which she was enabled to reach the harbor of montevideo  mons bougainville now proceeds to give an account of his sailing from montevideo to the island of st elizabeth which includes a narrative of what passed on his interview with the patagonians and several other interesting particulars till he reached the isle of st elizabeth  the etoile sailed from the encenada on the  0th of october and the boudeuse on the day following having on board provisions for ten months and soon reached montevideo having lost three men in that short passage by a boat in which they were sitting running fowl under the ship at a time when she was wearing two other men who were in the boat were with much difficulty saved and the boat was recovered  early in the morning of the   th of november      they sailed from montevideo with a fine gale of wind at north being in sight of land till the evening on the   th and the five following days the sea ran high and the wind was contrary so that they were obliged to reef their topsails on the   d the wind blew a perfect storm which continued all the succeeding night in squalls attended with rain the etoile made a signal of distress but the violence of the gale would not admit of any assistance being given them as the waves became less mountainous by the abating of the wind in the morning mons bougainville hailed the etoile to make enquiry into what damage she had sustained in the late violent storm when he learnt that several of her chain plates and her foretopsailyard had been carried away and that she had lost almost all the cattle which had been purchased at montevideo the boudeuse had likewise lost most of her cattle but had sustained no other damage  the winds were at this time very uncertain frequently changing during the remainder of the month and the currents were so violent as to drive the vessels as far as the fortyfifth degree of south latitude they now concluded that they were between thirty and forty degrees from the coast of patagonia and at length when they had soundings with a line of forty fathom they had sight of cape virgins the same land which sir john narborough and commodore anson have distinguished by the name of cape virgin mary  as mons bougainville had during a former voyage discovered a sunken rock in fortyeight degrees and a half of south latitude he avoided coming too near the shore till he was in fortynine degrees the person who had formerly first seen this rock imagined it had been a grampus and the ship had sailed within considerably less than a mile of it  it was on the  d of december that they had sht of cape virgins about which time they made all the sail possible as the wind was in their favor they now saw a number of alrosses and petrels the last of which mons bougainville says are a sign of bad weather whenever they are seen they also beheld penguins seals and whales in considerable numbers he says that the skins of the whale appeared to be covered with small worms very much like those which are observed to adhere to the bottoms of old vessels which he rotting in harbor some white birds not unlike pigeons but of a larger size now perched on the yards of the boudeuse  soon after they had sight of cape virgins they made the land of terra del fuego and for several successive days they contended with tempests and contrary winds on the  d of december the wind blowing favorable for a short time they made their best efforts to reach the entrance of the streights of magellan but the wind soon fell to a dead calm and thick fogs clouded the whole coast of the country in a few hours the breeze again sprang up but as by this time night came on they were obliged to ply to the windward  early in the morning of the  th the wind being favour they again stood in for land when  weather and rain preventing the having ght of the coast they were obliged to keep  it cleared up however in a short time when they made another attempt to enter the straight but the wind  the fog growing thcker and a storm  compelled to lay to between the main land and the two shores of terra del fuego  on the  th of december the foresail of the boudeuse was split by the fury of the winds and as at this time they were in no deeper water than twenty fathom they determined to scud under their bare poles lest they should run fowl of some breakers which lie off cape virgins to the south southeast  they now made other fruitless attempts to enter the straight sometimes being within sight of the cape and at other times at a considerable distance from it mons bougainville says that the view of this cape as given in ansons voyage is exact in every respect  the night of the  th was spent in standing off and on and early in the morning of the sixth they were in sight of cape possession and likewise of terra del fuego they now took the advantage of a westerly tide and tried to get close to the coast of patagonia they kept sounding all the night between the sixth and seventh not sailing to a greater distance from the coast than three leagues what they had gained by plying to the windward they lost by the opposition of the currents and about noon on the  th were back in their former station  what man in his senses who reads accounts like these would hazard the imminent dangers of such seas for the honor of having made a new discovery or the pride of saying that he had circumnavigated the globe  this day they had sight of cape orange which forms the first narrow pass in the streights this narrow pass mons bougainville called goulet which is not improperly translated gut it is rather more than forty miles from cape virgins to this first gut and the streights for ths distance are of different breadths of seldom less than five or more than seven leagues on the north coast the land is high and healthy and has a regular appearance as far as cape possession in the bays of which there are several dangerous rocks opposite to the two hillocks to which sir john narborough gave the name of the asses ears  in the afternoon when they had reached the entrance of the gut though the wind blew fresh and all their sails were set the tide ran with so great force that they were driven backwards instead of advancing in their voyage  in the evening the ships were anchored in possession bay and on the eighth by the assistance of a strong breeze they stemmed the tide and afterward by making different tacks they got through the first narrow entrance of the gut with the wind right against them  during the preceding night they had observed fires on the shore and this morning they discovered a white flag which the patagonians had erected on a ing ground on which a white flag was likewise hoisted at the masthead of each vessel the flag which these patagonians had put up was one given to them by the commander of the etoile when that ship lay in boucaults bay in the month of june      so that it is pretty evident that the people were the same mons bougainville speaks in very grateful terms of the care these indians had taken to preserve the flag  while the ships were passing the abovementioned gut a number of men clothed in the skins of beasts were observed on terra del fuego who ran along the shore with their utmost expedition in order to keep pace with the vessels they likewise frequently beckoned with their hands as if they wished our voyagers to land the spaniards say that the inhabitants of that part of terra del fuego are less savage in their manners than most other native indians when mons bougainville sailed from rio de la plata a spanish ship was on the point of sailing thence to convey some priests to instruct these people in the doctrines of christianity  the ships having come to an anchor in the afternoon in boucaults bay several officers from each vessel having fire arms with them embarked in boats and went ashore at the bottom of the bay the common sailors were ordered to remain in the boats and to keep them afloat the gentlemen were no sooner landed than half a dozen of the natives came riding up to them on the full speed when they were advanced within fifty yards of the french they dismounted and came forward pronouncing the word shawa having come up quite close they held out their arms and laid them on those of the officers whom they shook hands with and embraced repeatedly saying shawa which word was repeated by mons bougainville and his officers  an englishman on reading the above passage may be allowed to make a remark on the singular politeness of these savages manifested by the circumstance of embracing but he will not pay so vile a compliment to the delicacy of the uninstructed patagonian as to suppose that he made the first advance toward a salute on the contrary it is but a piece of justice due to the superior goodbreeding of the french to conclude that they taught the savages that worst rudiment of all politeness that most filthy deviation from all decent and manly behavior the shocking custom of men kissing each other an englishman of virtuous principles and refined ideas would scorn to kiss his own son whom he had not seen for a twelvemonth if the boy but approached to his teens no let the manly shake of the hand and the generous effusion of the heart from the lips be the only expressions of affection duty or politeness between man and man let our embraces be reserved for those amiable creatures to whom god and nature have taught us they are due  the patagonians appeared to be much pleased with the company of their new friends but it was observed that some of them had a mixture of fear imprinted on their countenances this however was soon removed by the hospitality of the officers who sent to the boats for bread and cakes which were as readily devoured as they were cheerfully given more of the indians soon approached among whom were some children they expressed no kind of surprise at the sight of their visitants and seemed not to be unacquainted with the use of firearms as appeared by their making a noise which resembled the report of a gun the good nature of these people was expressed in all their actions some of the french gentlemen being engaged in collecting plants the patagonians no sooner saw what kinds they collected than they immediately began to pull up and bring the same sorts one of them seeing an officer engaged in this employment went to him and pointing to his eye which had received an injury intimated his wish that some herb might be shown him the virtues of which would cure the disorder and this was deemed to be a conclusive proof that they had an idea of the medicinal virtues of herbs  mons bougainville received from these patagonians a number of skins of the guanacoe and other beasts in exchange for a few trinkets on which they seemed to set a great value some of the gentlemen having red clothes on the natives advanced and stroked them with their hands seeming highly delighted with every thing of that color they also made signs for some tobacco and as often as any thing was given them they cried out shawa in a very loud and disagreeable tone  a small quantity of brandy being given to each of the patagonians they had no sooner drank it than they struck their hands repeatedly against their throats and blew with their mouths so as to produce a kind of trembling sound at the conclusion of which they had a singular quivering of the lips  the evening now advanced and the gentlemen prepared to return to their ships which was no sooner observed by the indians than their uneasiness was expressed in their countenances and they intimated by signs that they wished them to remain longer as they expected more of their brethren the french on the contrary made signs that they would come again the next day and bring such articles as the natives had requested of them  mons bougainville and his party now walked toward their boats accompanied by the indians one of whom sung songs till they reached the coast and several of them went into the water as far as where the boats lay where they seized on all the articles they could put their hands on but when they saw they were observed they made no scruple to return them  as the boats were rowing off many more patagonians were observed galloping down to  countrymen and the crews of the boats now cried out shawa so loud that the people on shore could not fail to hear them  mons bougainville says that these indians were the same which were seen by the crew of the etoile in the year      for one of the seamen recollected a person among them whom he had before seen these people are well trade and appear to be about the height described by other voyagers our author says that it is the thickness of their limbs the largeness of their heads and the extraordinary breadth of their shoulders that make them appear to be of a gigantic race  the color of the patagonians is brown as is that of all the native americans in whatever climate they are born their muscles are strong and their nerves well braced and as their food abounds in juices proper for the nourishment of the human frame it is no wonder that they arrive at their full growth their eyes are sparkling their teeth extremely white and their faces round but rather flat and many of them are very comely men some of them have whiskers which grow long but are very thin and they all tie their hair which is long and black on the tp of the head the cheeks of some of them are painted red their language has an agreeable and melodious sound our voyagers did not see any of the patagonian wmen though it was conjectured that the men intended to have brought them from a  camp which appeared to be about three miles distant  these people wear a piece of leather round the  and a kind of cloak made of skins which  to the bottom of the leg and is girt round the body the part which would otherwise cover the shoulders  permitted to fall back so that the greater part of the body is left naked  the climate is so cold as apparently to requre more covering than the whole which they wear  orcustom will harden the human  the rigor of the most inclement   it was in the summer when mons bougainvlle was on the coast of patagonia yet he says there was only a single day on which the thermmeer was observed to rise to ten degrees higher than the freezing point  the rest of the dress of the patagonians consisted of a  of half boots made of the skin of the  and left open at the back part of the lg a few of them wore on the thigh a ring made of copper two inches in breadth and the necks of two very young men were adorned with beads  some small knives of the manufacture of england were seen in their possession which our author very properly concludes were the gift of commodore byron and their only arms consisted of a twisted gut in the two ends of which were enclosed a round pbble and weapons of that kind he says are used in all that part of the american continent  their horses are very poor and of a small size and the saddles and bridles were such as are used by the natives of rio de la plata one of these people was observed to have gilt nails on his saddle stirrups made of wood enclosed with copper a bridle made of leather twisted and a complete spanish harness  their food consists chiefly of guanacoes and vicunnas and they eat both the flesh and marrow of those animals they devour this meat raw with great avidity and carry it with them on their horses fresh water being very scarce in this country the horses drink the sea water as do likewise their dogs which are both small and ugly  it was observed that some of them pronounced capitan chi bueno and other panish words mons bougainville concludes that the patagonians lead the same kind of life as the tartars as they are always on horseback traversing immense plains in pursuit of wild beasts and game and he imagines that they also like the tartars plunder the caravans of travelers but this remark seems equally cruel and unjust from his own account of the singular friendship and kindness with which they treated himself and his fellowvoyagers our author concludes this part of his narrative by saying that he has since found a nation in the south acific ocean which is taller than the patagonians  mons bougainville tells us that the soil of this country is extremely dry and very much like that of falklands islands the coast likewise exhibits the same kind of seaweeds and shells of similar sorts are strewed upon the beach the country produces shrubs but affords no woods for shelter  on the th of december      all the sails of the vessels were set to make head against the fury of the tide but they were obliged again to come to an anchor after sailing only three miles during two whole days the weather was so tempestuous that not a boat could put off from the ships which was a mortifying circumstance as great numrs of the patagonians were by this time got tther on the ot where they had conversed with the officers who were concerned that they were not able to keep tr promise with these friendly people wose little wants might have been easily suppled  by the help of glasses that they had built several huts on the shore and it was observed that some of them were constantly galloping backwards and forwards from this place to a spot where it was supposed the main body of them lay  early on the morning of the   th the boudeuse lost an anchor by the parting of the cable soon after which they set all their sails and by the assistance of the ebbtide and a favorable wind they got through the second gut in the afternoon and anchored on the northside of the isle of elizabeth  as they were detained here two days by tempestuous weather and contrary winds mons bougainville resolved to land on the isle of elizabeth where he met with a few bustards that were at this time hatching their eggs but these birds were so intimidated at the sight of our adventurers that they could not approach near enough to have even a single shot at them the island produces no wood but only a kind of heath which might supply its place as fuel fr the fire the water of this place is brackish and the soil extremely dry several places were likewise observed which had been marshes but had become dry and the ground on some parts of them were covered with a thin crust of salt it was evident that this island was occasionally visited by the indians as the shells of some fish they had eaten were found near where a dead dog was lying and where it was plain that fires had been made  our adventurers were now on the point of entering that part of the streights of magellan which abounds in woods and the principal difficulties were already overcome  on the afternoon of the  0th the anchors were weighed and they sailed with a violent wind in a channel between the islands of st barthelemi and lions and that of elizabeth they were now obliged to coast the last named island to steer clear of a number of breakers with which the other islands are encompassed having sailed beyond cape noir they observed that the country had a pleasant appearance being almost every where covered with woods which afforded a most delightful prospect to the eye  in the evening the weather became suddenly calm and pleasant so that mons bougainville pleased himself with the hope of being able to double cape round before the morning but in this climate the most flattering appearances are by no means to be relied on a truth that was fully evinced in the present instance for soon after twelve at night the wind suddenly shifted and blew most violently bringing with it storms of hail and deluges of rain while a fog apparently impenetrable covered the whole coast  the mainsail of the boudeuse being split by this storm they endeavored to make port famine where they hoped to be sheltered from the tempest but this attempt was fruitless for the violence of the current was such that they lost nine miles in as many hours and were hurried with amazing rapidity into a large bay formed by part of the coast of terra del fugo which mons bougainville called bay duclos from the name of the officer who was next in command under the commodore of the expedition and whose knowledge and experince are mentioned as circumstances highly advantageous to the enterprise  this bay is described as being very convenient for ships to anchor in on account of the westerly winds blowing over the coast two small rivers discharge their streams into the bay the water of which is excellent at about a quarter of a mile from the sea coast though nearer than that distance it is impregnated with  particles the landingplace is a sandy beach above which a pleasant meadow stretches itself to a considerable distance behind this meadow the woods raise their lofty heads and form a kind of amphitheatre our adventurers traversed a considerable tract of the country without meeting with any living animal except a very few parroquets bustards ducks teals and two or three snipes  several huts were seen at the mouth of a river which had been constructed by twisting branches or trees into the form of an oven in these huts were found large numbers of limpets muscles and calcined shells and the huts themselves appeared to have been recently made our adventurers going some miles up the river observed the trck of human creatures and remarked that the flood came from the east at the rising of the tide which they had not before observed in any other part of the streights  the seamen were now engaged in cutting wood till the   th when the vessels sailed with a favorable wind and passed point st anne which covers port famine a bay so called on account of the disastrous fate of the colony formerly establishd on its borders by the too adventrous spaniards  mons bougainville observes that the shores of this country are covered with wood and are remarkably steep those of terra del fuego he says are horrible to behold and that mountains those are covered with a blueish snow as old as the creation  these are his own words but with all submission to the learning and penetration of our ingenious voyager we cannot conceive by what kind of intuition he came to know that the snow had lain on these mountains more than five thousand years or even that it had not fallen within five days of the time he saw it it is no breach of christian charity to observe that these frenchmen are as finished coxcombs in their writings as they are in every part of their dress and behavior it is hoped that englishmen will be cautious how they imitate them in either particular  there are four bays proper for the anchoring of vessels between cape forward and cape round and two of these bays are separated by a cape of a most singular kind which consists of petrified shells laying horizontally and rising more than fifty yards above the level of the sea mons bougainville took soundings at the foot of this cape but a line of an hundred fathom would not reach the bottom  as the ships were now becalmed for two hours our commodore took this opportunity of taking the soundings near and the bearings of cape forward which he mentions as the most southerly point of land on the continent in the known world and he fixes its latitude at fiftyfour degrees five minutes and fortyfive seconds south its surface consists of two hills something more than two miles in extent one of which is considerably higher than the other the tops of these hills are covered with snow which gradually melting by the warmth of the sun supply with perpetual moisture the roots of trees which are fixed in the crevices of the rock  mons bougainville and his party landed on a small rock which barely afforded room for four persons to stand on and here they hoisted the colors of the boat and repeatedly shouted vive le roi our author mentions it with an air of triumph that these rocks now resounded for the first time with this compliment to the grand monarche a striking instance of the vanity by which the french nation is distinguished  having returned to the ship and the wind coming about favorable mons bougainville sailed in search of a harbor which received the name of french bay where he resolved to take in a quantity of wood and water as a supply during their voyage across the great south sea in consequence of this resolution all the boats were instantly hoisted out with a view to begin this necessary business the next morning  the night proving excessively stormy and  it was passed in fears and apprehensions which baffle all description  early in the morning a boat was sent out to sound the mouth of a river which had been previusly denominated ges river from the name of a gntleman who was a partaker in the dangers and hardships of this expedition as it was low water when the boat reached the shore her crew could not land without running her aground on a sand and it was evident that the larger boats could only make the shore monsieur bougainville hoisting the french colors on a small  at high water so that their wood and water could be brought on board only once a day for these reasons mons bougainville determined to anchor in a small bay about three miles distant called after his own name where he had in the year      taken in a loading of wood for falklands islands  bougainville bay to which they now sailed is surrounded by high mountains which secure it from the winds blowing from every point of the compass so that the surface of the water is unruffled even by a single breeze  having cast their anchors in this bay and made fast the vessels by means of hawsers tied to some trees on the coast they landed and found two indian huts constructed of the branches of trees but they did not appear to have been lately inhabited in the year      mons bougainville had caused a hut of bark to be erected on this spot in which he left some trifles by way of present to such of the natives as might happen to wander that way on this hut he had put up a white flag but both the presents and the flag had been taken away and the hut levelled with the ground  on the morning of the   th of december a kind of camp was formed on shore by way of guarding the effects which were landed and protecting the men who were to be employed in taking in wood and water small ponds were now dug for the accommodation of those destined to wash the linen and the water casks were sent on shore to be repaired the crew of the eagle having in      cut down many more trees than were wanted for that vessel the labor of this task was saved to our present adventurers who were likewise happy in finding roads ready made through the woods for the convenience of bringing down the timber to the seashore at this place the remainder of the month was spent in the necessary employment abovementioned and in repairing the ships particularly the etoile which had so large a leak in her stem that most of the hands on board her were fatigued beyond expression by standing at the pumps alternately night and day  the astronomer mons verron now landed on a little island which was denominated the isle of observatory from its being a place admirably calculated for the making astronomical observations but his labors were fruitless owing to the cloudiness of the weather which is almost perpetual in this country at some periods however the sun appeared free from clouds and melted a part of the snow which had lodged on the mountains of the main land whenever this fine weather happened the prince of nassau attended by mons de commercon a celebrated botanist went in search of plants and herbs and they were very successful in their researches but the gentlemen who endeavored to fish or to hunt for animals met with no such good fortune for they never catched even a single fish nor ever saw any quadruped but one fox which was killed by the party employed in collecting the stores  mons bougainville having formed a resolution of taking a survey of the coasts of the main land and likewise of those of terra del fuego he embarked in his boat early in the morning of the   d accompanied by two gentlemen who proposed to sail with him as far as cape holland the weather was calm and serene at their first setting out but the wind soon varied to different points of the compass and blew a hurricane which obliged our adventurers to take shelter in the mouth of a small river having gained the desired port they waited in the hope that the storm would abate till they were almost benumbed with the cold and wet to the skin with the rain they therefore landed and cutting down some branches of trees erected a kind of hut in order to shelter them during the night these huts says mons bougainville serve as palaces to the natives of these climates but we had not yet learnt their custom of living in them  it continued to rain incessantly and was at the same time so cold that the gentlemen found their present situation untenable they therefore sheltered themselves as well as they could under the sail of the boat and kept up a large fire all night which was tempestuous in a very high degree in the morning they hastened to their boat and returned to the ship happy by that means to avoid the effects of the growing tempest which soon became so violent that it would have prevented their returning at all for two days after this it snowed continually so that the mountains were covered notwithstanding it was now midsummer and the sun appeared almost eighteen hours in the four and twenty  when the storm had subsided mons bougainville formed the resolution of going on a second expedition which he flattered himself would be attended with more success accordingly early in the morning of the   th the barge of the etoile and the longboat of the boudeuse having been armed with swivel guns and muskets our adventurers embarked with the prince of nassau and two other gentlemen and sailed for the coast of terra del fuego where they arrived in about six hours and finding a number of huts which the natives had left in a delightful wood on the seacoast they there sat down and made a most agreeable repast  after dinner they coasted the country for a considerable time and then crossed an inlet which mons bougainville conjectures to be a straight which leads to the sea at no great distance from cape horn this conjecture is founded partly on the width of the inlet which is not less than six miles and partly on the observing a prodigious number of whales in that part of the sea  when our adventurers had almost reached the opposite side of the inlet they saw a number of fires on the coast and soon afterward discovered several of the inhabitants on the point of a bay toward this place they immediately steered and they had no sooner landed than mons bougainville recollected that these indians were the same people whom he had seen on his former voyage in the streights and whom he had then distinguished by the name of pecherais because these savages were perpetually making use of that word in the same manner as the patagonians did that of shawa  the number of the pecherais that had thus assembled was about forty of both sexes and all ages and they had several canoes in an adjacent creek as the evening advanced mons bougainville could not stay long with his old acquaintance but left them in order to reach an inlet where he proposed to spend the night but as the time would not permit the accomplishing his wish he landed on the banks of a river and having caused tents to be made of the sails of the boats and a large fire to be made the party spent the night in perfect safety and much to their satisfaction  on the following day it was found that the inlet abovementioned was an excellent port wherein ships might be sheltered against every dangerous wind and in which the ground is admirably calculated to afford the best and safest anchorage from the elegance and convenience of this bay and port it received the name of beaubassin the beautiful harbor mons bougainville mentions this place as equally convenient for the careening of ships and for the taking in wood and water  that no necessary information respecting so commodious a harbor might be lost the commodore left mons bournard there to take the most exact account of every thing that might be thought worthy of notice and he was then to return in the longboat to the ships in the mean time mons bougainville and a part of his company embarked in the barge and rowing to the westward discovered an island on the coast of which several of the natives were employed in fishing before the evening our voyagers arrived at a bay which received the name of de la cormorandiere from a rock which appeared at about a mile distant ftom it  early in the morning of the   th mons bougainville departed from this bay and sailed between two islands to which he gave the name of the two sisters they are situated about nine miles from cape forward soon after this they discovered a mountain of a conical a prospective view of the great cascade in cascade bay form which they called the sugar loaf and in the course of the day they arrived at a commodious bay at the bottom of it there is a most excellent port into which falls a very singular cascade for these reasons the place received the name of the bay and port of the cascade it is represented as a place highly proper for taking in wood and water and very safe to anchor in  the stream of a small river which seeks its way between a number of lofty hills forms this waterfall which descends perpendicularly down the side of the rock above a hundred yards mons bougainville went to the top of the cascade and made his remarks on the appearance of the adjacent country in some parts of which there are small plains which produce a kind of spungy moss and in others the ground is covered with thickets of wood the plants and trees are of the same kind as those which the coast of patagonia produces and the whole face of the country has much the appearance of falklands islands except the want of trees at the latter place on the whole our author says that all that part of terra del fuego from the present spot to that which lies opposite elizabeth island consists only of large and mountainous islands the summits of which are clothe dwith perpetual snow mons bougainville searched in this place to find the traces of inhabitants but he did not succeed and he is of opinion that the natives of terra del fuego seldom if ever depart from the sea shores because on those they obtain the necessaries of life  our adventurers remained at port cascade during the night of the   th which was rendered highly disagreeable by incessant rain and intense cold and on the morning of the following day they crossed the straight with a boisterous wind and a rough sea which rendered the navigation dangerous to so small a vessel the rain kept pouring down almost the whole of this day which was employed in viewing the coast and making such remarks as may be useful to future navigators our voyagers had now a very narrow escape with their lives the boat having been nearly overset in crossing a bay owing to a mistake of the steersman in the management of the helm at length however they got safe on board the boudeuse and as the commanding officer during mons bougainvilles absence had shipped every thing that was necessary preparations were immediately made for sailing  they departed from bougainville bay in the afternoon of the   st of december      and in the evening came to an anchor in the road of port galant which is situated at the bottom of fortescue bay where they were detained no less than three weeks by such bad weather as the inhabitants of these milder climes cannot form an adequate idea of  on the first of january      mons bougainville dispatched a party in a boat to make remarks on the coast as far as elizabeth bay and to take a view of the numerous islands with which this part of the streights of magellan abounds two of these islands to which sir john narborough formerly gave the names of charles and monmouth were distinctly seen from the place where the ships lay at anchor but those which he has denominated the royal isles and rupert island were at too great a distance to be viewed from mons bougainvilles present station  notwithstanding the severity of the weather and the almost incessant rains the crew which had been sent out landed on different places at one of which it was evident that some english ships had lately touched for on several trees they saw initial letters and even whole names cut in the wood they also saw many spicelaureltrees the bark of which had been lately taken off with other plain indications who they were that had visited the spot but what put the matter beyond all doubt were the words chatham march      which were very legible on a piece of wood of that kind which is frequently affixed to pieces of cloth in the royal marine warehouses of great britain  the astronomer mons verron in the mean time had his astronomical instruments conveyed to a peninsula by which the harbor is formed in order to make observations for ascertaining the bearing and distances of particular capes but the result of his observations would afford neither instruction nor entertainment to any but the mere nautical reader nor would they be of the least use even to him unless he was bound on a voyage to the south seas through the streights of magellan  the weather was so exquisitely severe on the fourth and fifth of january that no pen can describe it nor any imagination conceive an idea of it a violent storm of wind was attended with incessant rain or snow and the keenest biting coldness in the air mons bougainville informs us that during this severe weather he sent out a boat to search for a convenient anchoringplace on the coast of terra del fuego and an excellent one was found to the southwest of charles and monmouth islands  on the  th the weather was more moderate than it had been for some days past in the morning of this day four small boats with indians on board them were observed at the point of cape galant one of which advanced toward mons bougainvilles ship while the rest rowed toward the bottom of the bay in the boat which approached the boudeuse were a man his wife and two children the former of whom went on board without the least apparent sign of fear leaving the woman and children in the boat soon after this man had gone on board two indians from the other boats followed his example bringing their children with them  these people seemed not to express the least surprise either at the structure of the ship or at any thing they saw on board her which our author deems a proof that in order to be capable of being surprised at the work of art one must have some fundamental ideas of it  there may be some truth in this observation but we cannot help resolving the apparent want of curiosity in these savages into another and a very different cause namely their having seen the english or other vessels which had visited the streights of magellan  the commodore prevailed on these people to dance and sing and treated them with a kind of concert of music he likewise gave them bread and different kinds of meat all of which they devoured with avidity seeming equally pleased with every thing that was given them and with every occurrence that passed nor could they be persuaded to quit the ship till several pieces of salt meat had been put into their boats  our author calls these happy indians troublesome and disgusting guests  one would wonder on what authority he has adopted these epithets or how the company of the savages as he calls them could be troublesome or disgusting when they sang and danced only on being asked to do so received with gratitude whatever was given them and applied it to the purpose for which it was given  mons bougainville calls them unpolished men as if the frippery complaisance of the court of versailles could have been expected from these honest tenants of the woods whose instructors are plain sense and nature and whose god is the god of the europeans  in a word our author writes with an affected consciousness of superiority and in the pert restlessness of style that is almost peculiar to the french novelist who would be thought a philosopher  the people are clothed with sealskins which are by far too small to cover the whole of the body and with these skins they make the sails of their boats and the coverings of their huts they are likewise possessed of a few of the skins of the guanacoe but our author does not mention to what use they apply them though it should seem probable that they form a part of their clothing  mons bougainville describes these indians as thin short and ugly and that a most offensive smell is the consequence of keeping them company the women are still more disagreeable than the men who do not appear by any means fond of them it is the duty of the females to steer the boats and to repair any damage that may happen to them and they are often obliged to swim after them through the seaweeds nor are even women who have sucking children excused this duty the child is carried on the mothers back enclosed in the sealskin that forms her dress when the women are on shore their business is to collect shells and wood nor do the men even share with them in this employment  the boats are constructed of the bark of trees fastened together with rushes and the seams are caulked with moss a fire is constantly kept in the middle of the boat on a heap of sand which is placed to prevent the burning of the vessel their arms consist of bows and arrows formed of the branches of the berberry bush which grows plentifully in these parts the arrows are pointed with sharp stones and the string of the bow is made of the gut of some animal but they use not these weapons against an enemy they are destined only for the destruction of birds or other animals proper for the support of life  mons bougainville says that these indians use a kind of harpoon for the purpose of striking fish which is made of bones it is about twelve inches in length pointed at the end and indented on one of its sides  the principal subsistence of these people is fish but it is supposed that they sometimes catch game as they have dogs of the sporting kind and springes or nooses adapted for the snaring of quadrupeds the teeth of all the natives are very bad which our author attributes to their eating fish when boiling hot though they do not half boil it before it is so eaten they live in huts which have no partition of rooms in the middle of which a fire is lighted that serves the whole family  the disposition of these people is of the amiable kind but their extreme goodnature borders on weakness they believe in evil genii and have priests and physicians whom they suppose capable of deprecating the vengeance of their aerial enemies mons bougainville observes that these pecherais have the fewest conveniences of life of any people he has ever known yet they they do not repine at their situation but appear to be contented with the lot which providence has assigned them though they live in the most inclement climate hitherto discovered in the habitable globe exclusive of the other peculiarities of their fate they are fewer in number than any other known race of men yet this little society cut off as it is from all intercourse with the rest of mankind is not totally free from the vices common to larger states as a contest for dominion exists even among them and the more powerful are perpetually laboring to distress the weaker thus it is with the poor pecherais as with every other community in the universe that those who cannot make head against tyranny must submit to the arbitrary command the sic voleo sic jubeo of the tyrant  the inclemency of the weather during the  th and  th of the month was such that the crews of the ships could not venture on shore and though it was even now the summertime the adjacent country was covered with snow which also laid on the ship to the depth of several inches  on the ninth the indians who had previously painted their bodies with red and white streaks advanced toward the ships but seeing the boats go off toward their habitations all of them except one followed the ships boats and that went on board the etoile where she remained but a little while and then followed the others  the crews of the boats having landed went to the huts of the indians who seemed by no means to relish this unexpected visit which was particularly evinced by the women having all retreated to one hut the men invited the french sailors into those huts where the women were not to be found and the frenchmen having accepted the invitation were treated with shellfish which the indians sucked before they delivered them to their visitors the behavior of the natives was lively and they entertained their guests with dancing and singing they revelled with uncontrouled delight when alas their mirth was interrupted by an accident as fatal as unexpected  a boy the son of one of the indians was suddenly seized with a disorder which occasioned the most violent convulsions and spitting of blood this child had been on board the etoile where the seamen had presented him with some pieces of glass and as these indians are accustomed to put things of this kind up their nostrils and into their throats it is supposed this youth had taken the same measure and that the fatal effects which followed were the consequence of his having swallowed the glass it is here proper to remark that the pecherais consider the swallowing of substances which resemble glass as a preventive remedy against certain disorders to which they are liable  the lips palate and gums of the boy were cut and as he bled freely the indians conceived an idea that the frenchmen had violated the rights of hospitality and injured him whom by all the laws of honor they were bound to treat with civility  this circumstance gave rise to a jealousy and distrust no way favorable to their european visitors indeed it appeared that the indians suspected the french to have caused the childs illness a linen jacket having been given to this child by the french he was stripped of it and it was thrown at their feet but it was instantly seized by an indian who did not seem to dread the powers of enchantment  the child being laid on his back a conjurer knelt between his legs and pressing the body forcibly with his hands and head uttered a number of inarticulate vociferations at repeated intervals during this ceremony he arose and opening his hands which had been before grasped he blew in the air with his mouth as if desirous of driving away some evil genius while this business was transacting an ancient woman bawled in the ears of the child so as almost to deafen him with her noise and indeed the remedy seemed to be in the literal phrase worse than the disease the conjurer having retired for some time returned in a new dress and with an air of triumph renewed his incantations but with no better success than before his hair had been powdered and his head was distinguished by two wings similar to those with which mercury is represented by the painters the life of the child now appearing to be even in more danger than before the french chaplain hastily baptized him unobserved by the indians  what a strange medley of ignorance and superstition was all this  mons bougainville laughs at the folly of the indian juggler while he seems to speak in an applausive strain of the conduct of the french priest which was certainly equally ridiculous with that of the indian  some officers having repaired on board the ship and acquainted the commodore with what was transacting he went on shore with the surgeon who took some gruel and milk with him when they came to the spot they found that the juggler was assisted by another person habited like himself and that the patient had suffered much from their absurd attempts to relieve him yet were these attempts continued without any complaint on the part of the poor boy  the affection of the parents and indeed of the whole company of indians was manifested by floods of tears and by many other expressions of grief and when it was observed that the frenchmen seemed to share in their misfortune they appeared to be less diffident of the conduct of the strangers and at length they permitted the surgeon to examine the mouth of the sick youth which being bloody had been repeatedly sucked by his father and another man  after some time the father accepted the gruel and permitted his son to drink some milk but not till the french gentlemen had repeatedly tasted it in his presence the conjurers appeared to be jealous of the surgeon but they could not help confessing the superiority of his abilities it was remarked that while one of these indian physicians was endeavoring to drive away the disorder the other was busily employed in deprecating that vengeance which they supposed the visit of the strangers had occasioned  in the evening the child appeared to be less pained but from many circumstances it was thought that he had swallowed some pieces of glass mons bougainville and the surgeon now went on board and it is conjectured that the boy died about two oclock the next morning for soon after that time loud cries were heard and at daybreak the indians departed from a place which had been so peculiarly fatal to them for the loss of even one member of so small a community could not but be an object of great and public concern  on the   th and   th the weather was so bad that it was impossible to think of sailing and on the   th the vessels were detained by a strong contrary wind but on the following day they sailed with a favorable breeze which however soon shifted and prevented their reaching rupert island off which it was mons bougainvilles intention to have anchored after a whole day of fatigue and danger they returned to port galant and anchored again near their former station  on the seventeenth the storms were more violent than they had ever yet been the sea ran to a mountainous height and the wind blew in such contrary directions that the opposing waves destroyed each other the storm having in some degree subsided before noon a loud peal of thunder was presently heard after which the winds blew with increasing violence and all the elements waged a still more furious war the anchors of the ships having dragged the topmasts and loweryards were struck to avoid the dreadful consequences of the storm at this time however the shrubs and plants were in bloom and the trees were covered with a luxuriance of verdure  on the   st and the two following days the weather was extremely windy while it rained and snowed incessantly the night of the   st indeed was moderately calm but this calm served only as the prelude to a storm which descended with aggravated fury such a storm as the oldest sailor on board had never remembered but its continuance was by no means proportioned to its violence  on the   th the weather being fine and serene preparations were made for sailing and on the following day the anchors were weighed and the vessels got under way having arrived off cape quod our commodore stops a moment to describe it its figure he says is very singular consisting of craggy rocks the most elevated of which bear a strong resemblance to the ruins of ancient buildings from bay galant to this cape the verdant appearance of the trees takes off in some degree that horror which would otherwise arise in the mind from the constant sight of the summits of mountains which are always frozen after passing cape quod the face of the country is totally changed both sides of the straight exhibiting a prospect of rocks which are uncovered even with the slightest layer of earth the tops of these rocks are clothed with eternal snow while the valleys between them are choked up with prodigious quantities of ice which have the appearance of having been congealed for a long series of years so dreadful is the appearance of this part of the straight that sir john narborough gave it the name of desolation of the south and in fact it is desolate and dreary beyond all description  when mons bougainvilles ship was opposite cape quod the coast of terra del fuego distant upwards of forty miles appeared as if terminated by a projecting cape there are three capes on the continent which our adventurers called etoile cape boudeuse cape and split cape cape fendu in the original  the last of which is so denominated from its figure the straight which in this part is about six miles wide received the name of long reach longue rue   as the evening of the   th was very fine mons bougainville determined to continue his way under an easy sail but about two hours before midnight a thick fog came on the wind arose and the rain poured down in torrents while it became so excessive dark that no land could be seen the situation of the ships was now supposed to be opposite cape monday and the night was spent in standing off and on shore in momentary expectation of some fatal accident  the land being seen at daybreak they hoisted additional sails and proceeded with rapidity till they reached cape pillar when they had sight of the main ocean into which they arrived under a full sail on the evening of the same day having by the advantage of thirty six hours fair wind sailed from port galant into the great south sea without once coming to an anchor  mons bougainville was seven weeks and three days in passing the streights of magellan the whole length of which from cape virgin mary to cape pillar he computes at about three hundred and forty miles  though the passing the streights is a work of some difficulty and danger our author recommends it as more safe than the doubling of cape horn if undertaken between the months of september and april but during the rest of the year he advises the passing through the open sea and he observes that the lost time in sailing through the magellanic streights is amply repaid by the conveniences of taking in wood and water and the chance there is of the scurvy making less havoc among a crew when they have repeated opportunities of landing he adds that when he left the streights he had not a single invalid on board either of his vessels  mons bougainville now proceeds to a recital of the several circumstances which arose and the adventures he met with from this period till his return to europe in which we shall trace him with the utmost fidelity of the historian presuming to differ from him whenever he appears to be mistaken as a writer or to act on wrong principles as a man  our commodore now sailed nearly a westerly course having previously agreed with the captain of the etoile that he should keep company with the boudeuse during the nights and in the morning of each day should sail as far as he could to the southward without losing sight of the other vessel in order that the ships might command as extensive a prospect as possible by which means it was hoped that some new discoveries might be made  on the  0th of january while the sea ran very high one of the crew of the boudeuse fell overboard and was drowned notwithstanding every endeavor to preserve his life  from this time till the   th of february mons bougainville sailed in search of what is called daviss land which was discovered by our countryman of that name in the year      and he says that if he had followed the directions laid down in mons de bellins chart he must have sailed over this land  on the   th seagulls were seen and as these birds do not go above eighty leagues from land it was resolved not to alter the course of the ships for three days but within this period no land was discovered  the westerly wind with a slight variation to the north and south prevailed from the   d of february to the  d of march during which time they had rain and thunder every day immediately before or soon after the sun had reached the meridian this variation of the wind from what is commonly called the tradewind is mentioned by mons bougainville as an extraordinary circumstance  soon after the ships had got clear of the streights of magellan an epidemical sore throat attacked almost every man on board which was cured by putting vinegar and red hot bullets into the water casks so that by the end of march the whole crew were recovered for several days after this period such a quantity of bonitos and other fish was catched as afforded one meal daily to every man on board  on the   st a tunny fish was taken in the belly of which were a number of small fish of such kinds as are known not to swim far out to sea whence it was concluded that land could not be at any great distance and on the following day this conjecture appeared to be well founded for four very small islands were then discovered to which mons bougainville gave the name of les quatre facardins but as these were too much to the windward of the ships they held on their way steering for another island which was almost right ahead  as the vessels advanced toward this latter island it was observed that it abounded with cocoanut trees the fruit of which had a very tempting appearance these trees grew on plats of grass strewed with an abundance of beautiful flowers and the rest of the island was clothed with trees of various kinds immense numbers of birds were seen on the coast which was therefore supposed to afford a plenty of fish but the sea running high and no harbor being discovered in which our voyagers might hope for protection from the fury of its waves they were prevented from landing when they had coasted the island for about two miles they had sight of three men who advanced hastily toward the shore  mons bougainville at first imagined that these people were part of the crew of some european ship which had been wrecked on the coast and impressed with this idea he gave the necessary orders for affording them the wished for relief but he soon discovered that his conjecture was illfounded for the people retired to the woods from whence in a short time issued a number of them supposed to be near twenty with long slaves in their hands which they held up with an air of threatening and defiance this being done they retreated to the woods in which by the help of glasses their habitations were plainly seen these islanders were of a copper complexion and very tall  mons bougainville makes it a matter of wonder by what means these people were conveyed to this solitary island and how they are disposed of when their increasing numbers render their support impossible on a spot the circumference of which he apprehends does not exceed nine miles  but our philosopher seems to forget that he has but just left four other small islands nor did he recollect when he wrote his volume that he was in a subsequent page to tell us that he had soon afterward discovered a larger island the inhabitants of which for any thing he could tell might have intercourse with those on the beforementioned island he seems equally ignorant whether the people of these islands are or are not possessed of vessels proper for conveying them from one to the other and he has forgot likewise which appears to be the greatest blunder of all that there may probably be in this neighborhood some large continent hitherto unknown to all our european navigators it is possible our remarks may be as absurd as mons bougainvilles appear to be but they seem to arise naturally from the subject be this as it may our commodore named the abovementioned place the isle of lancebearers from the staves or lances which the inhabitants brandished  during the night between the   d and   d they had much rain accompanied with violent thunder while the wind blew almost a tempest at the dawn of the morning land was discovered which appeared to be a regular level sufficiently clothed with verdure breakers being observed on the coast the ships stood out to sea till the weather becoming more calm they might approach the shore with greater safety which happening before noon they then coasted the island which is shaped like a horseshoe and its inside is filled by the sea  some parts of this island produce cocoanut and other trees which afford a very agreeable shade but the greater part of it is only a sand on which grows no kind of verdure a number of indians were observed in boats some of them rowing and others sailing on the lake formed by the shape of the island these people were all naked and in the evening large numbers of them were seen on the seashore with pikes in their hands like those with which the inhabitants of the isle of lancebearers were armed  night advanced before any proper place was found for the ships boats to land nor were they more successful in their researches in the morning wherefore they held on their course mons bougainville having called the place harp island the inhabitants of which had the appearance of being tall and genteelly made  our flippant frenchman professes to admire the courage of these islanders if they live unconcerned on these little slips of sand which are every moment liable to be sunk in the abyss of an enormous ocean he might as well admire the courage of the inhabitants of france the redoubted vassals of louis le grand who are not less liable to fall victims to a convulsion of nature nor under the more immediate protection of the almighty than these harmless tenants of a solitary island happily cut off as they are from an intercourse with the more plished barbarians of europe  in the evening of the day on which harp island was discovered they had sight of other land at the distance of something more than twenty miles which had the appearance of being what it afterward was found to be a cluster of islands eleven of which were seen and received the name of the dangerous archipelago our author conjectures that they are more numerous and observes that it is dangerous sailing among them as they are encompassed with shoals and breakers through which a vessel ought to steer with peculiar care  the ships now stood to the south and by the   th of the month were out of sight of all land the cluster of islands abovementioned were first discovered by quiros in the year   0  and were again visited by roggewein in the year      who gave them the name of the labyrinth  nothing material happened from this time till toward the end of march when the weather was boisterous and stormy to a very great degree for several days successively and the scurvy now began to attack several of the crew to combat the ill effects of this disorder every invalid received daily a pint of lemonade in which was infused a powder which had been frequently used with success during the voyage about this time they were much in want of fresh water which was procured by the distillation of seawater according to a process invented by mons poissonier and the water thus procured was used in boiling meat and making broth the bread was kneaded with salt water  a steep mountain which appeared to be encompassed by the sea was discovered on the second of april and received the name of the boudoir or boudeuse peak from that of mons bougainvilles ship  bearing to the northward of this peak they had sight of land which extended farther than the eye could reach  by this time it was become highly necessary for the ships to put in at some port where they might obtain refreshments and take in a supply of wood for the greater part of this day the weather was wholly calm but in the evening a breeze sprung up which conveyed the ships near the newlydiscovered land but it was thought prudent to stand off and on for the night  in the morning they had sight of more land to the northward but were not able to distinguish whether it was another island or a part of that which they had before seen  in the night between the  d and  th of the month fires were observed on several places from whence it was conjectured that the country abounded with inhabitants just before sunrising on the  th it was discovered that the two lands which had been supposed to be separate islands were connected by a flat country bending like a bow and forming a fine bay while the ships were standing in toward the land a boat was seen coming from the offing which soon afterward crossed a head of the ship and joined a number of other boats which had assembled from various parts of the island this assemblage of boats was preceded by one which was rowed by twelve indians quite naked who advanced toward the side of the ship and held up some boughs of the banana tree considering this as a token of friendship our adventurers in their turn endeavored to express a reciprocal regard  this being done the natives rowed alongside the boudeuse and a rope being lowered into the boat one of them affixed to his branch of the banana tree a quantity of the fruit of that tree and a small pig this present was accepted and in return for it mons bougainville gave them some handkerchiefs and caps and thus was a friendly intercourse established with these people  in a short time upwards of a hundred boats surrounded the french ships which were laden with bananas cocoanuts and various other kinds of fruit highly acceptable to the french who gave in exchange for them a number of toys which proved equally acceptable to the indians  in order to carry on this traffic our voyagers held up such articles as they meant to give for the fruit and when the natives were satisfied with the quantity which was offered it was let down by the ships side in a net or basket and the indians having taken it out returned their commodities by the same conveyance but sometimes the basket was lowered when empty and the natives put their effects in it before they had received the european goods without seeming to harbor the least distrust or jealousy of those with whom they dealt thereby giving the best proof of the integrity of their own hearts  when the evening advanced the ships stood out farther from the coast and the natives rowed back to the shore during the night a number of fires were seen on the island at small and nearly equal distances from each other which the french imagining to be illuminations in honor of themselves a number of skyrockets were fired from both the ships to return the compliment  on the morning of the fifth the boats were sent in search of an anchoringplace while the day was spent in plying to windward of the island  the description which mons bougainville gives of the appearance of this place as seen from the ships is very beautiful the mountains though of great height are every where clothed with the finest verdure even to the extreme point of their most lofty summits one peak in particular runs up to a most enormous height tapering gradually as it rises yet is it every where clothed with the most beautiful foliage forming the appearance of a pyramid adorned with garlands and carved by the hand of an ingenious sculptor the lower lands consist of an intermixture of woods and meadows while the coast is a level ground sheltered by the mountains and abounding in cocoa nut and other trees beneath the agreeable shade of which are situated the houses of the inhabitants  as mons bougainville coasted the island he was charmed with the appearance of a noble cascade which falling immediately from the summit of a mountain into the sea produced a most elegant effect on the shore very near to the fall of this cascade was a little town and the coast appeared to be free from breakers it was the wish of our adventurers to have cast their anchors within view of such an enchanting prospect but after repeated soundings they found that the bottom consisted only of rocks and they were therefore under a necessity of seeking another anchoringplace  soon after the dawn of day the natives rowed alongside the ships bringing with them fowls pigeons cloth shells chissels and other things which they bartered for earrings and pieces of iron both parties dealt with the same ease and mutual confidence as they had done on the preceding day and among the number of visitors were several women whose clothes barely sufficed to hide those charms which could not fail of attracting the ravished eyes of the seamen one of the indians slept all night on board the etoile and seemed not to entertain a shadow of fear  the ships plied to windward during the night and by the morning of the  th they had nearly reached its most northern extremity when they discovered another island but as the passage between the two islands appeared to be rendered dangerous by a number of breakers mons bougainville came to a resolution of returning to the bay which they had seen when they first discovered land where he hoped to find a convenient anchoringplace and where after different soundings the ships were at length safely moored  the natives now put off in their boats and surrounded the ships in greater numbers than they had yet done exhibiting many tokens of regard and perpetually crying out taio which was afterward found to signify friend the strangers were much pleased with some nails and toys which the officers and sailors gave them these boats were crowded with women whose beauty of face was at least equal to that of the ladies of europe and their symmetry of body much superior almost all of them were naked the old men and women having taken previous care to divest them of those coverings which might otherwise have prevented their charms from taking the wished effect  these lovely lasses eyed the sailors with looks the most emphatically expressive yet with a degree of timidity which is at once the characteristic and the ornament of the sex it was not however necessary that these females should give any very plain indications of their meaning  the indian men saved them this trouble intimating that the favors of the ladies might be purchased on easy terms they even urged many of the seamen respectively to make choice of a dulcinea with whom he would choose to retire to the shore and their gestures appeared not less extravagant than those of the same people as recited by dr hawkesworth in his account of captain cooks voyage of which circumstance the readers of these volumes is already apprised  but mons bougainville goes beyond the doctor in the coloring of this scene he says that even in those countries where the ease of the golden age is still in use women seem least to desire what they most with for  be this as it may the sight of these enchanting damsels operated very powerfully on the passions of the seamen and thus situated it was no easy matter to keep to their duty four hundred young fellows who had not seen a woman for half a year before  mons bougainville and his officers did all in their power to preserve order and decorum and to prevent any of these tempting creatures from coming into the ship but their efforts were unsuccessful  one of them notwithstanding every precaution got on board and took her seat on the quarter deck near a hatchway which was open to give air to some of the crew who were heaving the capstern she had scarcely seated herself when she let fall a cloth that covered her with an air of negligence and appeared at once the cyprian goddess to the ravished eyes of the spectators both seamen and marines now eagerly crowded to the hatchway and the capstern was heaved with a cheerfulness and expedition never known on any former occasion  after some time the officers succeeded in bringing the crew into some kind of order though as mons bougainville confesses they found it equally difficult to restrain the ardor of their own passions  the commodores cook having eluded the vigilance of the officers got from the ship and having selected a mistress from one of the boats went on shore with her where he had no sooner arrived than the natives crowded about him and pulled off all his clothes they now examined with curious attention every part of his body while he stood trembling under their hands in continual apprehension of being murdered or otherwise abused but his fears were illfounded for they had no sooner finished the examination than they gave him back his clothes put into his pockets several things which they had taken out of them and then introduced his girl to him urging that he would gratify those passions which had impelled him to come on shore but alas their persuasions their warmest entreaties were thrown away  his fears had destroyed all ideas of love nor could even the enchanting beauty of his mistress recall them the natives were obliged to take him back to the ship where he told mons bougainville that he had nothing to fear from his anger for he had lately suffered such exquisite misery that all other punishment would be comparatively light  mons bougainville and some of his officers now went on shore to take a view of the wateringplace and were no sooner landed than the natives flocked around them in prodigious numbers regarding them with looks of inexpressible curiosity some of them bolder than the rest came and touched the french and put aside their clothes to find if they were formed like themselves the happy islanders who wore no kind of arms testified great pleasure at this visit of our voyagers  a person who appeared to be the principal man among the indians took mons bougainvilles party to his house where they found an old man the father of the chief and several women these last paid their compliments to the strangers by placing their hands on their breasts and frequently repeating the word tayo the old man was a truly venerable figure whose long white beard and hair added dignity to his person which was exceedingly graceful and well formed he had none of the decrepitude of age no wrinkles on his face and his body was nervous and fleshy  the behavior of this man was wholly different from that of all the rest of his countrymen for he expressed no sign of admiration or curiosity left the room without returning the compliments of his visitors and with an air that testified his uneasiness at their arrival mons bougainville even imagines that he feared that a new race of men coming to settle on the island might disturb that happy repose in which its inhabitants had hitherto lived  the house of the chief was about twenty feet in width and eighty in length and covered with thatch from which hung a cylinder above a yard long formed of the twigs of the ozier and adorned with black feathers two wooden figures were observed which mons bougainville says were idols and that one of them was the god of the natives but in this he must be certainly mistaken as it appears from the account since published that the inhabitants of otaheite are not idolaters  but from almost every part of his volume it is evident that he has made his observations very hastily and given a decisive opinion on subjects which he did not understand and which he took very little pains to examine  the figure which our author took for the god was fixed upright against one of the pillars of the house and over against it stood the other which he calls the goddess leaning against and fastened to the reeds which form the walls of the house these figures stood on pedestals of hard black wood about two yards high one yard in circumference shaped like a tower hollowed out and carved  the chief having directed his guests to seat themselves on a grassplat in the front of his house he presented them with a collation consisting of broiled fish water and fruit while they were regaling themselves he produced two collars formed of oziers and adorned with sharks teeth and black feathers these collars which resembled the prodigious large ruffs worn by the french in the reign of francis the first were put on the necks of mons bougainville and a gentleman of his party the chief having likewise presented our author with some pieces of cloth the french were about to take their leave of this hospitable indian when one of them found that his pocket had been picked of his pistol on which a complaint was made to the chief who immediately reprimanded several of his household and would have searched them all but this the commodore would not permit contenting himself with intimating to the chief that the weapon which had been stolen would kill the thief  mons bougainville was attended to the coast by the chief and his whole family as the company passed along they observed an indian remarkable for the fine proportion and symmetry of his figure reclined at the foot of a tree who prevailed on the french to sit down by him and sung them an excellent song to the slow music of a flute which the other indian blew with his nose our author says this song was doubtless of the anacreontic kind but he assigns no reason for this opinion this is described as a most delightful scene and well worthy the pencil of the limner  the company now proceeded to their boats in which a few of the indians embarked and went to spend the evening and sleep on board the islanders seemed to be under no kind of restraint but to have the fullest confidence in the hospitality of the french who treated them in a very elegant manner and concluded the evening with a band of music and a display of fireworks at which however the indians seemed more terrified than delighted  the chief went on board mons bougainvilles ship the following day and took with him a present of some fowls and a hog he likewise gave a full proof of the integrity of his heart by returning the stolen pistol but this is no wonder it may hold as an almost unfailing maxim that the generous are always just that the knavishpart of mankind are to be found among the sordid and avaricious the generous soul disdains every act of meanness and it is certainly an act of meanness to detain the property of another doubtless the history of mankind will afford some instances which militate very strongly against this argument but it will usually be found that when the man of liberal sentiments has detained what he knew to be the property of another such detension has arisen from the extreme penury of his own circumstances  we have instances of robberies being committed on the highway and the money returned years after the perpetration of the fact in such a case surely the robber must be allowed to have possessed an honest heart even while he was violating the laws of his country that his principles were just and generous and that what he conceived to be a case of extreme necessity the support of his sinking credit and the preserving a beloved an amiable woman and the dear pledges of her love from inevitable poverty and ruin was the occasion of his taking so unwarrantable a step the reader will excuse this digression in favor to the writer who conceived that it arose naturally from the subject  the name of the chief whose conduct gave rise to the above reflections was ereti who remained on board several hours and then went on shore with mons bougainville who by this time had made the necessary preparations for landing the sick and filling the watercasks  as soon as the boats had landed the commodore fixed on a spot on the borders of a rivulet where he gave orders for the forming of a camp for the protection as well of the sick men and their attendants as of the waterers and others whose business might call them on shore  for some time ereti beheld the marines under arms and regarded the preparations which were making to form the camp without any apparent signs of uneasiness and then took his leave in a few hours however he returned bringing with him his father and some others of the most eminent men on that part of the island who remonstrated with mons bougainville on the impropriety and injustice of his taking possession of their country at the same time intimating that his people were welcome to be on the island during the day for any period of time he might think proper but insisting that the party should return on board every night the commodore on the contrary as peremptorily insisted that he would form the encampment and endeavored to convince the indians how necessary it was that he should do so in order to procure wood and water and to have the better opportunity of trafficking with the islanders  the indians now retired and held a conference on the occasion at the close of which ereti came to mons bougainville and desired to know whether the french proposed to take up their residence on the island for life and if not how long they intended to stay  in answer to this the commodore put eighteen small stones into his hands intimating that he should remain there only so manys days hereupon a third council was held the result of which was that an elderly man of great authority was deputed to wait on the commodore and endeavor to prevail on him to depart in nine days which however he positively refused to do and thus the matter ended  from this period the islanders became again easy and happy ereti complimented mons bougainville with the use of a large building that had been erected on the side of the rivulet for the purpose of laying up the indian boats which were instantly removed at the command of the chief under this building tents were put up for the accommodation of the sick and other tents for various uses a sufficient number of muskets were carried on shore to arm thirty marines all the workmen and even the invalids in case of necessity  mons bougainville passed the first night on shore in company with ereti who added his supper to that of the commodore invited a few select friends to partake of the repast and gave orders that a crowd of indians whose curiosity had brought them to the spot should be dispersed he then desired to see some fireworks which he beheld with a mixture of pleasure and astonishment late in the evening he sent for one of his wives who slept in the tent allotted to the use of the prince of nassau mons bougainville says that this woman was ugly and old but how does he know that she was not the only wife of ereti it does not follow because a number of women were seen on the first visit at the house of this chief that he was married to them all they might be daughters sisters aunts nieces or cousins for any thing that could be known to the contrary by people who had not learnt three words of the language of the natives  the camp was completed on the following day and the building entirely enclosed except at one entrance where a guard was constantly stationed none of the indians were admitted into this building but ereti and his friends of both sexes a crowd of people were constantly about the place but they made way for any one who had permission to enter on the motion of a small stick which a frenchman held in his hand to this place the natives assembled from all quarters bringing poultry hogs fish fruit and cloth in exchange for which they received buttons beads tools nails and trinkets of various kinds on which they appeared to set a high value  these benevolent islanders vied with each other which should oblige their visitors most and when the french were observed collecting shells and gathering plants a number of women and children instantly employed themselves in the same manner bringing the same plants in great abundance and variety of fine shells  mons bougainville now applied to ereti for information where he might cut wood and was directed to the mountains where the hard wood grows the low lands producing only a gumtree and fruit trees of various kinds the chief even marked the trees which were proper for cutting and pointed out the side on which they should be felled  the islanders assisted our adventurers in cutting the wood and carrying it down to the boats and likewise helped them to fill water and roll the casks to the coast for these services they received a number of nails proportioned to the industry they had exerted but it was necessary for the french to be constantly on their guard to prevent their thieving the articles which were brought on shore nor were even their pockets safe from the depredations of these people who mons bougainville says are as ingenious in the art as the pickpockets of europe which is certainly no great compliment to the people of otaheite  mons bougainville supposes that these islanders do not rob each other as none of their effects were kept under locks and keys and he attributes their frequent attempts to rob the french to an insatiable curiosity for articles which they had never before seen guards were stationed and patroles appointed to protect the french property notwithstanding which the islanders found means to steal several things and they even pelted the guards with stones these freebooters hid themselves in a marsh behind the camp which was overgrown with reeds but a part of this marsh was cleared by order of the commodore who directed that when any more thieves were seen they should be fired at ereti even hinted that this measure was necessary but pointing to his own house seemed very solicitous that mons bougainville would not fire that way orders were now given for some of the ships boats to anchor before the camp and point their swivel guns so as to protect it  the article of thieving excepted every other intercourse between the french and indians was carried on in the most harmonious manner the seamen made several incursions into the island unarmed sometimes in small parties and sometimes singly when the natives invited them into their houses gave them provisions and presented the young damsels to their embraces on these occasions the hut was instantly crowded with numbers of both sexes who surrounded the young lovers and eyed them with looks of the most intense curiosity leaves and flowers were immediately strewed on the ground and while some played on flutes others sang a kind of song sacred to the cyprian goddess  mons bougainvilles picture of these scenes is rather overcharged but the pen of the historian should be guided by truth here venus says he is the goddess of hospitality her worship does not admit of any mysteries and every tribute paid to her is a feast for the whole nation  the people of otaheite seemed astonished at the embarrassment of some of the frenchmen on these occasions but mons bougainville is of opinion that there was not a man of the whole crew who had not got the better of the european delicacy by making a public sacrifice at the altar of venus if this opinion be well founded the poor cook whose case has been related must have wonderfully recovered of his fright before the commodore left the island  surely these intrepid subjects of louis the fifteenth must have been blessed with the most vigorous constitutions in the universe or have been cursed with the most unblushing impudence of face that many of the crew should have got the better of all regard for decency is not to be wondered at but that there should not be one frenchman out of four hundred who could resist the temptation of thus publicly prostituting himself is very astonishing but vanity is constitutional in a parisian and rather than not sacrifice at her shrine he will be content to rob himself of his own good name  it may fairly be concluded that if every man gave these public proofs of his prowess the commodore himself made one of the number a naked spectacle to the laughing indians but perhaps mons bougainville was honored in the embraces of one of eretis wives in which case it is presumed that the fond couple were surrounded only by the royal family and the lords and ladies of the court doubtless an extraordinary band of music must have been provided on these solemn occasions and the best nosefluteplayers on the island must have been engaged as performers what pity it is that our gallant philosophical nautical warlike amoroso has omitted a description of one of these charming scenes a print of it too would have done honor to some ingenious engraver of paris and it would doubtless have promoted the sale of a work so admirably calculated for the meridian of versailles the doting monarch would have subscribed liberally while the lascivious bar would have extolled to the very skies the writers happy talent at description who knows too but that the french ambassador might have introduced the work among the circle at st jamess and thus have promoted the cause of libertinism so far that not one of the nobility of the succeeding generation should be the real child of his reputed father  to be serious this is strange stuff even for a french historian to write nor would we have copied it but that our engagements to the public compelled us to give mons bougainvilles voyage and mons bougainville must be answerable for all its faults  happy ought englishmen to think themselves particularly those of the middling and lower classes among whom marriage is still held in some sort of esteem long may it be so held for the honor of legal love the security of property and the sake of those tender ties by which relations are held in the bond of friendship  hail wedded love mysterious law true source of human offspring sole propriety in paradise of all things common else by thee adultrous lust was driven from men among the bestial herds to range by thee founded in reason loyal just and pure relations dear and all the charities of father son and brother first were known milton mons bougainville now proceeds to a description of the beauties of the interior parts of the island he has often walked out with only a few attendants and arrived at places enchanting beyond the power of pen or pencil to paint trees abounding with fruit of the most delicious kinds were frequently found on meadows intersected by rivulets which gave an agreeable coolness to the air on these enchanting spots numbers of the natives revel in the profusive gifts of nature unincumbered with the cares of the busy world our author met with many little societies reposing at their ease under the shade of trees who welcomed the strangers in the most friendly manner those he saw on his way made room for his passage with a degree of civility that would have done honor to the most polished european and in every place he found evident marks of the content and happiness of the people while he was treated with the utmost hospitality  mons bougainville gave ereti some ducks and geese and a couple of turkies that he might raise a breed of those birds he likewise presented him with some garden seeds and advised him to cultivate some ground in the european manner and a spot being fixed on by the french it was enclosed and several of the crew employed in digging it the natives were much pleased with the implements of gardening and happy in having wheat barley oats rice etc put into the ground as were likewise onions and a variety of pot herbs the commodore is of opinion that his generosity in this particular will not be thrown away as the people of otaheite seem to have a taste for agriculture and he thinks they might soon be brought to cultivate in a proper manner the finest soil in the world they have indeed a sort of kitchen gardens near their huts which produce yams potatoes and other edible roots  soon after the camp was formed the commodore was visited on board the ship by toutaa the chief of a district near that of ereti who was a very tall man and most admirably well made he was attended by several gentlemen hardly one of whom was less than six feet in height toutaa brought with him cloth hogs fowls and fruit which he presented to mons bougainville who complimented him with some silk stuffs trinkets nails etc  toutaa invited mons bougainville to his house where in the midst of a large assembly he presented him with a fine young girl whom the commodore conjectures to have been one of his wives and the musicians instantly began the bridal hymn  but our author does not say what farther passed on the occasion  one of the indians happening to be killed his countrymen complained to mons bougainville of this violation of the rights of hospitality the dead body being conveyed to one of the huts some persons were sent to examine it when it appeared that he had fell by a gunshot wound on which all possible enquiry was made after the offender but he could not be discovered and how he came to be shot remained a mystery for mons bougainville says that none of the crew had that day left the ship with firearms nor had any of those on shore been permitted to leave the camp it was evident however that the natives in general conceived their countryman to have been the aggressor for their dealings with the europeans were not intermitted but some few of them moved off their furniture to the mountains and even the house of ereti was stripped but a few presents from the commodore regained his friendship and esteem  early in the morning of the   th the cable of the boudeuse parting that ship ran foul of the etoile but the vessels were happily got clear of each other before any damage had been sustained a boat was now sent to sound for some convenient passage as the ships were in evident danger of being driven on shore and at this unfortunate juncture news arrived that three of the indians had been either murdered or wounded in their huts and that in consequence of this unhappy circumstance a general terror had seized the inhabitants the women children and old men had fled up the country taking their effects with them and even carrying off the bodies of the deceased the commodore on receiving this intelligence went on shore and selecting four marines on whom rested the suspicion of having perpetrated this foul deed he ordered them to be put into irons in the presence of ereti a circumstance that reconciliated the affection of the indians  mons bougainville apprehensive that the natives might revenge the injury they had sustained in the persons of their countrymen spent a considerable part of the night at the camp and gave orders for a reinforcement of the guards it is true that the situation of the french was every way so advantageous that in all probability they might have been an overmatch for the united forces of the natives the night however was spent in perfect repose except some slight alarms occasioned by thieving interlopers  the commodores concern arose more from the apprehended loss of his ships than from any hostile efforts that might be made by the indians after ten at night the wind blew violently the sea swelled to an enormous height the rain descended in torrents and the whole scene was tempestuous in a high degree  mons bougainville went on board soon after midnight when a violent squall of wind was driving the ships toward the shore providentially the storm was soon over and a breeze from the shore prevented the vessels being stranded  about daybreak another cable and the hawser of the boudeuse parted when she was almost close on the shore on which the surges beat with unremitting fury at this time too as an aggravation of their misfortunes the buoys of the anchors were missing but it is doubtful whether the natives had stolen them or whether they had sunk  some little time before noon another cable parted and the boudeuse drove toward the shore they now let go their sheet anchor but it could be of no service to them as they were so near the breakers that the ship must have stranded before a sufficient length of cable could have been veered out to have given the anchor time to reach the bottom thus situated within a moment of despair a wind off shore operated in their favor yet this wind soon changed though not till it had enabled them to get at a distance from the shore by the help of a hawser from a streamanchor of the etoile which ship happening to be anchored in firmer ground than the boudeuse was under providence the great means of saving that vessel and her crew from destruction on occasion of this singular escape mons bougainville pays a grateful compliment to mons de la giraudais the commander of the etoile to whose friendship and abilities he deems himself greatly indebted for the preservation of the boudeuse  soon after daylight it was observed that the camp was totally destitute of its usual visitors not an indian was to be seen near it nor even a single boat sailing on the river the natives had quitted their houses and the whole country appeared to be depopulated the prince of nassau now went on shore with a small party and at about three miles from the camp found ereti with a considerable number of his subjects when the chief recollected the prince he advanced toward him with a mixed countenance expressive of hope and terror  many women were now with ereti who dropping on their knees at the feet of the prince kissed his hands and bathed in tears exclaimed tayo mate  you are our friends and you kill us   the prince succeeded in his endeavors to inspire them with fresh confidence and mons bougainville had the pleasure of observing from on board by the help of his glasses that the natives hastened to the camp carrying with them fowls fruits etc so that there could be no doubt but that peace was reestablished  the commodore instantly left the ship and taking with him a quantity of silk stuffs and a variety of other articles he presented them to the principal persons intimating how unhappy he was on account of the misfortune which had happened and assuring them that the perpetrators of so foul a deed should not escape unpunished  the grateful indians caressed the commander the natives in general were happy that peace was restored and the market soon became more crowded than ever so that in two days only more refreshments were brought in than had been before and the whole place had the appearance of a fair the indians now requested to see some muskets fired but were not a little alarmed when they found that the animals fired at were instantly killed  the boat which the commodore had sent to sound having found an excellent passage to the northward the etoile sailed on the   th and being got safe without the reef her commander sent the boat to the boudeuse in which was an officer who having surveyed the passage and conducted the etoile to a place of safety returned to take the same care of mons bougainvilles ship  the crew of the boudeuse now labored incessantly in completing her stock of water and in bringing her effects on board the commodore took possession of the island for his sovereign by an inscription carved on an oak plank and burying in a bottle near the building they had occupied a writing containing the names of the several officers concerned in this expedition and this method he followed invariably at all the places he discovered in the course of his voyage  the boudeuse set sail early in the morning of the   th and the commodore congratulated himself on having got clear of the reefs when the wind suddenly dying away the tide and a swelling sea drove the ship violently toward the rocks on which she must have been instantly dashed in pieces and every man on board have perished except the few who could swim remarkably well at this moment when she was ready to strike on the rocks providentially a western breeze sprang up and in about two hours conveyed our voyagers clear of all those dangers they had dreaded  mons bougainville joined the etoile before the evening and a strong gale springing up about midnight they set all their sails and soon got perfectly clear of the coast  our author now describes in very affecting terms what passed at his taking leave of the people of otaheite and we shall endeavor not to fall short of the original in the tenderness of the description convinced that the english language is at least as well adapted for the pathetic as the french or any other european tongue  soon after the dawn of the morning when the indians observed that their visitors were making preparations for their departure ereti came hastily on board in the first boat that was ready he now clasped in his arms embraced and wept over those newmade acquaintance whom he was about to part with for ever  this scene was scarcely ended when a larger boat in which were the wives of this generous chief came alongside the ship laden with a variety of refreshments  this vessel likewise brought off the indian who on their first arrival had slept on board the etoile this man was called aotourou ereti presented him to mons bougainville intimating his determined resolution to sail with the strangers and entreating permission that he might do so this request being complied with ereti presented him to the officers respectively saying that he trusted a wellbeloved friend to the care and protection of friends equally beloved  ereti having accepted some presents returned to the boat in which were a number of weeping beauties made still more lovely by their tears  with him went aotourou to take a melancholy leave of a lovely damsel the dear object of his regard he took three pearls from his ears which he delivered as a lovetoken to the desponding beauty embraced her affectionately tore himself from her arms and left it to time and tears to restore her serenity of mind  who that reads this narrative can suppose that an indian has less dignity of soul than an european  mons bougainville now proceeds to a description of the island of otaheite with an account of the manners and characters of its inhabitants and in this part of his history we shall trace him with the pen of accuracy  there is a fine bay about ten miles in depth between a cape which advances to the north and the southeast point of the island toward the bottom of this bay the coast is almost level and this part appears to be the best peopled as well as the most agreeable part of the country in a passage between the two most northerly islands there is good anchorage for thirty vessels the rest of the coast is mountainous land and in most places is encompassed by reefs of rocks some of which are almost covered by the sea while others are left sufficiently destitute of water to be considered as islands on these the natives kindle fires every night that the crews of their boats may fish in safety between these rocks are spaces through which a ship may enter but will find it difficult to get anchorage  the mountains at a distance from the coast are much higher than it is usual for hills to be in countries of no greater extent these being covered with verdure and fruits of various beautiful and delicious kinds afford the richest prospect that the imagination can form an idea of springs issuing from the mountains form themselves into rivulets which meandring through the country serve at once to fertilize and adorn it  on the level parts of the island the houses are erected under the shade of fruit trees not in regular towns or villages but separately and where the fancy of the owner shall fix the spot public walks kept in the neatest order lead from one residence to another throughout the island so that the whole appears one scene of enchanted ground  the principal fruits of the island are plantains cocoanuts yams curassol okras and the breadfruit indico and sugarcanes grow wild and two substances proper for dying one red and the other yellow was found among the natives but mons bougainville could not learn from what vegetable they were produced  while aotourou was on board the boudeuse it appeared that he was acquainted with many of the plants and fruits in the possession of the french which he called by their indian names indeed the same productions are common to most countries within the tropics  the natives use the cedarwood which grows on the mountains for the construction of the largest boats and they make a sort of pikes of a very heavy black wood their smaller boats are made of the wood of the breadfruit tree which is extremely soft and full of gum  the island of otaheite produces very rich pearls which are worn by the women and children but these were secreted almost as soon as the french landed and were seen no more during their stay a sort of castanets instruments used by the indian dancers are formed out of the shells of the pearloysters  the only quadrupedes seen on the island were hogs small but handsome dogs and rats the last of which are very numerous of winged animals there are parroquets of exquisite beauty the feathers of which are red and blue most happily blended pigeons rather larger than ours of a deep blue color and most delicate taste and common domestic poultry differing in no respect from those of europe the hogs and fowls feed on plantains only so that the purity of their food must ensure the goodness of the meat  mons bougainville obtained by his traffic with the natives about   0 hogs and more than eight hundred fowls and he might have procured much larger numbers if his stay had been longer  no venomous animals were seen on this island nor any of those noxious insects which are common to and are the greatest curse of hot climates  there can remain no doubt of the salubrity of the air of otaheite for though the french labored hard all day in the heat of the sun and were frequently in the water and slept all night in the open air on the bare ground not a single person contracted any disorder while those who were landed for the cure of the scurvy recovered very fast and many of them acquired so much strength that their cure was perfected on board the ships  our author mentions as an undoubted proof of the healthiness of the climate the strength of its inhabitants who grow to an extreme old age without feeling any of its inconveniences though they sleep only on a few leaves strewed on the ground in huts ill adapted to defend them from the inclemencies of the weather  the chief articles of food among the natives are fish and vegetables flesh is seldom eaten even by grown persons and by the young women and children never their drink is pure water and from this temperance doubtless arises in a great measure that freedom from disease which is one of their greatest blessings these people were averse to the taste and smell of every thing strong particularly tobacco spices brandy and wine  the natives of otaheite are of two distinct tribes having no personal resemblance yet practicing the same customs associating together in the most friendly manner and conversing in the same dialect the first race of these people are much taller larger and better proportioned than the other few of these are less than six feet high and so extremely well made that as our author says in order to paint a hercules or a mars one could no where find such beautiful models their features are perfectly like those of the inhabitants of europe their hair is black and their skins rather brown but this is attributed to their being so much exposed to the sun and air mons bougainville does not say which of the european nations they resemble and therefore it must be concluded that he means the french in which case an english lady would scarcely give him credit for the extravagant encomiums which he lavishes on the beauty of the otaheiteans on the contrary she will be apt to conclude that better models for a hercules or a mars may be found between berwick upon tweed and the landsend in cornwall  the other tribe of these indians are about the middle stature have almost the features and complexion of mulattoes and rough curled hair as strong as the bristles of a hog aotourou was of this tribe and the son of one of the chiefs of the island  our author says that this indians want of personal beauty was amply recompensed by the goodness of his understanding but this assertion has been flatly contradicted by the testimony of several english gentlemen who saw aotourou during his residence at paris and who represent him as one of the most ignorant blockheads they had ever known hence it should seem that english and french ideas are extremely at variance respecting indian abilities and seize  both the tribes shave the upper part of the face permitting the beard on the chin to grow and a whisker on each lip some of them bind the hair on the top of the head while others cut it short but all of them rub the oil of the cocoanut into the hair and beard they permit all their nails to grow to a great length except that of the middle finger of the right hand among these people one cripple only was seen and it was supposed that he got his hurt by a fall the surgeon informed mons bougainville that many of the natives were marked with the small pox and he says he took every precaution that the venereal disorder should not be communicated to these happy unoffending people but it appears from captain cooks account that some ungenerous frenchman was base enough to plant this dreadful malady in a country where from mons bougainvilles own account it is more likely to spread than in any other part of the world on account of the extreme attachment of the inhabitants to the cytherean sports  aotourou is probably arrived at his native country before this time and has informed the islanders that their late visitors were frenchmen in which case the poor indians will have ample reason to call the disorder by its genuine name the french disease  the ladies and gentlemen of otaheite stain the lower parts of their backs and their thighs with a deep blue the method of doing which having been already mentioned in our account of captain cooks voyage need not be here repeated mons bougainville mentions it as a singular circumstance that the practice of painting the body has always prevailed among the people of all countries at the time when they bordered on a state of nature it is indeed a well known fact that the ancient britons were found stained with wood when julius caesar made his first descent on this island  the natives of otaheite wear pearls and flowers of different kinds in their ears they likewise make a frequent practice of bathing their bodies constantly washing themselves before they either eat or drink so that they are to be ranked among the most cleanly people in the universe  our author represents these islanders as goodnatured and benevolent in a high degree he says that though the several districts are governed each by its own chief public war or private animosity seemed to be equally unknown on the island the natives seem not to entertain even the slightest doubt of the integrity of each other and appear to enjoy in common whatever is necessary to the support of life their houses are always open night and day and whoever enters may freely eat of whatever he finds in like manner they gather fruit from every tree and all the level country being a kind of continued orchard seems to be but one common property  yet were these people with such exalted ideas of general benevolence most dextrous in stealing the property of the french the chiefs however did not encourage their inferiors in these depredations on the contrary they requested the officers to kill those who should be detected in an act of theft but they would never take this disagreeable task on themselves  when a thief was pointed out to ereti he would run after till he had overtaken him and then compelling him to restore the stolen goods he punished the offense by a number of stripes  mons bougainville says he had conceived an idea that these people had no severer punishment among them than this kind of whipping for they seemed to commiserate the fate of some of the french seamen whom they saw put in irons but our author has been since informed that they have a custom of punishing theft by hanging the felon on a tree  although the inhabitants of otaheite maintain perpetual peace among themselves yet it seldom happens but that they are engaged in war with the natives of the adjacent islands  they have large vessels called periaguas in which they descend on the enemies country and even engage in sea fights a pike and a bow with a sling are all their arms  if aotourous information is to be depended on the consequences of their battles are very fatal to the vanquished the men and boys who are made prisoners are stripped of their skins and the beards of the men are taken off and carried away in triumph as ensigns of the victory the conquerors take with them the women and girls with whom they frequently cohabit  aotourou declared himself the son of one of these unnatural alliances his mother being a native of oopoa an island not far distant from otaheite with the inhabitants of which they are frequently at war mons bougainville ascribes the difference observed between the two races of people to this intercourse with the captive women of the adjacent islands  the principal people on the island have a number of servants who submit to their orders with the most unreserved obedience and in each district the will of the chief is a law from the authority of which there is no appeal but the chief himself does not come to any resolution respecting matters of great importance till he has previously consulted with the principal inhabitants the reader will recollect that the truth of this circumstance is evinced by the repeated counsels which were held on occasion of the french having determined to take up their residence on shore  when an inhabitant of otaheite dies his body is deposited on a kind of bier placed under a shed to which the women resort daily and anoint the corpse with the oil of the cocoanut in these places they are left till all the flesh is wasted from the bones and then the skeleton is conveyed to the hut of his relations where a person who appears to have great authority attends and being dressed in a habit peculiar to the occasion he performs some solemn ceremonies but how long the skeletons are kept in the houses our author had no opportunity of knowing  mons bougainville endeavored to learn of aotourou the religious ceremonies of his countrymen and if they mutually understood each other it will appear that the people of otaheite are superstitious in a high degree that the supreme authority is vested in the priests that their principal deity is called eritera that is king of light or of the sun besides whom they acknowledge a number of inferior divinities some of whom produce evil and others good that the general name of these ministering spirits is eatoua and that the natives suppose two of these divinities attend each affair of consequence in human life determining its fate either advantageously or otherwise  to one circumstance our author speaks in decisive terms he says that when the moon exhibits a certain aspect which bears the name of malama tamai the moon in a state of war the natives offer up human sacrifices  mons bougainville mentions one circumstance as a proof that these people originated on the continent from whence their ancestors must have emigrated when any one sneezes his companions cry out evarouateatoua that is may the good genius awaken thee or may not the evil genius lull thee asleep  the principal people on the island appear to have many wives and our author thinks polygamy is common among them all the rich are chiefly distinguished from the poor by keeping a greater number of the fair sex for universal love is the characteristic of the inhabitants of otaheite both the parents seem eqally fond of nursing their infants the men employ themselves principally in war fishing and agriculture while the women have little to do but to render themselves agreeable by their assiduity to please they submit implicitly to the will of the men and the woman who should prostitute herself without the permission of her husband would atone for her infidelity with her life yet is the permission of the husband to gratify her passions in what way she please so easily obtained that these fair ones are not under the least temptation to disobedience in fact the wife generally yields her person at the solicitation of her husband jealousy therefore one would imagine must be a passion quite unknown among them  the single woman follows implicitly the dictates of her heart and yields her person at her own discretion and the more numerous the favors she has granted the better her chance of obtaining a husband the examples perpetually before her eyes the hymeneal songs of the natives their dances and their attitudes added to the seductive warmth of the climate all conspire to render that circumstance no vice at otaheite which would be deemed so in england love is at once the business and the pleasure of the natives of this island and at his shrine all its inhabitants bend with the most fervent devotion they dance to the music of a drum and sing to the flute blown with the nose they likewise divert themselves occasionally with a kind of wrestling which at once braces the nerves and relaxes the mind though in this place of all parts of the world the mind seems to require the least relaxation for almost the whole business of the islanders consists in pleasure  our author says that the inhabitants of otaheite are a witty and humorous people which he attributes to their living in ease and jollity  that ease may make a man happy we will readily allow but that it can create humor or inspire wit we must beg leave to deny  perhaps the dullest fellows this day to be found on the habitable globe are among those who are easy and independent in point of fortune and perhaps too some of the most humorous and witty may be found among those who know not where to obtain a second shilling when the present is expended this at least is the case in london it may possibly fare differently with the parisians almost all of whom being poor and merry may fancy themselves wits and humourists in a word wit and humor are not the gifts of fortune but of nature  mons bougainville charges the people of otaheite with a fickleness of disposition which was deemed astonishing every new object struck their attention but nothing engaged it for more than a few minutes to reflect was to them a work of labor and they seemed to prefer bodily to mental exercises  this with our ingenious authors permission is a proof of their good sense every man who can think at all must know that the labor of the mind exceeds that of the limbs in proportion as the soul is superior to the body for this reason we pay not an artist as we pay a porter the one will earn an hundred pounds while the other is drudging for as many shillings but the porter can drudge on for life while the artist if he acquire not sufficient to retire with decency at an early period will pine away a wretched old age in unmerited penury  the natives of otaheite are ingenious beyond description in the construction of their fishingtackle the hooks of which are of mother of pearl and wrought as nicely as if with european tools with threads drawn from the american aloe they form their nets which are made like those of france and other nations of europe their houses too are exceedingly well built and the palmleaves with which they are thatched are laid on with great skill and taste  the boats or periaguas of these people are of two kinds the former very large hollowed out of huge trees and finished with much taste parts of other trees being added as ornaments  the latter small and of much ruder construction  but these kinds of boats having been repeatedly described in this and other books of voyages it is unnecessary to say more of them  in order to convey themselves from one island to another they fix beams of wood from the starboard side of one vessel to the larboard of the other leaving an intermediate space of something more than a yard and over the stern of both the boats they erect a kind of hut lightly built and covered with reeds which serves as a repository for their provisions and a shelter against the inclemency of the weather  two boats thus lashed together never overset and are therefore much in use among the people of superior rank the sails of these vessels are nearly square and consist of mats stretched out by means of pieces of cane  the only tools in use among the natives of otaheite are pieces of shells made sharp for boring holes in wood and a chissel in the european make the blade of which is formed of a hard black stone  the natives manufacture that remarkable kind of cloth which forms their dress a shrub is cultivated near all the indian huts from the rind of which this cloth is made by beating it on a smooth board and occasionally sprinkling it with water till it is as thin as paper and something like it only much more pliable thus they make cloth of different thickness which they afterward dye but their process in the dying it mons bougainville had no opportunity of seeing  our author now employs two or three pages in defense of his conduct in bringing aotourou from his native island in answer to some illiberal reflections which had been cast on him and then he proceeds to describe some particulars of the indians behavior during his residence this account should certainly have appeared as a supplement to the volume but we take it as it stands  mons bougainville says he endeavored at a great trouble and expense to render aotourous residence at paris both improving and entertaining to him the curiosity of the public to view this stranger was insatiable and the foolish parisians were astonished to learn that there was any country on the face of the earth where neither french english nor spanish was spoken mons bougainville happily ridicules this strange kind of ignorance but he does not seem to wonder that it should prevail among those who had never been without the walls of the city which gave them birth  our author is likewise very severe on a set of critics who seemed to wonder that aotourou could live among frenchmen almost two years and yet learn only a very few words of their language to account for this mons bougainville mentions a physical obstruction in the organs of his speech his age which rather exceeded thirty years the deficiency of a memory never exercised by study and the possessing only a very limited number of ideas relative to the trifling wants of the natives of his happy island hence our author concludes that he must first of all have created a world of previous ideas in a mind as indolent as his body before he could adapt them to the french words proper to express them  though aotourou was thus deficient in the language of france yet the streets of paris were quite familiar to him he went out daily without attendants and found his way readily through the whole city he frequently bought things and was seldom defrauded in the purchase none of the public diversions had any charms for him but the opera to which he went regularly for he knew the nights on which it was to be performed and paid the same for admittance as other people his great fondness for dancing was what rendered the opera so agreeable to him  he was exceedingly grateful to those who conferred any obligations on him nor did he ever forget their persons or their favors the duchess of choiseul stood foremost in the list of his friends and he expressed more gratitude for the polite attention with which she treated him than even for the numerous presents which he received at her hands and as often as he heard of that ladys being arrived from her countryseat he would immediately go and visit her  after a residence of eleven months at paris aotourou was put on board the brisson at rochelle which ship was destined to convey him to the isle of france whither orders were sent to the governor and intendant to transport him thence to his own country mons bougainville gave about   00 l sterling toward the fitting out the brisson for this voyage and the duchess of choiseul ordered a considerable sum to be expended in cattle seeds implements of husbandry etc which were shipped for the use of the natives of otaheite mons bougainville concludes this part of his narrative with the following very humane and equally political wish o may aotourou soon see his countrymen again  our author now proceeds to inform us of several particulars with which his conversation with this adventrous islander had made him acquainted if mons bougainville be not misled in his information the state of facts will appear to be that the inhabitants of otaheite pay their devotions to the deity at the rising and setting of the sun that their supreme god is incapable of representation but that they have two classes of inferior deities who are represented by figures carved in wood exclusive of these regular devotions the natives of otaheite practice a number of superstitious ceremonies in order to avert the influence of the evil genii  while aotourou was at paris in      a comet appeared which furnished mons bougainville with an opportunity of knowing that these kind of stars had been frequently observed at otaheite but that the natives do not suppose that they are portentous of any evil consequence on the contrary what we call shooting stars are by these people deemed evil genii  how far it was possible for aotourou to explain himself to mons bougainville on astronomical subjects is left to the readers reflection  the more enlightened people of otaheite have names for the sun moon and stars by which without the assistance of the needle or compass they steer their course night and day sailing at some times not less than eight hundred miles from island to island in the daytime they are guided by the sun and by the stars in the night  mons bougainville learnt from aotourou the names of several islands in the seas near otaheite the natives of some of which were in friendship and those of others at war with his countrymen of the former are tapouamassou oumaitia aca maoroua and aimeo of the latter oopoa toumaraa otaa aiatea and papara all which are represented as about equal in extent with otaheite  there is an island called pare the inhabitants of which are alternately at war and in friendship with the natives of otaheite in these seas are likewise two small islands called toupai and enouamotou which are not inhabited but yield abundance of fruit fowls and hogs while their coasts abound with turtle and other fish but the people of otaheite conceiving these islands to be the residence of evil genii deem it a certain sign of misfortune if either curiosity or chance should lead any boat to their coasts and it is supposed that those who endeavor to land there will perish in the attempt  the most distant of all the islands abovementioned is not more than about fifteen days sail from otaheite even with the boats of that island and mons bougainville conjectures that aotourou had no idea of going farther when he embarked on board the boudeuse  if this conjecture be well founded there certainly was not so much magnanimity in this indians behavior as we have been hitherto taught to believe  but there are great inconsistencies in the writings of our voyager which the reader will pardon in favor of his vanity it is our duty to correct and amend as we proceed  mons bougainville at first imagined that the inhabitants of otaheite were nearly equal in point of rank and that their happiness was to be envied from their supposed equality but he now from the information of aotourou corrects that error and confesses that the distinction of ranks is very great and the disproportion very tyrannical  the chiefs and other men in power dispose of the lives of their dependants at their pleasure and our author thinks that they have the power of exerting this cruel prerogative over the common people who are not immediately dependant on them the vulgar are distinguished by the appellation of tata einow that is vile men and it is mentioned as an indubitable fact that those doomed for sacrifices are selected from the plebeian race the grandees only eat fish and flesh while the common people subsist entirely on pulse and fruits indeed the distinction of rank appears to be very great for persons of eminence are lighted from place to place in the night with a wood of superior quality to that which the vulgar are allowed to burn the tree called the weeping willow is planted only before the houses of the chiefs or kings and their public dinners are held beneath its shade  the servants of the great men are distinguished by a kind of sash worn round the body which is placed across the loins or higher up till it comes close under the armpits in proportion to the rank of the master  the natives of otaheite make two regular meals daily one just after noon and the other as soon as the sun is gone down the servants cook the victuals which are served up by the wives who eat after their husbands have done  when the men die the women go into mourning for them but this compliment is not returned on the part of the men the children wear mourning a long time after the death of the father and on the decease of a king the whole nation is in sables the mourning consists of a headdress of black feathers and a veil drawn over the face  aotourou informed mons bougainville that this veil was very favorable to the wishes of those women whose husbands were not so complaisant as his countrymen in general are this arises from the following circumstance when the mourners go out a number of slaves walk before them beating the castanets to a solemn melancholy tune which is considered as a notice for all persons to keep at a distance from the afflicted thus the veil over the face and the sound of an instrument from which every one flies cannot but be auspicious to the wishes of the enraptured lovers  when any person is dangerously ill all his relations repair to his house and remain there till he is either dead or out of danger each in his turn attending the sick man their method of bleeding is very singular an inferior priest called taoua is the physician who strikes the cranium with a piece of sharp wood which opens the sagittal vein and when he deems the patient to have bled sufficiently he ties on a bandage which closes the orifice the day following he washes the wound and no ill consequence ensues  mons bougainville says that the preceding account contains every thing he could learn respecting the customs of otaheite either on the island or from the information of aotourou our author remarks that some words spoken by the natives of otaheite are to be found in a vocabulary at the end of la maires voyage under the title of the vocabulary of cocos island which being mentioned as lying nearly in the same latitude with otaheite is conjectured to be one of those islands the names of which were recited by aotourou  the language of the people of otaheite is described by mons bougainville as extremely harmonious and easy of pronunciation consisting chiefly of vowels and having no aspirates he says also that it has no nasal mute or half syllables nor that quantity of consonants and articulations which render some languages so difficult hence he concludes arose the difficulty of teaching aotourou the french tongue but he thinks it would have been a work of much less labor to have taught him the italian or spanish  how far our author is right in his conjectures it would be no easy task to determine for the direct contrary of what he says of the language of these islanders has been observed by the english navigators as we have already given some vocabularies we shall at the conclusion of this narrative give that of mons bougainville that the reader may determine whether the english or the french voyagers have the best pretensions to credibility  mons bougainville informs us that a gentleman of paris distinguished by his skill in teaching the art of speech to persons born deaf and dumb repeatedly examined aotourou and found that he could not naturally pronounce any of the french nasal vowels and but very few of the consonants  our author is of opinion that the language of otaheite is sufficiently copious and he grounds this opinion on the following circumstances whenever during the voyage aotourou was struck with any new object he immediately expressed his sentiments in a kind of extempore blank verse and he also repeated daily a long prayer which he called the prayer of the kings not a dozen words of which mons bougainville understood or heard him repeat on any other occasion  aotourou informed the commodore that an english ship had arrived at otaheite about eight months before the french touched at that island this says our author was the vessel commanded by captain wallace and he ascribes the knowledge of iron which was observed among the natives to this visit of the english especially as they call it aouri which is not very unlike our word iron our frenchman likewise gives a very ungenteel hint that the poor indians were indebted to the english for the venereal disease but the contrary of this is known to be the fact  mons bougainville now proceeds to give an account of his departure from otaheite and his discovery of other islands in the southern pacific ocean on the morning of the   th of april      he discovered what he thought to be three other islands but it was afterward found to be only one the high lands of which had at a distance given it the appearance of separate islands at a considerable distance beyond this island they saw another which aotourou told them was called oumaitia that the natives of it were in alliance with the people of otaheite that there was a girl on the island to whom he had a strong attachment and that if the commodore would touch there he would meet with the same kind of necessaries and the same hospitable treatment as he had experienced among his countrymen  our circumnavigator however deaf to all these persuasive arguments held on his way and lost sight of the island the same day the succeeding night proving remarkably fair and the stars appearing with unclouded luster aotourou pointed out a constellation in the shoulder of orion and expressed a wish that the ships course might be directed by it in consequence of which they would in two days time arrive at a fine island where he had a numerous acquaintance and it was conjectured from his hints that he had also a child there as mons bougainville persisted in his resolution not to alter the ships course aotourou became very uneasy and endeavored to persuade him to steer for the desired port by assuring him that the island abounded in hogs fowls fruits and what he seemed to think would be the most prevailing argument fine women who were abundantly liberal of their favors  mortified in a high degree that his reasons did not operate with the commodore he ran to the steerage and seizing the wheel of the helm tried to steer for his favorite isle nor was it without great difficulty on the part of the helmsman and equal vexation on that of the poor indian that he was prevented from carrying his design into execution  early on the following morning he climbed to the masthead where he remained several hours anxiously looking out for the spot which had so much attracted his regard  on the preceding night he pointed out a great number of stars and informed mons bougainville of their names in the language of otaheite and it was afterward certainly known that this islander was not unacquainted with the phases of the moon and that he was learned in those prognostics which evince an approaching change of the weather it likewise appeared that his countrymen were not uninformed in this kind of knowledge so useful to people whose wants or curiosity frequently carry them to sea where they have no compass to direct their course except their own judgment and the sight of the celestial constellations  mons bougainville confesses that the natives of otaheite are fully convinced that the sun and moon are peopled and he asks what fontenelle taught them the plurality of worlds  we will answer him  the omnipotent creator of all worlds who fills all space whose power gave birth and whose presence gives life to nature and who has poured his bounties with unsparing hand on every part of his creation  our historian having acknowledged that these islanders are possessed of such great and superior talents has certainly no right to call or to deem them savages is a man a savage because he happens to be born in a different part of the world from us because he is unacquainted with the languages of europe and untaught in customs which he could never from the locality of his situation have an opportunity of learning the historians and particularly the navigators of this quarter of the globe are very censurably fond of distinguishing by the title of savages all those who are happy enough to be born in milder climates and to live and die uninstructed in those arts of refinement and unskilled in that baseness of insincerity which are at once the characteristick the boast and the disgrace of the christian world  the weather continued fine till the end of april at which time the principal pilot on board the boudeuse died of an apoplectic fit in the beginning of the month of may three islands were discovered at the distance of ten or twelve leagues to the northwest but these were unknown to aotourou who imagined that it was mons bougainvilles country the moon shone bright in the night during which they kept sight of the islands and in the morning steered for the largest the eastern shore of which they coasted and found it about nine miles in length  the coasts of this island are remarkably steep and in fact the whole of it is little else than an enormous hill clothed with trees several fires were seen on shore a small number of houses covered with reeds under the shade of cocoanut trees and more than twenty of the natives running hastily along the coast  the two smaller islands were each about a mile and a half in length and separated from the larger one by an arm of the sea in shape and appearance they are very much like the former  the commodore had given directions to steer between the islands when a boat with five indians in her was observed coming off toward the ship she advanced very near but though every sign of friendly invitation was made not one of the natives would venture on board they had no kind of clothing but a bandage round the waist and as they could not be prevailed on to come up the ships side aotorou stripped himself leaving on nothing more than what they wore and addressed them in the language of otaheite but they understood not a word of what he said  as they held up some cocoanuts and other vegetables and seemed to wish to barter them for some trinkets which were shown them mons bougainville ordered out one of the ships boats with a view to visit the strangers but they no sooner learnt his intention than they rowed off with all possible expedition and he did not think proper to follow them  in a little time many other boats advanced toward the ships some of them rowed and others sailing these less diffident than the former came close under the ships side but none of the islanders would venture on board they exchanged pieces of an exquisitely fine shell yams cocoanuts and a water hen of most beautiful plumage for small pieces of red stuff but they did not seem fond of earrings knives nails nor iron of any kind which had been so eagerly coveted by the inhabitants of otaheite one of these indians brought a cock with him but he would not part with it on any terms they had also some pieces of cloth of the same kind as that manufactured at otaheite but not of so fine a fabric and died black brown and red but none of the colors were good of their kinds they were likewise possessed of a kind of wood hardened by fire lances mats and fishhooks made of bones  mons bougainville conjectures from the features of these islanders that they are not of so amiable a disposition as the natives of otaheite and he represents them as such dextrous thieves that it was almost impossible to guard against their depredations  these people are of the middle size and exceedingly alert they are of a deep brown complexion but one was seen among them who was much fairer than any of the others they had no beards so that it was supposed they were plucked out by the roots and their hair which was universally black stood almost erect on their heads their thighs and breasts were painted with a deep blue  their boats are built in a most ingenious taste and furnished with outriggers the head and stern of the vessel are equally flat with its sides and over each is a small deck in the center of which is a row of wooden pegs the tops of which are enclosed in a shell of the purest white the sail is formed of matting and its shape triangular being extended by means of sticks  in these boats the islanders followed the french vessels to a considerable distance out to sea while several others from the smaller islands joined the naval procession and produced an effect that was highly agreeable in one of these last mentioned boats was an old woman remarkably distinguished by the singular ugliness of her features  as the weather now fell calm the commodore gave up from an apprehension of danger hit project of sailing between the islands though the breadth of the channel was more than four miles they now sailed therefore in the open sea and on the evening of the same day the man at the masthead had sight of other land even while they were yet in view by the aid of a bright moon of the islands they had lately left  on the morning of the  th it appeared that the newly discovered land was a most beautiful island consisting of alternate mountains and valleys clothed with the richest verdure and finely shadowed by the spreading branches of the cocoanut and a variety of other trees near the westermost point of this island is a ledge of rocks and the sea breaks with violence on many parts of the coast so that it would be difficult to land except in very few places  many boats put off from the island and sailed round the ships though they were then going at the rate of at least seven knots an hour these boats however one only excepted would not venture near the ships but that one went alongside and her crew made signs for the french to land which they would have done but the breakers rendered it impossible at this time the man at the masthead observed a number of the indian boats sailing to the southward  on the following day another island was seen to the westward of the ships course in the neighborhood of which were two smaller islands but none of these could be distinctly beheld on account of some thick fogs which intercepted the view  the last mentioned islands are situated nearly where tasman the dutch navigator has placed a number of islands which he discovered and to which he gave the names of heemskirk prince william pylstaart amsterdam and rotterdam the longitude of these islands corresponds likewise very nearly with those which navigators have called solomons isles so that it is most probable they are the same  mons bougainville conjectures that the number of boats which were observed sailing to the southward is a vindication that there are other islands at no great distance and indeed this opinion seems to be wellgrounded o all these lands the commodore gave the general name of the archipelago of the navigators  the writer of this work must be indulged for giving a hint which springs from the noblest of motives the love of his country it is surely well worthy the consideration of the british ministry whether it might not be proper to send a fleet to discover and settle some of these islands  who knows what future benefit might from such a circumstance accrue to the first maritime and commercial state in the universe  the american colonies form the brightest gem in the british crown the colonies in the southern pacific ocean might not improbably constitute a diadem of still superior luster  on the morning of the   th another island was discovered which received the name of the forlorn hope but for what reason it is impossible to guess at a distance it had the appearance of two islands but this deception was occasioned by its shape for it consisted of two hills joined by a low land which could not be seen far out at sea  at this period and for some days before and afterward the weather was extremely unfavourable the winds being adverse and the rains and calms alternate mons bougainville on this circumstance observes that in the ocean which has obtained the name of pacific the approach to land is generally announced by violent tempests which become still more violent in proportion as the moon decreases the vicinity of islands is generally foreboded by thick clouds at the horizon and squally weather and the precautions necessary to be taken to prevent a vessels running fowl of shoals may be more easily conceived than described in the present instance it was impossible to proceed with the necessary degree of caution for the crew were in want of provisions and water in particular grew very scarce so that they were obliged to take advantage of every breeze of wind both by night and day and run all hazards for fear of starving  thus situated it may be presumed that they thought themselves sufficiently unhappy but their distresses were aggravated by the greater number of the crew of each ship being attacked by the scurvy which inflamed their mouths to such a degree that they could scarcely have swallowed those refreshments of which they stood much in need salt beef pork and dried pulse constituted the whole fare of those who remained in health for the sick however there were yet some few articles of fresh provisions remaining  at this unfortunate juncture the disease consequent on an illicit commerce between the sexes made its appearance attended by all its most disagreeable symptoms aotourou was so extremely ill of it that though seeming to despise its progress and its effects he was obliged to submit himself to the care of the surgeons mons bougainvilles words on this occasion are very remarkable in his aotourous country this disease is but little minded columbus brought it from america here it is in an isle in the midst of the greatest ocean have the english brought it thither or ought the physician to win who laid a wager that if four healthy stout men were shut up with one healthy woman the venereal complaint would be the consequence of their commerce  ungenerous frenchman why this unjustifiable attack on the english at the time mons bougainville wrote the narrative of his voyage he knew that some of his crew were infected with the malady in question when they landed at otaheite for in a former part of his volume he has said that he did all in his power to prevent their communicating it to the poor islanders what becomes too of his wonder how a disorder should find its way to a little island in the pacific ocean when he knew that his own ship had carried it thither  whether columbus brought this pestilence from america or not is perhaps a question not easily determined nor at this period is it at all material but one fact is well known that the french have plentifully distributed the contagion through europe and it is not improbable that they have likewise carried it to every other quarter of the globe  this subject is rather of the indelicate kind but we are necessarily led into it and may be indulged in one remark that seems to arise naturally from the preceding circumstances and will we trust militate on the side of virtue  providence we conceive wisely intended one man for the associate of one woman who should be the companion of his life the friend of his bosom the partaker of his joys the sharer of his griefs whose love for him should excite all his tenderness and repay with interest those toils and cares it gave rise to thus paired thus mutually giving and receiving happiness the married state is indeed a heaven on earth wedded love the chaste the holy the conjugal tie will ensure as much happiness as is to be found in this sublunary world and trust o reader in the goodness of god for the future to sum up this remark marriages are made in heaven choose ye ladies with prudence choose the heart paired with your own select ye generous youths the amiable fair whose eyes beam the gentle influence of love and whose heart feels the solid force of virtue then be true to each other and bid defiance to contagion so shall your days be happy and your children bless the parents to whom they owe the first of human blessings health of body and of mind  the ships now steered a westerly course and early on the morning of the   d two islands were discovered one of which received the name of aurora from the early hour on which it was first seen and the other that of whitsuntide isle from the day which gave birth to its being so named  the track of the vessels was now so directed as that they might have passed between the two islands but an unexpected calm prevented this maneuver proceeding to the northward of the first discovered island a rising land in a conical form was observed to bear north by west which received the name of the peak of the etoile  in the afternoon mountainous lands at thirty miles distance were seen appearing as it were over and beyond the island of aurora  on the twentythird it was discovered that the land last seen was a separate island the appearance of which was lofty its descent steep and the whole clothed with es a number of boats were seen coasting the shore but none of them approached the ships smoke was seen issuing from among the woods but no habitation was observed  in the morning the commodore dispatched three boats well manned and armed to take in wood and to learn the necessary particulars respecting the country while the ships guns were brought to bear on the island in order to protect the boats crews from any insult that might be offered them by the natives  mons bougainville himself went on shore in the afternoon where he found the goodnatured indians assisting the french in carrying to the boats a quantity of wood which had been cut  the information obtained from the officer commanding the boats crew was that on his first landing the natives assembled on the shore armed with bows and arrows intimating by signs that the strangers must retreat the french officer however gave directions for landing and while his people advanced the islanders retreated but with their bows bent and in an attitude of selfdefence at length the crew were ordered to halt while the prince of nassau approached the indians who no longer retreated when they saw only one person advancing the prince having given them some remnants of red cloth their esteem appeared o be at once conciliated  the commanding officer now stationed himself at the entrance of a wood and sent out a party in search of refreshments while another was deputed to cut firewood the natives now came forward with an appearance of friendship and distributed some fruit among the seamen to whom they likewise gave some arrows but refused to accept any thing in exchange their numbers were considerable and those who were not armed with bows and arrows had provided themselves with stones as instruments of defense  these people intimated that they were at war with the natives of a different district on the island and even while they were hinting this circumstance an armed party of indians approached from the westward while the former appeared determined not to retreat from their enemies but the valor of the latter was rendered unnecessary to be exerted by the want of present courage in the former  matters were in this situation when mons bougainville landed on the island where he remained till his boats were laden with the articles he wanted  this being done he took possession of the island by the act of burying at the foot of a tree an inscription carved on an oakplank and then he retreated to the ship  it was imagined that this early retreat of the french prevented an attack which the islanders had meditated as they seemed to be making preparations for what they had not yet in their power to carry into execution but no sooner had the boats put off than the islanders hastened to the beach and complimented them with a shower of arrows and a volley of stones some of them even plunged into the waves aiming their fury at the supposed invaders and hurling their vengeance on the insolent strangers when at length one of the seamen had been wounded by a stone a discharge of muskets drove the poor islanders to their native woods evidently wounded from their cries and exclamations  mons bougainville gives the following description of the natives of this island which he called the isle of lepers from observing that many of the inhabitants were afflicted with the leprosy some of them are mulatttos and others perfect negroes their hair is woolly and generally black but in some instances of a very light brown approaching to a yellow few women were seen among them but those few were equally disagreeable with the men who are represented as low in stature illfavored and disproportionably made  we will not deny the veracity of our historian the works of nature and of providence are astonishing the god of creation is equally wise and wonderful in all his works but we must own that it appears to be a phenomenon the existence of which surpasses the credulity of an english reader that black men should have to use mons bougainvilles own words hair of a yellowish color of all historians the circumnavigators are fond of dealing in the mavelous our commodore presuming that he had visited an island unapproached by any other european commander has told us just what he pleased of the natives of that island and it is not in our power to contradict him it would have given weight to the testimony of our flippant french historian if he had brought to paris one of these curious lusus naturae these yellowpated negroes  the ladies of this singular country carry their children in a bag of cloth slung at their backs on these cloths there are elegant drawings in a fine dye of crimson the noses of the men are pierced and hung with ornaments and it is presumed that they pluck their beards as none of them were observed to have any they wear a bracelet on the arm which had the appearance of ivory and pieces of tortoishells round their necks  clubs stones bows and arrows form the armor of these people the arrows are made of reeds pointed with bone on the points of these bones are inverted darts which prevent the arrow being drawn without tearing the flesh of the wounded person the boats of these islanders bore a strong resemblance to those of the indians of the isle of navigators but these vessels did not approach the ships so near as to furnish the french with an opportunity of giving a particular description of their construction  near the beach on which mons bougainville landed is a lofty hill extremely steep yet clothed with a superabundance of verdure the vegetable productions of the isle of lepers are far inferior to those of otaheite owing as is supposed to the lightness of the soil and its want of depth  figs of a species not before known were found in this country and several paths were seen cut through the woods and enclosed by pallisadoes about a yard in height it was conjectured that these enclosures marked the boundaries of the landed property of different persons half a dozen hovels only were seen into which no person could enter but on his hands and knees yet the inhabitants were very numerous and it is supposed they must be very miserable from the perpetual wars among the natives of different districts on the island  mons bougainville says that the sound of a drum harsh and dissonant to the ear was frequently heard in the wood near the top of the abovementioned hill and this he imagines to have been a signal for the indians to rally their forces for no sooner had the discharge of the firearms dispersed the multitude than this drum was immediately heard and when the islanders in enmity with the others appeared the drum was beat with suspended violence  aotourou formed a very contemptible opinion of the inhabitants of the isle of lepers whose persons appeared indescribably odious in his eyes and of whose language he had not the slightest idea  on the   d more land was discovered which on the   th was observed to enclose almost all the horizon so that the ships were surrounded in one extensive gulf while the coast of the newlydiscovered country contained many other gulphs or large inlets across which several boats were observed rowing from one shore to the other  the night of the   th was spent in tacking and in the morning it was observed that the currents had carried the ships several miles more to the south than their reckoning the number of isles now seen was so great that they could not be counted nor could the end of these extensive countries be discerned  steering northwest by west the land had a very beautiful aspect being diversified with fine trees between spots of land that had the appearance of being cultivated some parts of the mountains being barren and spotted in different places with a red earth mons bougainville conjectures from that circumstance that they contained some mineral substances  a great inlet to the westward having been seen on the preceding day the ships now arrived in it and saw a number of negro indians on the south coast of it while others approached the vessels in their boats but when they came to about the distance of a musket shot they would advance no nearer nor could any sign of invitation from the french induce them to alter their resolution  the land on the north shore is of a moderate height and clothed with trees on this shore many negroes were seen and several boats put off toward the ships but these like the former refused to come to board  at the distance of about eight miles from this spot two islands were seen which formed the entrance of a fine bay which the boats were sent to examine and after they had been gone a few hours the sound of muskets were heard which made the commodore very uneasy on their return in the evening it appeared that one of them in disobedience to the orders of the commander had left her consort and going near in shore the indians discharged two arrows at the crew which was returned by the musquetry and some larger guns a projecting point of land prevented the boat being seen from the ships but the incessant firing induced the commodore to imagine that she was engaged with a very large number of the enemies boats two of which she had certainly encountered  preparations were making for dispatching the longboat to her assistance when she was descried coming round the abovementioned point of land  the lamentable cries of the poor indians were now heard in the woods to which they had fled from the rage of their enemies and their drums were incessantly beating  we must now transcribe one passage from mons bougainville because it is the most humane and consequently the noblest in his whole narrative i immediately made signal to the boat to come on board and i took my measures to prevent our being dishonored for the future by such an abuse of the superiority of our power  the country last mentioned consisted of a number of small islands off which there is tolerable good anchorage but at such a distance from the coast that a ship could not cover any boats which should land which as the islands are clothed with thick woods would be the more necessary  these indians went naked and except a bandage round the waist wore the same kind of ornaments as those on the island of lepers whom they resembled in all respects except not being quite so black and the productions of the island were likewise the same  the commodore very properly declined any attempt to trade with these people whom he could not suppose would barter their effects with those from whom they had received such essential injuries  on the morning of the   th they again sailed and in a few hours had sight of a fine plantation of trees between which there were regular walks resembling those of an european garden many of the natives were seen near this spot and as an inlet was observed at no small distance the commodore ordered the boats to be hoisted out but they found that it was impracticable to land  the ships now quitted the great cluster of islands they had lately visited which received the general name of archipelago of the great cyclades which it is conjectured occupies no less than three degrees of latitude and five of longitude mons bougainville says that these islands are not the same that quiros called tierra austral del espiritu santo but that roggewein saw the northern extremity of them which he denominated groningen and thienhoven  our author now recites a very singular fact on board the storeship was a person reported to be a woman which was almost confirmed by her want of beard her voice and her shape the commodore going on board the etoile enquired into the fact when the party confessed her sex while floods of tears streamed down her face  her story is extraordinary  born in burgundy and left an orphan she was ruined by the fatal issue of a lawsuit on which she resolved to drop the habit of her sex and served a gentleman at paris but hearing of mons bougainvilles intended expedition round the world she repaired to rochefort where just before the ships embarked she entered into the service of mons de commercon who went out with a view of increasing his botanical knowledge she followed her master with astonishing courage and resolution through deep snows to the hoary tops of the mountains in the straight of magellan carrying loads of herbs plants arms and provisions with unspeakable courage and unwearied toil  while our adventurers were at otaheite the men of that island flocked round our heroine and exclaiming this is a woman would certainly have treated her as such but that an officer rescued her from their hands and ordered her to be delivered unviolated on board the ship  mons bougainville observes that this is the first woman that ever circumnavigated the globe and remarks on the singularity of her situation if the ships should have been wrecked on some desert isle in the great ocean the name of this extraordinary woman is bare and she is as celebrated for her chastity as her courage  on the night between the fourth and fifth of june some breakers were seen at half a leagues distance by the light of the moon in the morning it appeared to be a low flat sandy isle abounding in birds which received the name of the shoal of diana  about this period several species of fruit and some pieces of wood floated by the ship and a kind of flying fish was seen larger than the common sort the body of which was black and the wings red  a sand bank was discovered on the  th on which the sea broke violently and the tops of rocks were seen at intermediate spaces this last discovery says our author was the voice of god and we were obedient to it  they therefore spent the night in making short tacks in that part of the sea with which they were previously acquainted  at this time the salt provisions on board were become so putrid that it was almost impossible for men even on the point of starving to swallow them and therefore the rats were industriously sought after and eaten in preference to it the remaining peace would serve only forty days and the bread two months so that it became highly necessary to think of steering to the northward  on the  0th before daybreak an agreeable fragrancy impregnated the air announcing that land was near and it was accordingly discovered before sunrising this is described as a most delicious country divided near the sea coast into groves and plains behind which the land rises in the form of an amphitheatre till the tops of the mountains are lost in the clouds the most lofty of three chain of mountains was seen above seventy miles inland the whole country appeared to be rich and fertile but the deplorable situation to which the ships companies were reduced would not admit of their staying to take a more accurate survey of it  on the  0th a prodigious swell from the southeast drove the ships violently toward land and they were soon within about two miles of it and the night was passed in this dangerous situation taking advantage of every slight breeze to clear the shore a number of boats were now seen coasting the island on many parts of which fires were observed a turtle was found here in the belly of a shark  for several successive days there was so thick a fog that the boudeuse was obliged to fire frequent guns to keep company with the etoile on board of which were a part of their provisions  several shell fish called cornets leaped into the ship in the night and as it is known of these fish that they are accustomed to keep at the bottom of the sea it is evident that the ships must have been in very shallow water  on the   th the weather became fine and on the following day several islands were discovered one of which was called ushant from its similitude to the island of that name  by this time our voyagers were reduced to very great extremities the allowance of bread and pease was considerably reduced and a fear of the consequences that might arise obliged the commodore to forbid the eating of leather there was yet on board a shegoat which had been brought from falklands islands she yielded milk daily but this was insufficient to save her life the starving crew demanded the victim and the butcher who had hitherto been her feeder wept as he plunged the murderous knife in the breast of his favorite soon after this a dog which had been put on board at the streights of magellan fell a sacrifice to the dire demands of hunger  on the   th not less than nine or ten islands were discovered and on the  0th a still farther number our navigators now struggled at once with a variety of inconveniences occasioned by foul ships damaged rigging crazy masts and tempestuous weather  on the   th high land was discovered which appeared to terminate in a cape which they doubled with a degree of transport that may be more easily conceived than described as it was the point they had wished for a sight of from a certainty that it would enable them to quit for ever the archipelago of islands amidst which they had been so long in hourly danger of shipwreck or starving this cape was called cape deliverance and the name of the gulf of the louisiade was given to a bay of which the cape forms the eastermost point  north of cape deliverance about sixty leagues land was discovered which proved to be two small islands and two days afterward an officer was sent to examine several creeks in the hope of finding anchorage while the ships sailed slowly after the boats ready to join them on the first signal  the natives now advanced toward the ship in several boats carrying from two or three to upwards of twenty men each  these boats had no outriggers and their crews were as black as the negroes on the coast of guinea some of them had reddish hair and that of all of them was long and curled they wore white ornaments on their foreheads and necks and were armed with lances and bows they kept an almost continual shouting and seemed rather inclined for war than peace  when the boats returned on board the officer reported that the sea broke on all parts of the coast that he had found only one small river that the land is every where covered with wood and that the mountains run down close to the seashore  the natives dwell on the mountains but they have a few huts on the banks of some of the small creeks  some of them followed one of the ships boats and seemed almost resolved on an attack and one of the indians repeatedly put himself in an attitude to have thrown his lance but he desisted from his purpose and no mischief was done  mons bougainville says that he was now advanced too far to return but that he hoped to find a passage though the weather was so foggy that he could not discern any object at the distance of more than two leagues  in the morning of the  st of july the ships were just in the station they had quitted the preceding night having been impelled forward and driven back by the tides  nothing remarkable happened but the discovery of a race in the middle of a passage to which was given the name of denniss race from that of the master of the boudeuse  a race is a part of any channel or straight where there are opposing tides or a rapid and dangerous current and such are even sometimes met with in the open seas  boats were now sent to find anchorage in a fine bay and the account of their expedition is as follows  that a number of indian boats in which were a hundred and fifty of the natives armed with shields lances and bows came from the banks of a rivulet on which their habitations were situated and rowed hastily toward the french boats which they surrounded and with hideous outcries began the attack with their bows and lances the french discharged their muskets but the natives covering themselves with their shields the fight continued till a second firing terrified them so that they made a hasty retreat some of them swimming on shore  two of their boats were taken on the stern of which was the figure of a mans head with a long beard the eyes being motherofpearl the ears tortoiseshell and the lips were dyed a bright red exclusive of their weapons and utensils there were found in their boats cocoanuts and several fruits the species of which were not known the jaw of a man half broiled and various other things  the natives of this coast are negroes whose hair curls naturally and they have a method of coloring it yellow red and white their clothing consists only of a piece of matting round the waist this river received the name of warriors river and the whole spot that of the isle and bay of choiseul  two days afterward a cape was discovered which was called cape laverdi on which were mountains of an astonishing height on the  th other mountainous land was discovered from which came off five or six indians and after lying on their oars some time they accepted some trifles which were thrown to them they now exhibited some cocoanuts saying bouca bouca onelle and seemed greatly pleased when the french repeated them they then intimated that they would fetch some cocoanuts but they had scarcely left the ships side when one of them discharged an arrow by which however no person was wounded  the people were altogether naked had long ears bored and curled short hair which some of them had dyed red and they had also white spots on their bodies their teeth were red probably from the chewing of betel  this island which was named bouka appeared to be cultivated and from the number of huts that were seen it probably abounds with inhabitants  the cocoanut and other trees dispersed over a beautiful plain was a sufficient temptation for landing but the rapidity of the current prevented the possibility of it  two more islands were seen on the  th and as the wood and water were expended and disease reigning aboard the commodore resolved to land here and on the following afternoon the ships came to an anchor the casks were sent on shore and tents erected for the sick on a commodious spot where there were four rivulets near together and where wood for the carpenters and joiners use as well as for burning was very plenty there were no inhabitants near the place so that the sick had an opportunity of ranging the woods fearless of any attack from the natives and every thing seemed to conspire to render this spot the most eligible imaginable but there was one great inconvenience no fruit could be found  two huts were discovered on the bank of a rivulet not far from the encampment and a boat near which were seen the remains of fires some calcined shells and the skeletons of some animals heads which were taken for those of the wild boar some fresh bananas were found which proves that the natives had but lately left the place  this island produces a large blue crested pigeon which has so plaintive a note that the seamen mistook it for the cries of men toward the mountains  mons bougainville now relates an extraordinary incident a seaman being looking for shells found a plate of lead buried in the sand on which the following letters were very visible hord here the mark of the nails with which the lead had been fastened appeared and it is plain that the natives must have torn off the plate and broken it  this circumstance gave rise to a diligent search and at about six miles from the wateringplace the very spot was found where the english had formed their encampment several trees were seen which had been felled and others which were sawn in pieces a very large and conspicuous tree was found on which the inscription had been nailed it stood in the midst of a spacious place and it appeared that the plate had been pulled down but a very short time there were other trees to which the ends of ropes were fastened one of the trees which had been cut down had put forth fresh twigs apparently of the growth of four months mons bougainville mentions it as a very singular circumstance that amidst so many islands he should happen to land on that so lately visited by a rival nation  diligent search was now made for food and refreshments but almost in vain for nothing could be found but a few cabbagetrees and thatchpalms no fish could be catched and though a few wild boars were seen not one of them was taken a small number of pigeons were indeed shot the feathers of which were of green and gold  it will be needless to mention the other products of this island as the reader has already had an account of them in the narrative of the english voyages  no time was now lost in the necessary repairs of the ships and an equal division was made of the provisions which now began to run extremely short a third part of the late allowance of pease was taken off from the commodore to the lowest person on board all fared alike their situation like death banished all distinction  on the   th there was an eclipse of the sun which was clearly seen and the proper astronomical and nautical remarks made on it the name of port praslin was given to this harbor an inscription having been first buried under the spot where the eclipse had been observed  the etoile being a light vessel and there being no stones to ballast her after the provisions had been taken out this important business was necessarily performed with wood a fatiguing and unwholesome task in so damp a country  an insect of a most wonderful texture was found on this island the body and wings of which appeared so much like the leaf of a tree as scarcely to be distinguished from it even on a nice inspection when the wings are extended each forms the half of a leaf and when they are closed it is entire the upper side of the body is of a brighter hue than the under parts and it has six legs the upper joints of which resemble parts of leaves this curiosity was preserved in spirits and is in the cabinet of the french king  a sailor who was hauling the fishingnet in search of a scarce fish called the hammeroyster having been bit by a snake whose bite is poisonous was cured in a few hours by a profuse perspiration produced by taking flowerdeluce water and treacle  aotourou having remarked the progress of the cure intimated that at otaheite there were seasnakes whose bite is mortal in every instance  on the   d repeated shocks of an earthquake were felt for about two minutes the sea rose and fell several times so that the concussions were felt on board the ships  notwithstanding the extreme bad weather which prevailed the crews divided into separate parties went to the woods every day in hopes to shoot some turtledoves and gather cabbagetrees and thatchpalms but it generally happened that they returned without any success and wet to the skin at length however they found some mangle apples and a kind of pruens but too late to be of much service as they were now on the point of departure a kind of ivy was successfully applied in the cure of the scurvy  an immense cascade was seen falling from numerous rocks into a hundred basins of water and at once shaded and adorned by stately trees some of which grow even in the reservoirs is recommended by mons bougainville as a subject fit to exercise the fancy of the boldest painter  why did not his limner make a drawing of it  the situation of the ships companies now became so dreadful that no more time could be lost  in the afternoon of the   th a favorable breeze enabled the ships to get out to sea  mons bougainville remarks that this country must be new britain and that the great bay must be the same which dampier calls st georges bay but that he had the happiness to land on a part of it where his wants could be supplied by the inhabitants  a succession of islands having been seen in the offing mons bougainville named them after the officers  the fieldtents were now cut up to make trowsers for the seamen who had been repeatedly clothed during the voyage to enable them to sustain the inclemencies of so many different climates but the last change of clothing was now delivered out and at this period an ounce of bread was deducted from their scanty allowance their salt provisions were now so bad as to be nauseous in a high degree yet their starving situation impelled them to feed on them but even at this melancholy period no one yielded himself a prey to melancholy the sailors influenced by the example of the officers employed every evening in dancing dispelling by their mirth some of the pangs of hunger  happy frenchmen who could be thus mirthful in the jaws of apparent destruction  new britain continued in sight till the beginning of august when the ships being nearer the land than they had been before several indian boats came off the crews of which were negroes with woolly heads which they had covered with white powder they are tall and active and wore no other clothes than leaves round the middle they held out something that had the appearance of bread and invited the french to land but they refused to enter the ships though an attempt was made to conciliate their friendship by presents of some pieces of stuff they accepted what was given and threw a stone from a sling in return instantly retreating with loud vociferations  on the following day a larger number assembled along side the boudeuse a person who had the appearance of authority carried a red staff knobbed at each end in his hand on approaching the ship he held his hands over his head for a considerable time the hair of these negroes was painted red some of them were adorned with feathers earrings made of the seed of some herb or circular plates depending from their necks others had the nose pierced and rings ran through it but the general ornament was a bracelet made of the half of a shell the french were anxious to conciliate the esteem of these people but in vain they eagerly grasped at whatever was given them but would make no present in return the roots of a few yams were all that could be obtained from them two of their boats being observed approaching in the night a rocket was fired on which they instantly rowed off  on the   st a number of indian boats attacked the etoile with a volley of stones and arrows but a single discharge of the musquetry got rid for ever of these troublesome companions  on the  th of august two islands were seen which are conjectured to be the same which dampier distinguishes by the name of matthias and stormy or squally island on the  th a third island was seen and then the northern point of new britain which lies only forty one minutes south of the land  on the  th a flat island was seen covered with trees abounding with cocoa nuts and certainly well inhabited as appeared from the great number of houses that were seen on the shore fishingboats in multitudes surrounded the island but the fishermen took no notice of the ships this received the name of the isle of anchorets on the following day a prodigious number of small islands was seen when mons bougainville having escaped the most imminent dangers in the endeavor to double this chain of islands at length happily effected his point in consequence of a breeze which still freshened with the rising sun  he now continued to range the coast till he came within sight of two lofty peaks to which he gave the name of the two cyclops on the   th two high mountains were discovered on the continent and two small islands near them  on the   d two other islands being discovered an attempt was made to land in the hope of obtaining refreshments but this was found impracticable but by the boats the commanding officer of which reported that the islands were totally uninhabited and that no fruits grew which were fit to be eaten  this day the ships crews were twice alarmed the first time with a report from aloft that a range of breakers were seen ahead but this proved to be only the rippling of a strong tide the second alarm was from the forecastle where it was declared that the bottom of the sea was visible under the ships way this shoal was perceived by the crew of the etoile but was easily escaped by both the ships monsieur denis first master of the boudeuse died this day of the scurvy to the infinite regret of the whole ships company at this time upwards of forty persons were ill of the same disorder the progress of which was stopped by the plentiful use of wine and lemonade  it was now thought necessary to stear a southerly course in order to get clear of the islands by which they were surrounded none of these islands appeared to be inhabited though all of them were clothed with verdure during the following night they sailed out of this labyrinth through a channel about three leagues in breadth early in the morning they doubled the southernmost of a number of small islands on each side of this channel which was denominated the french passage on the   th in the morning they passed the meridian for the fifth time and early the next day had sight of a small island to the southeast they likewise saw a steep hill remarkably high to which they gave the name of big thomas near which are three small islands  they had sight of several islands on the   th and   th when mons bougainville gave orders for a boat belonging to the etoile to steer to the southwesternmost of these isles in search of anchorage and to enquire if they produced any thing worthy of notice the boat having landed on two islands which neither produced any fruits nor appeared to be cultivated and indicated no signs of being inhabited the ship was on the point of returning when an indian rowed up to the ships boat without expressing the least sign of fear or astonishment the frenchmen intimated that they wanted food and liquor on which he presented them with a kind of meal and some water in return for which they gave him a lookingglass a handkerchief and some other trifles which he received with indifference and laughed at the donors it was conjectured that this negroe had deserted from one of the adjacent islands which have been settled by the dutch the number of them were formerly seven but they are now reduced to five by earthquakes the crew of the boudeuse took a turtle on this spot of not less than two hundred weight  early in the morning of the   st our voyagers had sight of the island of ceram which runs in a parallel east and west abounds in lofty mountains and is partly cleared and partly in its original state a great number of fires were seen on this island which seem to intimate that it is well peopled early in the morning on the first of september our adventurers found themselves at the entrance of a bay on the banks of which they beheld a number of fires they soon observed two boats under sail constructed on the plan of those of malay a dutch pendant was now hoisted and a gun fired but the commodore confesses his error in this procedure as the people at ceram are at variance with the dutch whom they have almost totally routed from their island mons bougainville having been thus unsuccessful through mistake returned from the bay and employed the rest of the day in plying between the islands bonao kelang and manepo  some time before midnight a number of fires attracted their attention to the island of boero where there is a dutch factory well provided with the necessary refreshments  the abovementioned dutch factory is at the entrance of the gulf of cajeli which the french had sight of at daybreak their joy on this occasion is not to be expressed for at this time not half of the seamen were able to perform any duty and the scurvy had raged so violently that no man on board was perfectly clear of it what few provisions were on board were absolutely rotten and stunk intolerably  thus circumstanced their change of situation must have been rapturous indeed from midnight the fragrant breeze had wasted the aromatic flavor of the plants which abound in the moluccas the aspect says our author of a pretty large town situated in the bottom of a gulf of ships at anchor there and cattle rambling through the meadows caused transports which i have doubtless felt but which i cannot here describe our commodore hoisted dutch colors and fired a gun but though several boats were sailing in the bay none of them came alongside in a few hours a periagua rowed by indians advanced toward the ship and the commanding officer enquired in dutch who they were but refused to go on board mons bougainville however proceeded under all his sails and in the afternoon came to an anchor opposite the factory  two dutch soldiers one of whom spoke french now came on board the boudeuse demanding the reason of the commodores entering that port when he must know that the ships of the dutch east india company had an exclusive right to that privilege he was answered in brief that necessity was the motive that hunger must preclude the force of treaties and that they would depart as soon as their wants were supplied  the soldiers soon returned with the copy of an order from the governor of amboyna who presides over the resident at boero forbidding him to admit foreign ships into that port the resident therefore entreated mons bougainville to declare in writing the cause of his putting in there that he might transmit such declaration to the governor of amboyna in justification of his own conduct  this request being complied with all difficulties were at an end the resident having performed his duty as a servant of the company was anxious to discharge the superior duties of humanity the commodore and his officers visited him on shore were received in the most friendly manner and accepted his invitation to supper  the resident and his company beheld with equal pleasure and surprise the effects that hunger had on the appetites of the guests nor were they willing to eat themselves least they should deprive their now too happy visitants of their full share of their repast mons bougainville confesses that he was supremely happy because he had previously sent on board what would be an equal feast to both the ships companies a contract was now made that while the ships should remain in that harbor venison should be daily supplied to the crews that eighteen oxen a number of sheep and poultry and a quantity of rice to supply the place of bread should he put on board the resident was likewise obliging enough to furnish the sick with a quantity of pulse from the companys garden but much could not be obtained as it is not generally cultivated on the island  the sick were now brought on shore and the majority of the seamen were likewise indulged in walking about for their health and pleasure the commodore hired the slaves belonging to the company to fill the water casks and to carry the several necessaries on board  mons bougainville and his officers were gratified with the pleasure of stag hunting and he mentions the deer of this country as most exquisite food the dutch originally transported them hither this island is described as a delightful composition of woods hills plains and wellwatered valleys  the town of cajeli and about fourteen indian dwellings formed the dutch settlement a stone fort which the dutch had originally erected was accidentally blown up in the year      since which time it has no enclosure but that of palisadoes with a battery of six small cannons about fifty white people are all that reside on the island of whom a sergeant and twentyfive men commanded by the resident form a part the negroes who reside in the interior parts of the country subsist by the cultivation of rice  the moors and the alfourians are the genuine natives of this country the former are protected by the dutch factory who endeavor to inspire them with the dread of all foreigners these people are principally kept in awe by the influence of their own chiefs for whom the dutch resident professes a sincere regard dutch policy in this as in all their other settlements is the same by fomenting a jealousy among the chiefs of their respective dependants a plot is no sooner formed by one chief than it is revealed by another the natives of boero are not treated as slaves by the dutch their slaves being procured from the islands of ceram or celebes  unlimited freedom and independence appear to reign among the alfourians who residing on the mountains in the interior parts of the island subsist on the produce of their hunting with fruits and sago it is presumed they are not mahometans because they eat swines flesh the principal people among the alfourians pay occasional visits to the dutch resident they would do as well says our author to stay at home  the chief products of this island are various kinds of wood particularly black and white ebony and there is a fine plantation of pepper the fruits are pineapples citrons lemons bitter oranges shaddocks bananas and cocoanuts very good barley is likewise a produce of this country  parrots and a variety of other birds many of them extremely beautiful abound in the woods there is likewise the wild cat whose bag under the belly serves for the conveyance of its young bats and serpents of an enormous size the latter of which are said to have a swallow capacious enough for the reception of a whole sheep there is a snake too which posting itself on the trees darts into the eye of the passenger who happens to look up and the bite of this animal is certain death  crocodiles of an astonishing size reside on the banks of the rivers devouring such beasts as fall in their way and men are only protected from their fury by carrying torches in their hands mons bougainville asserts that these crocodiles which roam for prey in the night have been even known to seize people in their boats  the name of the resident at buero is ouman he is by birth a batavian and is married to a native of amboyna he lives in great elegance and splendor and is attended by no less than a hundred slaves mons bougainville speaks of his politeness and hospitality in very high terms after having twice regaled the french officers in the ceremonious way he bid adieu to all set forms but his house was constantly open to them as their own they always found good viands and liquors and our author thinks this was no inconsiderable degree of civility to persons who had so lately been on the point of starving  the residents house is constructed in the chinese taste in the middle of a garden which is intersected by a river the house itself is a handsome building and it is elegantly furnished its approach is through an avenue of trees which are planted down to the seaside the wife and daughter were habited in the chinese manner and were no way deficient in the essential requisites of good breeding their chief employment consists in making nosegays and selecting flowers proper for distillation  the astonishment of aotourou at this first fight of an european settlement may be more easily conceived than described he regarded every object with an intenseness of curiosity scarcely to be satisfied but he was particularly charmed with the hospitality of the dutch he supposed every thing freely given as he did not see any thing returned by way of barter mons bougainville says that he hehaved sensibly with respect to the dutch to whom he intimated the consequence he was of in his own country and that his present voyage was merely pleasurable with friends whom he esteemed his constant practice was to imitate the manners of the french both in their visits and in their rural amusements the knees of this indian being distorted he attributed to that circumstance his not being taken with the commodore on his first visit to the resident and actually desired some of the seamen to press their weight on his knees to make them strait  this surely is no great proof of that good sense which mons bougainville has frequently hinted that aotourou was possessed of  this islander would frequently enquire if paris was as grand a place as boero  though the french were only six days on shore the healthful air of the place had so far recovered the sick that by the help of the refreshments now ready to be put on board it was very possible to perfect the cure at sea  the sick people were conveyed to the ships in the morning of the  th and before evening every one was on board in expectation of the landbreeze by which after much difficulty in weighing the anchor they were enabled to sail about an hour before midnight and got clear of the gulf of cajeli before morning  mons bougainville now proceeds to a recital of the incidents which occurred during his passage from boero to batavia in which we shall trace him with all necessary exactness  having coasted the island of boero the isles of manipa and kilang were seen on the morning of the  th and on the  th they had sight of the island of xullabessic where the dutch have a factory named cleverblad that is the cloverleaf there is a garrison consisting of twentyfive men under the discipline of a sergeant and commanded by a person who holds no higher rank than bookkeeper to the dutch east india company  on the  0th the commodore buried his tailor who fell a sacrifice to the scurvy increased when on the point of cure by an excessive drinking of brandy  on the morning of the   th they had sight of the island of wawoni and in a few hours saw that of button the streights of which they entered on the following day and observed a vessel of a square form ranging the shore and towing a periagua the french ships were no sooner observed by this vessel than she furled her sail and concealed herself behind a small island a french seaman whom mons bougainville had engaged at boero said that the vessel in question was manned by a set of indian pirates who made a practice of taking prisoners in order to sell them  in the afternoon the ships sailed by a beautiful port on the coast of celebes the view of which land is delightfully variegated by mountains hills and valleys and clothed with an exuberance of verdure in a few hours afterward the island of pangasani was in sight to the northward of which appeared the highest mountains of celebes pangasani is a flat island abounding in trees and our author conjectures that it produces spices it is however certain that it is well inhabited from the number of fires that were seen on it during the night  on the morning of the   th the ships were surrounded with indian boats bringing parroquets cockatoes fowls eggs and bananas which the natives sold for dutch money or exchanged for knives these people were inhabitants of a considerable district on the mountains of button opposite the place where the ships lay at anchor on this spot the land is cleared and cultivated the property of different persons being divided by ditches some of the fields are enclosed by hedges and there are houses in these fields besides which there are several villages  the produce of the country consists in potatoes yams rice maize etc and the bananas are deemed as good as in any part of the world pineapples mangle apples cocoanuts and citrons are very plentiful the natives are of a brown complexion ordinary features and of low stature they profess the mohammedan faith and speak the language common in the molucca isles they are very honest though expert traders  they offered mons bougainville some pieces of coarse cotton cloth but he does not say whether he dealt with them or not he asked them for some nutmegs which they said they procured from the island of ceram and in the neighborhood of banda and his remark is that the dutch cannot supply them from those places  our author describes the coast of pangasani as rising in the form of an amphitheatre from the level of the coast which he imagines is frequently overflowed because the dwellings of the natives were observed to be situated on the slope of the hills the people of button consider the inhabitants of pangasani as pirates and each party is provided against the attacks of the other by a dagger which is always worn stuck in the girdle  the ships sailed on the morning of the   th but coming to an anchor in a few hours afterward a number of periaguas surrounded the boudeuse one of which hoisting dutch colors the rest retreated that she might come alongside it appeared that in this boat was one of the chiefs of the country to whom alone the dutch permit the distinction of carrying their colors  our commodore sailed again on the   th and in the afternoon of that day dispatched his barge after a boat which was seen in a large bay with a view to procure a pilot and the boat readily came having an indian on board who for thirteen shillings readily engaged in the pilotage but his intended services were rendered unnecessary by the sun happening to shine with great luster on a spot which directed their passing out of the channel  as opposing winds and tides now obliged the ships to come to an anchor the periaguas came off in great numbers bringing pieces of cotton articles of curiosity and variety of refreshments at the approach of evening the ships got clear of the narrow pass and anchored in boston bay  mons bougainville gives an animated description of the passage he had just cleared the coast of button abounds in enclosures proper for the catching fish while the rising grounds are bespread with habitations the opposite shore is perpendicular and after passing the galley both sides are steep hanging in some places over the channel one would think says our author that the god of the sea had opened a passage here for the swelled waters by a stroke of his trident  might he not as well have said that the great god of nature is equally wise and wonderful in all his works  the coast of pangasani has two or three houses on it though it is little else than a solid rock yet well clothed with trees  the indian pilot abovementioned gave the best instructions in his power respecting the mode of passing this gut but he appeared totally unskilled in the european art of navigation another indian supposed to be the pilots father went on board the boudeuse in the morning and remained till the evening they both drank plentifully of brandy but would eat only bananas and chew betel absolutely refusing to taste of the ships provisions  on the morning of the   th while the ships were under sail the indians came off in great numbers bringing fruit poultry and eggs which they sold so reasonably that even the common seamen could possess themselves of those refreshments in very great abundance so that both the ships had the appearance of large poulterers shops and capital fruiterers warehouses on a market day  this morning five of the orencaies or chiefs of button came off in a boat of the european form with dutch colors hoisted at its poop these people were dressed in jackets and long breeches with turbans and each of them had a silverheaded cane with the companys marks on it they gave mons bougainville a roebuck and received in return each a quantity of silk stuffs they paid many compliments to the french nation freely drinking the health of his most christian majesty and the king of button so freely indeed that they were at length obliged to be helped down the ships side into their boats  the commodore enquired of the orencaies whether any spices grew on the island of button to which they replied in the negative and were easily credited on account of the weakness of the dutch settlement which is nothing more than a sew huts built of the bamboo cane and enclosed with pallisadoes the whole guard on the part of the company consists only of a sergeant and three men the coast opposite button is enclosed cultivated and wellpeopled nor is the island itself less populous or less fruitful  in the morning the indian pilot visited the commodore and informed him that the southeast wind would blow freshest exactly at noon this proved to be strictly true and was a circumstance so well known to the natives that all the boats which had surrounded the ship retired before the sun had gained his meridian altitude  mons bougainville taking advantage of the pilots advice got out to sea with a fair wind steering for the island of saleyor which he discovered on the   th  on this island the dutch have a small settlement the principal resident at which is the bookkeeper this day at noon three islands were discovered which were called north island south island and isle of passage which last was so denominated from the ships passing near it for the advantage of a safe navigation  by daylight on the   th they were within about a league of the coast of celebes which in this part is described as one of the finest countries in the world immense herds of cattle graze on the plains which are adorned with groves while the coast is one continued plantation of the cocoanut tree the plains are in most places cultivated and covered with houses while the mountains behind them add dignity and ornament to the whole picture  on this day mons bougainville chased a malayan boat in the hope of obtaining a pilot acquainted with the coast but she fled at his approach nor even brought to after he had fired several guns at her he conjectures that the boudeuse was mistaken for a dutch ship and observes that the generality of people on this coast are pirates who are always made slaves of when they are taken by the dutch  the ships having during the evening steered between an island named tanakeka and three smaller isles orders were given at midnight to carry all the sail possible in order to come within sight of the isles of alambai  at midnight between the   st and   d a boat was observed advancing toward the ships but though guns were repeatedly fired she bore off in the apprehension as conjectured that they were dutch vessels  mons bougainvilles observation is that these people are more afraid of the dutch than of the firing of guns  and indeed this observation seems to be verified by another boat being equally studious to avoid them a few hours afterward  in the afternoon of the   d the north coast of madura was seen from the masthead and a number of fishing boats were observed some at anchor and some employed in their business  on the following morning four ships were seen two of which hoisted dutch colors and one of them was spoke with by the boudeuse which proved to be a snow from malacca bound for japara  mons bougainville now coasted the land of java the shore of which is level but the interior country abounds in lofty mountains  on the morning of the   th the coast of java appeared with the rising sun in the afternoon the commodore spoke with a dutchman who commanded a boat bound for the isles of amboina and ternate who said that according to his reckoning he was then twentysix leagues from batavia  having come to an anchor for the night the ships sailed early in the morning of the   th and on the following night came to an anchor in the fear of having even past the port of batavia but having sight of the church of that town in the morning they sailed into and soon anchored in the road happy to have after so many toils difficulties and dangers reached a spot which they conceived would soon put a period to all their misfortunes by ensuring them a safe arrival in europe  mons bougainville now proceeds to recite such incidents as happened during the time he was at batavia and gives some particulars respecting the molucca islands  we searce know how to treat this subject with the delicacy with which it ought to be touched as the readers of these volumes are already apprized of almost every interesting particular respecting batavia but we shall with the utmost diligence select such circumstances as our french historian has recorded which have been either unknown to or not treated of by the english navigators  mons bougainville for reasons which would operate on every prudent commander resolved to make his stay at batavia as short as possible but the want of biscuit a sufficient quantity of which was not baked compelled him to stay longer than he had intended  a dutch officer came on board with a written paper of which our frenchman understood not a word but the cockswain having enquired who their visitants were demanded a certificate written and signed by the commanding officer mons bougainville who had sent an officer on shore to wait on the governor declined to give any answer till his return this officer came back late in the evening with an account that his excellency was at his country house but that he had been with the shebander who promised to introduce the commodore to the dutch general on the following day  the heat of this climate requires that visits should be made early in the morning mons bougainville therefore set out soon after daybreak and after waiting on the shebander was by him conducted to the governor general who was then at one of his country residences about nine miles from the town  the behavior of this chief of an important district was equally sincere and obliging he approved of the conduct of the resident at boero in his treatment of the french during the hour of their distress he gave permission for the sick to be lodged in the hospital and issued the proper orders for their being received the furnishing of the necessary supplies was left to the shebander and when all matters of business were ended the governor asked the commodore if he would salute the citadel to this it was answered in the affirmative on the condition that the salute should be properly returned these preliminaries being adjusted mons bougainville went on board his ship saluted with fifteen guns and was complimented with the same number  considering the matter seriously is not all this most egregious nonsense  a frenchman agrees to waste a cetain quantity of his masters powder provided a dutchman will blow into the air an equal quantity of the powder of their high mightinesses the states general  the sick people were now sent to the hospital twentyeight in number most of whom were troubled with the bloody flux and the rest with the scurvy  the officers having taken lodgings in the town fixed a day for paying a visit of ceremony to the governor at his countryseat called jacatra after which they visited in form an officer called schoutbynacht or rear admiral who is a member of the regency and has a vote in every matter respecting maritime affairs this gentleman lives with a degree of splendour that would not disgrace a prince  mons bougainville mentions the theater of batavia as an elegant building but of the performances he was not qualified to judge from a total ignorance of the language his curiosity impelled him to take a view of the chinese comedies but of these also he could form no judgment but from sight exclusive of the exhibitions on the regular theaters he says that a kind of pantomine is daily performed on scaffolds erected in the chinese quarter of the city it is a singularity of the chinese comedy that the characters of men are represented by women nor is it unfrequent to see the actors entertain the spectators with a boxingmatch  our ingenious voyager represents the neighborhood of batavia as elegant beyond description  the neatness is all dutch the magnificence truly parisian  a clergyman of batavia mr mohr distinguished for his immense riches and his extensive knowledge has erected in the garden of one of his countryhouses one of the most superb observatories in the world and has furnished it with great variety of instruments of the construction of european artists our author observes that he is doubtless the richest of all the children of urania  the water of batavia is of so bad a quality that the people of fortune import seltzer water from holland for their common drinking at a most enormous expense the houses of this city are built only one story high on account of the frequent earthquakes which would be of pernicious consequence to buildings of a lofty construction  the riches of the batavians are marked by the magnificent taste in which their houses are furnished yet is the city said to be much inferior to what it was some years ago and it is certain that the rent of houses is not half as much as it was yet will this place always be rich through the refined policy of the dutch which makes it difficult for any man after he has amassed a fortune to transmit it to europe for any money intended to be sent to holland must pass through the hands of the company who charge eight per cent for the care of sending it to europe exclusive of which the currentmoney of batavia would sustain a loss of no less than twentyeight per cent even if it could be smuggled out of the country  the distinction of rank is observed in the strictest degree at batavia what the french call the etiquette is never dispensed with the gradation of rank is as follows viz the high regency the court of justice the ecclesiastics the companys servants the sea officers and those of the military  there is no appeal from the decisions of the court of justice this court about twenty years since sentenced to death the governor of ceylon who had been convicted of most infamous oppressions in his government and he was executed opposite the citadel at batavia  if any of the respective sovereigns of the island of java offend against the established dutch policy they are put to death in the most inhuman manner on these melancholy occasions the unhappy sufferers are dressed in white drawers and are never beheaded from a conviction prevalent among them that appearing in any other dress or visiting the other world without their heads would be productive of the most fatal consequences nor do the dutch dare to controvert these opinions as the immediate consequence of such a procedure on their part would be a revolt of that of the javanese  the dutch company have an exclusive right to a large part of the island of java  the island of madura did formerly belong to them but the chief of it revolted from their authority and the son of this revolting king is at present the governor of that very island of which his father had been the sovereign  the dutch equally deep in every stroke of their politics have seized the province of balimburan in consequence of the sovereign of that district having revolted from their authority it is asserted that the english erected him a fort and supplied him with arms and ammunition to combat that slavery which he thought the more an indignity because it was impelled by the mercantile world after a war of two years and after repeated battles in the last of which the javanese prince and his family were made prisoners the dutch became final conquerors and the routed sovereign being lodged in the citadel of batavia soon fell a sacrifice to the grief that preyed on his mind when mons bougainville arrived at batavia it was in agitation to send the son and the other branches of this unhappy family to the cape of good hope in order that they might spend the remains of a wretched existence on the island of roben the several chiefs of the different districts of the island of java are surrounded with dutch guards so that they are kings only in name from these however the dutch receive arrac rice sugar coffee and tin in return for which they supply opium the sale of which is very profitable from the great quantities consumed by the javanese  our commodore now proceeds to a description of the commerce of batavia and a recital of many particulars respecting the molucca islands but these particulars or others so exceedingly resembling them being recorded in many volumes of voyages we shall pass them over in search of something really new and respecting which our author appears to have been well informed  before the crews of the boudeuse and etoile had been ten days at batavia the diseases common to that climate began to attack them with all their fury from a vigorous state of health the people were in a few days reduced to the brink of the grave nor could the commodores utmost diligence enable him to transact his affairs with a proper degree of dispatch as the illness of the shebander himself prevented the acceleration of his business  every officer on board the boudeuse began to feel the fatal effects of the climate and at length aotourou felt the direful influence of this pestiferous clime and it is supposed that nothing but the readiness with which he took the prescriptions offered him could have saved him from the most fatal consequences of the contagion for a long time after he left batavia he distinguished it by the name of enoua mate the land which kills  mons bougainville now proceeds to a description of his leaving batavia his touching at the isle of france and his return to his native country of which we shall have occasion to say but little as the run from batavia to europe is universally well known and has been previously described in the course of these volumes  the ships sailed on the   th of october      and cleared the streights of sunda on the   th in the afternoon by this time the crew were all perfectly recovered of the scurvy but a few of them remained ill of the bloody flux on the  0th the ships were in sight of the isle of france and on the  th of november the boudeuse anchored in the port of that island the etoile which had been unavoidably left behind anchoring in the same port on the following day  at this place the ships were repaired and the commodore left behind him on the island several persons who desired to add to the numbers already in that colony  the commodore expresses his happiness that he was enabled after so tedious a voyage to enrich this colony with inhabitants and necessaries but he laments in the most pathetic terms the death of the chevalier du bouchage an ensign on board the kings ship whose abilities as an officer could be surpassed only by his virtues and accomplishments as a man  our author speaks in the most lavish terms of the forges for making iron which are established on this island and he even prefers them to those of europe how far he is justified in this preference must be left to future navigators or future artificers to determine  mons bougainville sailed from this place the   th of december      leaving the etoile behind him to undergo some necessary repairs and this ship did not arrive in france till a month after the boudeuse without encountering any singular accident our adventurers had sight of the cape of good hope on the   th of january and came to an anchor in table bay on the following morning  our author very judiciously omits a description of the cape which has been so often and so accurately described by our circumnavigators and other voyagers one circumstance however he fails not to mention that they killed a quadrupede named the giraffe which was seventeen feet in height and that they took the young one alive which measured seven feet none of these says our author had been seen after that which was brought to rome in the time of caesar and shown there in the amphitheatre  mons bougainville sailed from the cape on the   th and came to an anchor off the island of st helena on the  th of february where he remained till the  th and then got under sail in pursuance of his voyage to france  on the   th of this month the commodore joined the swallow commanded by captain carteret what passed in consequence of this junction the readers of these volumes are already acquainted with  nothing material happened from this time till they had sight of the isle of ushant when a violent squall of wind had nearly blasted all the blooming hopes of so fine a voyage on the   th the commodore bore away for st maloes which he entered on the following day after an absence of two years and four months from his native country during all which time he had buried only seven of his crew a circumstance that will be deemed truly astonishing when we reflect on the variety of dangers they had encountered the amazing changes of climate they had experienced the hair breadth perils they had escaped and the estimated proportion of time that any man may be supposed to live at any given age when in full health and breathing his native air to what then shall we ascribe the unexampled success of mons bougainvilles circumnavigation but to the benevolent interposition of that particular providence the existence of which has been lately so boldly and with such apparent weight of argument denied  thus have we traced with the pen of fidelity this ingenious historian from the milder climate of france to the frozen regions of the magellanic streights and from those streights through the intense burnings of the torrid zone back again to the benevolent influence of the european sun and abating that vanity peculiar to the french and that nationality which if criminal is a crime arising from a noble and praiseworthy cause we must confess that his narrative is as much more philosophical and ingenious as it is more pert and flippant than the narratives of our english adventurers mons bougainville has introduced in the body of his volume a narrative of the establishment of the spaniards in rio de la plata and also an account of the missions in paraguay and the expulsion of the jesuits from that province but as these recitals seemed to have no immediate connection with the commodores circumnavigation we have not interrupted the narrative thinking they would come in with more propriety immediately after the close of the voyage  the river de la plata takes a southerly course to the   th degree latitude where it is united with the river uraguai making one stream which runs still southerly to the ocean the jesuits have advanced a false principle of geography and other authors have fell into their errors by supposing the river de la plata to spring from the lake of xarages this lake which has been the subject of much enquiry is now supposed to have no existence  by order of the courts of spain and portugal the marquis of valdelirais and don george menezes undertook to determine the limits of possession of these two powers and accordingly several spanish and portuguese officers traversed this large district of america between the years      and      the spaniards embarked on the river paraguai and the portuguese proceeded from a settlement belonging to the crown of portugal called maragosso situated on the interior boundaries of the brazils at about    degrees south latitude and proceeded up the river caourou which according to the maps of the jesuits is described as falling into the lake xarages but how great was their surprise and disappointment at meeting in the   th degree of south latitude in the river paraguai without finding any thing to justify the supposition of the existence of the lake hence it was concluded that the periodical inundations of the river over a considerable tract of the adjacent country having been received in the low grounds formed a body of water which by former navigators was taken for the ideal lake  the source of the paraguai or rio de la plata is among the mountains between the two oceans and between five and six degrees south latitude and it empties itself into the river of amazons the uraguai arises in the captainship of st vincents in the brazils and the parana in the mountains to the east northeast of rio janeiro whence it flows to the westward and then changes its course to the south  it appears from the account of the abbe prevost that diaz de solis first discovered the parana in      and called it after himself but that in      sebastian cabot named it la plata or of silver on account of the many pieces of silver which he observed in the possession of the natives of the adjacent country the fort of espirutu santo was erected by cabot who had scarcely time to see it completed before it was levelled with the earth  in      don pedro de mendoza great cupbearer to the emperor sailed for the river de la plata and founded buenos airs but this undertaking proved extremely unsuccessful and after mendozas death the inhabitants of buenos airs unable to defend themselves against the depredations of the indians and living in perpetual dread of famine fled for sanctuary to assumption now the capital of paraguai which was built by the followers of mendoza soon became well inhabited and of course considerably enlarged don pedro artiz de zarara governor of paraguai rebuilt buenos airs upon an improved plan in the year    0 and it soon became the principal resort of ships navigating the south seas soon after which it was an episcopal see and the place of residence of the chief magistrate the situation of buenos airs is computed to be in    degrees    min south latitude and    degrees   min west longitude from paris the inhabitants including negroes do not exceed twenty thousand notwithstanding which the town covers a very large space of ground owing to the generality of the habitations having no more than a ground floor with spacious courtyards and extensive gardens the public market is held in a grand square the angles of which are formed by the governors palace the town hall the cathedral and the episcopal palace there is no harbor at buenos airs so that ships of any considerable burden are obliged to sail to encenada de baragon about ten leagues east southeast of the town or else receive and deliver their freights by means of small boats  adjoining to the jesuits convent there is a building called the house for the exercises of women where married and unmarried people without the consent of their husbands or friends sequester themselves for the space of twelve days during which time various religious exercises are practiced almost without intermission there are holy ceremonies appointed for the slaves and such of the negroes as pay four reals per annum to the dominicans are admitted members of some religious community are entitled to certain holidays to hear mass and a decent interment at the expense of the friars  this community of negroes acknowledge st benedict of palermo and the virgin for their patrons and on the days dedicated to these saints they select two persons to represent the kings of spain and portugal who are followed by all the negroes of the order parading through the streets from the rising to the sitting of the sun singing dancing representing battles and repeating religious incantations  the grounds near buenos airs are extremely fruitful producing all the real necessaries of life but it is entirely uncultivated at only three leagues distance and in crossing the plains scarce a hovel is to be met with so that passengers are frequently under the necessity of sleeping in their carriages and those who go on horseback are often for many successive nights exposed to the inclemency of the weather horses and black cattle abound in these plains and the latter are frequently killed by travelers who take away sufficient for a few meals and leave the rest for the birds and beasts of prey the only furious animals known here are wild dogs and tigers the former which are said to have been originally brought from europe are both fierce and numerous and perhaps owing to their food and the climate seem as it were greatly to have altered their species the latter are of the usual kind but are not very frequently met with  in the neighborhood of buenos airs wood is so extremely scarce that very little is to be found that will even serve for fuel and what is used in erecting and repairing houses or in refitting vessels is transported from paraguai  the indians inhabiting this part of america are of a copper complexion seldom exceeding five feet in stature and of a very forbidding aspect their chief is distinguished by a thong of leather tied round his forehead to which are fastened several plates of copper the arms they use are bows and arrows nooses and balls these balls are about the circumference of a two pound cannon ball and being received in leathern cups at the end of cords of about six or seven feet long they throw them when on horseback with such amazing force and dexterity as to be almost at a certainty of killing an animal at the distance of three hundred yards  some years ago a number of delinquents escaping the punishment they were sentenced to retreated to the north of the maldonadoes where being joined by some deserters and indian women they have formed a community of desperadoes they frequently plunder the spanish settlements and carry their spoils to the boundaries of the brazils where they receive in exchange for them firearms and clothes from the paulists another desperate race of robbers supposed to be between six and seven hundred in number who removed from brazil farther to the northwest about the sixteenth century since which time they have continually traversed the adjacent country in parties and such travelers as are so unfortunate as to meet with them generally fall victims to their cruelty and rapine  the governments of tucuman and paraguai with the missions of the jesuits are dependent upon the governorgeneral of la plata who in all matters relating to the silver mines of potosi is under the jurisdiction of the viceroy of peru a mint having been lately established at potosi the silver will not in future be brought from thence in the ore but refined on the spot  two hundred carts attended by three hundred men go annually from buenos airs to fetch salt from the lakes adjacent to the sea in fortythree degrees latitude and the necessity of obtaining salt is the only motive that induces the spaniards to travel so far south of buenos airs where the country exhibits a melancholy prospect of dreary and uncultivated wilds  the principal commerce of buenos airs is with peru and chili to which province they send cotton mules some skins and about four hundred thousand spanish pounds weight of the paraguai herb or south sea tea every year great part of this last article is consumed by the laborers in the peruvian mines it being esteemed a most excellent preventative against the effects of the noxious vapors arising from those inexhaustible funds of treasure  notwithstanding there is but little trade at buenoes airs it is a place of such great riches that the register ships frequently carry away a million of dollars each and if they were inclined to extend their skin and fur trade those articles alone would undoubtedly acquire them immense wealth  montevideo was built between forty and fifty years since upon a peninsula to the north of the river and about ninety miles above its mouth the town has a bay affording safe anchorage but in boisterous weather some skill must be exerted to keep clear of a chain of hidden rocks off the east point of the bay which are called punta de las carretas the town of montevideo affords every refreshment and the air being particularly salubrious renders it still more inviting to the sons of neptune who here find a happy renewal of that health and vigor which from various causes must inevitably be impaired by a long residence on the stormy element  the jesuits took up their residence at paraguay in the year    0 and in the time of philip the third founded their celebrated missions called indifferently by the europeans paraguai or uraguai these missions are thirtyseven in number twentynine being on one side of the river uraguai and eight on the opposite shore  the jesuits undertook to convert the natives of this tract of america to the roman catholic religion and in order to encourage them to pursue this very difficult task with a proper degree of spirit they were rendered independent of the governors authority and allowed an annual stipend of sixty thousand piastres for their necessary expenses and in order to indemnify the crown for this expense a tax of one piastre per head was levied upon all the indians between the age of eighteen and sixty  notwithstanding the many and great obstacles which would have dispirited less determined men the jesuits by a steady perseverance the most ardent zeal and a strict attention to the genius and disposition of these savages at length civilized their manners implanted in their minds the principles of the christian religion and made them happy within themselves and useful to the community  in the year      the spanish monarch having given up the colonies on the left shore of the river to the portuguese in exchange for santo sacramento with a view to suppress the smuggling trade the indians of the ceded colonies disgusted at being driven from their cultivated lands took up arms against the spaniards don joseph andonaighi governorgeneral of the province de la plata and don joachim de viana governor of montevideo marched against and entirely defeated them soon after this battle the insurrections being quelled viana left buenos airs and was accompanied as far as the maldonados by seven indian families where they settled leading a life of exemplary prudence and industry the situation of these reclaimed people gives an idea of what the poets call the golden age they knew no distinction of rank were neither incumbered with riches nor oppressed with poverty and as all their wants were supplied from the warehouses appointed to receive the produce of the common labor they had no incitement to use sinister and clandestine means to obtain private property  the country in which the missions are situated reaches about four hundred and fifty miles east and west and about six hundred miles north and south and the number of the inhabitants is computed to be three hundred thousand there are immense forests of all kinds of wood and extensive meadows watered by innumerable small rivers and brooks which produce pasture sufficient for upwards of two millions of cattle  the country was divided into districts over each of which two jesuits were appointed to preside one of whom acted as rector and the other as his curate the indians lived in the most abject state of submission to their rectors who severely chastised them for misdemeanors and annually appointed a number of inferior officers called corregidors to take cognizance of petty offenses  near the church are two large buildings one of which was inhabited by a great number of girls who were instructed in various occupations the other building was occupied by young negroe men who were brought up to various handicraft professions and one department of this building was appointed to the teaching of music sculpture architecture etc the rectors house stood between these buildings and had communications with each which he visited every day to see the provisions justly distributed and the proper decorum in other respects strictly observed  the entire expulsion of the jesuits from the spanish dominions having been resolved upon don francis buccarelli was appointed to carry this design into execution and he accordingly sailed for buenos airs arrived there in the beginning of      and immediately sent the dispatches with which he was charged to the governors of peru and chili and the commanders of cordoua mendoza corrientes santafe salta montevideo and paraguay these dispatches were accompanied by letters strictly enjoining the persons to whom the dispatches from the court were directed not to open them till an appointed day as it was a matter of doubt whether the indians would tamely submit to see jesuits arrested in the colonies all the preparations for carrying the kings orders into execution were conducted with the most profound secrecy the time for accomplishing this grand design at length arrived and the different governors being previously instructed to open their letters and to proceed according to their contents with all imaginable dispatch  the general execution began about two oclock in the morning when the jesuits with equal horror and astonishment found their habitations invested by the spanish troops  they evinced a high degree of philosophical resignation and humility in quietly submitting to their fate which they confessed was not so severe as their crimes deserved  on the thirteenth of september a cacique belonging to each colony and all the corregidors arrived at buenos airs these people were politically detached from their companions by the following stratagem with a design of securing them as hostages in case any resistance had been made the governorgeneral sent for them under pretense of communicating the substance of the kings letters and these deluded people were not informed of the events that had happened till they received the account from the mouth of the governor who gave them a general audience immediately upon their arrival when the governor informed them that he came to free them from the slavery they had long groaned under and directing them to one of the houses formerly occupied by the jesuits they were there properly provided for at the kings expense the jesuits had established other missions than those abovementioned to the south of uraguay and were making great progress southward of chili toward the island of chiloe but the unexpected turn of affairs in europe utterly destroyed the work the

of this collection given an authentic account of the proceedings and discoveries of the english navigators who have lately surrounded the globe and also a copious detail of the voyage of a cotemporary navigator of another nation who jealous of the english designs was commissioned to follow the same track that the present undertaking may not want novelty to recommend it i have procured at a considerable expense the journal of a new voyage to the northern part of the globe a voyage which his majesty in a particular manner has thought fit to patronize and which was equipped with such care and circumspection that nothing was found wanting during the course of it  this voyage i have added by way of supplement without any additional expense to the subscribers and have prefixed to it a brief recapitulation of the many attempts that have been made for the discovery of a northeast passage to china and japan and also have subjoined a like summary of the enterprises set on foot by government or undertaken by private adventurers for discovering a communication with the great pacific ocean by a passage from the northwest  these accounts are full of astonishing events and wonderful descriptions of uncommon phenomena in them we read of rivers and lakes of ice bursting with imprisoned vapors and of rocks forests beams of houses and buildings splitting with a noise not less terrible than the loudest thunder  of brandy brine and even spirits of wine exposed to the open air only for a few hours freezing into a solid mass  of mountains of ice frozen in the sea one hundred fathom deep  of snow hills that never thaw  and of winds that blister the flesh and shrivel the skin like redhot iron  in this supplement the distresses dangers providential deliverances and unspeakable sufferings of those who have wintered in the dark and dreary regions of the north are recounted with clearness and brevity and in the small compass of a few sheets the contents of many volumes are comprised  supplement containing the journal of a voyage undertaken by order of his present majesty for making discoveries toward the north pole by the hon commodore phipps and captain lutwidge in his majestys sloops racehorse and carcass to which is prefixed an account of the several voyages undertaken for the discovery of a northeast passage to china and japan map of the arctic ocean a map of the icy sea  which the several communications with the land waters and other new discoveries are exhibited   the introduction it is fortunate for commerce and the intercourse of nations that there is implanted in mans nature a desire of novelty which no present gratification can satisfy that when he has visited one region of the earth he is still like alexander sighing for another to explore and that after having escaped one danger in his progress he is no less eager to encounter others that may chance to obstruct him in the course of his pursuits  if the history of former hardships could have deterred men from engaging in new adventures the voyage the particulars of which we are now about to relate would probably never have been undertaken the dreary regions that surround the poles are so little accustomed to feel the kindly influences of the enlivening sun and are so destitute of the ordinary productions of the earth in happier climates that little less than one whole quarter of the globe is by its sterility rendered uninhabitable by human beings and but thinly occupied by a very inconsiderable number of the race of quadrupedes the many and almost insuperable difficulties that must therefore be expected in traversing these forlorn deserts where no relief is to be expected but from the favorable interposition of that power whose merciful providence extends to the remotest corners of the earth are upon reflection enough to cool the ardour of the most enterprising and to stagger the resolution of the most intrepid  in the contention between powers equally formed by nature to meet an opposition it may be glorious to overcome but to encounter raging seas tremendous rocks and bulwarks of solid ice and desperately to persist in attempts to prevail against such formidable enemies as the conflict is hopeless so the event is certain the hardiest and most skilful navigator after exposing himself and his companions to the most perilous dangers and suffering in proportion to his hardiness the most complicated distresses must at last submit to return home without success or perish by his perseverance  this observation will be sufficiently justified by a brief recapitulation of the voyages that have been undertaken with a view to the discovery of a northeast passage to china and japan  the first who attempted this discovery was sir hugh willoughby with three ships so early as the year      the era of perilous enterprises this gentleman sailed to the latitude of    degrees north within sight as it is imagined of new greenland now called spitsbergen but by a storm was driven back and obliged to winter in the river arzena in lapland where he was frozen to death with all his company he left upon his table a concise account of all his discoveries in which he mentions having sailed within sight of a country in a very high latitude about which geographers are divided some affirming as has been said that it could be no other than new greenland afterward discovered and named by the dutch spitsbergen others that what he saw was only a fogbank and of this latter opinion is capt wood an able navigator of whom we shall have occasion to speak hereafter  to sir hugh willoughby succeeded capt buroughs afterward comptroller of the navy to queen elizabeth this gentleman attempted the passage with better fortune and returned full of hope but without success he passed the north cape in      advanced as far north as the   th degree discovered the wygate or strait that divides nova zembla from the country of the sammoyds now subject to russia and having passed the easternmost point of that strait arrived at an open sea from whence he returned having as he imagined discovered the passage so painfully sought and so ardently desired some affirm his discoveries extended beyond the  0th degree of latitude to a country altogether desolate where the mountains were blue and the valleys snow  be that as it may the favorable report of capt buroughs encouraged queen elizabeth to fit out two stout vessels to perfect the discovery the command of these ships was given to the captains jackman and pett who in    0 sailed through the same strait that had been discovered by buroughs and entered the eastern sea where the ice poured in so fast upon them and the weather became so tempestuous that after enduring incredible hardships and sustaining the most dreadful shocks of ice and seas terrible even in the relation they were driven back and separated and neither pett nor his ship or crew were ever heard of afterward  after this disaster and disappointment the desire of visiting the frozen seas to the northeast began to abate among the english but was assumed by the dutch with an obstinate perseverance peculiar to that phlegmatic nation the first dutchman we read of who made the attempt was john cornelius of whose voyage in      we have but a very imperfect account he was followed however in   0  by william barrans or as some write barents an able and experienced seaman and mathematician who being supplied with every necessary for so hazardous a voyage by the generosity and patronage of prince maurice proceeded in the same course which had been pointed out to him by the english navigators but having passed the wygate found the like encumbrances and the like tempests which the english had experienced and not being able to bear up against them returned thoroughly convinced that the wishedfor passage was not to be attained in that direction however he traversed the coast of nova zembla gave names to several promontories and headlands and planned to himself a new course to steer by which he hoped to accomplish what he had failed in discovering by following the steps of those who had gone before him  in   0  animated rather than discouraged by disappointment he entered upon his second voyage with the spirit of a man fully prepossessed with success he had heard that some of the whalers who had now begun to frequent the north seas had either by design or accident advanced much farther to the northward than those who had been purposely fitted out upon discoveries he therefore determined to steer to the northward of nova zembla till he should arrive at the height of the pole under which he was persuaded he should find an open sea and by changing his course to the southward avoid those obstructions which had retarded his passage to the northeast  in this hope he continued till he arrived on the coast of nova zembla where before he had reached the   th degree he was so rudely attacked by the mountains of ice that every where assailed him that not being able to withstand their fury he was driven against the rocks and his ship dashed to pieces barents and the greatest part of his crew got safe to land but it was to experience greater misery than those underwent who perished in the attempt they were obliged to winter in a country where no living creature besides themselves appeared to have existence and where notwithstanding their utmost efforts to preserve their bodies from the cold the flesh perished upon the bones of some of them and others died of the most excruciating pains  in this extremity and notwithstanding the anguish they endured those who survived had still the fortitude and ingenuity to frame a pinnace from the wreck of their broken ship in which at the approach of summer they made sail for lapland but before they arrived at colu their captain died and with him the hopes of perfecting his discovery  it was now the active season for naval enterprises private adventurers began to fit out ships for the north seas innumerable sea animals had been observed to bask upon the ice the tusks of whose jaws were found to excel in whiteness the finest ivory and their carcases to yield plenty of excellent oil in the infancy of the whale fishery these were pursued with the same eagerness with which both the english and dutch endeavor at this day to make the whales their prey and perhaps with no less profit in following these many islands were discovered to which they resorted and in course of time the seas that were so formidable to the first discoverers became frequented at the proper seasons by the ships of every nation  foreign navigators however were more sanguine in their notions of a northwest passage than of the existence of a passage to the northeast and it was not till many unsuccessful trials had been made to discover the former that the latter was again attempted the celebrated hudson who discovered the straits that leads to the great western bay which still bears his name after he had exerted his skill in vain to find a passage westward was persuaded at last to undertake a voyage in search of a passage to the northeast this he performed in    0 but being discouraged by the miscarriages of others and the fatal issue that had attended their obstinate perseverance on viewing the face of the country examining the currents and traversing an immense continent of ice that stretched along the ocean in a direction from east southeast to west northwest he concluded that no passage could be practicable in that direction and therefore returned without making any other material discovery  from this time till the year      the prosecution of this discovery was totally neglected by the english and though the dutch whalers amused the world with wonderful relations of their near approach to the pole yet little credit was given to their reports till the arrival of one john wood who had accompanied sir john narborough in his voyage to the south sea with a view to establish a new trade with the chilians and natives of that vast tract of country reaching from the straits of magellan to the confines of peru  this able and enterprizing navigator being himself an excellent mathematician and geographer and reading in the philosophical transactions a paper by which the existence of a northeast passage to the eastern or indian ocean was plausibly asserted and this exactly coinciding with his own notions of the construction of the globe he was induced by this and other reasons to apply to king charles the second for a commission to prosecute the discovery the accomplishment whereof it was said would add to the glory of his majestys reign and immensely to the wealth and prosperity of his kingdoms  many about the court of that needy prince hoping to share in the profits of the voyage were earnest in prevailing with his majesty to forward the design who being himself fond of novelty ordered the speedwell frigate to be fitted out at his own charge manned victualled and provided with every necessary while the duke his brother and seven other courtiers joined in the purchase of a pink of one hundred and twenty tons to accompany her which hey likewise manned and victualled and furnished with merchandises such as were thought marketable on the coasts of tartary or japan the countries they most probably would first fall in with after their passage through the north sea  these ships being in readiness and commissions made out for their commanders captain wood was appointed to direct the expedition on board the speedwell and captain flawes to bear him company on board the prosperous  on the   th of may      they sailed from the buoy of the nore with the wind at southwest and on the  th of june cast anchor off lerwick in brassey sound where they continued six days to take in water and recruit their stores  on saturday the  0th they weighed anchor and continued their voyage and on the   th they entered the polar circle where the sun at that season of the year never sets at noon the speedwell broke her maintopsailyard in the slings the first disaster that had happened which however was easily repaired the weather now began to grow hazey a circumstance that frequently happens in the polar regions and darkens the air with the obscurity of night  from this time till june    when they fell in with the ice in latitude    degrees    minutes north nothing material occurred on that day at noon they observed a continent of ice stretching to an imperceptible distance in a direction from eastsoutheast and westnorthwest they bore away along the ice till the   th when they found it join to the land of nova zembla  on the   th they stood aay to the south to get clear of the ice but unfortunately found themselves embayed in it at    at night the prosperous bore down upon the speedwell crying out ice upon the weatherbow on which the speedwell clapped the helm hard a weather and veered out the mainsail to ware the ship but before she could be brought too on the other tack she struck on a ledge of rocks and stuck fast they fired guns of distress but were not heard and the fog being so thick that land could not be discerned though close to the stern of their ship no relief was now to be expected but from providence and their own endeavors in such a situation no description can equal the relation of the captain himself who in the language of the times has given the following full and pathetic account  here says he we lay beating upon the rock in a most frightful manner for the space of three or four hours using all possible means to save the ship but in vain for it blew so hard that it was wholly out of our power to carry out an anchor capable to do us any service at length we saw land close under our stern to the great amazement of us all which before we could not see for the foggy weather so i commanded the men to get out the boats before our mast came by the board which was done i sent the boatswain toward the shore in the pinnace to see if there was any possibility of landing which i much feared because the sea ran so high in half an hour he returned with this answer that it was impossible to land a man the snow being in high cliffs the shore was inaccessible this was bad tidings so then it was high time to think on the safety of our souls and we went all together to prayers to beseech god to have mercy on us for now nothing but individual ruin appeared before our eyes after prayers the weather cleared up a little and looking over the stern i saw a small beach directly with the stern of the ship where i thought there might be some chance of getting on shore i therefore sent off the pinnace a second time with some men in her to be first landed but she durst not venture to attempt the beach i then ordered out the longboat with twenty men to land who attempted it and got safe on shore they in the pinnace seeing that followed and landed their men likewise and both vessels returned to the ship without any accident the men on shore desired some firearms and ammunition for there were many bears in sight i therefore ordered two barrels of powder some small arms some provisions with my own papers and money to be put on board the pinnace but as she put off from the ships side a sea overset her so that all was lost with the life of one man and several others taken up for dead the pinnace likewise was dashed to pieces to our great sorrow as by that disaster one means of escaping from this dismal country in case the prosperous deserted us was cut off the longloat being on board and the sea running high the boatswain and some others would compel me and the lieutenant to leave the ship saying it was impossible for her to live long in that sea and that they had rather be drowned than i but desiring me when i came on shore if it were possible to send the boat again for them before we got half way to shore the ship overset so making all possible haste to land the men we had on board i went off to the ship again to save those poor men who had been so kind to me before with great hazard i got to the quarter of the ship and they came down the ladder into the boat only one man was left behind for dead who had before been cast away in the pinnace so i returned to the shore though very wet and cold we then hauled up the boat and went up the land about a flight shot where our men were making a fire and a tent with canvass and oars which we had saved for that purpose in which we all lay that night wet and weary the next morning the man we left on board having recovered got upon the mizzenmast and prayed to be taken on shore but it blew so hard and the sea ran so high that though he was a very pretty sailor none would venture to bring him off  the weather continuing blowing with extreme fogs and with frost and snow and all the illcompacted weather that could be imagined put together we built more tents to preserve ourselves and the ship breaking in pieces came all on shore to the same place where we landed which served us for shelter and firing besides there came to us some hogsheads of flour and brandy in good store which was no little comfort in our great extremity we now lay between hope and despair praying for fair weather that captain flawes might find us which it was impossible for him ever to do while the weather continued foggy but fearing at the same time that he might be cast away as well as we  but supposing we never were to see him again i was resolved to try the utmost to save as many as i could in the longboat in order thereunto we raised her two feet and laid a deck upon her to keep the sea out as much as possible and with this boat and thirty men for she would carry no more i intended to row and sail to russia but the crew not being satisfied who should be the men began to be very unruly in their mind and behavior every one having as much reason to save himself as another some holding consultation to save the boat and all to run the like fortune but here brandy was our best friend for it kept the men always foxd so that in all their designs i could prevent them some were in the mind to go by land but that i knew was impossible to any man neither had we provisions nor ammunition to defend us from the wild beasts so the passage by land being impracticable and no passage by sea to be attempted till forty men were destroyed i will leave it to the consideration of any whether we were not in a most deplorable condition without the interposition of divine providence  the weather continued still very bad with fogs snow rain and frost till the  th day of our being on shore which was the  th day of july when in the morning it cleared up and to our great joy one of our people cried out a sail which proved captain flawes so we set fire to our town that he might see where we were which he presently discovered so came up and sent his boat to us but before i went off i wrote a brief relation of the intention of the voyage with the accident that had befallen us and put it into a glass bottle and left it in the fortification i had there built so by twelve oclock we all got safe on board but left all on shore that we had saved from the ship for we much feared it would prove foggy again and that we should be driven once more on this miserable country a country for the most part covered perpetually with snow and what is bare being like bogs on whose surface grows a kind of moss bearing a blue and yellow flour the whole product of the earth in this desolate region under the surface about two feet deep we came to a firm body of ice a thing never heard of before and against the icecliffs which are as high as either of the forelands in kent the sea has washed underneath and the arch overhanging most fearful to behold supports mountains of snow which i believe has lain there ever since the creation    thus far in captain woods own words he adds that by the tides setting directly in upon the shore it may be affirmed with certainty that there is no passage to the northward one thing remarkable in his relation and which seems to contradict the report of former navigators is that the sea is there salter than he had yet tasted it elsewhere and the clearest in the world for that he could see the shells at the bottom though the sea was four hundred and eighty feet deep  being all embarked on board the prosperous on the  th of july they changed their course and steered for england and on the   d of august they arrived safe in the thames without any remarkable accident intervening  after the miscarriage of this voyage on which the highest expectations had been formed the most experienced navigators in england seemed to agree that a passage by the north or northeast had no existence they were the more confirmed in this error for an error it is by the reasons assigned by capt wood for changing his opinion on this matter for before he went upon the discovery he was fully persuaded himself and likewise persuaded many others that nothing was more certain when however he first saw the ice he imagined it was only that which joined to greenland and that no solid body of ice extended farther from land than twenty leagues in this persuasion he altered his course and coasted along in the direction in which the ice lay expecting at every cape or headland of ice after running a certain distance to find an opening into the polar ocean but after running two or three glasses to the northward in one bay he found himself entangled in another and thus it continued till his ship was wrecked by this experiment he found the opinion of barents confuted namely that by stearing the middle course between spitsbergen and nova zembla an open sea might be attained in which a ship might safely sail as far as the pole from his own experience he therefore pronounced that all the dutch relations were forgeries which asserted that any man had ever bee under the pole verily believing that if there be no land to the northward of  0 degrees that the sea is there frozen and always continues so and grounding his opinion upon this remark that if the body of ice which he saw were to be conveyed ten degrees more to the southward many centuries of years would elapse before it would be melted  to this positive assertion however may be opposed the testimony of many credible persons some of whom have themselves sailed beyond the  0th degree of north latitude and others upon evidence whose veracity there is no reasonable cause to bring in question  among the latter the testimony of mr joseph moxon member of the royal society of london must have considerable weight in a paper which this gentleman caused to be printed in the philosophical transactions is this remarkable relation  being about twenty years ago in amsterdam i went into a public house to drink a cup of beer for my thirst and sitting by the public fire among several people there happened a seaman to come in who seeing a friend of his there who he knew went the greenland voyage wondered to see him because it was not yet time for the greenland fleet to come home and asked him what accident had brought him home so soon his friend who was the steersman answered that their ships went not out to fish but only to take in the lading of the fleet to bring it to an early market but said he before the fleet had caught fish enough to lade us we by order of the greenland company sailed unto the north pole and came back again whereupon says moxon i entered into discourse with him and seemed to question the truth of what he said but he did assure me it was true and that the ship was then in amsterdam and many of the seamen belonging to her ready to justify the truth of it and told me moreover that they had sailed two degrees beyond the pole i asked him if they found no land or islands about the pole he answered no there was a free and open sea i asked him if they did not meet with a great deal of ice he told me no they saw no ice about the pole i asked him what weather they had there he told me fine warm weather such as was at amsterdam in the summertime and as hot i should have asked him more questions but that he was engaged in discourse with his friend and i could not in modesty interrupt them longer but i believe the steersman spoke truth for he seemed a plain honest and unaffectatious person and one who could have no design upon me  to authenticate this relation it has been observed that under the poles the sun in june being    degrees high and having little or no depression toward the horizon always as it were swimming about in the same elevation might invigorate that part of the hemisphere with more heat than he does our climate when he is in the winter no more than    degrees at the highest and but eight hours above the horizon in which space the earth has time to cool and to lose in the night the influences of heat which it receives in the day  another report upon like evidence was made to king charles the second by capt goulden who being a greenland whaler himself spoke with two hollanders in the north seas that had sailed within one degree of the pole where they met with no ice but a hollow grown sea like that in the bay of biscay  a still more credible testimony is that about the year    0 application being made to the states general for a charter to incorporate a company of merchants to trade to japan and china by a new passage to the north east the then east india company opposed it and that so effectually that their high mightinesses refused to grant what the merchants requested  at that time it was talked of in holland as a matter of no difficulty to sail to japan by the way of greenland and it was publicly asserted and believed that several dutch ships had actually done it the merchants being required to verify this fact desired that the journals of the greenland squadron of      might be produced in seven of which there was notice taken of a ship which that year had sailed as high as the latitude of    and three journals of that ship being produced they all agreed as to one observation taken by the master august        in    degrees    minutes north  but a proof incontestible is the testimony of captain hudson who sailed in   0  to the latitude of    degrees  0 minutes north where he arrived on the   th of july the weather being then pretty warm  add to all these that the dutch who were employed in    0 in endeavoring to find a northeast passage advanced within a very few degrees of that open sea which is now commonly navigated by the russians and which would infallibly have brought them to the coasts of china and japan had they persevered in the course they were pursuing  it does not appear however from any authentic accounts that we can collect that any voyage professedly for the discovery of a northeast passage has been undertaken by either public or private adventurers in england since that of capt wood in the year    0 till the present year and it is more than probable that if the russian discoveries on the north of asia had never taken place the thoughts of finding a practicable passage from europe in that direction would have lain dormant for ever  but the vast and enterprizing genius of peter the great in forcing his subjects out of that obscurity in which they had long been involved has opened to the maritime powers new sources of commerce and furnished fresh motives for new enterprises from a people unacquainted with a vessel bigger than a bark and who knew no navigation but that of their own rivers that wonderful prince not only taught them the use of ships but instructed them in the true principles of building and equipping them nay he did more for after making himself known and admired throughout europe he conceived the design of opening a communication with the remotest parts of the globe and discovering to the world new countries which no european nation had ever yet explored  with this design he planned one of the boldest enterprises that ever entered into the heart of man and though he did not survive to see it executed the glory of the achievement is wholly his  the country of kamschatka was as much unknown to his predecessors as it was to the rest of the civilized nations of the earth yet he formed the design of making that savage country the center of the most glorious achievements  it was in the last year of this great monarchs life that he commissioned capt behring to traverse the wild and then almost desolate country of siberia and to continue his route to kamtschatka where he was to build one or more vessels in order to discover whether the country toward the north of which at that time they had no distinct knowledge was a part of america or not and if it was his instructions authorized him to endeavor by every possible means to seek and cultivate the acquaintance of some european people and to learn from them the state of the country at which he should arrive if he failed in this he was to make such discoveries as circumstances should present and commit to writing the result of his observations for the use of his imperial master  to enter minutely into the particulars of capt behrings journey and voyage would carry us beyond the limits prescribed for this introduction let it suffice to say that after surmounting incredible difficulties and suffering hardships which none but a russian could have survived he executed his commission successfully and returned to petersburg in safety after an absence of five years in which time besides his voyage by sea he had traveled in going and returning eighteen thousand miles by land  it is from the second enterprises of this astonishing man and from the subsequent voyages of the russians that we are able to ascertain the existence of a northeast passage and it is from thence and from the late voyage of capt phipps that we think we may fairly infer the practicability of it  it was some time about the year    0 that capt behring embarked on his second voyage from kamtschatka of which all that we know is that he sailed southward to the isles of japan and from thence eastward about  0 leagues at that distance from japan he discovered land which he coasted northwest still approaching to the northeast cape of asia which he doubled and named cape shelvghenski not daring to land till he arrived at the mouth of a great river where sending his boats with most of his crew on shore they never more returned being either killed or detained by the inhabitants which made his discovery incomplete for not having men sufficient left to navigate the ship she went on shore on an uninhabited island where the captain unfortunately died  from this voyage however we learn that the sea from the northeast cape of kamtschatka is open to the isles of japan and from a subsequent account of russian voyages published in the philosophical transactions from a paper communicated by the celebrated euler it appears that they passed along in small vessels coasting between nova zembla and the continent at diverse times in the middle of summer when those seas were open the first expedition was from the river oby latitude    degrees north longitude    degrees east from london and at the approach of winter the vessels sheltered themselves by going up the janiska the mouth of which is marked in our maps in latitude  0 degrees north and in longitude    degrees east from whence the next summer they proceeded to the mouth of the lena in latitude    degrees north and in longitude     degrees into which they again retired for the winter season the third expedition was from the mouth of this river to the farthest north cape of asia in    degrees of north latitude and in     degrees of east longitude from london thus the russians having passed between the continent and nova zembla and sailed as far as the easternmost north cape and the english and dutch having repeatedly sailed through the straits that divide nova zembla from the continent nothing can be a plainer demonstration of the reality of a northeast passage than the sum of the voyages here enumerated when added together the english and dutch sail to wygatz or the strait of nova zembla the russians sail from wygatz to the north cape of asia and behring from the north cape to japan this is an incontrovertible demonstration yet it is obvious that this course can never be practicable to ships employed in trade the russians by taking the advantage of an open sea and mild weather in three years time accomplished but part of a voyage which by the cape of good hope may be made in less than one who therefore would run the hazard of so desperate a passage for the sake of reaping imaginary advantages by an intercourse with savages who for aught we know have nothing to exchange for european commodities but the skins of bears or the bones of monsters  but though the passage to the northern countries of the east was known to be impracticable to european navigators in this direction it was worthy the greatness of a maritime people to endeavor to determine the possibility of attaining the same end by another course  the miscarriage and death of barentz and the shipwreck of capt wood had left the question undetermined whether the regions adjoining to the pole are land or water frozen or open sea the advantages from this discovery besides the glory resulting from it had the decision terminated in favor of navigation would have been immensely great to have opened a new chanel of commerce at a time when our trade is languishing would have revived the drooping hopes of our manufacturers and retained at home the numerous emigrants who for want of employment in their own country are seeking new habitations and new means of living in remote settlements of the certainty of which they have no experience  it must be acknowledged to the lasting honor of the noble lord who presides at the head of the admiralty board and who patronized the undertaking that the means to render it successful was in every respect proportioned to the importance of the discovery  the vessels that were made choice of were the properest that could be devised bomb ketches are in the first instance stoutly built and not being over large are best adapted for navigating seas that are known to abound with shoals and covered rocks these vessels besides their natural strength were sheathed with plank of seasoned oak three inches thick to fortify them against the shocks and pressure of the ice that in their progress they must infallibly encounter they were besides furnished with a double set of ice poles anchors cables sails and rigging to provide against the terrible effects of the severe and tempestuous weather that frequently happens in high latitudes even in the middle of the most temperate seasons  nor was his lordship less careful to provide for the comfortable subsistence of the men than for the preservation of their lives by his wise directions in equipping their ships his first care was to issue orders for killing and curing a sufficient quantity of beef and pork in the best manner possible that their provisions might be good and fresh and his next to cause one hundred buts of porter to be brewed with the best malt and hops that they might have proper drink to fortify them against the rigor of the climate they were about to pass their pease oatmeal rice and molossus were all provided with equal care and when all things were in readiness the beer was stowed in the holds and the vacancies filled up with coals which served as ballast that firing might not be wanting to warm and dry them when cold or wet with labor or with watching add to this that a double quantity of spirits were put on board with a large proportion of wine vinegar mustard etc etc and what we believe was never before thought of in the fitting out of any kings ships a considerable quantity of tea and sugar for the sick in case any should be seized with that dreadful disorder which rendered ship provisions loathsome to capt jamess men who were constrained to winter in charlton island in      these men fell sick and had sore mouths and could neither eat beef pork fish nor potage the surgeon was every morning and evening obliged to pick their teeth and cut away the pieces of rotten flesh from their gums yet they could eat nothing but bread pounded in a mortar and fried in oil on which they subsisted for several months in case of accidents of this kind and that tea should fail to answer the purposes of nourishment a quantity of portable soup was likewise provided and to complete the whole a stock of warm clothing was laid in consisting of six fearnought jackets for each man two milled caps two pair of fearnought trowsers four pair of milled stockings and an excellent pair of boots with a dozen pair of milled mitts two cotton shirts and two handkerchiefs  thus equipped and provided the command of the race horse was given to the hon constantine phipps as commodore and that of the carcarse to capt skiffington lutwych the first mounting eight six pounders and fourteen swivels burden three hundred and fifty tons the latter four six pounders and fourteen swivels burden three hundred tons  thus being premised let us now proceed to the journal of the voyage  journal of a voyage to discover the north east passage under the command of the hon commodore phipps and capt skiffington lutwych in his majestys ships race horse and carcass bombs all things being now in readiness the officers on board and the men paid their bountymoney of three pounds per man according to his majestys royal proclamation for the encouragement of those who should voluntarily enter to undertake the voyage on the  d of june      the commodore made the signal to weigh but previous to their departure the carcass having been judged too deep to navigate those heavy seas through which she was to pass the captain obtained leave from the board of admiralty to reland ten of her compliment of men and to put ashore six of the eight sixpounders with which she was equipped with a quantity of provisions proportioned to the number of men that it had been thought proper to discharge  on friday the  th being off sheerness the wind west by north and a fresh breeze they took their departure and continued their voyage without any material occurrence happening till tuesday the   th when the commodore made the signal to lie to they were then off brassey island and many fishingboats from shetland being in sight the men were invited on board and some fish purchased of them at a cheap rate  on the   th they took a new departure from shetland but the day following the fog thickened so much that it almost approached to total darkness during the continuance of the fog the commodore kept firing guns and beating drums to prevent the carcass from losing company as it was impossible that one could see the other at a ships length it was found the more necessary to repeat and return the firing lest they should run foul of each other before they could be apprized of their danger about five in the morning the mist cleared up and about nine the commodore being in sight made the signal to the carcass to steer northeast they were then in latitude  0 degrees    minutes north by observation the north end of shetland island bearing north by west one half west seven or eight leagues  on the   th they observed a sail to the northeast which the commodore brought to and spoke with the breeze fresh the weather hazy and the wind variable the carcass carried away her maintopmast studding sail yard which however was very soon supplied latitude this day by observation    degrees    minutes north  friday the   th being in the latitude of    degrees   minutes north the clothing allowed by the government of which notice has already been taken in the introduction was delivered out and officers as well as men received their full proportion this day the weather continued as before  saturday the   th the weather varied to every point of the compass the commodore brought to and spoke with the carcass made sail about three in the morning and at nine a large swell tacked and stood to the eastward latitude    degrees   minute north longitude from london    minutes west  sunday the  0th they pursued their course to the eastward with the wind northwest but variable high breezes and clear air they were now within the polar circle and at midnight had an observation of the sun and found their latitude    degrees    minutes north sounded on board the commodore with a lead of one hundred weight and a line of seven hundred and eighty fathom to which was fastened a thermometer of lord george cavendishs construction they found no bottom but the water was eleven degrees colder at that depth than on the surface the carcass sounded with four hundred and fifty fathoms only  monday    light breezes and cloudy weather they observed a whale on the northeast quarter the first they had yet seen in the north seas the weather now began to set in severe the nights cold and the days cloudy the commodore observing a whaling snow with hamborough colors flying fired a shot and brought her to she happened to be homeward bound with seals and mr wyndham a gentleman of fortune who had embarked on board the commodore with a view to prosecute the voyage finding nothing but foul weather and heavy seas to gratify his curiosity and being withal unable to endure the sea sickness took passage on board the hamburgher in order to return home and having taken leave of his friends by wishing them a happy voyage the snows boat took him on board about seven in the morning and at eight the commodore and carcass pursued their voyage  tuesday    the articles of war were read on board the carcass the weather began to be piercing cold they had reached the  0th degree of north latitude in a course nearly north being only    minutes to the eastward of london and from their leaving shetland to this day they had seen nothing remarkable nor had any accident befallen either of the map of spitsbergen spitsbergen or new greenland ships worth relating except that of now and then snapping a rope or breaking a yard incidents easily repaired this day it poured with rain the air was thick and the rain froze as it fell saw a large ship to the northwest standing southward but wanting no information that she could give they pursued their voyage without speaking to her  wednesday    the rain continued the weather hazy heard three guns fire at a distance but saw no ship or other object the whales are here in no great plenty and few ships appear in the open sea in pursuit of them they generally at this season frequent the bays and creeks near the shore and only break away when they are pursued or wounded  on thursday the   th the commodore changed his course to east northeast and on the   th they were in latitude    degrees   minutes north and in   degrees    minutes east longitude from london served out to the ships company plenty of mustard pepper vinegar etc the weather extremely cold and variable at eight in the evening thick fog at two in the morning fresh breezes at eight clear weather at eleven squally and at noon calm with sleet and snow  on saturday the   th at midnight they had an observation and found themselves in latitude    degrees    minutes north fresh gales sometimes rain sleet and snow at seven in the morning clear weather and an open sea  sunday    light airs from the southward and cloudy weather much warmer than the preceding day it is remarkable that the vicissitudes of heat and cold are more frequent here than in the more southerly latitudes it often changes from temperate to extreme cold and that suddenly  it should seem likewise that the ice frequently changes its place in this latitude or that it is more solid near land than in the open sea for on the   d of june      capt wood being more to the eastward fell in with ice right ahead not more than a league distant he steered along it thinking it had openings but found them to be bays he sounded and found ground at one hundred and fiftyeight fathom soft green oar in some places he found pieces of ice driving off a mile from the main body in strange shapes resembling ships trees buildings beasts fishes and even men the main body of ice being low and craggy he could see hills of a blue color at a distance and valleys that were white as snow in some places he observed drift wood among the ice some of the ice he melted and found it fresh and good this navigator never could advance farther to the north but in seeking to penetrate the ice was shipwrecked as has been already related in the introduction he therefore judged the ice impenetrable and that land or ice surrounded the pole our navigators found also much wood in this latitude floating about the ships and saw great flocks of birds  monday    the weather altered the wind west fresh breezes with rain and sleet latter part thick fog  tuesday    being in latitude    degrees north and in longitude   degrees    minutes east from london came in sight of land when the ships brought to and the captains held a consultation concerning their future course the appearance of the land lay from eastsoutheast to northeast and this day they spoke with the marquis of rockingham greenlandman who by their reckoning were then in latitude    degrees  0 minutes north though by that of the commodore their latitude was only    degrees   minutes this difference it it probable arises from not making the proper allowance for refraction in this high latitude the greenlandman presented each of the commanders with a deer and a half which they found wellflavoured venison though not over fat he likewise informed that he had just come from the ice and that the day before three whalers had been crushed to pieces by its closing upon them suddenly  wednesday  0 pursued their course cloudy weather half past four in the morning sounded one hundred and twelve fathoms soft blue mud at this time black point so called from its dark appearance bore northeast by east three quarters east at the distance of seven or eight leagues at half past seven in the morning saw two sail in the northwest quarter at half past twelve tacked and stood to the east sounded and found ground at one hundred and fifteen fathom  thursday july   light breezes and clear weather at midnight the sun as bright as at noon day black point east one half south distant seven leagues at three in the morning made charless island and at nine saw a sail to the westward whaleing they were then in latitude    degrees    minutes north by observation sounded and found the same depth as before  friday   light airs and moderate weather lay to and took the altitude of a mountain which they named mount parnassus found it from the level of the sea to be three thousand nine hundred and sixty feet high covered with snow and at a distance resembling an ancient building with something like a turret atop the foot of this mountain with the hills adjoining have sometimes a very fiery appearance and the ice and snow on their sides resembling trees and shrubs glissen with a brilliancy that exceed the splendour of the brightest gems when this happens a violent storm generally succeeds here they shot some sea fowl but of an oily taste  saturday   proved a perfect calm they spoke with a hollander who foretold that a degree or two farther north was the utmost extent of their progress this season having doubled cape cold they anchored in fifteen fathom water about three miles from the land and sent the boats ashore for water which they found in abundance pouring down in little streams from the rocks at five in the afternoon by the mean of four azimuths the variation was found to be    degrees    minutes west sounded and found only sixtyfive fathoms soft brown mud mount parnassus eastnortheast three or four leagues  among other reasons which capt wood gave for wishing to be employed on the discovery of the northeast passage one was that he might have an opportunity of approaching the pole in order to settle an hypothesis which he had long framed whereby the inclination of the magnetical needle under the horizon in all latitudes and in all longitudes with the variation of the compass might be exactly determined this navigator imagined two magnetical poles to exist and that by approaching the one he should be able to determine the action of the other it does not appear that he ever explained his hypothesis and there never has been but one man whose name was williams since his time who pretended to know any thing of the matter  saturday

pieces of ice against each other which is heard at many leagues distance hacluits headland southeast by south distance six or seven leagues  tuesday   proved very foggy the breezes slight and islands of ice beginning to appear at three in the afternoon the commodore hauled up from a large body of packed ice and the fog thickening both ships kept firing volleys of small arms to prevent their losing company at half past ten in the evening the extremes of the ice stretching from northwest to eastnortheast the commodore bore away and at half past twelve lost sight of it at half past one in the morning heard a violent surf to the southeast at two tacked and stood to the westward at half past five the fog gathering they began firing volleys of small arms at six saw the ice stretching from east by south to north by east and at seven was within sight of land at ten cloven cliff stood eastsoutheast distant about five or six leagues  wednesday the  th the weather cloudy they found themselves beset among the loose ice which increasing continually gave them incredible trouble observing that it thickened to the eastward they hauled up and stood to the westward but in tacking they were in danger of running foul it was with difficulty they could keep any course for the driffs of ice came so thick as to whirl the ships about as if in a whirlpool  thursday   the weather still remaining cloudy and the wind variable both ships still were entangled in the ice and the carcass being driven to leeward hoisted out her longboat to tow up with the commodore but the ice closing very fast it was impossible for the boats to live orders were then given to tack and stand to the southward but the ships not being able to make head against the accumulation of ice that continually gathered round them were under a necessity of applying to their iceanchors and poles in order to warp through it at half past eight in the evening the ice beginning to open they again hoisted out their boats and with difficulty towed the ships round a cape of ice projecting from the main body and at last got clear at ten the boats were hoisted on board in extricating themselves from this dangerous situation the race horse had her best boweranchor snapt in the shank close to the stock and the carcass lost her starboard bumpkin and headrails  it frequently happens that ships beset among the ice in the manner above related perish by being dashed to pieces against the solid fields of ice or crushed by the broken pieces crowding upon one another and rising so fast about the ship as to exceed the height of her sides and then there is no escaping they were told by some experienced seamen that the ice rises out of the sea as high sometimes as mountains and that several of these mountains by striking together and coalescing form these islands of ice that are frequently seen in the lower latitudes driving up and down the sea as the wind and tides direct them  the greatest danger to be apprehended is however from the loose ice for the whalers often moor their ships to the solid fields of ice that at certain seasons seem to rest upon the earth and appear fixed to it and there find the best fishing in such situations it often happens that little or no loose ice is to be seen yet presently upon a change of wind or a view of the whale fishery the blowing of a storm it shall pour in upon them so suddenly that they sometimes perish in it it is not possible to account for the astonishing quantity that will gather in this manner in less than an hours time  though it seems to be agreed that many of the largest fields of ice are frozen to the depth of the sea in which they are found and that they are bedded on the solid earth yet it is equally certain that they are often rent asunder by the raging billows and that in breaking they produce the most terrifying noise in nature nay it is asserted that the clashing of the pieces of loose ice against each other on any extraordinary agitation of the waves is attended with a roaring so loud that a man who is near it can hardly hear the sound of his own voice  friday the  th they hauled up to the westward and lost sight one of the other but about nine next morning they came in sight and joined company the weather being now piercing cold the people had an additional quantity of porter and brandy delivered to them two quarts of porter and a pint of brandy being now every mans daily allowance  saturday july the  0th the breeze fresh and the weather cloudy they sailed between numberless pieces of ice among which they saw several whales but none of the whalers in pursuit of them the ice now becoming solid and compact they found it impracticable to continue their course and the discovery of a passage to the pole in that direction upon holding a consultation appearing impracticable to every officer on board of both ships the commodore at seven in the evening hauled close to the wind and the carcass as soon as she could extricate herself followed his example the weather continuing foggy with rain and snow the sailors were almost worn out with turning and winding and although they used the utmost precaution in working through the narrows yet they could not always avoid striking against the mountains that every where surrounded them during this nights work they steered a hundred different courses to follow the channels  sunday    having worked out of the ice they sailed along the main body which appeared perfectly solid and compact without any passage or inlet this immense mass of ice extended northeast as far as they could see from the masthead and no doubt might be a continuation of that in which they were engaged a few days before the sea was now tolerably clear for they met with no more fields and only a few detached islands at half past one in the morning they saw the land from south by west to southsoutheast at three in the morning they tacked cloven cliff bearing southsoutheast six miles at seven tacked again at eight the commodore bore away and the carcass stood after him cloven cliff south one half west two or three leagues latitude    degrees    minutes north  monday    at eight in the evening cloven cliff bearing westsouthwest four or five miles they sounded in fifteen fathoms water and found a rocky bottom saw several english and dutch greenlanders at anchor in the norways that being their rendezvous to the northward they never choose to proceed farther here they found the current setting so fast to eastward that they were forced to come to an anchor to keep from drifting on the ice the swell from westward being so great that had that happened it would of consequence have staved the ships at five in the morning a breeze from northnortheast springing up they weighed and made sail at eight hacluits headland westsouthwest one half west six or seven leagues at noon latitude  0 degrees   minutes north  tuesday    the weather being clear and calm and a strong easterly current setting in at eight in the evening they came to with their stream anchors and hausers in forty fathoms water but at nine a breeze springing up from the eastward they weighed and next day came to an anchor in smearingburgh harbor cloven cliff east one half south one mile west point of voogle land northnorthwest one half west distant one mile and a half soundings fifteen fathom sandy bottom  here they remained between five and six days to take in fresh water during which time our journalist was employed in surveying the country which to a stranger had a very awful and romantic appearance  the country is stoney and as far as can be seen full of mountains precipices and rocks between these are hills of ice generated as it should seem by the torrents that flow from the melting of the snow on the sides of those towering elevations which being once congealed are continually increased by the snow in winter and the rain in summer which often freezes as soon as it falls by looking on these hills a stranger may fancy a thousand different shapes of trees castles churches ruins ships whales monsters and all the various forms that fill the universe of the icehills there are seven that more particularly attract the notice of a stranger these are known by the name of the seven iceburgs and are thought to be the highest of the kind in that country when the air is clear and the sun shines full upon these mountains the prospect is inconceivably brilliant they sometimes put on the bright glow of the evening rays of the setting sun when reflected upon glass at his going down sometimes they appear of a bright blue like sapphire and sometimes like the variable colors of a prism exceeding in luster the richest gems in the world disposed in shapes wonderful to behold all glittering with a luster that dazzles the eye and fills the air with astonishing brightness  smearingburgh harbor where they landed was first discovered by the dutch here they erected sheds and conveniences for boiling the oil from the fat of the whales instead of barrelling it up to be boiled at home here also allured by the hope of gain they built a village and endeavored to fix a colony but the first settlers all perished in the ensuing winter the remains of the village may be traced to this day and their stoves kettles kardels troughs ovens and other implements remained in the shape of solid ice long after the utensils themselves were decayed our voyagers were told that the russians have lately attempted the same thing and that ten out of fifteen perished last winter in this second attempt  where every object is new it is not easy for a stranger to fix which first to admire the rocks are striking objects before a storm they exhibit a fiery appearance and the sun looks pale upon them the snow giving the air a bright reflection their summits are almost always involved in clouds so that it is but just possible to see the tops of them some of these rocks are but one stone from bottom to top appearing like an old decayed ruin others consist of huge masses veined differently like marble with red white and yellow and probably were they to be sawed and polished would equal if not excel the finest egyptian marble we now so much admire perhaps the distance and danger of carrying large blocks of stones may be the reason that no trials have been made to manufacture them on the southerly and westerly sides of these rocks grow all the plants herbs and mosses peculiar to this country on the northerly and easterly sides the wind strikes so cold when it blows from these quarters that it perishes every kind of vegetable these plants grow to perfection in a very short time till the middle of may the whole country is locked up in ice about the beginning of july the plants are in flower and about the latter end of the same month or beginning of august they have perfected their seed the earth owes its fertility in a great measure to the dung of birds who build and breed their young here in the summer and in the winter repair to more favorable climates  the plants that are most common in spitsbergen are scurvy grass and crowsfoot there are besides small houseleak and a plant with aloeleaves an herb like stonecrop some small snakeweed mouseear woodstrawbery periwinkle and a herb peculiar to the country which they call the rockplant the leaves of this plant are in shape like a mans tongue above six feet long of a dull yellow color the stalk is round and smooth and of the same color with the leaf it rises tapering and smells like muscles it is an aquatic and rises in height in proportion to the depth of water in which it is found there are other plants and herbs but these are the chief of flowers the white poppy seems the principal  the rocks and precipices are full of fissures and clefts which afford convenient harbor for birds to lay their eggs and breed their young in safety most of these birds are waterfowl and seek their food in the sea some indeed are birds of prey and pursue and kill others for their own sustenance but these are rare the waterfowl eat strong and fishy and their fat is not to be endured they are so numerous about the rocks as sometimes to darken the air when they rise in flocks and they scream so horribly that the rocks ring with their noise  there are a few small birds like our snipes and a kind of snowbird but different from that found about hudsons bay the gentlemen shot some of the waterfowl but they were strong and illtasted  the icebird is a very beautiful little bird but very rare he is in size and shape like a turtledove but his plumage when the sun shines upon him is of a bright yellow like the golden ring in the peacocks tail and almost dazzles the eye to look upon it  the other inhabitants of this forlorn country are white bears deer and foxes how these creatures can subsist in the winter when the whole earth is covered with snow and the sea locked up in ice is hardly to be conceived it has been said indeed that when the ocean is all frozen over and no sustenance to be procured in this country they travel southerly to the warmer climates where food proper for them abounds in the immense forests of the northern continent but whoever considers the vast distance between spitsbergen and the nearest parts of the northern continent will be as much at a loss to account for the subsistence of these creatures in their journey as in the desolate region where they undoubtedly remain the bear is by far the best accommodated to the climate of which he is an inhabitant he is equally at home on land and water and hunts diligently for his prey in both in summer he finds plenty of food from the refuse of the whales seahorses and seals which is thrown into the sea by the whalers and cover the shores during the time of whaling and they have besides a wonderful sagacity in smelling out the carcases of the dead let them be ever so deeply buried in the earth or covered with stones the dead therefore that annually are buried here may contribute in some degree to the subsistence of a few of these creatures in winter but the question will still recur how the race of them subsisted before the whalefishery had existence and before men found the way to this inhospitable shore disquisitions of this kind as they are beyond the reach of human comprehension serve only to raise our admiration of that omnipotent being to whom nothing is impossible  these creatures as they differ in nothing but their color and size from those commonly shown in england need no description  the foxes differ little in shape from those we are acquainted with but in color there is no similitude their heads are black and their bodies white as they are beasts of prey if they do not provide in summer for the long recess of winter it were one would think almost impossible for them to survive yet they are seen in plenty though by their subtlety and swiftness they are not easy to be catched  the dutch seamen report that when they are hungry they will feign themselves dead and when the ravenous birds come to feed upon them they rise and make them their prey  but the most wonderful thing of all is how the deer can survive an eight months famine like ours they feed upon nothing that can be perceived but the vegetables which the earth spontaneously produces and yet for eight months in the year the earth produces neither plant herb shrub or blade of any kind of grass whatever they are besides but thinly clothed for so severe a climate and what seems still worse there is not a bush to be seen to shelter them within the distance that any man has yet discovered the means of their subsistence must therefore remain among the secrets of nature never to be disclosed as no human being can ever live here so as to be able to trace these creatures to their winters residence  amphibious creatures abound the most about the sounds and bays of spitsbergen and they seem best adapted to endure the climate these are the seals or sea dogs and morses or sea horses of which the whalers avail themselves when disappointed in completing their lading with the fat of whales  the seal is sufficiently known but the seahorse as it is a creature peculiar to high latitudes is therefore more rare it is not easy to say how he came by his name for there is no more likeness between a seahorse and a landhorse than there is between a whale and an elephant the seahorse is not unlike the seal in shape he has a large round head larger than that of a bull but shaped more like that of a pugdog without ears than any other animal we are acquainted with he tapers all the way down to the tail like the fish we call a lump and his size is equal to that of the largest sized ox his tusks close over his under jaw like those of a very old boar and are in length from one foot to two or more in proportion to the size and age of the animal that breeds them his skin is thicker than that of a bull and covered with short mousecoloured hair which is sleeker and thicker just as he happens to be in or out of season when he is caught his paws before and behind are like those of a mole and serve him for oars when he swims and for legs to crawl when he goes upon the ice or on shore he is a fierce animal but being unweildy when on land or on the ice is easily overcome  these animals are always found in herds sometimes of many hundreds together and if one is attacked the rest make a common cause and stand by one another till the last gasp if they are attacked in the water they will fight desperately and will even attempt the boats of their pursuers if any of them are wounded and not mortally some of them have been known to make holes in the bottom of the boat with their tusks in defense of their young their eyes are large and they have two holes in the upper part of the neck out of which they eject the water in like manner as it is ejected by whales  though the sea about spitsbergen is full of fish yet they rather appear to be designed by providence for the sustenance of one another than for the food of man the mackarel of which there are no great plenty seem not only to be the most wholesome and the most palatable but also the most beautiful they seem to be a different species to those caught upon our coasts the upper part of the back is of a vivid blue the other part as low as the belly of a gemlike green on an azure ground underneath the belly the color is a transparent white and the fins shine like polished silver all the colors glow when alive in the sea with such a richness that fancy can hardly form to itself any thing in nature more beautiful almost all the other fish on this coast are of an oily nature and of a very indifferent flavor  the saw or sword fish is remarkable not only for the oddity of his shape but also for his enmity to the whale this fish takes his name from a broad flat bone in length from two to four feet which projects from his nose and tapers to a point on each side it has teeth like a comb at the distance of a fingers breadth asunder he is also furnished with a double row of fins and is of astonishing strength in the water his length from ten to twenty feet he seems to be formed for war and war is his profession the conflict betwixt him and the whale is dreadful yet he never gives over till his sword is broken or he comes off victorious  the whale is a harmless fish and is never known to fight but in his own defense yet when he is exasperated he rages dreadfully though from his magnitude he may be called the sovereign of the seas yet like other sovereigns he is liable to be vexed and hurt by the meanest reptiles the whales louse is a most tormenting little animal its scales are as hard as those of our prawns its head is like the louses head with four horns two that serve as feelers the other two are hard and curved and serve as clenchers to fix him to the whale on his chest underneath he has two carvers like scythes with which he collects his food and behind these are four feet that serve him for oars he has moreover six other clenchers behind with which he can rivet himself so closely to his prey that he can no otherwise be disengaged but by cutting out the whole piece to which he is joined he is jointed on the back like the tail of a lobster and his tail covers him like a shield when he is feeding he fixes himself on the tenderest parts of the whales body between his fins on his sheath and on his lips and eats pieces out of his flesh as if eaten by vultures  they found no springs of fresh water in spitsbergen but in the valleys between the mountains are many little rills caused by the rain and melting of the snow in summer and from these rills the ships are supplied some are of opinion that this water is unwholesome but they are more nice than wise the whaling people have drank of it for ages and have found no ill effects from the use of it ice taken up in the middle of these seas and thawed yields also good fresh water  on board the race horse dr irvine the gentleman who received the premium by a grant of parliament for his discovery of an easy process for making salt water fresh at sea tried many experiments at spitsbergen and in the course of the voyage the result of which will appear at a proper time that gentleman had formed a project for preserving fleshmeat fresh and sweet in long voyages but it did not answer in this  in calm weather they remarked that the sea about the islands appeared uncommonly still and smooth that it was not suddenly moved at the first approach of blowing weather but that when the storm continued the waves swelled gradually and rose to an incredible height  these swelling waves successively follow one another and roll along before the wind foaming and raging in a frightful manner yet they are thought less dangerous than those that break short and are less mountainous  they observed likewise that the ice that rested on the ground was not stationary but that it changed place and they learnt also that in some seasons there was no ice where this season they were in danger of being embayed there does not however from thence appear the least reason to conclude that any practicable passage to the indian ocean can ever be found in this direction for were it certain that the seas were always open under the pole yet great bulwarks of ice evidently surround it sometimes at a less and sometimes at a greater distance moreover were it possible that chance should direct some fortunate adventurer to an opening at one time it would be more than a million to one if the same opening were passable to the next who should attempt it  there are many harbors about spitsbergen besides that of smearingburg where ships employed in the whale fishery take shelter in stormy weather and there are some islands such as charless island the clifted rock redhill hacluits headland etc that serve as landmarks by which seamen direct their course these islands are full of the nests of birds but their eggs are as nauseous as the flesh of the fowls that lay them the sailors sometimes eat them but they are filthy food even the geese and ducks on the neighboring islands eat fishy and strong  the air about spitsbergen is never free from isicles if you look through the sun beams transversely as you fit in the shade or where you see the rays confined in a body instead of dark motes as are seen here you see myriads of shining particles that sparkle like diamonds and when the sun shines hot as it sometimes does so as to melt the tar in the seams of ships when they lie sheltered from the wind these shining atoms seem to melt away and descend like dew  it is seldom that the air continues clear for many days together in this climate when that happens the whalers are generally successful there is no difference between night and day in the appearance of the atmosphere about spitsbergen one being as light as the other only when the sun is to the northward you may look at him with the naked eye as at the moon without dazzling the fogs here come on so suddenly that from bright sunshine you are presently involved in such obscurity that you can hardly see from one end of the ship to the other  while our journalist was busy in making his observations all belonging to the ships were differently engaged in one employment or other some in taking in water some in fishing some in hunting some in handing the sails and spreading them out to dry some in scrubbing the ship and some in viewing the country the commanders and officers with mr lion mr robinson etc busied themselves in making observations being furnished with an apparatus that is said to have cost at least one thousand five hundred pounds from such a set of instruments in the hands of the ablest observers the nation can boast some very considerable discoveries in the phenomena of the polar regions may be expected they landed their instruments in a small island in vogle sound and had several opportunities during their stay of using them to advantage having erected two tents the captains from the fishery frequently visited the observers and expressed their admiration not only at the perfection of the instruments but likewise at the dexterity with which they were accommodated  the ice began to set in apace yet the weather was hot the thermometer from fiftysix in the cabin rose to ninety in the open air it was still ten degrees higher on the top of a mountain to which it was carried the island on which the experiments were made they called marble island from the rock by which it is formed having watered and finished their observations the ships prepared to depart  monday july the   th the commodore made the signal to weigh at two in the afternoon the ships were under sail and as soon as they had made their offing stood to the eastward at three they tacked and steered northward and before four were again entangled among the loose ice through which they sailed directing their course along the main body which lay from northwest to south southeast  tuesday the  0th they continued their course along the ice but could discover no opening though they searched every creek and left no bay or turning unexamined this day they observed what the sailors call a mocksun a phenomenon well enough known in this climate hacluits headland bore southwest one half south fortysix leagues the weather cloudy with rain excessive cold thermometer    degrees    minutes  wednesday the   st the severity of the weather increasing an additional quantity of brandy was served out to the people and every comfortable refreshment afforded them that they themselves could wish or require the course of the ice lay this day northeast  thursday    nothing remarkable  friday the   d they saw land from east by south to southeast by south at four in the morning hacluits headland bore southeast ten leagues the wind variable and the weather cold with sleet and snow thermometer  0 degrees  sunday    they had gentle breezes with cloudy weather and were engaged among some pieces of ice separated from the main body which kept them continually tacking and luffing at length they entered among mountains and islands of ice which came upon them so fast that it was with the utmost difficulty they could proceed the carcass having several times struck against them with such violence as to raise her head four feet out of the water they now imagined from the solidity and extent of these islands that the late strong gales had caused a separation from the main body the commodore therefore changed his course with a strong gale to the eastward in the morning the weather became moderate  monday    at seven in the morning they came in sight of redhill a small mount which commands an open plain known by the name of deersfield by reason of its fertile appearance it being the only spot on which they saw no drifts of snow to the eastward lies muffins island here they sounded and found forty five fathom water rocky ground capt lutwich sent out the long boat with orders to sound along the shore and to examine the soil this island is about a mile long very low and looks at a distance like a black speck though the soil is mostly sand and loose stones and hardly so much as a green weed upon it yet it is remarkable for the number of birds that resort to it in summer to lay their eggs and breed their young and these not of one kind only but of many different sorts as geese ducks burgomasters icebirds malamucks kirmews rotgers and almost every other species of birds peculiar to the climate insomuch that the eggs were so numerous and lay so thick upon the ground that the men who landed found it difficult to walk without filling their shoes  while the crew of the boat ten in number with their valiant officer at their head were examining the island after having sounded the shores they observed two white bears making toward them one upon the ice the other in the water major buz for that was their officers traveling title like falstaff was always the boldest man in company over a cup of sack and minded killing a bear no more than killing a gnat but seeing the bears approach very fast especially that which came in the water he ordered his men to fire while yet the enemy was at a distance as he did not think it prudent to hazard the lives of his little company in close fight all of them pointed their muskets and some of the party obeyed orders but the greater part judging it safer to depend upon a reserved fire when they had seemingly discharged their pieces pretended to retreat the major a full fathom in the belly endeavored to waddle after his companions but being soon out of breath and seeing the bear that came in the water had just reached the shore thought of nothing now but falling the first sacrifice his hair already stood an end and looking behind him he saw the bear at no great distance with his nose in the air snuffing the scent he had all the reason in the world to believe it was him that he scented and he had scarce breath enough left to call to his men to halt in this critical situation he unfortunately dropped his gun and in stooping to recover it stumbled against a goosenest fell squash upon his belly into it and had very nigh smothered the dam upon her eggs the old saying is misfortunes seldom come alone before he could well rise the enraged gander came flying to the assistance of his halfsmothered consort and making a dart at the eye of the assailant very narrowly missed his mark but discharged his fury plump upon his nose the danger now being pressing and the battle serious the bear near and the gander ready for a second attack the men who had not fled far thought it high time to return to the relief of their leader overjoyed to see them about him but frighted at the bear just behind him he had forgot the gander that was over his head against which one of the men having levelled his piece fired and he fell dead at the majors feet animated now by the death of one enemy he recovered his gun and faced about to assist in the attack of the second by this time the bear was scarce ten yards from him and beginning to growl the major just in the instant was seized with a looseness dropped his accoutrements and fell back that he might not be in the way of his party to impede the engagement in the hurry he was in for in a man of such valor we must not say the fright he entangled his buttons and not being able to hold any longer he filled his breeches the crew in an instant had brought down the bear and now it was time for their leader to do something great having recovered his arms and seeing the poor beast grovelling on the ground and growling out his last like a ram in a pinfold making a short race backwards in order to redouble his force he came with nine long strides forwards and with the strength and fierceness of an enraged bull thrust his lance full four feet deep in the dying bears belly and now says the major cocking his hat have not i done for the bear bravely the sailors who are always in a good humor upon such occasions but captain said they you have but half done your work you have another bear to kill yet the major whose situation began to be troublesome content with the honor he had already acquired my lads said he as i have been the death of one bear sure six of you may kill the other so ordering four of them to row him on board he left the remaining six to kill the other bear  on this island two bears were killed and a seahorse the seahorse made a desperate defense being attacked in the water and had there been only one boat engaged in the combat he certainly would have come off victorious but the crew of the racehorse having learnt that there were bears and seahorses on this little spot were willing to share in the sport of hunting them as well as in the pleasure of tasting their flesh they accordingly landed in their boats and came in good time to assist in pursuing the conquest it happened however that their ammunition being almost spent one great bear came up to revenge the death of his fellows and advanced so furiously growling and barking that he put the whole company to flight and some of them it is said had no great reason to laugh at the major  on sounding the shores they remarked that when the north islands bear north fortyfive east seven or eight leagues and redhill east by south five miles there is generally from twentyfive to thirty fathom hard ground but that closer on shore when redhill bears east onefourth south about one mile it increases to one hundred and fifteen fathom with soft black mud the current about one mile an hour to the northeast  tuesday    the air being perfectly serene and the weather moderate the fishes seemed to enjoy the temperature and to express it by their sporting the whales were seen spouting their fountains toward the skies and the fin fish following their example they likewise this day saw dolphins the whole prospect in short was more pleasing and picturesque than they had yet beheld in this remote region the very ice in which they were beset looked beautiful and put forth a thousand glittering forms and the tops of the mountains which they could see like sparkling gems at a vast distance had the appearance of so many silver stars illuminating a new firmament but this flattering prospect did not continue long by an accurate observation they were now in latitude  0 degrees    min north and in longitude    degrees  0 min east from london and in sight of seven islands to the north to which they directed their course  wednesday    they had fresh easterly breezes which from moderate weather the day before changed to piercing cold at midnight the west end of weygate straits bore south by east so that they were now in the very spot where barentz had supposed an opening would be found into the polar sea yet so far from it they could discover nothing from the masthead but a continued continent of solid ice except the islands already mentioned on this ice however there were many bears some of which came so near the ships as to be shot dead with small arms these bears are very good eating and where no better is to be purchased the whalers account them as good as beef they are many of them larger than the largest oxen and weigh heavier in many parts of their body they are musket proof and unless they are hit on the open chest or on the flank a blow with a musket ball will hardly make them turn their backs some of the bears killed in these encounters weighed from seven to eight hundred weight and it was thought that the bear that routed the sailors on muffins island could not weigh less than a thousand weight he was indeed a very monster  thursday    sailing among innumerable islands of ice they found the main body too solid for the ships to make the least impression upon it and finding no opening the commodore resolved to send a party under the command of the first lieutenant to examine the land which at a distance appeared like a plain diversified with hills and mountains and exhibited in their situation a tolerable landscape  on trying the water it was less salt than any sea water they had ever tasted and they found likewise that the ice was no other than a body of congealed fresh water which they imagined had been frozen in the infancy of the earth  tuesday  0 the weather being clear they ran close to the main body of the ice and the sun continuing to shine made them almost forget the climate they were sailing in but it was not long before they had reason for severe recollection in coasting along they observed many openings and were in hopes from their distant appearance that a passage might be made between them but upon trial it was found as the dutch fishermen had foretold that these appearances were deceitful at one in the morning fine clear sunshine they sounded in sixteen fathom water and found small stones at bottom they were then about four miles from the northeast part of the northernmost land the easternmost land in sight distant about five or six leagues  saturday    at midnight the easternmost land in sight lay eastnorth east one half east which they could not make out to be an island they rather judged it to be a continent but found it impossible to determine with certainty as it lay beyond their reach at nine in the morning the carcass hoisted out her cutter and filled her empty watercasks with water from the ice on this ice he great quantities of snow and as soon as a pit is dug it fills with fine soft clear water not inferior to that of many land springs at noon they sounded in ninety five fathoms the ground soft mud this day a bear came over the ice to visit them the first they had seen since they left muffins island they saluted him with a volley of small arms and he returned the compliment by turning his back upon them their longitude was this day    degrees    minutes east by timekeeper thermometer fortyfive  sunday august   proved a day of trial lying too among the close ice with the loose ice driving fast to shore the commodore was desirous of surveying the westernmost of the seven islands which appeared the highest in order to judge from the prospect on the hills of the possibility of proceeding farther on the discovery with this view they carried out their iceanchors and made both ships fast to the main body a practice very common with the fishing ships that annually frequent those seas of the reconnoitring party were the captains the second lieutenants one of the mathematicians the pilots and some chosen sailors selected from both ships they set out about two in the morning and sometimes sailing sometimes drawing their boats over the ice they with difficulty reached the shore where the first objects they saw were a herd of deer so very tame that they seemed as curious to gaze at the strangers as the stranges were pleased to see them for they came five or six together so near that they might have been killed with the thrust of a bayonet a proof that animals are not naturally afraid of man till by the fate of their associates they are taught the danger of approaching them a proof too that animals are not destitute of reflection otherwise how should they conclude that what has befallen their fellow animals will certainly happen to them if they run the like risque the gentlemen however suffered only one of these fearless innocents to be fired at and that was done by a sailor when they were absent on observation  on this island they gathered some scurvy grass and in many places they could perceive the sides of the hills covered with the verdure on which these deer undoubtedly fed  after having ascended the highest hills on the seacoast and taken a view of the country and the ocean all round the gentlemen descended and about five in the afternoon embarked again on their return to the ships at which they arrived safe about ten after an absence of twenty hours they were greatly disappointed by the haziness of the weather on the tops of the mountains which confined the prospect and prevented their taking an observation with the instruments they had carried with them for that purpose  there is here a small variation in the journals of the two ships that kept on board the commodore making the distance between the island and the ships near twenty miles the other only five leagues which might easily happen as the ships shifted their stations with the main body of ice sometimes driving northwest sometimes the contrary course as the wind and tides happened to sit  their situation now began to be serious and it was discovered too late that by grappling to the ice as practiced by the greenlandmen they had endangered the loss of the ships the loose ice closing so fast about them that they found it absolutely impossible to get them disengaged and there was besides great reason to fear that one or both would soon be crushed to pieces great minds are ever most distinguished by their expedients on the most alarming occasions the commodore set all hands to work to form a dock in the solid ice large enough to moor both ships and by the alacrity with which that service was performed the ships were preserved from the danger of immediate destruction  the ships being thus far secured the officers pilots and masters were all summoned on board the commodore to consult on what further was to be done in their present unpromising situation when it was unanimously agreed that their deliverance was hopeless and that they must either provide to winter upon the adjacent islands or attempt to launch their boats into the open sea which was already at a considerable distance for the loose ice had poured into the bay in which they were at anchor with so much rapidity and in such astonishing quantities that the open sea was already far out of sight before any thing farther was undertaken the men were ordered to their quarters that they might refresh themselves with sleep  while their commanders preserve their fortitude the sailors never lose their courage they rose in the morning with as much alacrity and unconcern as if they had been sailing with a fine breeze in the british channel  august   it was now thought advisable to make one desperate attempt to extricate the ships by cutting a channel to the westward into the open sea the scooping out the dock with so much expedition by a party only of one ship raised high expectations of what might be performed by the united labors of both the crews no body of men ever undertook a work of such difficulty with so much cheerfulness and confidence of success as the sailors observed on this occasion their icesaws axes sledges poles and the whole group of seatools were in an instant all employed in facilitating the work but after cutting through blocks of solid ice from eight to fifteen feet deep and coming to others of many fathoms that exceeded the powers of man to separate that was laid aside as a hopeless project and another more promising though not less laborious adopted in its room  on the  d of august after the men had again refreshed themselves with sleep it was resolved to fit up the boats belonging to both the ships with such coverings as were most easy to be accommodated and of lightest conveyance and by skating them over the ice endeavor to launch them in the open sea could this be effected they hoped that by sailing and rowing to the northernmost harbor of spitsbergen they might arrive at that island before the departure of the last ships belonging to the fishery for europe  while the boats were getting ready for this expedition a second party were dispatched to the island with orders to take the distance as exact as it was possible to the nearest open sea as all the people belonging to the ships were not to be engaged in these services those who were unemployed diverted themselves in hunting and killing the bears that now attracted perhaps by the savory smell of the provisions dressed on board the ships came every day over the ice to repeat their visits several of these were killed occasionally and this day they fought a seahorse in which engagement the second lieutenant of the carcass signalized his courage in a most desperate rencounter in which however he succeeded though his life was in imminent danger  on the  th the carpenters etc were still employed in fitting up the boats the pilots who the day before had been sent to make observations on the islands already mentioned made their report that the nearest water they had seen was about ten leagues to the westward that in their passage they had met with great numbers of spars or pine trees floating about the island some of them of considerable size with the bark rotted off and the bodies much wormeaten that there was neither tree nor shrub to be seen growing on any of the seven islands nor upon any land that they had yet discovered in that latitude nor for ten degrees farther south and that the trees they had seen must therefore have come from a great distance  though there is nothing now in this observation the like being annually observed by all the navigators who frequent those seas in the summer and who collect their wood from those drifts yet the country from whence they proceed has hitherto been thought a mystery but it being now certain that many of the great rivers that flow through the northernmost parts of russia empty themselves into this sea and that there is an open communication throughout the different parts of it at different seasons of the year there seems very little reason to doubt but that those trees are torn up by land floods and are precipitated into the sea by the rapidity of the streams  it has indeed been objected that all the wood that is found floating in this manner about the islands in high latitudes is to a piece barked and wormeaten and that if these trees were torn up and precipitated into the sea in the manner above supposed some of it would appear sound and unbarked as in its first state to this it may be answered that were the course of the tides to run as constantly to the northward as the course of the rivers runs into the sea this objection would be unanswerable but the very reverse is known to be the fact and that neither the winds nor the tides tend to the northwards for any considerable part of the year so that from the time these trees enter the ocean it must in the ordinary course of things be many ages before they can reach the latitudes in which they are now found because if they are driven northwards by the strength of a storm from the south they will be driven in another direction by the next storm that happens from another quarter and all the while the calm continues they will be driven to and fro by the tides which as has been observed seldom set long to the north therefore being in continual motion for ages or being cast upon the shore by tempests or high tides and lying there exposed to the air till tempests or high tides return them again to the ocean they will in a long progression of time be reduced to the state in which they are constantly found this solution is however offered with diffidence the fact is certain of much wood being annually found about the islands in question and it is now of little importance from whence it proceeds as a passage by the north east to china will probably never more be sought  on the  th they had gentle breezes but about four in the morning small sleet the ice still surrounding them and appearing to grow more and more solid and fixed those who had till now retained hopes that the southeast wind would again disunite its substance and open a passage for their deliverance began to despair as the wind had blown for twenty four hours from that quarter from which alone they could have relief and not the least alteration to be perceived the men however were as joyous as ever and showed not the least concern about the danger of their situation  early in the morning the man at the masthead of the carcass gave notice that three bears were making their way very fast over the ice and that they were directing their course toward the ship they had without question been invited by the scent of the blubber of the seahorse killed a few days before which the men had set on fire and which was burning on the ice at the time of their approach they proved to be a she bear and her two cubbs but the cubbs were nearly as large as the dam they ran eagerly to the fire and drew out from the flames part of the flesh of the seahorse that remained unconsumed and eat it voraciously the crew from the ship by way of diversion threw great lumps of the flesh of the seahorse which they had still left out upon the ice which the old bear fetched away singly laid each lump before her cubbs as she brought it and dividing it gave each a share reserving but a small portion to herself as she was fetching away the last piece they had to bestow they levelled their muskets at the cubbs and shot them both dead and in her retreat they also wounded the dam but not mortally it would have drawn tears of pity from any but unfeeling minds to have marked the affectionate concern expressed by this poor beast in the dying moments of her expiring young though she was sorely wounded and could but just crawl to the place where they lay she carried the lump of flesh she had fetched away as she had done the others before tore it in pieces and laid it down before them and when she saw that they refused to eat she laid her paws first upon one and then upon the other and endeavored to raise them up all this while it was pitiful to hear her moan when she found she could not stir them she went off and when she had got at some distance looked back and moaned and that not availing her to entice them away she returned and smelling round them began to lick their wounds she went off a second time as before and having crawled a few paces looked again behind her and for some time stood moaning but still her cubbs not rising to follow her she returned to them again and with signs of inexpressible fondness went round one and round the other pawing them and moaning finding at last that they were cold and lifeless she raised her head toward the ship and like caliban in the tempest growled a curse upon the murderers which they returned with a volley of musketballs she fell between her cubbs and died licking their wounds if what is related by a voyager of credit in the last century be true the filial fondness of these animals is no less remarkable than the maternal the young ones says he keep constantly close to the old ones we observed that two young ones and an old one would not leave one another for if one ran away it turned back again immediately as soon as it did hear the others in danger as if it would come to help them the old one ran to the young one and the young one to the old one and rather than they would leave one another they would suffer themselves to be all killed  friday the  th the weather calm but foggy and the winds variable they discovered that the drift of the ship with the whole body of ice inclined fast to the eastward and that they were already embayed in the very middle of the seven islands they therefore sent off the pilots of both ships with a party of sailors to the northernmost island to see what discoveries could be made from the promontories there they returned at night after a fatiguing journey with a dismal account that nothing was to be seen from thence but a vast continent of ice of which there was no end and that the thought of wintering in such a situation was more dreadful than that of perishing by instant death  saturday   the wind set in northnortheast veered to the north to the northeast and east piercing cold this day the boats were all brought in readiness on the ice fitted with weather clothes about thirteen inches above the gunnels in order to keep off the cold as much as possible if by good fortune they should be enabled to launch them in an open sea this day was employed chiefly in boiling provisions to put in the boats for the intended voyage in delivering out bags to the men to carry their bread and in packing up such necessaries as every one could take along with him for now every man was to be his own porter the necessary provisions and liquors being found load enough for the boats and twentyfive days bread load enough for each man this being adjusted when night approached they were all ordered on board to sleep  thursday   at six in the morning all hands were ordered to turn out and a detachment of fifty men from each ship headed by their respective officers were appointed to begin the hard task of hawling the lances along the ice the bravest and gallantest actions performed in war do not so strikingly mark the true character of a sea commander as the readiness and alacrity with which his orders are obeyed in times of imminent danger every one now strove who should have the honor to be listed in the band of haulers of whom the commodore took the direction leaving capt lutwych to take care of both the ships that if any favorable turn should happen in the disposition of the ice he might make use of the remaining part of both the crews to improve it upon a general consultation of officers previous to this undertaking it had been agreed and an order issued accordingly that no person on board of whatever rank should encumber himself with more clothes than what he wore upon his back upon this occasion therefore the officers dressed themselves in flannels and the common men put on the clothes which the officers had thrown off it was inconceivably laughable to see these motley bands yoked in their new harness and to say the truth there was not one solemn face among the two companies that headed by the commodore drew stoutly for the honor of their leader and that headed by their lieutenants had their music to play to them that they might dance it away and keep pace with the commander in chief indeed the officers who headed them were deservedly beloved as well as their commanders particularly lieutenant beard whose steady and uniform conduct in times of the greatest danger cannot be sufficiently admired or applauded neither swayed by passion nor disconcerted by the sudden embarrassments that often intervened his conduct was always calm and his orders resolute he never was heard during the whole voyage on the most pressing emergencies to enforce his commands with an oath or to call a sailor by any other than his usual name and so sensible were they of his manly behavior that when the ship was paid off at deptford they were only prevented by his most earnest request from stripping themselves to their shirts to cover the streets with their clothes that he might not tread in the dirt in going to take coach  in six hours with the utmost efforts of human labor they had only proceeded a single mile and now it was time for them to dine and recruit their almost exhausted spirits as the commodore had labored with them it was in character that he should dine with them also and an accident happened that made it necessary for him so to do the cook with his mates who were bringing the commodore and the officers their dinners under covers to keep out the cold after coming from a warm fireside had made a little too free with the brandy bottle before they set out and before they had got half way to the lances the liquor began to operate the cooks were sometimes very near boarding each other sometimes they hauled off and sometimes steered right ahead at length coming to a chasm or parting of the ice which they were obliged to leap down came the master cook with dish cover meat and all and what was still worse though it was not then thought of much value the commodores common service of plate which the cook carried for the officers to dine on fell in the chasm and instantly sunk to the bottom this accident brought the cook a little to himself and he now stood pausing whether he should jump down the gulf after the plate or proceed to the commodore to beg mercy and make his apology his mates persuaded him to the latter as the commodore was a kindhearted gemman and would never take a mans life away for a slip on the ice besides it was a great jump for a fat man and commodore they were sure had rather lose all the plate in the great cabin than lose cookie comforted a little by this speech the cook proceeded but let his mates go on first with what remained to carry the tidings of what befell the rest when the commodore had heard the story he judged how it was with them all but where is the cook said he to the mates he is crying behind an please your honor in the mean time the cook came up cook said the commodore bring me your dinner i will dine today with my comrades my dinner ay a pound of the flesh next my heart if your honor likes it the promptness of the reply showed the sincerity of the cooks good will and pleased the commodore better than a feast upon turtle he dismissed him with a smile and partook with the officers in what was left who made up their dinners with a mess from the common men  they had just begun to renew their labor when word was brought that the whole body of ice had changed its situation and was moving to the westward that the ships were both afloat and that the ice was parting the joy which this news diffused through the two companies of hawlers is easier to conceive than express they instantly shook off their harness ran to assist in working the ships and once more to resume their proper employments when they arrived at the ships captain lutwych who was no less beloved by his men than the commodore had by his example and his judicious directions done wonders both ships were not only afloat with their sails set but actually cut and warped through the ice near half a mile this ray of hope however was soon darkened the body of ice suddenly assumed its former direction to the eastward and closed upon them again as fast as ever while the ships remained in the ice dock they were lashed together for their greater security but now being launched and afloat the ice pressed upon them with such weight that it was every moment expected that the hawser would break that held them together orders were therefore given that the hawser should be slackened and the ships released  for the remainder of the evening and till two in the morning the drift continued eastward and all that while the ships were in danger of being crushed by the closing of the channel in which they rode they had now drifted two miles to the eastward the men were worn out with fatigue in defending the ships with their icepoles from being engulphed and now nothing but scenes of horror and perdition appeared before their eyes but the omnipotent in the very moment when every hope of deliverance from their own united endeavors had relinquished them interposed in their favors and caused the winds to blow and the ice to part in an astonishing manner rending and cracking with a tremendous noise surpassing that of the loudest thunder at this very instant the whole continent of ice which before was extended beyond the reach of sight from the highest mountains moved together in various directions splitting and dividing into vast bodies and forming hills and plains of various figures and dimensions all hearts were now again revived and the prospect of being once more released from the frozen chains of the north inspired the men with fresh vigor every officer and every idler on board labored now for life the sails were all spread that the ships might have the full advantage of the breeze to force them through the channels that were already opened and to help them like wedges to rend the clefts that were but just cracking  while the major part of the crews were employed in warping the ships with iceanchors axes saws and poles a party from both ships were dispatched to launch the boats this was no easy task to accomplish the ice though split in many thousand pieces was yet frozen like an island round the lances and though it was of no great extent yet the boats were of a weight hardly to be moved by the small force that could be spared to launch them they were besides by the driving of the ice at more than five miles distance from the ships and at this time no channels of communication were yet opened but providence was manifest even on this occasion for the island on which the lances stood parted while the men were hauling them and by that lucky circumstance they were launched with great facility without the loss of a man though the ice cracked as it were under their feet  the people on board had not been able to force their way with the ships much more than a mile when the party in the lances joined them and now excited by what curiosity or instinct is not easy to determine several bears came posting over the ice to be spectators of their departure and advanced so near the ships that they might have been easily mastered had not the men been more seriously employed  this day they altered their soundings from thirty to fifty fathoms and from fifty to eighty and eightyfive fathoms  the breeze continuing fresh from eastsoutheast and east the ice seemed to open as fast as it had before closed when the wind blew westerly and from the north a strong presumptive proof of land to the eastward which stopping the current of the loose ice in driving from the north and west closes it in course and renders it compact on the contrary when the wind blows off the land and the current sets to the sea the loose ice being no longer opposed disperses itself again in the ocean where it again floats till the same cause produces the same effect if therefore the land which our voyagers saw on the  0th and which they could not determine with certainty to be an island should upon some future occasion be discovered to be a continent then the closing of the loose ice so suddenly about the seven islands and its crouding one piece upon another to a great height when violently agitated by tempests from the north or west will be fully and naturally accounted for  tuesday the  0th about two in the morning the fog being thick and the weather calm and the men very much fatigued they were ordered to their quarters to refresh themselves with sleep it was besides very cold and much rain fell and as the wind was variable they could make but little progress the ice in the morning early seemed rather to close upon them than to divide and being apprehensive for their boats they attempted to hoist the lances on board but that belonging to the carcass being either too unweildy or the men too much fatigued to effect it they slung her to the ships side  about eight the breeze sprung up fresh from the northeast exceedingly cold but opening the ice to the westward they then made all the sail they could driving with the loosening ice and parting it wherever it was moveable with their whole force toward noon they lost sight of the seven islands and in a very little while after to their great joy spitsbergen was seen from the masthead  wednesday    the men who with hard labor cold and watching were much dispirited on the prospect of a speedy deliverance and seeing the ice no longer adhere in immovable bodies began after a little refreshment to resume their wonted cheerfulness they had not till the second closing of the ice after the attempt to dig a passage through it had proved ineffectual and that the hauling the lances had been tried with little better success discovered the least despondency but when they had exerted their utmost efforts and providence which at first seemed to second their endeavors appeared to have forsaken them when their pilots had filled their minds with the terrors of their situation and their officers had given the ships and their most valuable effects over for lost the men then began to reflect on the hardships they were likely to suffer and to be impressed with the sense of their common danger their apprehensions however were but temporary and the moment they were released from their icey prison and that they were within sight of a clear sea their sorrow was changed to mirth and their melancholy to rejoicing festivity and jolity took place of abstinence and gloomy apprehensions and before they arrived at spitsbergen there was not a sailor on board with a serious face  the ice that had parted from the main body they had now time to admire as it no longer obstructed their course the various shapes in which the broken fragments appeared were indeed very curious and amusing one remarkable piece described a magnificent arch so large and completely formed that a sloop of considerable burden might have sailed through it without lowering her mast another represented a church with windows and pillars and domes and a third a table with icicles hanging round it like the fringes of a damask cloth a fertile imagination might here find entertainment enough for as has already been observed the similitude of all that art or nature has ever yet produced might here be fancied  they continued working all this day through the loose ice hacluits headland bearing south thirtynine west and in their course saw a dutch greenlandman in the southwest quarter  thursday the   th they cleared the ice and bore away with all sails set for the harbor of smearingburg in which they had before cast anchor at two in the afternoon they anchored in north bay the north part of vogle sound bearing north fortyfive east distance about four miles at half after four the commodore made the signal to weigh and at half past nine came to an anchor in their former station where they found four dutch greenlandmen lying in readiness to depart these dutchmen acquainted the commodore that all the english fishing ships set sail on the  0th of july the day to which they are obliged by contract to stay to entitle their owners to receive the bountymoney allowed by parliament for the encouragement of that fishery  about the same time the greatest part of the dutch set sail likewise from spitsbergen on their voyage home but it is a practice with these last to take it by turns to wait till the severity of the weather obliges them to leave the coast in order to pick up such men as may by accident have lost their ships in the ice and who notwithstanding may have had the good fortune to save their lives by means of their boats this is a very humane institution and does credit to the dutch government did the british government bear an equal regard for individuals so many valuable subjects would never be suffered to migrate as now annually hire ships to convey themselves to seek their fortunes in new settlements it is estimated that twelve thousand at least are yearly shipped off from ireland and not many less from england and scotland yet no measures are thought necessary to be taken to retain them at home  the turn of waiting at spitsbergen falls annually to the lot of about five dutch ships who are obliged to send out their boats daily in search of their unfortunate fellow subjects some of these boats have themselves suffered severely and have been detained seven or eight days by severe weather in these excursions to the great anxiety of their friends  the day of our voyagers return to smearingburg harbor being fine the commodore ordered a tent to be raised on the lower point to the southwest where there was a level plain for the space of two miles and where all the mathematical apparatus were again taken on shore for a second trial  they found on the examination of the vibration of the pendulum that it differed from that at greenwich by harrisons timekeeper only two seconds in fortyeight hours which timekeeper at their arrival at greenwich varied only one second and a half from the timepieces at the observatory there mr robinson who was articled to commodore phipps from christs hospital and who does honor to that noble foundation was particularly careful to note the result of all the observations that were made in this high latitude  the ovens were also here taken on shore and a considerable quantity of good soft bread baked for the refreshment of the men  hacluits headland of which mention has been frequently made in the course of this voyage is an island on the northwest point of spitsbergen about fifteen miles in circumference on which is found plenty of scurvy grass and in the valleys some of which extend from two to three miles there is store of other grass in summer on which the deer is supposed to feed  the people were now fully employed in overhauling the rigging tarring the ships sides taking in water peying and securing the masts and in preparing the ships for pursuing their voyage upon discovery or if that was found impracticable for returning home  on the   th two of the dutch ships weighed anchor and sailed away in company  on the   th vast pieces of broken ice supposed to have fallen from the icebergs came floating into harbor when these pieces which are undermined by the continual agitation of the sea in stormy weather lose their support they tumble with a crack that surpasses the loudest thunder but they were told that no other thunder was ever heard in this latitude  the activity and enterprizing spirit of the russians already noticed begin to manifest itself every where and it is not improbable but that the maritime powers may one day or other have cause to repent their emulation in contributing to aggrandize the naval power of that increasing people the dominions of the russian empire are situated to command the trade of the universe they are now actually erecting a yard for building ships at kampschatka to improve their discoveries from that quarter and to open a trade from thence to china they have attempted to settle colonies as our voyagers were told on the southernmost districts of spitsbergen and those of the new settlers who survived the first winter were preparing to encounter the rigor of the climate in a second this can only be done by way of experiment to try if a settlement is practicable for those now sent are said to be criminals  during the six days which the ships anchored here to make observations take in water refresh the men and refit our journalist made several excursions to the adjoining islands where the birds appeared in astonishing numbers it being the season for bringing forth their young and teaching them to fly and to dive  of all the birds that breed in these islands the burgermaster is the largest and the most ravenous he is so called by the dutch from his size and his authority as he holds all the other birds in subjection his bill is long and crooked rather like that of the stork than that of the hawk and is of a yellow color he has a red ring about his eyes is web footed but has but three claws on each foot his wings are of a beautiful pearl color edged with white his back a silver gray his body white as snow and his tail of the same color which when he flies he spreads like a fan he builds his nest very high in the rocks inaccessible either to bears or foxes he preys upon all the other birds and eats the carrion of fish or flesh or whatever comes in his way his cry is horrible and when he screams the mallemuch a bird as large as a duck is so much intimidated that she will sink down and suffer him to devour her without opposition  our journalist found it very dangerous to pursue his way over the hills and precipices in this rugged country the clefts on the mountains are like those in the ice frequently impassable but they are abundantly more hazardous being sometimes concealed under the snow so that a traveller is engulphed before he is aware many have been entombed in these clefts and perished in the hearing of their companions without a possibility of relief to a contemplative mind however even the deformities of nature are not unpleasing the wisdom of the creator being manifest in all his works  on the   th of august the ships unmoored and on the twentieth they cleared the harbor they found the tide to flow northeast and southwest and to rise three feet seven inches perpendicular height  on the   d they again found themselves beset with loose ice they were then in latitude  0 degrees    minutes north longitude   degrees    minutes east  on the   d they had a heavy sea from the southwest quarter  on the   d the carcass being a heavier sailer than the race horse lost sight of the commodore and fired a sixpounder which was answered in the evening they came in sight and pursued their course with favorable weather and without any thing worthy of notice happening till  september   when being clear and calm weather the commodore sounded and found ground with seven hundred fathoms very soft mud the people were employed eight hours in heaving up the lead with the capstan at three in the morning the sun risen took the amplitude and found the variation to be    degrees    minutes west  september   at five in the afternoon they had heavy squalls with rain at seven in the morning moderate weather this day in  0 degrees    minutes west they found their longitude corrected by observation of sun and moon to be   degrees    minutes east longitude by time keeper   degrees    minutes east a very remarkable difference  the ships pursued their course home in company together with high seas and variable weather till  sept    when at half after ten the night dark and the weather moderate the wind all at once veered to the southward and a strong gale with a great sea came on the ships parted and never more came in sight till they met off harwich on the english coast  our journalist being on board the carcass can now only relate what happened to that sloop till her arrival in the river thames  when the gale came on the commodores lights not appearing the carcass fired a sixpounder but that shot not being returned by the race horse it was concluded that the commodore was at too great a distance to hear the signal at four in the morning the gale increasing they close reefed the topsails and employed all hands in lashing and securing the boats and booms and preparing to withstand the threatening storm at this time they were in lat    degrees    min north the naze of norway

the navigation to the north pole and proved what captain wood had before asserted that no passage would ever be found practicable in that direction  from the quantities of ice which that navigator met with in latitude    north longitude  east he concluded indeed erroneously that the  0th degree would bound the passage toward the poles and that from thence the polar region was either a continued continent of solid ice or that land filled up the intermediate space  it has been found however that those seas are navigable as far as between the eightyfirst and eightysecond degrees of latitude and it may possibly happen that in some future years they may be found navigable a degree or two farther but it may now with certainty be concluded that a course under the pole can never be pursued for the purpose of commerce  we have already shown incontestibly that the north sea communicates with the eastern sea and that the passage to china and japan may be performed with difficulty by a northeast course by watching the opportunity when a few days in the year the north sea is open but who would think of exposing a ships company to the hazard of being frozen to death in a tedious uncertain and dangerous passage when a safe certain and one may say speedy passage at all times lies open before them  from behrings discoveries to the east of japan and from the continent he there met with there seems reason to believe that the land seen by commodore phipps to the eastward of the seven islands might be a continuation of that continent in that case it is not improbable but that either that continent may join to the western part of america or that it may extend southward and form a part of that continent so much sought after in the southern hemisphere  a small premium of two or three thousand pounds secured by parliament to be paid to the owner or owners of any greenland fishing ship that should be fortunate enough to discover such a continent to the eastward or northward of the seven islands might possibly have a better effect than many expensive expeditions fitted out solely for the purposes of such discovery this by a trading nation were it only to improve the science of geography would surely be well bestowed  it is true indeed that the reward secured by parliament for the discovery of a northwest passage has not yet been attended with that success with which the promoters of the bill had flattered themselves and the public from the libera ispirit with which it was granted  the hudsons bay company though bound by their charter to further and promote the discovery were generally suspected from interested motives to oppose and discourage every attempt to accomplish it and captain middleton who in    0 was sent in a kings ship upon that service returning without success was publicly charged with having received a bribe of five thousand pounds to defeat the undertaking and by his report to discourage any farther attempts in pursuit of it this charge was strongly supported and generally credited and mr dobbs by whose interest captain middleton was employed had the address to prevail with the then ministry to preclude any future scheme of private corruption by promoting the public reward already mentioned  the preamble to the act will state this matter in the true light it sets forth that whereas the discovery of a northwest passage through hudsons straight to the western ocean would be of great benefit and advantage to this kingdom and that it would be of great advantage to the adventurers to attempt the same if a public reward was given to such persons as should make a perfect discovery of the said passage it is therefore enacted that if any ships or vessels belonging to his majestys subjects shall find out and sail through any passage by sea between hudsons bay and the western ocean of america the owners of such ships or vessels shall be entitled to receive as a reward for such discovery the sum of twentythousand pounds and as a farther encouragement to prosecute this discovery and to prevent obstructions from interested persons it was enacted that all persons subjects of his majesty residing in any place where the said adventurers may come in the prosecution of this discovery shall give the said adventurers all assistance and shall no way obstruct molest or refuse the said adventurers reasonable succor in any distress they may fall into in the prosecution of this discovery  such was the encouragement and such the liberal reward that was and is secured by parliament to the fortunate discoverers of a northwest passage to the great pacific ocean a passage which it is generally believed would open a trade with nations on the northern continent of america wholly unknown to the maritime powers of europe and supposed from their situation to abound in commodities equally rare and precious with those of any other country under the sun  the fair prospect of acquiring fame by enlarging commerce the hope of obtaining the parliamentary reward and the desire of exposing the disingenuity of captain middleton were incitements sufficient to prevail with mr dobbs to solicit the equipment of two ships for another voyage which he made not the least doubt would find out the passage so long sought for in vain and by the advantages attending the discovery exceed the most sanguine expectations of the adventurers  the command of this expedition was given to captain ellis who on the   st of may      passed yarmouth in the dobbs galley accompanied by the california sloop and convoyed to the north sea by the loo man of war but in proportion as mr dobbs had flattered the avarice of the adventurers who were to share in the reward and had elated himself with the thoughts of triumphing over the disgrace of captain middleton so it happened that when the ships returned without having effected any one thing of consequence the chagrin of the former for having advanced their money on a visionary project and the mortification of the latter in not being able to support his charge were increased by every circumstance that could aggravate the disappointment captain middleton now triumphed in his turn and no ship from england has since been induced to undertake the voyage notwithstanding the greatness of the reward  it is now however believed that government have in contemplation another voyage to the north to which that of captain phipps was only the prelude but there is reason to conclude from what has already been said of these latter attempts and from the ill success of former undertakings that the discovery of a northwest passage is not the sole object in view the figure of the earth the phenomena of the winds the variation of the compass and the attraction of the magnet are points yet unsettled of infinite importance to navigation and it is not impossible but that a more careful examination of the polar regions may lead to the solution of problems that have hitherto baffled the enquiries of the ablest navigators  a very slender acquaintance with the difficulties and hardships attending northern discoveries will fully account for our knowledge of the countries surrounding the pole being still very imperfect a brief recapitulation of the sufferings of those to whom we are most indebted for our information will not we hope be thought an improper conclusion to a voyage solely undertaken with a view to enlarge it  the first who conceived the idea of exploring the northern regions was sebastian cabbot that enterprizing navigator long before magellan thought of a passage to the pacific ocean by the southwest had made two voyages with a view to direct his course to the same sea by the northwest in these voyages he discovered newfoundland the coast of the esquimeaux indians and had penetrated as far as the   th degree of latitude when a mutiny among his men or rather an obstinate refusal to proceed any further obliged him to return yet he died in the persuasion that a passage in that direction certainly existed and that he should have found it but for the opposition of his crew  the next who prepossessed with the same notion undertook a voyage for discoveries toward the north was sir martin forbisher he discovered greenland and in the latitude of    degrees north passed a straight which though it still holds a place in our maps has never been found navigable since he made two other voyages discovered many bays and capes to which he gave names but returned without attaining the principal object of his voyage though like his predecessor he asserted the certainty of its existence to his latest hour  to him succeeded sir humphry gilbert who in      traversed the coast of labradore entered the mouth of the great river st laurence and surrounding the island of newfoundland laid the foundation of the cod fishery which has been prosecuted with immense advantage to his country ever since  the rapid progress of discoveries in the southern hemisphere which about this time were attended with vast profit to the adventurers reanimated cotemporary navigators to prosecute with more ardour than ever their enterprises toward the north the more the pacific ocean became known the firmer the belief prevailed that a passage into it by way of the north must certainly exist and that whoever could discover it would not only immortalize his name but enrich his country  the merchants of that time were no less eager to embark their money than the navigators were to hazard their persons in any new project where the hope of gain appeared to be well founded a company therefore of wealthy persons in london agreed to join a company of merchants in the west and to sit out two ships for the discovery of a passage which all agreed was practicable though none could tell readily where to find it to the command of this expedition captain john davis was strongly recommended as an able navigator and of a bold and enterprising spirit accordingly on the  th of june      he set sail from dartmouth in the sunshine of fifty tons and accompanied by the moonshine of thirtyfive tons having on board both vessels fortytwo hardy seamen on the   th of july they were alarmed by a mighty roaring which was the more terrible as the fog was so thick that they could not see each other at a ships length it proved only the crackling of the islands of ice which was not then very well understood on the breaking up of the fog they discovered land which from its horrid appearance they named the land of desolation on the   th they were in    degrees    min north the sea open and the weather moderate in this latitude they discovered land and conversed with the natives who appeared to be a harmless hospitable people polite in their manners neatly habited and not ill favored these friendly people observing that the english admired their furs went up in the country to bring down more with which they traded with much simplicity to an adjoining hill davis gave the name of mount raleigh from which he took his departure on the  th of august and on the   th doubled the southernmost cape in view to which he gave the name of the cape of gods mercy and entered a straight which bears the name of the discoverer to this day in this straight he sailed sixty leagues and on the   th went on shore and found evident signs of human inhabitants being met by a pack of dogs twenty in number that expressed their joy as if their masters had been returned after an interval of absence one of those had on a leathern collar the captain was highly pleased with the promising appearance of the new streights and consulting with the master agreed to report upon their return home that they had found the wishedfor passage to the western sea  the weather changing from temperate to excessive cold on the  0th it was resolved to set sail for england on the   th of september they fell in with the land of desolation and on the  0th of the same month entered the port of dartmouth without the loss of a man  the account captain davis gave to his owners was so well received that other merchants were desirous of joining in a second expedition and accordingly he was again employed and furnished with a much greater force  on the  th of may he sailed from dartmouth in the mermaid of   0 tons in company with the sunshine and moonshine as before and an additional pinnace of thirteen tons called the north star  in the latitude of  0 degrees north captain davis divided his force ordering the sunshine and north star to seek a passage between greenland and iceland while the mermaid and moonshine continued their course to the straight as before in the latitude of    degrees and longitude    degrees  0 min north from london they fell again in with the land and met the same people with whom they had traded the former year overjoyed to meet they renewed their acquaintance and while the english was preparing a pinnace to facilitate their discoveries the natives came in numbers to carry on trade as soon as the pinnace was fitted for sea captain davis dispatched her to examine the inlets on the coast and to trace their course up the main land but that was productive of no essential discovery  though the natives attended them with an obsequious diligence yet on their kindling a fire in their manner and using some strange ceremonies captain davis supposing them to be using idolatrous sorceries first thrust the priest into the smoke and then encouraged his men to tread out the flame and to spurn the reeking coals into the sea unable to bear the insult the natives for the first time began to show resentment they seized the boat from the stern of the moonshine cut the cable belonging to the mermaid made prize of the implements that lay upon the shore and in short declared open hostilities against the aggressors who in return discharged their artillery among them which instantly dispersed them  no civilities however that could be shown them after the indignity offered to their priest could ever after reconcile them and the year following they found an opportunity to take a severe revenge in the mean time one of them being made prisoner was taken on board the mermaid who after recovering his fright trimmed up his darts repaired his fishing tackle picked okam and set his hand to any thing he was set about and after a time became a very pleasant companion on board  on the   th of july in latitude    degrees   min north they fell in with a continent of ice very high like land with bays and capes and till they examined it closely could not be convinced that it was a mere congelation they coasted it till the  0th when the weather became so tempestuous and foggy and withal so cold that the shrouds ropes and sails were frozen and glazed with ice and the men who the year before found the sea open and the weather temperate became so dispirited that in an orderly manner they addressed their commander and entreated him to consider their present situation to have regard to his own life and the preservation of theirs and not through boldness and an indiscreet zeal for a hopeless discovery leave their widows and fatherless children to blacken his memory with bitter curses moved with their pitiable representation he discharged the mermaid with those who were most desirous of returning home and proceeded in the moonshine to prosecute his voyage changing his course to recover the opposite shore on the  st of august in latitude    degrees    min north and longitude  0 degrees west he discovered land without either ice or snow on the  d they cast anchor in a fine road and in a day or two were visited by the natives who came to traffic on the   th they set sail to the westward and on the   th changed their course to the southward on the   th they discovered a high promontory to the northwest which having no land to the south recovered their hopes of a free passage  on doubling the cape they found the land trending away to the south in broken islands and coasting along till they arrived at a fine opening in latitude    degrees they sailed ten leagues with woods and lawns on each side abounding with deer and game of every kind here they staid till the  st of september and then set sail coasting along to the northward where they were again flattered with the hopes of a passage by observing a strong current rushing in between two lands to the westward which they were very desirous of approaching but the wind blew directly against them  on the  th returning to their former station five of the crew fell into an ambuscade for having ventured on shore unarmed in their boat they were suddenly assaulted from the woods two of them killed upon the spot two grievously wounded and the fifth made his escape by swimming with an arrow sticking in his arm the same evening a furious storm arose which lasted till the  0th in which time they in a manner unrigged their ship and were about to cut away her masts by the board the cable of their sheet anchor parted and they every moment expected to be dashed upon the rocks and to be made a prey by the savage cannibals of the country but the storm abating and the sea growing calm they recovered their anchor on the   th and made sail for england  about the beginning of october they arrived at dartmouth where they found the sunshine but the north star having parted company in a hard gale on the coast of greenland was never more heard of  this undaunted mariner had yet  to undertake a third voyage and then  as the   d degree of north latitude  deserted by his companions was  return in great distress to his  upon hs return he wrote a letter to his  him that he had found  open  lat    degrees north and  boad and concluded from thence that the passage was    he sailed april the  to daviss streights  latitude    degrees north  where on the  of november  ship was frozen in and being scantily provided with provisions the crew mutinied and in the end most barbarously contrived as the writer expresses it to turn the captain the arpenter and all the sick men out of the shp who were never more heard of after wh  leaders  determined to make the best of their way for england but in their passage home not a few perihed and those who survived   but notwithstanding this disaster and that it w  that the captain and all wo were loft  were either drowned starved or murdered the progress he had mae in  encouraged other   the  who adventured was captain bton a man of gre  courage and exp  prince  and

undertook the  of the extremity of that sea into wch daviss streights opened a passage and he so far succeeded as to determine its extent and to scover an outlet marked in our maps by the name of sir thomas smiths sound which is proudly the only communication between our northen bays and the great pacific ocean which nature has provided in order to maintain a general circulation without which  is hardly possible to conceive that the equi of the globe could for a  be preserved  in      captain john mnk at the  of his danish majesty underto  and arrived safe at cape  where though the tackle of the ship was  tha the mainers uld  the ropes yet next  it was so  that they were forced  he  hudsons treght in the month of july and was forced to winter in latitude  degrees  0 min north on an island that still retains his me but the hardships he endured almost  belief in may   0 he found himself alone in a cave dug in the earth scarce alive and almost morally certain that all his marners were dead as soon as the weather would permit he crawled forth and found of al his crew only two left by removing the snow they found some fresh herbs underneath  by eating them recovered from the scurvy unable to navigate their ships they abandoned her to the savages and by a wonderful providence got safe to norway in the pinnace being a man of uncommon resolution he was still citous to perfect a discovery which had ed the researches of so many able navigators and to acquire glory by accomplishing that which they had failed to attain he ased the existence of such a passage so conntly and laid down the method of finding it so plausibly that he had persuaded the merchants of norway to raise a joint stock to defray the expenses of a second voyage but applying to the king for hs permission and pro  known sufferings  his former voy m told him he had already been  many of his subjects and  to seek to murder  monk gave a quick reply   capt ke  and capt james were the  engaged in this discovery the  in a kings frigate victualled for eighteen months the other in a small vessel of seventy ton built at bristol on purpose victualled and equipped by private adventurers  captain  departed in the spring of       all the western bays uncovered by former  examined the westermost part of hudsns bay and returned in      he pubshed a pompous account of his discoveries which however was never much regarded  on the  of may      captain james set  from the severns mouth and on the th of june cleared hudsons streights where he found himself so pestered with broken  to  it out of his power to prosecute his  to the northwestward as he had  he therefore ordered his master to steer west southwes and on the   th of july after staining most dreadful shocks found  so fast among the ice that notwithsstandng it blew a hard gale and all  she ed no more than if she had been in a dry dock it was now that the men first began to murmur and the captain himself was not without his fears  should here be frozen  and obliged  in the middle of the  by an observa ch they made upon the ice they found that they were in latitude   degrees    min   on the  th of next month to their great joy the ice opened and on the  th they were again  clear sea on the  th seeing some break  and looing to clear them the ship uddenly struck upon the rocks and received three dreadful shocks but the swell heaved her  and on pumping she made no water  they were now bered with rocks as  had been with ice and in the most  ation that can be conceived and so  two nights and two days every mo expecting to be dashed to pieces on the  clearing up they saw land from the northest to the southeast by east with rocks and kers on the   th they weighed and made  when a storm arose and drove them within ght of port nelson on the   th they stood to the southward on the  0th they made land     degrees north where they cast anchor and called it the principality of south wales  having weighed on the   th they set sail  the evening came in sight of higher land  on the   th they saw a sail which proved to be captain fox already mentioned they  together and after exchanging mutual  parted  captain james kept coasting along the shore  make discoveries and captain fox made the  of hs way for england  the captain now began to think of a connt place to winter in in this attempt they met with so many disasters that at last having no hope left they began to prepare themselves to make a good end of a miserable life on the  0th they lost their shallop though lashed to the ship by two hawsers and to their inexpressible grief their boat was almost rendered irreparable  winter now be to set in a pace the nights long the days close and foggy the seas rough and nothing but soals and broken land to navigate added to all these the men began to sicken an universal deection to prevail and in proportion  their distresses increased their strength to  up against them grew less every day  on the th of november being in latitude    north they  in with an island from  mpossible to depart the  were quite worn down with fatigue the  not to be led the ropes  and the deck knee deep in snow in  condition they built a  on shore for the sick and in this tent they kept fires continually burning night and day but the  fast that beer and even sprts froze by the fireside  the suffering of the captain and crew from the latter  of october when they landed tll the  d of july when they departed are hardly to be parelleed  this was the last voyage that was undertaken for the discovery of a northwest passage till that of captain middleton already related from all which and the opinion of captain james after his reurn there is great reason to  that what we have said of a northeast passage is likewise true of a passage by the northwest that it most certainly exists but will never be found praccable for mercantile purposes  finis
