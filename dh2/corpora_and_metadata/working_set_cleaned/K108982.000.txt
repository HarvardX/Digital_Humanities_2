against transports and vows the fawning of treacherous man who by artful grimaces by cringing and bows ensnares every woman he can his transport is false and his vows are a cheat his oaths and his cringing a lie each practiced alone their desire to complete and gain what we ought to deny ii poor daphne too soon owned the flame in her breast too easy too quickly was won her swain from that

will quickly grant relief    scene vii strephon alone o happy thought this artifice may prove a full amends for all my anxious love air haughty caelia still disdaining never shall triumph over my heart never will i with mean complaining sue for comfort to my smart i will appear the careless rover let her coquettish airs affect like a gay a happy lover treat contempt with cold neglect ii never ye fair ones damp the passion where with honor love attends never cross with indignation love that fairest truth commends constant minds alike disdaining insincerity and fraud are their utmost wish obtaining while their hope their hearts applaud    scene viii a village nymphs and swains sylvia forming a wreath of flowers air how lavish natures liberal hand with verdure decks the ground how

alexis reapers cease to use the fickle  sylvia leafy woods forbear to move alexis when alexis wanders fickle sylvia when thy sylvia wanders fickle  both or desires a second love     end of the first act act ii scene i before a cottage caelia musing say if to strephon i confess my flame yield to his wish and own a conqurors claim will he not soon forsake such easy charms and leave me slighted for anothers arms he will he will therefore to prove his heart i will yet resist him and prolong his smart air since artful man so often betrays by subtle wiles and hardy ways our weak unguarded sex by oaths dissembled sighs and fears to melt our hearts to charm our ears and still our minds perplex in revenge i am determined to treat him with scorn and show him a nymph can perplex in her turn ii but strephons heart with purest fire with kindest love and fond desire has ever warmly glowed yet his may be like all the rest a treacherous bait to snare the breast and so my fears forbode those fears then shall teach me to treat him with scorn and show him a nymph can ensnare in her turn    scene ii alexis caelia alexis death furies woman   caelia what is the matter now  alexis from henceforth who will trust a female vow nymph we are both deceived your strephon feigned for you no love within his bosom reigned sylvia in secret still possessed his heart their passions mutual   caelia oh my

but softest joy so venus smiled to charm her love and bid his angry fury cease the god with rapture did approve and sighed his soul to gentle peace    alexis o traitor  caelia monster  but on second thought i will hide my rage  alexis aside to strephon well said the gudgeons caught  caelia down down my heart strephon i am pleased to hear you have got a mistress who will be less severe cruel i am but sylvia we are sure inflicts no wounds but she will be glad to cure  trio alexis happy swain thy cares are over lovesick whims no more perplex thoughtful roams no more the lover seeking means himself to vex  caelia in my life i never felt greater pleasure my pains every moment are varied grief rage  lord i long beyond measure to see you both happily married  strephon blessed with sylvias

every feature to every action grace then never slight the lover or draw too tight his chain least in the end the rover succeeds the dying swain    scene vi caelia alexis alexis stay caelia stay a word let me entreat behold a shepherd falling at your feet each disappointed of a wished for spouse let us here in spite exchange our mutual vows  caelia alexis no strephon i truly loved nor can my breast by other vows be moved  alexis a fair confession from an honest heart now listen to the tale that i impart air a shepherd long sighed for a beautiful fair and in rapture discovered his love not doubting the nymph would dispell his fond care and his amorous transport approve though she to compassion insensible grown no glimpse of delight would impart when he sighed at her feet she replied with a frown and rejoiced at his sufferings and smart ii he suffered long time this impertinent scorn nor thought of upbraiding the fair but secretly pined in the bower forlorn involved in the keenest despair till his friend who observed him heart wounded with grief lamenting his fruitless desire resolved that the nymph should afford him relief and in turn feel the force of loves fire iii too artful her passion she never had owned though it triumphed alone in her breast but laughed while the shepherd in misery moand and wandered a stranger to rest advised then his bosom no longer to vex but her haughtiness treat with disdain he owned a feigned courtship her breast to perplex and convert to delight all his pain    scene vii enter strephon sylvia shepherds and shepherdesses strephon all this is true my caelia come my fair destroy each doubt and banish every care  caelia what means the joy that over powers my mind can my dear strephon can he yet be kind  duetto strephon this soft

minds united age shall never regret  quartetto air strephon can we know more real bliss than the happy days in view  caelia no shepherd sure an hour like this crowns the wishes but of few  alexis dearest nymph as happy we envy none though ever so great  sylvia power riches sure must be much beneath our blissful state  chorus then quickly to the neighboring grove blessed together let us rove the cheerful dance the suited song to such a day as this belong     finis
