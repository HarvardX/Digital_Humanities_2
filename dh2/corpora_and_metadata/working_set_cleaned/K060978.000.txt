an ode to tragedy  by a gentleman of scotland  edinburgh printed by a donaldson and j reid for alex donaldson mdclxi  price six pence  to james boswell esquire my dear sir if adam fitzadam presumed to inscribe a volume of the world to mr moore i can see no reason why i a gentleman of scotland may not take much the same liberty with mr boswell  do not imagine sir because this address comes in the form of a dedication that i have been invoking the goddess of flattery indeed i have no intention to pay your compliments not that your discernment is so nice as to reject them with indignation but because it is my sincere opinion that they would do you harm to entertain agreeable notions of ones own character is a great incentive to act with propriety and spirit but i should be sorry to contribute in any degree to your acquiring an excess of selfsufficiency  to talk thus freely is certainly a proof that i wish you well and i make no doubt sir but you consider me as your very good friend although some people  and those too not destitute of wisdom  will not scruple to insinuate the contrary  be that as it may give me leave to thank you for your particular kindness to me and chiefly for the profound respect with which you have always treated me  i own indeed that when i have boasted of a glimpse of regard from the finest eyes and most amiable heart in the world or to display my extensive erudition have quoted greek latin and french sentences one after another with astonishing celerity or have got into my oldhock humor and fallen araving about princes and lords knights and geniuses ladies of quality and harpsichords  you with a peculiar comic smile have gently reminded me of the importance of a man to himself and slily left the room with the witty dean lying open at  p p clerk of this parish  the following ode which courts your acceptance is on a subject grave and solemn and therefore may be considered by many people as not so well suited to your volatile disposition but i sir who enjoy the pleasure of your intimate acquaintance know that many of your hours of retirement are devoted to thought and that you can as strongly relish the productions of a serious muse as the most brilliant sallies of sportive fancy  as to my merit as a poet i shall only say that while i am certain of your approbation i shall be entirely satisfied and if i can any how improve the noble feelings of that honest open heart of yours i shall reckon myself infinitely happy  i must now bid you farewell with an assurance that while you continue the man that you are you shall ever find me with the greatest sincerity and affection  my dear sir yours etc  ode to tragedy i goddess supreme whose power divine the yielding passions all obey on me o with thy influence shine o send a spark to fire each lay a soul by nature formed to feel grief sharper than the tyrants steel and bosom big with swelling thought from ancient lores remembrance brought prompt me with pinions bold my way to wing and like the skylark at heavens gate to sing ii come mistress of superior grace daughter in hour sublime of jove over the strong features of whose face with air of distant awe we rove while mingling softness to the eye seems over each lineament to fly as when the suns resplendent rays in summer glow with reddning blaze a floating bluetingd cloud does interveen and through a veil the sire of light is seen iii come muse while terrors ghastly form and pity gentle maid appear or to assault the soul by storm or steal the generous heartsprung tear while they attendant on thy state submissive thy behests await dread as a hideous lion chained and pitys looks with crying stained o in thy dazzling majesty advance thou who through nature shootst with eagle glance iv it is thine the soul to humanize by fancied woe  goddess it is thine to bid compassion melt the eyes and all the feelings soft refine it is thine with great apollos skill the inmost springs of life to thrill it is thine to move a breast of stone and make a brazen heart to own that solemn tragic numbers are of force to stop a villain in his bloody course v behold the buskined bard of greece the enchantment of whose tuneful shell could sooth the mind to gentle peace or rouse to fury sprung from hell see in his kindling look the fire bright flaming from his golden lyre hark how he sweeps the strings  such tones nature designed afflictions groans i feel when now he wakes another strain the love of glory panting in each vein vi unhappy oedipus thy fate   gods for one mortal how severe  while sophocles deigns to relate in pomp of sadness shall appear the direful oracle we dread while on thy bare dejected head we see the black tempestous shower of fortunes wrath incessant pour we see a wretch over boiling eddies tossed till in a gulf of woe the victims lost vii o say thou arbitress of mind what sympathy unites our race that even in savages we find this wondrous tender human grace how is the heart of man so soft  which i alas have felt too often  how are we moved with others woe how do the streams of pity flow how does the breast with throbs spontaneous beat how is compassion found so strangely sweet viii hail father of the british stage shakespeare to whom shall still belong through each successive wondering age the glories of immortal song melpomene with aspect mild with joyful hope exulting smiled what time on avons banks she saw thee young thy first rude sketches draw of richest poesy whose strains sublime already aimed the empyreums height to climb ix genius unbounded as the sky that spreads itself from pole to pole disdains a formal course to fly or sweep the ground with lazy stole the stagyrite may preach in vain and tasteless critics cold complain that thou all rules of art have broke and flung away the stated yoke to the kind heart alone thou do appeal and bidst the ingenuous there conviction feel x say thou the illustrious poets shade whether old westminsters famed dome thou hauntst or where his childhood strayed and where his bones have fixed their home o say from whence such powers he drew by which the universe he knew ye ghosts and beings of the brain witches and all the magic train you he could lively paint with pencil nice and scourge by force infernal blasted vice xi greatest of bards o hear my prayer gleam on my soul with chearing view yet think not that i rashly dare one of thy footsteps to pursue how have i in my youthful age adored to see the passions rage as when her swain with juliet strove who felt the anguish most of love or when old englands annals were displayed and piercy stormed in martial fire arrayed xii forgive though i forbear to tell of you ye other bards who shine forgive though i forbear to swell with crowd of names the sounding line when oroonokos godlike soul by misery distracted roll in gloomy bloodstreakd eyes we see can any bosom ruthless be will not a hapless orphan make us weep or randolphs lady plunged in sorrows deep xiii augustas theaters  with pride how often have i witnessed there the lucid pearls of pity glide from lovely eyes of british fair how often have i raptured seen the passion of the present queen with uncontrolled applauses loud burn in each feature of the crowd lo boundless liberty submissive deigns  triumph how great to wear the actors chains xiv see garrick in poor lear rave borne down the tide of sore distress he seems against each oerwhelming wave with hoary majesty to press see sheridan in denmarks heir  wide spreads the prospect of despair with dusky clouds the sky is hung pale horror falters on his tongue torn is his wretched mind even now i view cold painwrought drops his mournful face bedew xv o why by cams delightful streams does mr mason he who sung elfridas woe indulge his warm poetic dreams but to the private eye to show why does the moralizing train the ancient chorus  him from the worlds just glass detain beams not bright beauty brighter still from the high summit of yon hill drive him ambition from the inglorious seat though hurd approve his indolent retreat xvi goddess supreme my vows attend o let the honored task be mine thy temple trembling to ascend trembling to offer at thy shrine while idle follys glittering train bask in the sunshine ever vain like junos bird so pert and gay their gaudy plumage still display o let me visit often thy sacred store and in ecstatic heat intrancd adore finis
