essays moral and philosophical on several subjects viz a view of the human faculties a short account of the world two discourses on decency an essay on selflove   london printed for j osborn and t longman at the ship in paternosterrow mdccxxxiv  advertisement from the publisher though the following papers are of different forms and upon different subjects yet there appeared no reason why they might not be all published together i take the liberty of mentioning this and a few things more to the reader because i had a greater latitude given me by the person whose hands the papers came from but i have exerted my powers no further than in not letting the essay on selflove come out singly which was his inclination but i hope i shall have the public approbation for what i have done  i had a long letter chiefly relating to the essay with several hints in it which i thought the public ought not to be deprived of and so with the authors allowance i have thrown some of them into the appendix whereof they make the last number a few of his words in that letter seem to call for a place here  i designed to have sent you these papers several years ago i industriously shunned taking notice of some performances that appeared at different times after this small work was begun and ended having seen them as much despised by the most judicious sort of readers as i thought they deserved all i have in view by the essay is that it may serve for an introduction to books of a deeper reach but i took all the care i could that it might have no air of a religious dissertation it was indeed next to impossible to avoid saying somewhat on the love of god that the contrary doctrine might appear the more in its own colors  i thought it was best to add the d of rochefoucaults description entirely as being a run of natural eloquence without precision as the french call it which makes it rather the more agreeable sometimes he puts selflove for covetousness sometimes for pride sometimes for vanity sometimes for passion sometimes for obstinacy sometimes for mere whim and sometimes for all these together as appears throughout his reflections but still he will be well enough understood for by selflove he either means corrupt nature in general or some of its particular qualities but with submission see the continuation of this in the last number of the additions  the author designed the rest of those additions as an explanation of some terms and a collection of some citations to support the essay though it stands pretty much independent of either the sections were also designed to have been of a more equal length and the whole to have been shorter but he yielded to an advice of dropping in some practical reflections because as he owned himself abstract reasonings seldom make a deep impression nor was it without reluctance that he engaged at all in the performance having often said the nature of mankind gives little ground to expect an alteration in opinions once received though no speculation seems so likely for all parties to agree in as that of disinterestedness nor any speculation that could produce such happy effects if it was reduced to practice  as to the dialogues he expressed himself as if he had been but a witness to the conversation and had wrote only from his memory and therefore said it was to be feared it would be a kind of murder and at best to present the world with a skeleton he adds it will easily be supposed the two friends talked of many things i have taken no notice of and that their conversation was only reduced by me under certain heads and put in a different order from what they observed in talking together for it would not have been so natural to have begun with the distinction of body soul and spirit perhaps the thing such as it is may be of use to those who are not much acquainted with themselves and the world  the two discourses on decency he called neglected trifles and desired i might do with them what i pleased

the human faculties i of man in general lucinus and aemilius l there are not my dear aemilius two more common words nor a more common distinction than of body and soul the properties and operations of these two are entirely different quid enim homini accidit infaelicius quid turpius quam confusio actionum mentis corporisque boerhaave dissert de chemia  and nothing is more shameful and unfortunate than to confound them together   ae my dear lucinus you are entirely in the right and we are farther said to be made up of body soul and spirit a distinction not only used by st paul but which we have also from  m antonin lib ii    lib iii    good heathen philosophers  sensation is assigned to the body though it is the soul that properly feels through the bodily organs the passions or affections are appropriated to the soul and truths or principles are of the province of the mind or the understanding according to that distribution of antoninus   l but to go a degree lower than sensation for life may be conceived without any operation of the senses as when they are shut up in a deep sleep simple life is a thing as different from body or matter as any thing we can imagine and therefore life is sometimes called by the name of spirit and considered both as a principle or spring by which matter whose property is to rest is moved and the body of animals kept for a while from dissolution and corruption  dum spiritus hos regit artus  of this sort of life or spirit every living creature has a share a worm as well as a man the particular frailty of whose life we may be easily convinced of though the apostle had not told us it is but a vapor and yet we have no other barrier against that amazing state called eternity if the thought of death or simple extinction raises horror what would the prospect of endless existence raise without some latent hope or supposition of happiness a man makes this supposition secretly when he thinks at all of that state otherwise nature could not bear the prospect and we must confess our quiet or rather indolence as to an article of such importance is chiefly owing to our stupidity   ae but notwithstanding all the stupidity and weight that loads us there is still in our nature some expectation of immortality some hopes of a future life and a more perfect existence after this scene is over to which if we add our desire of dominion and esteem even in this world we may conclude there is really something of worth in us and our pride may be a sort of argument for our dignity and this elevation of mind is not infused into us by politicians divines officers of the army or any set of men whatsoever but may be said to be a part of our constitution  diotrephes loved preeminence caesar was not taught to desire dominion every man loves it less or more though not equally qualified to gain it nor equally successful besides the rewards promised by politicians and commanders rather respect the conveniences and glory of this life than the future and whether the reward be temporal or eternal the encouraging or the amusing people with the hopes of it supposes a desire in them beforehand of such things otherwise the designing men could have no fund to work upon and might as well talk to horses  i confess there are other arguments besides the pride of man which may help to show his dignity he grows weary of every thing here friendship only excepted as if nothing were worthy of his attention but then as nothing is able to satisfy him any thing is sufficient to amuse him so that we must consider man in different lights before we can understand his condition and after all we can think about it our knowledge must remain imperfect   l it is by viewing man in those opposite lights that he is sometimes called the glory of the creation and sometimes its disgrace and both epithets are true there is still in human nature something that is bright and lovely good and kind some remains of excellency some ruins of grandeur some sparks in the midst of ashes and rubbish  the scripture informs us that man was made after the image of god and that we are his offspring it is remarkable that st paul cites this passage from a heathen poet and there was great address in it since he was reasoning with the polite men of athens but if our pride should be apt to rise from the account the scripture gives us of our origin we shall find in the same books very different characters to keep us low we are called but dust the worms are our nearest kindred it is told us we are but vanity in our best estate and that the imaginations of our heart are continually foolish and wicked with much more to that purpose  the philosophers were much divided in their opinions concerning man some exalted him too high others sunk him too low without considering the strange mixture of his composition which indeed seems to make him akin to the highest and lowest beings the loveliest and the hatefullest things  nor is it to be forgot that though mankind in general are made up of contrarieties yet as my lord rochester says man differs more from man than man from beast   ae not only so but the same man differs as much from himself at different times   l it is a strange composition human nature but those who talk and write against the dignity of man and the immortality of the soul who affirm there is no virtue no friendship no honor can only argue from what they feel in themselves and what they observe in the world the first point might be readily yielded to them though we are not absolutely sure but they may have a greater belief of virtue and more conscience than they own as there are others who may have less of either than they pretend to and as to the observation of the decay of virtue in the world there is nothing oftener mentioned in the scripture than that in short whatever the opinions of particular persons may be human nature will still remain in its rank and the unhappy choices of the multitude will serve to confirm the sacred text man that is in honor and understands not is like the beasts that perish   ii the body l what do you think of this body of ours   ae it is by this wonderful piece of mechanism that we hold correspondence with the visible world about us   l the body as to its outward figure is certainly beautiful few are so fantastical as to find fault with the human shape nor are the parts within less wonderful in their contrivance and use many engines are constantly playing with what incredible force does the heart send out the blood and how much work is done within us as antoninus said and we feel nothing of it when we feel least of it we are in the best health  anatomists tell us there is hardly an instrument in mechanics or hydrostaticks but we meet with in the human body and indeed in the body of inferior animals scarce any part of a house or a ship hardly a common utensil but we find in this surprising fabric they talk of levers wedges pullies ropes sieves strainers beams tubes vases receptacles and more things than i have english for you may see deprehenduntur enim ibidem fulcimenta columnae trabes propugnacula hypomochlia cunei vectes trochleae determinantes funes praela folles cribra filtra canales receptacula institutiones  0 boerhaave   ae some of those laborious penetrating honest inquirers into nature have really made great discoveries and there remains still much to be discovered any body may know thus far that this outward vehicle of ours is made up of an infinite number of parts organs or instruments curiously adjusted and acting in a mutual subserviency each part to another as well as for the safety and pleasure of the whole system   l flesh and blood and skin and bones are familiar words and we think very little about the composition and texture of the things but we are surprised when we hear that flesh itself is but a collection of small fibers that every muscle may be divided into lesser ones and these again into lesser till they become too small for discovery institut     surpassing even the force of imagination  the action of the muscles and the motions performed by their means is a new matter of wonder as some of these motions are voluntary there are others without any design of ours the voluntary motions are often accompanied with satisfaction as the mind directs them either to real use or vanity and we are beholden to the muscles for dancing as well as walking to these the politician owes his shrugs and the nice lady her gestures   ae but at the same time that we admire the texture of the flesh we see evident marks of frailty stamped upon it or something worse the mixture of blood and other fluids makes the consistency the more difficult to be preserved and upon the breach of so many canals and vessels which a very ordinary wound may occasion we see a considerable disorder and have even some horror at the sight a putrefying sore is still more disagreeable   l it were prudence in us however to view our constitution sometimes on its weak sides that we may not forget the materials we are made of or imagine a statue of plaster to be a statue of brass the wisdom of the maker is still seen in the admirable contrivance of the machine though it were to last but a day and we have good reason to subscribe to that text we are fearfully and wonderfully made   ae wonderfully indeed but then the tenderness of our frame must not so frighten us as if it were every moment to fall to pieces and consequently under the notion of shunning danger make us shun the duties of society the body is strongly fenced and can bear considerable shocks after all we are only to keep our brittleness in view as a guard to sobriety and temperance for there is certainly a good deal of truth in that common proverb surfeiting destroys more people than the sword  how intemperance a general term for all excess comes to be such a ruin to the poor fabric is no hard matter to account for the bones it is true have a firmness but then how are they joined together and how many small vessels are employed in conveying nourishment even to them the whole body may be called but a bundle of pipes and vessels wrapped up in skin some of the fluids run in larger channels and with greater briskness whilst others naturally are but slowly filtrated what a pressure must a surcharge of meat and drink occasion how must the various canals be affected here a ferment there stagnation the ideas would be a little nauseous if pursued farther   l but since it is much more agreeable to consider things in their good order than in their corruption it may be very entertaining to look into some books of anatomy wherein such discoveries are given as cannot fail to raise admiration and delight and there is this moral inference to be made that as all the parts of the body united as st paul says by joints and bands contribute to the good of the whole in a mechanical way so all men ought to serve one another freely and cheerfully as members of one body or society and the good emperor has an useful criticism upon the difference between the words member and part the former implying a more vital union than the latter for instance a branch of a tree or any inanimate thing is separated from the body without pain which is far otherwise in the loss of an arm or in the least hurt of any animated part of the body this example might be much farther pursued with great pleasure all the members being found to act in concert and harmony no schism no appropriation no contempt no oppression   ae few criticisms are of so much use but notwithstanding all the agreeable things that are to be observed in the contrivance of the body its charms lie principally in the outside the figure of the inward parts and the endless branchings of the veins are looked at with more complacency in waxwork and copperplate than in their reality which must give the dissecters themselves some uneasiness not to be entirely overcome by the longest practice but the shape and air strike a reverence the skin and features a delight the features more than the skin and the air more than the features so that the air gives delight and reverence both we shall leave more observations to lovers in the mean time we must do the soul the justice to confess that it is she that is properly the mistress no man can be in love with the finest statue nor would life added to beauty be the attraction if some qualities of the mind were not supposed this must hold without dispute in rational love and as to the simple impressions on the eye which irrational animals may share in for any thing we know to the contrary whatever is agreeably felt if it is not excited by the soul is at least felt by the soul and to it we must have recourse as the seat of life itself as well as of sensation and reflection  i say we must have recourse to some other thing than the body for all our perceptions and faculties of what kind soever the body is but a vehicle enlivened we cut and mangle a dead body without much compassion and without any injury as if it were a log of wood   l what it is that ties two things together so different in their natures men have no notion of we see in fact and sometimes to our great affliction a deplorable alteration in the body or the visible part from whence we conclude a separation of the invisible or that the soul or spirit has withdrawn we know not whither   ae the dissolution of the body shows a little of its composition as it returns to the dust so it is of the dust but into this strange composition the four elements may be said to enter and other things often mentioned by philosophers and common men oil sulphur etc it must be owned too that these ingredients are more happily mixed in some persons than others as shakespeare observes of brutus from whence may proceed the difference of constitutions and even of tempers and this should engage people to pity one another or to be very civil at least if a man thinks his neighbor has too much fire he should consider whether he himself may not have too much phlegm and on the contrary   l if some people heard us they would be apt to think there is too much said concerning the body others that there is too little and i am of the latter opinion considering that it is the body which takes up the most of our care in so much that antoninus calls death a release from the drudgery about a carcass   iii the soul ae you asked me what i thought of the body pray what do you think of the soul   l mankind being so much in the dark as to the nature of all things can only consider them in some of their properties and operations   ae it seems the lowest operation we can conceive of the soul is to give life and motion to an organized body which the most curious organs cannot give since they are but matter reduced into shape and proportion it is agreeable to see a fly making its motions in the air or cleaning its little legs by some principle foreign to its light body but a small touch puts an end to the activity   l it is an odd sort of enquiry whether matter might not have thought superadded to it it is easy and no less true to say that infinite power can do every thing it pleases but then men should take care under the appearance of modesty or however real it may be not to make impertinent suppositions if life were superadded matter would be enlivened and if thought were superadded matter would be thinking whereas the settled idea of matter is something that is inanimate unactive and incapable of thinking  if we were to search for mere life or if any person could tell us where it is to be found i believe the answer would be not in the smallest fibers for they are but threads neither in the thinnest membranes for they are but threads woven together if genesis   it is in the blood as the scripture seems to intimate it still escapes our discovery and the blood itself must be reckoned but a vehicle for the life   ae another text in the same book says genesis   god breathed into man the breath of life and he became a living soul we must content ourselves with an historical account of our own being instead of a philosophical and if we should want to know how life has been insused into the meanest animals we must only conclude that the fountain of life has communicated to them their portion of it some way or other and without grudging them their manner of existence many of them having the advantage of us in some faculties we ought to study to make the best and the thankfullest use of our own  that which is called the vegetable life consists chiefly in a circulation of fluids in order to the support and growth of the body they belong to without any power of sensation vegetation is but growing and even stones and metals some think have a growth of their own   l baglivi is of that opinion evidenter sequitur posse lapides adinstar plantarum crescere ac vegetare quia revera lapidum pori permeabiles sunt upon which he tells of a shellfish called dactilus marinus found in the midst of stone alive and very agreeable to the taste not far from naples de vegetatione lapidum    ae plants are bodies organized to admiration they draw nourishment from the earth by their roots they seem to be nourished also by the air and may be killed by the air they have perspiration but no respiration which seems to be peculiar to the animal life and is the lowest of its operations  living creatures can move from one place to another and have their roots within themselves for their nourishment which roots says mr boerhaave are the absorbent veins in the mouth stomach and intestines   l some animals fixed in their shells to rocks are an exception from that power of local motion though they have still some inward spring of their own and may be said to move in their own houses   ae life certainly in the lowest view we can have of it implies something more than matter or matter and motion together and may be called immaterial or a thing that cannot fall under the cognizance of any of the five senses it is finer and quicker than flame it cannot be extracted by the best chemists nor kept in glasses mr hobbes triumphed over the expression immaterial substance as an instance of insignificant speech and he would have had reason on his side if he had first proved that there was no substance nor any thing in the universe but what we can see and touch etc   l sneering is no proof   ae but now though all life may be called immaterial it cannot upon that account be called immortal or unextinguishable immortality is a term appropriated to the soul the beasts have a life as well as men and are unwilling to part with it yet the scripture speaks as if it ended with the destruction of their body and they are said to perish it is true solomon speaks of the spirit of man and the spirit of the beast that the one goes upward and the other downward and i think some philosophers talk of different principles to which higher and lower spirits are united after quitting their respective bodies but when revelation stops short conjectures are often very unsatisfying and often very improper   l it still bears a good moral meaning that the spirit of man tends to somewhat of a superior kind than the beasts are capable of nature having made them grovelling as salust expresses it prona atque ventri obedientia  this we know for certain that the life of man and beast is subject to ruin and under great necessities while it subsists especially the life of man who not only wants food but raiment sleep is a want common to all animals on this earth as if some operations of life needed to be suspended to keep it from wearing out for other operations go on we breathe the blood circulates digestion advances etc mean time it is remarkable that the present wants of mankind and sleep in particular contribute very much to any peace and quiet they enjoy soldiers must rest on their marches and the plodding statesman drops asleep in the midst of a project that would have embroiled europe   ae but of our necessities some are real others only imaginary both of which subject us to great dependence by the real necessities all men depend upon one another and the highest ranks depend most upon the lowest who work both for their own subsistence and for theirs that are idle by the imaginary necessities some put themselves under the dependence of men in power and sometimes do very dirty work for the wages they receive but in all our wants whether imaginary or real the body wants nothing for it feels nothing it is properly the bodily life that wants meat and clothing and it is luxury and pride that want delicacies and ornaments  how life comes to fail notwithstanding all the repairs it is constantly getting and all our anxiety about it is only to be resolved into the will and appointment of its author it is just such another mystery that the bodily frame wears out and becomes no longer a fit habitation for the soul  certainly it might have lasted longer and we hear of lives in the beginning of the world near a thousand years old that some of the softer parts harden too much with time and the strainers cannot perform their functions is what experience shows but a new question may arise why that hardening of the softer parts besides we often see the machine destroyed before it is half worn even in infancy and this without any violent accidents man is the poorest creature in the world in many instances we may judge how it becomes him to be proud pride was not made for man   l poor ignorant man the difficulty is as great to know how life is kindled as how it goes out that it enters into the body is but a way of speaking perhaps the body and it are formed together i have sometimes thought men have been too prying with their glasses and their enquiries whatever be of that they discover nothing to lessen their difficulties nature still keeps her mysteries to herself  we see indeed in a gross manner how we are thrown into this world with the distress of our mothers and pain to ourselves though we have no remembrance of it our stay must be short from the nature of our bodily frame the cords are loosed and the wheels broken death comes and puts an end to our labors our designs and our impertinencies  this life is a state of trial and has many epithets it is called a voyage a passage an inn a pilgrimage sometimes a play and a farce but it always concludes in a tragedy a little earth is cast upon the head says mr pascal and en voila pour jamais   iv sensation ae but how little have we seen of the soul of man that principle of reason that immortal spirit capable of inexpressible joy and sorrow even here and of both these hereafter in a degree infinitely higher when this clog of a body is thrown off   l if you please we will talk a little more of our inferior state and condition as life is a considerable remove from matter and motion sensation carries us a stage beyond life and as it were into another region but still a very low one however if men cannot account for simple life no wonder they cannot account for sense and feeling it is much if mr hobbes was in earnest in what he says of the cause of sense you may see how far it is satisfying leviathan chap      ae sometimes one would hardly know whether to laugh or be angry at hobbes but though the cause of sensation is hid from us the advantages of it are very obvious the senses are the canals of pleasure they may be said to bring intelligence to the soul and to the whole man safety and delight they are noble presents from our creator and we see what a loss it is to be deprived of any one of them if they are sometimes the conveyances of pain this is owing to some accidents they are not answerable for and very often the pain is of our own procuring  if the organs are indisposed the senses must be so likewise and if they are lost the senses are lost it is the body that furnishes these organs which probably has made the emperor assign the senses to the body  the bodily senses are also called the external senses as they serve us in the commerce with things in this visible world they are commonly reckoned five and this number has obtained a sort of prescription in our english apocrypha they are called the they received the use of the five operations of the lord and in the sixth place he imparted them understanding and in the seventh speech an interpreter of the cogitations thereof ecclus    whatever may be in grotiuss conjecture that this passage has been put on the margin and it looks to have been so by some follower of the stoics it still shows that this way of classing our external senses is pretty ancient and it seems even to answer the purpose well enough for we can find out no other operation for discovering and surveying the qualities of outward things and for putting them to use five operations and though feeling is a word that may be applied to them all yet in common discourse it is appropriated to one of these five powers in particular sometimes we say a sight strikes the eye a sound the ear but it is the hand that is usually said to touch and hence touching and the other four senses are considered as active because they can be applied to particular objects as the mind directs by whose orders they also suspend their operations a man may shut his eyes when he thinks fit but upon the matter all the senses are rather passive than active which i believe you will readily grant  but though the number of those operations has been limited to five the number of sensations or perceptions may be called infinite both as to the objects and the degrees by the degrees i mean the higher and lower sensations of pleasure and pain two words that include every thing that delights us or afflicts us though in this place it is only what concerns the body that is under consideration   ae of those five operations you know the sight and hearing are reckoned the noblest probably because they are of a greater reach and serve more eminently for conveying knowledge to the mind the eye can take in half the firmament the ear can hear at a great distance and both can receive instruction by words whereas the other three senses especially the touch and taste can only act by an immediate application to the object   l there is a remarkable difference between the two last named senses in one respect that the taste is for ones self alone and so may be called but a poor solitary pleasure whereas the touch is a means of union with another person and in so far may be called a social pleasure and it serves often as a conveyance of friendship   ae you design to be merry   l neither merry nor grave you must have had the women in your head yourself and i dont deny that they were in mine but setting them aside i will appeal to any man if he would not prefer the kiss of a friends cheek to the best wine upon earth   ae he must be a sorry friend that would not   l the greatest observers have only discovered the organs or instruments belonging to each sense and it is probable they have not discovered them all neither thus touching and tasting are but faintly explained by the discovery of certain papillae molles pulposae medullosae nerveae pyramidales in nervis subcutaneis duris exuta membrana exteriori emollitis ortae hinc admodum sensiles factae affluenti assiduo tenuissimo liquore humectatae epidermide tenuissima defensae illibata sua sensibilitate intra sinus foveasque sub cuticula latentes in locis tactui exercendo propriis nempe lingua apice digitorum in manibus pedibusque contractiles iterumque emissiles sunt organum corporeum quo explorata corpora tangi dicuntur boerhaave institut  he shows afterward by what means touch arises and how the different perceptions are excited of heat and cold etc  tactus igitur fit      he goes very far yet must stop short   nipples under the skin differing in their figures as the proper instruments of these two senses though the small instruments are indeed described with great labor and exactness and as we know but some of the instruments so we know but some of the occasions or conditions not the causes requisite to affect us so many ways as we find we are affected so that the greatest philosophers have recourse only to the non ergo videtur diversitas haec idaearum pendere tantum a varietate illa qua ultima pars nervi construitur sed a multis aliis praeterea non quidem causis sed ex instituto conditoris adorandi conditionibus     appointment of the adorable creator the cause of simple life is not to be reached much less the cause of sensation and the cause of pleasure or pain less still   ae feeling or sensibility it seems is diffused through all the body without and within and so is considered as the foundation of what is most usually and strictly called pleasure and pain the rest of the senses convey what is agreeable the eye sights and the ear sounds for instance but they are not said to create that severe racking pressure which goes under the name of pain or torture nor that gentle agreeable impression called pleasure a new wonder arises how the same nerves are fashioned to sustain the greatest pleasure and the greatest pain    l it is remarkable how much the present frame of the body is liable to pain and often seized with it to extremity   ae it is remarkable too that the extremes of pleasure are much fewer than those of pain from which no fiber of the body can promise to be exempt and as to the point of duration pleasure has but little to boast of intense pain may continue long intense pleasure cannot   l mankind are in some delusion as to that point mr boerhaave and others are very good for showing the frame and texture of the organs belonging to each sense mean time the touch and taste are generally most gratified and the taste yet more than the former and to these two senses may be referred all that is called luxury the smell is but gratified in a manner for diversion elegance is properly the pursuit of the eye sometimes it is true all extravagance is called luxury as the luxury of building gardening apparel etc  to enter into all the bad consequences of indulging the senses were an endless affair there are few persons but know too much of it from their own experience with relation to their estate their character and the body itself and if they want authorities they may see what horace says of the effects of gratifying a sweet tooth as dr cheyne calls it dulcia se in bilem vertunt  but the inconvenience of sensuality is one thing and the injustice of it another mere selfish gratification without regard to society and friendship supposing the heart not to be engaged in the pleasure is a thing below humanity but it is infinitely more agreeable to think of what nature has done for our support and delight than what we do our selves to our uneasiness our destruction and our dishonor we have the benefits and pleasures of all the senses to think of and we can never think of them enough mr boerhaave is in after having said many things of the ear from the best authors and his own observations he adds  supra omnem vero admirabilitatem constructa appariet cochleae spiralis fabrica etc      he had said of the nose sunt praeterea in his narium cavis recondita and artificiose variis locis disposita quatuor ossicula spongiosa  sunt haec quatuor ossicula mire fabricata ex tenuissimis osseis lamellis papyro tenuioribus         nares investiuntur membrana crassa molli myriadibus vasculorum arteriosorum ornata  membrana haec solicit se insinuat  unde mirabili instituto         raptures speaking of the very organs how much more satisfaction must it give to reflect on the uses the delights and the certainty of the operations themselves to suppose them fallacious were to give our selves the lie as well as to unhinge all society law and commerce a man distinguishes his friend well from a stranger he knows his very foot before entering the room witnesses are admitted upon their knowledge of facts and a judge from his conviction of the proof acquits the innocent or condemns the guilty to say nothing of more familiar distinctions known to young and old   ae sometimes you know we must have recourse to one sense for confirming another or rectifying its mistakes but this can never overthrow the certainty of the senses in general if a stick appears crooked in the water there needs no more but to take it out to be convinced that it is straight it is the philosophers that perplex people or rather confound themselves with their subtilties and their marks of certainty an honest farmer is at no loss to know whether he is sleeping or waking   l the quickness of the senses as well as the health of the body depends very much on sobriety and good rules though to be sure there are higher motives for sobriety than health and pleasure and besides that the body is thus kept righter for the exercise of its proper functions the mind is freed from an excessive trouble in seeking after those seeming necessities of luxury which grow upon us the more they are indulged and make us delicate and fretful uneasy to ourselves and others   ae besides the five senses the naturalists generally speak of a sensorium or common sense which they reckon the ground of all sensation or a medium as it were for modifying the impressions and conveying them to the mind the eye say they knows not that it sees nor the ear that it hears till this common sense interposes its verdict  this makes no addition to the number of our senses whether it be granted or denied it only serves as a new instrument to account in some dark manner for their operations and perhaps it is owing to this medium or canal among other things that having two eyes and two ears we do not see nor hear double  many other things belong to the animal life which we may call indifferently sensations actions powers faculties physicians speak of the action of the stomach as well as that of eating and drinking what name shall we give sleeping which puts a stop to most of our powers and actions what shall we say of hunger and thirst some have called them internal senses sensations they are at least and sometimes extreme pressures and our pleasures arise mostly from such uneasy preceding sensations thus rest and motion are agreeable by turns and that faculty of moving from one place to another may be said to enlarge our confinement for we are but prisoners here on earth so that the taking a walk becomes a pleasure were it but in a chamber in short we are so wonderfully contrived that we can hardly speak sense when we attempt to give any description of our selves and must leave many things untouched after all we feel our wants and are eager to satisfy them right or wrong we have indeed strong arguments within us of our indigence without nourishment the poor animal starves in a very little time without sleep he is intolerably uneasy and it is as great a necessity upon him as the former but let us suppose all that is necessary for the subsistence of the animal life meat drink clothes sleep lodging and all these to the full and of the best what should poor man do without objects to entertain the rest of his senses how melancholy must he be and how little joy would his finest ideas often give him i say often because sometimes there is a pleasure in them but no body can promise himself the continuance of that pleasure and sometimes a man would quit it for a pipe of tobacco and if ideas yield to the senses these must yield to the affections for if the affections are not gratified or any one of them that chances to have the dominion for the time what good could the whole earth do us let a man in such a situation try how he can suffice himself and make the best of his selflove that he can he will find so little pleasure from that fountain that he would wish he were out of existence   v imagination l self is indeed a poor center as bacon says but our imagination imposes upon us i know not how   ae we hardly know what imagination is   l it is a dark affair indeed this faculty has such a dependence upon the senses that mr hobbes calls it nothing but decaying sense and he compares it to the tossing of water after the wind ceases but the comparison is lame a thousand things are imagined that never entered into the senses and the images of former impressions are recalled at pleasure  fancy is another word for the same faculty and both words are taken promiscuously for the faculty and the act and sometimes for the thing imagined thus we say a mere imagination a mere fancy  sometimes this faculty is taken for invention and is distinguished from judgment the one laying the materials in order which the other collects and sometimes fancy is taken for choice or taste we say a person of a good or bad fancy   ae i believe the fancy is a real faculty of the soul you know  but know that in the soul are many lesser faculties that serve reason as chief among these fancy next her office holds of all external things which the five watchful senses represent she forms imaginations airy shapes which reason joining or disjoining frames all what we affirm or what deny and call our knowledge or opinion then retires into her private cell when nature rests often in her absence mimick fancy wakes to imitate her but misjoining shapes wild work produces often and most in dreams ill matching words and deeds long past and late par lost b v milton calls it so and describes it finely  it serves to recall the images of things formerly perceived and so they are more languid than in the first impression as the idea of the sun and light is very poor and imperfect at midnight   l but as we can recall absent images they come sometimes upon us uncalled in a very tumultuous and irregular manner and when we would gladly be rid of them so that we may be said to dream even in the daytime it may be called dreaming though we do not entertain these imaginations voluntarily since they are for the most part but castles in the air nor is it future prospects only that intrude upon our imagination there is hardly a trifle that we have done or heard of twenty years ago but what breaks in upon us and often the most unseasonably in the world it is difficult to fix the attention so long as not to wander before the lords prayer can be repeated all which argues some distemper in our internal frame and yet very few i believe are sensible of it   ae that may be called involuntary imagination one and the same faculty may be said to be both passive and active the mind has certainly a power of raising images or appearances of things within itself and it often feels them raised it knows not how  but though we can tell many things the fancy can do it is impossible to tell every thing it adds it pares it joins it separates it mixes it jumbles it builds it razes in short it works wonders in its own shop and the best description will still be inferior to its power it can frame new ideas upon the model of old ones as when we suppose a person we have not seen to resemble one we have seen and when we frame an idea of constantinople from what we have seen of london or perhaps but from a map of london this sort of coining is very often a forging nor must it ever be forgot that such images are quite wrong or rather no images at all that are formed when the particular sense is wanting or hurt as in the known story of the blind man that reckoned scarlet was like the sound of a trumpet   l how the imagination imposes upon us when the senses are entire is still harder to explain but sometimes we say the imagination is imposed upon when it is the sense that is mistaken as when the stick appears crooked in water but the error lies neither in the sight nor in the fancy but only in our pronouncing too haslily hence we may see the advantage of that great rule not to judge according to appearances especially in things relating to religion and common life as to religion it is well known how hastly imaginations or rather hasty conclusions bring all things into calamity and ruin and the bad effects of rash judgment are no less seen in life we see others in a glittering situation we immediately pronounce them happy and by a natural consequence think ourselves miserable if we have not the like finery ben johnson makes fungoso faint away upon seeing another beau get into the fashion before him the same sort of judging obtains in household furniture equipage and titles it is true it may be called staring rather than judging when we have no other standard of felicity but to gape and admire with the mob qui stupet in titulis  but such is really the case and such influence has imagination both on private quiet and the public that the want of a ribbon may endanger a government pride indeed mixes with the admiration from what other source can it proceed that a man in perfect health is not easy to travel the length of a street unless he have a coach and that another is not easy in a very fine coach because it has not a coronet   ae it is this faculty of imagination however that makes the greatest figure in life especially in company and still more when there is a stock of memory along with it it is also the workhouse of poetry and sometimes of politics examples are needless   l to make a figure in company there must be also a stock of confidence   ae nothing truer mean time invention has much the advantage of bare imagination and every man either wishes for it or boasts of it some persons indeed have a very ready talent but even in this readiness of invention a man has nothing to call his own for though expedients come in his head yet he is not master of that art when he pleases and it is a very common way of speaking such a thing did or did not occur so that the hitting on a good thought may be reckoned as much an accident as the unexpected meeting with a friend and then how many things do occur that are very impertinent false humor ribaldry and dull conceits and it is very vexatious when all this is passed for wit   l the chief business of wit seems to be in ordinary conversation and scribbling whereas invention is extended to all affairs and offices in life from the first minister of state to the lowest mechanic or the poorest master of a family   ae rochester has pleasantly observed that riches and power were very unequally shared among mankind but that it was quite otherwise as to wit at least that every one was well satisfied with his own portion of this none thinks the due divisions such his own too little or his friends too much and though his lordship whose share indeed was very great said this only for his diversion yet really the division is more equal than is generally believed one shall hear very good jests and repartees among people of the meanest condition they have their smart lads their witty lasses and their satirical old men   l what passes most currently for wit in this island is properly but humor and often of a very low kind but true humor is when the fancy puts different things together which have no outward resemblance nor connection in nature thus butler says of his learned champion  he knew when butter does refuse to come and love proves cross and humoursome again when things in tolerable esteem are applied to the most vulgar uses for he by geometrick scale could take the size of pots of ale resolve by sines and tangents straight if bread or butter wanted weight   in such a jumble of images some ridicule naturally falls upon one of the things for its being in company with the other and such a merry burlesque vein may be pretty allowable when it brings no contempt on things or persons that ought to be more respectfully treated for in that case it is like the hanging nasty rags upon a fine statue mr hobbes lays down some regulations and remarks with reference to this ticklish affair which show the greatness of his genius beyond many that have succeeded him and which likewise show the unsuccessfulness of any genius when it meddles in a decisive manner with things out of its reach you may compare what he says in the eighth chapter of his leviathan with what he had said of the cause of sensation in the first  the secret thoughts of a man run over all things holy profane clean obscene grave and light without shame or blame which verbal discourse cannot do farther than the judgment shall approve of the time place and persons an anatomist or a physician may speak or write his judgment of unclean things natural things because he is not to please but profit but for another man to write his extravagant and pleasant fancies of the same is as if a man from being tumbled into the dirt should come and present himself before good company and it is the want of discretion that makes the difference again in professed remissness of mind and familiar company a man may play with the sounds and equivocal signification of words and that many times with encounters of extraordinary fancy but in a sermon or in public or before persons unknown or whom we ought to reverence there is no jingling of words that will not be accounted folly and the difference is only in the want of discretion so that where wit is wanting it is not fancy that is wanting but discretion judgment therefore without fancy is wit but fancy without judgment not   ae i was still mightily pleased with that passage   l if many books as well as conversation were examined by that standard they would run a great hazard i would only differ from hobbes in one of his conclusions that judgment without fancy is wit for it is the exuberance of fancy which produces the thing called wit in general the office of judgment being to keep that current within its due limits all poetical compositions whether in verse or prose the adventures of telemachus as well as the iliad or aeneid are works of wit and judgment both but are more properly referred to the class of wit because of the invention and fancy that prevails in them a history is the pure work of judgment and memory but to do mr hobbes justice if wit were taken according to the signification of the latin and french terms ingenium and esprit or according to our english word genius it were hard to refuse the epithet of wit to a good history or to any composition that is good in its kind   ae in comparing poetical works together some of them are observed to abound most in judgment others in fancy as fancy is reckoned to prevail in homer and judgment in virgil in the french performance it is hard to discover whether fancy or judgment prevails most all is so well adjusted tempered and mixed together i do not mean to derogate from the praise given to miltons paradise lost a performance of a quite different nature   l i must own i have often thought milton has given too much swing to his imagination   ae i shall not dispute that with you   l in many compositions humor is what appears more than either judgment or fancy and often it deserves not the name of humor but rather of ribaldry and this observation seems to hold pretty well that wit in the most usual acceptance of it is an edged tool and generally hurtful to those who have most of it it is a sort of involuntary incontinent derisive spirit which must burst out either in conversation or on paper from a mixed desire of pleasing and of being admired accompanied with a certain pleasure of disburthening the same lord rochester says very truly and wit was his vain frivolous pretense of pleasing others at his own expense satyr on man but this desire of pleasing is not very disinterested   vi the passions ae the force and activity of the soul appears much more in the passions than in the bodily senses which are but passive and languid in comparison of those violent commotions or even in comparison of the more gentle affections when the passions break loose they are like hurricanes and eruptions of fire and they are fitly called passions because we suffer under their dominion but then as they are bad masters they are excellent servants as we use to say of fire and water and without passions life would be a very insipid thing for let us suppose a man possessed of a fortune sufficient to give him all the gratifications of the senses and that in the most elegant way imaginable let him have ragouts and burgundy and dogs and horses and what else he has a mind for yet if we suppose him in the bare state of sensuality without love and friendship no desire of knowledge no relish of giving or receiving obligations neither satisfaction in virtue nor indignation at vice such a man would be reckoned by most people to pass his time very dully  on the other hand let us suppose a man heartily animated with one single passion it will keep him at least awake and the prospect of satisfying it will be to him instead of the most delicious sensualities and sometimes instead of the necessaries of life   l it is sometimes reckoned the stronger the passions are the better provided they are under due regulations be angry and sin not but this i suppose can mean only a vigorous constitution of soul to love heartily what we ought to love and to hate heartily what we ought to hate for there must be an exception as to such passions or such forms of them as can produce no good effect for instance fear and revenge the latter is diabolical and the former often very base such a fear i mean as is said to give a body to our imaginations to disconcert our most valuable faculties and which may be called an alienation of mind while it lasts and such a fear also as makes us recede from any duty that would expose us to the censure of the unthinking world such passions we had better wish extinguished  the passions you know are also called affections of the soul for though affection is taken particularly for love which word too has its different significations yet affection or passion denotes any motion or feeling whether agreeable or disagreeable and thus the passions are commonly divided into the concupiscible and the irascible two oldfashioned words but which intimate to us that all the various and variable motions of the soul turn upon these two hinges desire and aversion  this division of our passions or fetching them from two sources gives indeed no idea either of virtue or vice but only a general notion of pleasure and pain in the soul without any consideration of merit or demerit so that there had need to be another division of the passions into the virtuous and vicious but because this way of classing them would be insignificant to those who will not allow the distinction of virtue and vice it will be enough to divide them into the social passions and the selfish or the disinterested and the interested it is true those persons will not allow there is such a thing as disinterestedness neither but they will at least allow there is such a thing as compassion tenderness kindness they may choose their word and so the passions might be distinguished into the kind and unkind which i suppose would pass current with all the world since the greatest advocates for selflove do not deny that men can be friendly but only affirm that their friendship is founded upon their own interest   ae i think this may be said too that as desire and aversion especially when they come the length of passion imply want uneasiness trouble and violent motion in the soul so joy is the satisfaction delight and acquiescence that ensues on our meeting with our desires or even on getting free of our aversions joy is to the soul what pleasure is to the senses and sorrow may be called its pain with this difference that true joy and sorrow of the rational soul are still founded upon reason and in all the passions the will has some more power than in the bodily feelings which we cannot augment nor lessen the greatest stoic must feel the gout the most abstemious recluse cannot put a stop to his tasting while the glass is at his mouth whereas in the passions or feelings of the soul a man can either cherish them and consequently raise them higher or he can make some efforts against them and we see they die the sooner  simple desire and simple aversion are justly reckoned blind and if fancy may be said to enter often into our desires it enters yet oftener into our aversions for we can generally give a better reason why we like than why we dislike so that many of our aversions are much owing to some disorder in ourselves or our being out of tune which appears remarkably in those aversions and disgusts that are personal   l i believe hope and fear issue from desire and aversion according to the views or the apprehensions which the mind has of meeting with things agreeable or vexatious hope and fear therefore are supposed to be attended with some reason the pannick fear excepted as before because it concludes the dreadful thing to be already present our hopes seldom impose so far upon us though they rise very high and from very narrow foundations in some tempers and not the worst ones neither but if we consider hope as a rational expectation of the mind it will rather come under the list of the virtues than of the passions  the natural fear of death is wisely implanted in us for the preservation of our bodily frame and neither the fear of death nor of pain is shameful unless it make us shun what we ought to do or do what we ought to shun luxury and soft living must necessarily increase fear and magnify danger as it is told of an honest gentleman who thought to have joined king charles i but could not resolve to lie out of his own bed   ae poor gentleman   l i was thinking that as the mind from simple desire and aversion appetite and abhorrence proceeds to hope and fear so when these are accomplished or come to their period it would seem to proceed no farther but to rest on the enjoyment or in the affliction though affliction or sorrow is not properly a state of rest   ae joy no doubt is acquiescence and delight when we are told that joy is of short continuance i suppose we are to understand it of the pleasure of the senses and of the imagination for the soul seems to be capable of infinite joy both as to duration and extent and no less capable of sorrow   l but how hard is it to give the anatomy of the soul and to reduce all its motions into a regular system i know not whether our terms or our ideas fail us soonest how many little bastardpassions are there that go under the name of illhumour fretting disgust chagrin contradiction etc shall we refer these to the article of anger or of pride or are they not rather made up of both  however we must never blame nature as if she had put so many sources of trouble and disquiet within us for we have likewise other sources or funds of satisfaction if we would cultivate them faithfully but this we can never do till we endeavor to change the principle of our desires and actions   ae i confess it is the principle or cause our passions proceed from that makes them deserve either praise or blame thus grief is shameful when it proceeds from the loss of money but honorable in the loss of a friend   l numberless observations might be made on the passions each whereof would require a book if one was to consider their rise their progress their decay their extinction their rising again their giving way to other passions quite opposite their combinations their force their subtilty their enchantment etc all which are but the different turnings of human nature   ae the duke of rochefoucault would throw them all into the bottomless pit of selflove   l it will be good to consult the best authors who have wrote of our several powers and propensions if they write good sense and make a true report of nature whatever their profession be clergyman or laick and the sex by no means to be excepted since we have from their hands some of the finest compositions upon the most delicate and important subjects  indeed the passions like every thing else are better known by feeling than description what better can be said of love than that it is love it is difficult even to give a list of them nor do i find people agreed either as to their number or their classes   ae leviath chapter   mr hobbes has treated of a great many motions of the soul under one head of the passions and the long train he there mentions are but modes and diversifications of five or six primary motions which he calls the simple passions and perhaps fitly enough viz appetite desire love aversion hate joy and grief i think he proceeds in his scheme thus  appetite with an opinion of attaining is called hope   the same without such opinion despair    sudden courage anger   constant hope confidence of our selves    desire of good to another benevolence good will charity if to man generally goodnature    he discusses other passions or tendencies after the same aphoristical manner and it would seem just as they have come into his head such as ambition pusillanimity magnanimity valor liberality miserableness churlishness love jealousy curiosity religion pannick terror glory dejection laughter shame impudence pity cruelty emulation envy he speaks of certain tendencies that i do not remember and i wonder he said nothing of others since he was giving the history of man for instance affectation but it is hard for one to know what he should write or what he should not write and there is something so like pedantry in all those discussions that perhaps mr hobbes has been glad to dispatch them off as soon as he could and it must be owned he often writes in a very natural way i cannot however subscribe to all his aphorisms or definitions for instance that constant hope is a confidence in our selves for it may proceed as naturally from a confidence in another and as to religion he places both the true and the false only in fear fear of power invisible feigned by the mind or imagined from tales publicly allowed religion not allowed superstition and when the power imagined is truly such as we imagine true religion   l a poor account of true religion   ae we find by experience that the passions domineer by turns and when two or more of them are in competition at once the weakest must certainly yield unless reason interposeth but the duke of rochefoucault observes that sloth or indolence though it deserves not the name of a passion often gets the better of them all and triumphs equally over our vices and our virtues  there is another of his maxims which i cannot so easily join with that the passions are but different degrees of heat and cold in the blood that i think were a little too mechanical though we are undeniably under a sort of mechanism and are drawn like puppets by strings as antoninus has expressed it we may be literally said upon some occasions to be transported and inflamed nothing is more common even in the sacred writings than such expressions   l the degrees of every passion are infinite a man may easily suppose himself capable of greater sorrow or greater joy than ever he has yet felt and an extreme violence of any one of the passions is more than enough to separate the soul from the body   vii complexion disposition humor ae the constitution of the body is reckoned to depend much on the fibers the blood and the solid parts and the fluids from the good or bad temperament or habit of all which we may expect the better or worse health the longer or shorter life the complexion implies something more akin to the soul though it seems also to depend on the more or less happy mixture of the elements and certain chemical ingredients in us   l there is a strange variety among mankind but to give the preference to one complexion above the rest might be thought too forward and partial each complexion has its advantages and each has its defects the sanguine person would think it hard to be reproached for the hastiness of his temper which sometimes indeed flies out like gunpowder but when he cools and comes to himself he is all kindness and civility it is most advisable for the complexions not to dispute too much about their several prerogatives for in all such reckonings each party comes off with loss   ae and there is nothing a man disparages in another that he has not a part of himself and sometimes the largest part   l the complexion and disposition seem to differ in this point that the latter is a more internal thing than the former we shall find two persons equally sanguine or equally phlegmatic and yet the one remarkably prouder than the other pride is not reckoned a complexional thing but to lie deeper in the soul the same may be said of covetousness and some souls have a remarkable tendency to some predominant thing almost from the cradle   ae but whatever inclination prevails in the soul for the time being the wits are set at work to bring it about men are both drawn by pleasure and pursue it the same person as it were going out of himself for what he cannot find within it is true it is for his own sake that he goes thus out of himself but then he often goes on the errands of a fool or a madman so that the term selflove might be with as great propriety changed into selfwill and it is in this view that the duke of rochefoucault takes it when he says it will pursue things not only frivolous but destructive merely because it will   l this quality of the mule must be purely unreasonable and butler says excellently for obstinacys never so stiff as when it is in a wrong belief but it is not always from pride that this obstinacy arises for it acts often without any reflection on its own qualifications or any regard to consequences   ae there is another disposition no less hard to account for not less hard to conquer and that is inconstancy the soul grows weary and loathes and knows not why the object has lost nothing of its agreeableness and yet can no longer pleased and this happens as suddenly as frequently dispensary new passions new opinions still excite and what we like at noon we loath at night heaps of verse and prose might be produced on this subject and it may be said the passions and opinions excite one another though the passions or inclinations are the greater favorites and rochefoucault we take it more impatiently to have our inclinations condemned than our opinions we are also for the most part as forward to show our opinions as we are unwilling to show our inclinations in which respect these last may not be very ill compared to a dirty shirt   l though it is not possible to find words for all the motions of the soul yet we may discover what things men are most naturally carried to when we discover their differences of complexion and disposition and it were very profitable for us to make those discoveries at home but we are seldom at leisure for that nor indeed is the study very agreeable the patrons of selflove would have fewer proselytes if people were more inclined to selfexamination but whether we look at home or abroad the nature of things will continue the same and we may make this general conclusion as to the difference between the complexion and the disposition that it is the complexion which makes us quicker or slower warmer or colder and the like as it is from the disposition that we are more or less proud humble cruel mild covetous honest and whatever falls under the denomination of vice or virtue   ae the knowledge of tempers and dispositions seems to be very necessary for a first minister in order to deal with his particular men to gratify one with money another with a ribbon and so on   l some are even gratified with a nod or a smile   ae humor is a word that seems to imply something different both from complexion and disposition which are reckoned settled things whereas humor changes like the weather and may be called the mother of freaks whims frolicks and even of moaping the reverse of these good humor or good temper is more properly good disposition and to be in good humor and goodhumored are different things the worsttemperd person being sometimes in good humor but in all the turns and casts of human nature whatever source they come from there is such an endless variety that every person may be justly called an original   viii liberty after what we have observed of the passions and inclinations their insinuating power and open violence and from what is daily to be seen in the world we might be induced to think there is no such thing as liberty in man but that he were a piece of clockwork or an engine actuated by fire wind or water  ae some have refused liberty even to the deity subjecting their jupiter to fate and our moderns borrow from old opinions  others thinking liberty the prerogative of the almighty alone cannot allow it to mankind lest their abuse of it might seem to alter the purposes of heaven or lest too much should be ascribed to creatures in procuring their own happiness but no such consequences can be apprehended from all the liberty that we suppose to be in weak man it is nothing but such a power as the opening or shutting his eyes not of seeing without light a power only to accept or reject what is freely offered him and which he could by no means furnish to himself no more than he can make the fruits to grow for the subsistence of his natural life though few will deny that he can sow and plant   l liberty no doubt is a pure gift from heaven and in all creatures it is only a power to use their faculties for the purposes they were given in this general acceptance of it the meanest creature that has life has liberty and we see among beasts and birds great marks of deliberation and choice   ae in rational creatures liberty must be supposed not only as a foundation of virtue but of reason itself since the nicest engine in the world cannot be said to act rationally nor so much as to act freely mr hobbes indeed proposes to reconcile liberty and necessity by the comparison of a river which is said to run freely when nothing hinders its course but this is mere playing with words a river will hardly be called a free agent and i think it may be affirmed that those who make selflove the sole spring or motive of human actions allow no more liberty to a man than to a river there is only this difference of consciousness between them the one knows what it is doing the other not but both are under a like overbearing unvirtuous necessity   l another term for liberty is free will which imports no more than a freedom of choice but sometimes people confound the will with the inclinations and these having so much the upperhand in us it is no wonder if liberty is absolutely denied but as we do many things from our inclinations so we do many things against them but can strictly be said to do nothing against our will  for he that swears against his will is of his own opinion still  it is but a jest that butler says on swearing the acting against our inclinations is a pretty good proof of our liberty   ae the term liberum arbitrium supposes the understanding to act without any bias or rather without any thing that may darken it in which case it may be said to act freely and necessarily both freely because it is not hindered as mr hobbes says of the river and necessarily because its nature is to see and judge but there is still a further power of choosing after all trial and examination is made if it be alleged that this choice it self is determined it may be asked by what iftis by the reasonableness of the thing then the choice is as it ought to be but it cannot be said to be necessarily determined because it might have been and often is otherwise that is contrary to reason   l man then seems to have got a power or a spring within himself to determine him if this spring be called the will it must be free since a forced will is no will   ae the unhappy disputes concerning liberty being rather with reference to things moral than natural it might help to shorten them if it were referred to every mans breast whether in any thing he ever did that was wrong he could not have done otherwise unless this question be answered in the affirmative what foundation can there be for remorse or even for guilt or for justice in punishing it all divines admit of moral evil wherein can it consist but in the abuse of liberty or the making a wrong choice st augustine searching for the origin of sin lodges it only in the free will of the creature being well assured that blame which must fall somewhere cannot fall on the author of all good the gnostics indeed maintained with a bare face that god was the author of sin and it is probable the absurdity of that thought has given rise to the other the two eternal principles   l the scripture too always speaks of man as a creature endowed with freedom of choice hence so many exhortations threatenings expostulations and express declarations of his liberty and that his ruin is only of himself many texts might be adduced but i shall only read you a few lines of milton who founds the most of that excellent work of his on scripture authority he supposes the almighty to declare that man will be deceived by the suggestions of a more crafty revengeful spirit  paradise lost book iii l    so will fall he and his faithless progeny whose fault whose but his own ingrate he had of me all he could have i made him just and right sufficient to have stood though free to fall such i created all the ethereal powers and spirits both them who stood and them who failed freely they stood who stood and fell who fell not free what proof could they have given sincere of true allegiance constant faith or love where only what they needs must do appeared not what they would what praise could they receive what pleasure i from such obedience paid when will and reason reason also is choice useless and vain of freedom both despoiled made passive both had served necessity not me they therefore as to right belonged so were created nor can justly accuse their maker or their making or their fate as if predestination overruled their will disposed by absolute decree or high foreknowledge they themselves decreed their own revolt not i if i foreknew foreknowledge had no influence on their fault which had no less proved certain unforeknown so without least impulse or shadow of fate or aught by me immutably foreseen they trespass authors to themselves in all both what they judge and what they choose for so i formed them free and free they must remain till they enthrall themselves i else must change their nature and revoke the high decree unchangeable eternal which ordained their freedom they themselves ordained their fall the first sort by their own suggestion fell selftempted selfdepravd man falls deceived by the other first man therefore shall find grace  ae happy genius   l it would be an idle thing to make any commentary upon so clear sense it must only be remembered that the liberty of created beings is rather a power of making themselves miserable if they will needs do it than any power of making themselves happy though they have ever so great a mind without a higher support and a compliance with the conditions upon which happiness is yet before them   ae these two words fate and fortune ill understood have helped to perplex men in their disputes upon liberty and other subjects neither of them are words current in sacred writ but fate which is the same thing as edict is sometimes taken for the decree of the supreme being as it relates to the happiness of intelligent creatures and it is also considered as the settled order of nature and the connection of causes with their effects a stone goes to the bottom whilst a piece of wood floats above the fire melts metals hardens the clay and reduces wood to ashes and nature is another word for this constitution of things to use scriptureimages if a man takes a coal in his bosom he must be burnt with it and if he touches pitch it will stick to him such necessary consequences might therefore be called fate and eternal decrees to which may be added the pleasures and pains of the mind from a review of its good or bad actions remorse is an natural as sickness and the torture of the mind may become so great that a man may be said to be in hell   l all such consequences and the whole course of nature are really of the divine establishment and liberty is so in a particular manner so many faculties without the power of using them to the right purposes would be a much sorer evil than what solomon observed of a man to whom god had given riches but had not given him power to eat thereof but the last part of the verse is not to be precisely taken for the gifts of god are complete and perfect you know what  prudentius has said on this head of liberty after he had laid the objection as strong against it as possible and it seems homer has had it much at heart that the abuse of liberty should not be charged against the gods perverse mankind whose wills created free charge all their crimes on absolute decree is it not so that mr pope has it   ae i think so some have made strange work with the decrees of god   l but those opinions are wearing out in this island   ae the word nature has also occasioned disputes among men some having confounded it with the author himself whereas it is only to be looked upon as his divine art some of the stoics failed much in this point and spinoza improved upon it to the total exclusion of the deity all that nature implies is but the birth or production of things which still supposes a producer or author who was according to the expressions of the psalmist before the mountains were brought forth   l fortune is a more insignificant term than either nature or fate juvenal says it is only we that make her a goddess and indeed when the word is rightly considered there is nothing at all in it no more than in chance hit accident and the like which can produce nothing as all the different materials for building collected together could not put up the house without the contriver and the workman there is a trifling exception of a pencil apelles is said to have thrown in his anger which performed what he wanted to have added to the piece but it is to be remembered the colors were already prepared by the hand and the pencil thrown by it so the hand still gave the direction though out of the common way there is a large field for such accidents as that if we consider the freaks of man and the present state of things instances of successful rashness are very common   ae sometimes our exterior situation or circumstances in this life is called fortune and some persons being so unexpectedly raised and others depressed without much to be ascribed either to their skill or merit those who have not recourse to providence are induced to think with sallust that fortune certainly rules in every thing but there is no loss though particular words stand if people are but convinced of an invisible unerring direction and superintendency in the government of the universe and in the concerns of every individual person our savior has designed we should be much persuaded of this when he told us the hairs of our head are all numbered   l the belief of an overruling providence is mighty comfortable and liberty is very consistent with it it is agreeable to find that gift asserted for without admitting liberty men can hardly be brought to condemn themselves it is only the atheists that formally deny it others dispute rather about the extent and the consequences of it but it is remarkable that the same milton makes those disputes the amusement of some of the fallen angels and so an amusement one would think to be avoided others apart sat on a hill retired in thoughts more elevate and reasoned high of providence foreknowledge will and fate fixed fate free will foreknowledge absolute and found no end in wandering mazes lost    ix reason ae hitherto we have chiefly considered human nature with reference to the senses and affections according to that division of body soul and spirit the last of which i will be glad to have your opinion of for though the soul is often taken for the highest thing that can be supposed in man and is to be considered as an immortal thinking principle of an inexpressible activity and of a quite different creation and constitution from unactive lifeless matter yet according to the plan above mentioned there is a superior region in man called indifferently by the philosophers mind spirit or the governing part and what they call spirit st paul takes in a higher sense still   l here is my opinion without ceremony in the body itself mention is made of three regions the belly the breast and the head which bears some analogy to the senses the affections and the understanding but as there is no fixed standard for most words sometimes the heart and sometimes the bowels is made use of to signify those sentiments of tenderness and pity and also the seat of them the head being generally taken for the seat of the judgment as well as for the judgment it self  according to these three regions in the body the pleasures are generally classed and denominated those of sense being the lowest are sent down to the belly whose god is their belly says st paul and he gives a character of the inhabitants of crete  tit      from one of themselves the chinese god of pleasure is also represented like a dismal creature all belly but these representations and expressions are only figurative and not designed to be taken according to the precise letter the pleasure of the taste it self is far from the belly the pleasure of the eye has yet less connection with it so that the epithet of the cretians seems designed to express their luxury in general though perhaps they have been particularly remarkable for eating and drinking  meantime the body which we study to soak in pleasure like a sponge is of it self but a mere dead husk and drops off at last and a man reckons upon it no farther than as a machine for bringing him pleasure and would sometimes be content to change it for another body if he could and does often wear it out before its natural period  but to come to the highest region in man the mind or understanding is considered as a principle of light or discerning as the senses and affections are supposed to be blind the mind sees the order and value of things their relations and properties and this either by immediate intuition like the bodily eye or by a sort of process which considers one thing after another and so is called both reasoning and reason  thus reason or judgment is taken both as a faculty and as an act we say a person of judgment or of no judgment a judgment given and the like  you know reason is also taken for the cause or motive as such a law is founded upon such a reason and such a thing has no reason in it or no sense in it the same words are used promiscuously for different things and it is but a dry affair to adjust their significations   ae it seems one great use of the reasoning faculty is to supply the want of intuition which is seeing at a glance for this purpose the mind puts things in a certain order as figures in cyphering that we may find out the sum the remainder the proportion or whatever we want to know about them these three operations of numbering weighing and measuring seem to answer to the several exercises of reason and so it is compared sometimes to a balance sometimes to a line  reason then must fall into the grossest mistakes when it meddles in things beyond its line or out of its sphere in this case it is like an incompetent judge and the conclusions must be absurd quam pene lapsu pes mihi lubrico gressum fefellit dum pede metior immens parvo dum trutina mea expendo stultus judicium dei    causas latentes dum sequor anxius et pertinacis viribus ingeni pugno profundum se chaos ingerit et nocte mentis lumen ad obruit  buchanans paraphrase on the seventythird psalm is very applicable to this purpose it mistakes also in things within its sphere when it is imposed upon by the affections like a judge that is corrupted and nothing is truer than that observation the understanding is the dupe of the inclinations   l but the understanding or reason however often misled may still in some respect be called the leading faculty and supposed to be free of any bias all light without any heat pure deliberation assenting denying choosing rejecting etc imply the operation of the head only as if the heart had no interest in the thing for certainly we judge thus coolly on some occasions and as liberty was considered but as a power to make use of our faculties in general so the last step of reason is to make its choice which it does in sound unbiased minds according to the nature of things or in other words according to the truth  at present we are supposing reason to be entire so far as it goes without considering the narrowness of its limits nor the clogs that are upon it nor whether these clogs are most owing to the appetites or the passions all such discussions are endless  taking reason therefore only for the natural light of the mind we may well enough conclude that natural truths or principles belong to it as visible objects belong to the eye knowledge is but the seeing things as they are or in the way they are designed to appear to us for strictly speaking we see few things as they really are no more than we see the sun in the firmament as he is   ae we may thus have some little idea of faith reason and revelation the last of which like the drawing of a curtain gives a discovery of what the natural powers of man or the present frame of his understanding could not find out by revelation men might be informed of the state of things past present and to come of things relating to the visible world and the invisible of things in earth and things in heaven  we may likewise see how faith is taken in different senses one acceptance of it is trust confidence dependence another acceptance is honesty and fairdealing bona fides but the acceptance relating most to the present purpose is that divine conviction of the understanding whereby we cannot refuse our assent and though we see but through a glass darkly as st paul says and how few see like him yet the least remove from infidelity is a kind of faith and if there is but an honest heart to receive it into it will grow like the greatest trees from the least of seeds nor is a man to be discouraged if he does not perceive its growth and even though he should think he had no faith at all such a dark uncertain state as it is very afflicting may perhaps also be purifying but to say the truth most people are in the contrary state rather inclined to think their faith greater than it is than less and such persons would do well to consider what faith is and examine their own by st pauls definition who calls it the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen we ought to take great care that our faith be not found to be bare opinion  thus we see also that there is a difference between faith and reason or that some things are spiritually discerned and others naturally i only wish it were considered how religion and society suffer by setting these two gifts at variance religion suffers when things are obtruded as articles of faith and an assent required to them under the highest pains without satisfying the mind that such articles are of the boasted importance or even that they are not repugnant to common sense it is true religion cannot properly suffer but society or the particular members of it suffer many different ways persecution and obstinacy mutually exciting each other all histories ecclesiastic and civil are the melancholy registers of mutual oppression bigotry and contempt among all parties and yet all parties must make use of reason either true or false when they argue for their faith otherwise there must be nothing for it but an act of parliament and a standing army the protestants are professed admirers of reason their faith hangs upon it and the papists who say they believe upon the authority of the church must make use of reason to prove the church is infallible   l religion even suffers by such disputes and hatred in so far as occasion is given to its professed enemies to despise it and to the negligent part of mankind to be still the more careless about it i have interrupted you   ae to see things as they are even the things of nature there must be another light than the natural how little do we know about the things we see and handle only some of their outward properties color hardness and the like as mr lock instances in gold its yellowness ductility and other qualities without any knowledge of the essence as it is called or the substratum again how little do we know about ourselves can we tell as dr garth says why paler looks impetuous rage proclaim and why chill virgins redden into flame etc and dr burnet who was as much a freethinker as a man should be takes notice how little we know of things that are objects of faith shall i read you a few of his elegant expressions   l with all my heart   ae  these revelations as most in sacred writ are short and incomplete as being designed for practice more than for speculation or to awaken and excite our thoughts rather than to satisfy them accordingly we read in scripture of a trium deity of god made flesh in the womb of a virgin barbarously crucified by the jews descending into hell visibly ascending into heaven and sitting at the right hand of god the father above angels and archangels these great things are imperfectly revealed to us in this life which we are to believe so far as they are revealed in hopes these mysteries will be made more intelligible in that happy state to come   that article of the crucifixion and the other of the ascension are indeed two points of fact which reason may be satisfied about by enquiring into the character of the witnesses and other things relating to proof the crucifixion is a piece of history and a much less surprising event than the ascension but the mystery is that such a barbarity should have been permitted against the son of god this is to the jews a stumbling block and to the greeks foolishness and so a new enquiry arises if jesus christ was the person aimed at in the prophecies to be satisfied about which the prophecies must be considered and the old and new testament compared together and both these with the doctrine and the works in all such things reason may modestly exert itself and we are guilty of sloth if it be not exerted but we must be in the dark about many things still so the doctor subjoins  in like manner how little is it we understand concerning the holy ghost that he descended like a dove upon our savior like cloven tongues of fire upon the apostles  these things we know as bare matter of fact but the method of these operations we do not at all understand who can tell us now what that is which we call inspiration what change is wrought in the brain and what in the soul and how the effect follows  these things we see darkly and hope they will be set in a clearer light and the doctrines of our religion more fully expounded to us in that future world etc theory of the earth  this is an instance of great honesty in that ingenious man so frankly to confess his ignorance when far meaner heads take upon them to explain the deepest mysteries as a strange turn appears in others who will not admit of the possibility of a thing because they cannot conceive how it is reason would at least tell them thus much that every thing is possible to the almighty which does not imply a contradiction   l it must certainly be very ill service done both to religion and society to make an opposition between faith and reason as if they were two contraries like white and black or fire and water whereas they seem to differ more in the degree than in the kind the natural light itself being from god as well as the divine there is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and then the same thing may be the object of faith and reason both for instance the fall of adam it is indeed revealed as a fact that has happened and is consequently an object of faith we do not hear that it occurred to the philosophers though something like it is implied in the opinion of the preexistence of the soul and this ignorance of the fall made their systems so imperfect and clashing but after getting a hint of that unfortunate history many men are satisfied of the truth of it by their natural reason as they are also of the creation of the heavens and the earth and this may be called a mixture of historical and rational faith but cannot be said to come up to divine faith which carries along with it a more forcible conviction and may be reckoned such a thing as the  intellectual sensation of the platonists   ae however the faith of common christians is not to be despised our saviors disciples believed in him because of the miracles they saw him perform this does not derogate from the divine operation upon their hearts but it was very natural for them to think and reason with themselves that no man could do such works if god was not with him but he says himself upon another occasion to st peter that flesh and blood had not revealed these things to him etc   l it is no better service done religion and society to put faith and works at variance together there is a natural enough agreement between the two if the scriptures were well considered and they may be said to be two things god has joined and which therefore no man ought to separate st james and st paul are in perfect harmony with one another and with the rest of the apostles upon this subject faith without works is dead that is without the works of charity the works st paul seems most to run down in his disputes with the jews are the works of the law upon the observance of which they valued themselves to an excess as they did also upon their free will and natural powers which perhaps may be a key to some of the darkest of that apostles writings you may consult smiths discourses   ae it is remarkable that both the partisans of faith and infidelity have high pretenses to reason and each side accuses the other of pride and laziness it is certainly as reasonable to assent when the proofs are clear as to deny when they are not and to be in suspense when the probabilities seem to be equal but i know not how it is thought a prettier thing to contradict than to agree to received opinions and so it is natural for those who set up to make a figure in the world to fall into that way as it is as natural too not to be at much pains to enquire into the proofs and presumptions that are adduced excepting always out of the number of the lazy some laborious old unbelievers who are as indefatigable as missionaries   l there is still a worse quality in man than the two former which is insincerity but as this character is not levelled at any particular person it is so very base in it self that i shall not insist any farther upon it   ae what is best and highest in man is certainly the most agreeable to be thought on he has a mind made for the search after truth the discovery of it and the delighting in it and all this may be granted even to the natural man we have st pauls word for it that the gentiles who had not the law did by nature the things contained in the law but he tells us also the natural man knows not the things of god and even that they are foolishness to him upon which account the natural man if he would be a wise man ought to be very humble and though he had come to all the knowledge and virtue of st paul himself to follow his advice to take care lest he fall  in short as the natural understanding or the mind was considered by some philosophers both as the discoverer of truths and the director of the affections and the horses will be confessed to be very unruly so the spirit in st pauls sense must be looked upon as the director of the understanding it self and as it were a deity within us and those philosophers even looked on man as a temple where some divine genius resided and have almost made use of st pauls expressions grieve not the spirit etc   l what if this should be called enthusiasm and a high flight   ae if it should let st paul and the philosophers answer for it it is indeed a high flight if men can get into that true spirit to see things as they are to put the estimate upon them they deserve to love them according to their dignity and from the proper motives this is truly a flight above selflove and what human nature as it is now fettered cannot possibly attain unto without superior assistance but the bare speculation of the thing is no more than one of those truths or principles which natural reason can be convinced of   l but as to the comparison of faith and reason when they are considered as two lights of the mind the principal difference between them seems to be with relation to their objects the natural man receives not the things of god this natural man is not denied by the apostle to have the faculty of reason but for all that the things of god are foolishness to him and he adds neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned there must be another faculty therefore in man for knowing the things of god whatever term be used to express it and so the spirit of man may be said to receive intelligence from the spirit of god concerning such things as his natural understanding is not capable of  i should not indeed wish to add to the number of our faculties since it were the same thing as to our happiness whether we had many or but one if that one could perform all the offices of the rest so if it be alleged that what is called divine illumination is nothing but the making new discoveries to the old natural understanding i should readily enough give up the argument if it were owned that it was impossible for man to make those discoveries himself but then i know not what to make of those express words of st paul above mentioned whose words the clergy at least will grant me are not to go for nothing  but though reason be confined to natural knowledge its province is still very extensive it can examine several things concerning revelation it self for instance this was meant of things proposed to our belief by others and when a man reflects of his own head upon passages of sacred writ if the meaning is not so obvious reason is allowed to examine whether such passages are to be taken in a literal sense or a figurative and if he find it must be the figurative sense then he is to consider what may be couched under the figure it self whether a proposition said to be divine and which really may be so is consistent with what we know already of the divine nature it can also search into records and judge if they are authentic or spurious here is large scope for exercising reason and for baffling it   ae the searching into records would seem the first thing to be done in point of order though few have time for it but providence supplies the loss to the poor and the wellintentiond   l where i said it differed from faith rather in the degree than in the kind i meant not to make their difference consist only in more and less as one man may have more reason than another but that they were both a kind of seeing the one supernatural the other not   x the memory ae they who make the soul to consist of three powers taking the soul in the same sense with the mind and in a direct opposition to the body have classd this power of the memory with the understanding and the will though it does not come up to the dignity of the other two every body complains of his memory but no body complains of his judgment a bad will is the worst of all   l beside the advantage of a good memory as it serves for making a figure in conversation it is still valuable upon better reasons since it may be made a storehouse of the most profitable and agreeable things if it is for the most part but a magazine of trash the gift itself is still to be esteemed and a man has his own bad choice to blame for making such a collection   ae the memory is not only a register of tales and names and fictions the materials of common discourse but may be called a register of every thing that enters into the senses and the imagination but what shall we think of this strange sieve which lets some things pass through and retains others and often retains the most unprofitable to forget is certainly among the defects of our nature and yet as things go it were a kind of happiness to forget the most part of what we hear and we should be at no loss to forget even several things that we read though we may blame our selves more for what we read than what we hear not having at all times the choice of our company   l indeed i have often thought it a misfortune to have a memory of such a cast as not to be capable of forgetting any thing not so much as the poorest scandal a memory of that kind may very well be reckoned an unhappy memory   ae but what shall we think of this odd treasury which retains things during a certain time and then loses them even before the infirmities of age come on we say a thing has dropped out of our head where does it drop and it drops in again when we least expect it what corners do those images lurk in and how do they cast up what portion of matter and of what figure are they united to and what canals are they conveyed in i hardly expect these questions will be resolved and the proposing them is only designed to keep my self in mind of our ignorance both of the defects and the remaining excellencies of our nature   l the memory being considered as a register of things whether perceived or imagined these things are usually called ideas or in plainer english images and are accounted the materials of science when they are exact our knowledge is exact and not otherwise   ae our perception or reception of ideas even in the first instance is but superficial and defective and when we recall them from our memory it is but a picture formed in absence of the original   l as to the first entry of ideas into the mind you know aristotle has been blamed for affirming that nothing is in the understanding which was not before in the senses but there seems to be no great danger in that opinion if we do not limit the senses to too small a number you remember mr lockes account of their entry   ae not well   l it is to this purpose the senses at first let in particular ideas and furnish the yet empty cabinet and the mind by degrees growing familiar with some of them they are lodged in the memory and names got to them etc   ae obscurum per obscurius the question is how this familiarity arises and how the cabinet comes to be sensible of any thing that is put into it a scritore knows nothing of the papers which the careful banker locks up in it or a glass though it may be said to receive the image of a beau and he really sees somewhat of himself in it yet it can hardly be said to see any thing of him it would rather seem the mind had some native light of its own which is awakened we know not how and flies out as it were through the senses to the things it apprehends or lays hold on   l this might be the foundation of a dispute like that they say was in holland whether the bait catches the fish or the fish catches the bait and truly most disputes are of that sort  de lana caprina but one would think it might easily be granted that the mind is of an inconceivable activity and yet may be called passive in its admittance or reception of what comes into it nor does it lay hold and take in at random but has a distinguishing perception of one thing from another to say nothing of a farther power still of judging accepting and rejecting   ae though ideas or images would seem applicable only to the sense of seeing yet all the senses have their respective ideas or notices if the last word be liked better so that one may be said to have the idea of a sound as well as of a sight and on hearing a tune one had heard twenty years before one knows and remembers that it is the very same and so of the rest of the senses   xi speech l mr lock was an ingenious man   ae he was really so pray what account does he give of speech   l i protest i dont know but it is pity this interpreter of the thoughts should not always interpret fairly or that the mind and the words should not agree together but the gift is still to be admired and its uses cannot be thought of without pleasure  to say nothing of the common advantages of speech in the commerce of life how is the mind instructed and calmed by it how sweet are the words of a friend   ae excellent gift ill used the concurrence of all the organs by which speech is formed with the air that carries it and gives it a sort of body would be extraordinary surprising if the thing being so common were not quite overlooked you may see what mr boerhaave has said in his institutions we have so often mentioned where he also refers to dissertatio de loquela a curious little treatise printed at amsterdam in the year   00   l the abuses of speech are but the natural consequences of an unhappy disposition and the tongue is blamed for the vice of the man but the tongue is only one of the instruments of speech though a principal one and may be compared to a pump that brings up either clean water or foul out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks   ae words therefore may be called thoughts in vehicle we find ideas are conveyed to the ear by certain sounds and to the eye by the more arbitrary dashes of a pen or a stamp how minds are agreed about the meaning of these sounds and strokes is not easy to conceive without having recourse to the instruction of heaven in the first parents we see how it goes now by imitation the organs of speech are formed in children by degrees insensibly and their minds ripen the same way to find out the meaning of what is said to them but it is not conceiveable how any number of old people meeting together who had not learned to speak in their infancy should be able to contrive any language at all it would be nothing but cries and signs and confusion for admitting that the strongest and the loudest person should force the rest to call a thing by the same name he took in his head to express it by what should become of all the intermediate parts of speech necessary to connect those arbitrary terms together the invention will appear impracticable on a very little reflection   l i had a little dispute on this head with a friend who thought a language might be artificially contrived but as we could not convince one another nor were at much pains about it we agreed that it might be left as a moot point   ae the use of letters is also reckoned by many to have been taught mankind from heaven for althofigures and shapes like the egyptian hieroglyphics might have been fallen upon to express some precepts and instructions yet this could give no notion of letters which are rather the marks and figures of sounds than of things and here is a great convenience that so few of them are needed so that from the various combination of this small number of characters or letters arises the infinite number of words that make up the different languages and more new languages might arise without end   l those characters are a happy invention for conveying thoughts from one end of the earth to the other thus we are informed of the welfare of a friend in the indies and thus we are instructed as well as delighted it is needless to enter into the abuses of writing and printing so often made the conveyances of error and deceit they proceed like the abuses of speech from a bad heart but the faculties and inventions are still to be valued and admired   xii a review of the foregoing articles ae from what we have observed of man body and soul and all his faculties it will easily be perceived that of himself he is a mere void and all that is in him precarious and dependent  to apply this to the body as it is fashioned we know not how so it must have life infused into it to put it out of the condition of so much dead weight an unactive lump of matter and as life can be called nothing but the inconceivable knot that holds body and soul together so neither can death be called any thing but the dissolution of that union it is but a cessation of life or the retiring of the soul which is often in great concern and horror to think of being driven out of its lodging  animula vagula blandula etc   l poor adrian what did his empire signify then   ae as the body is so dependent upon the soul for its short duration and existence in this world the soul is no less dependent upon the supreme being for all its operations and enjoyments both here and hereafter david says upon good ground he holds our souls in life for though immortality is natural to the soul made after the image of god yet it may be conceived capable of extreme anguish without objects to nourish and delight it so that a state of that kind were rather to be called death than life and is so called in sacred writ   l not only are the objects of our faculties to be reckoned gifts from our creator but the faculties themselves are gifts we see some of them taken away or lost we know not how both the external operations and the internal and supposing them to be ever so durable man is still but a void and so cannot be the object of his own love love always supposes an union with or a desire after some other thing than the subject that loves so that selflove would be found an impropriety if one had a mind to quarrel with common expressions for what is it that a man calls self or himself but a creature endued with certain appetites desires qualities or whatever they may be called and what can he make of himself without objects adapted and proportioned to his wants again what can he owe to himself farther than care and benevolence which every animated creature in some measure has a share of and in which there is nothing to be blamed or praised if it be said a man owes himself respect this is not as he is such a particular person but as he is one of the human species and he had best take care not to think too often of his particular qualifications lest they appear to him greater than they do to others and make him also overlook his defects   ae without all question love is most eminently due to god or he is to be loved with our whole heart strength and mind and this is even reasonable on our own account no other object being able to satisfy our infinite desires as well as just with regard to him inferior rational objects are only to be loved with a love that may be called relative or subordinate as we have often agreed on by which justice and order are not violated   l we only condemned selflove where self is made the center and what is thus condemned is properly selfinterest whatever is loved from that principle is not loved according to justice for the preferring greater delight to lesser and endless joys to transient would indeed argue good judgment but where is the righteousness of it and the piety it is but wisdom for a mans self which sir f bacon calls a left handed wisdom but love makes no bargains and has no limitations moses was willing to be blotted out of the book of life and st paul to be an anathema for his brethren it were strange after two such instances to deny a disinterested love to the savior of the world or to draw inferences from a false reading of a text of scripture as if the love of his father and even of mankind was not the prevailing motive when he made the choice of enduring the cross and despising the shame nor is it any argument against the purity and the force of love that in a competition of eternal and temporal delights as in the case of moses with the delights of egypt the preference is given to the eternal since the clearness of the understanding cannot be supposed to exclude the love and obedience of the heart   ae the dignity of man appears conspicuously in the power of loving and in the object that can only satisfy his love if it centered in himself it would be wretchedly directed and no acquiescence could ensue the lower appetites are satisfied for a time the belly being full demands no more till the digestion is over and the fibers of the stomach irritated anew it is not so with the eye and the ear as solomon informs us nor with the mind neither for it must be constantly amused with new discoveries and tales there is a fund of curiosity in man or a desire of knowing which must be satisfied one way or other so that knowledge may be called the food of the understanding   l natural affection love and friendship are satisfied by the solaces and endearments proper to the soul and body and were it not for the selfish principle many of our satisfactions would be much greater than they are it is true the broken state of things makes all our enjoyments very uncertain and we often find our selves unexpectedly bereaved and desolate but if the highest faculty in man were exerted or which is much the same if his love were principally directed to the highest object perfect satisfaction would readily follow at least man would be in the state of order and where he should be if divine consolations were denied or suspended it would be but for a while and the resigned soul would have contentment in the divine will whatever desertion or pain it might suffer the bearing our natural afflictions is recommended upon the same principle  it must be owned this state of mind in which god is loved for himself is not at present natural like our other desires we naturally love created things or desire them for our convenience but the love of the creator may be called a stranger to us it cannot dwell with selflove for either the one or the other must give place   ae most certainly mean time in this review of man the distinction of body soul and spirit may still be had recourse to or the senses the affections and the understanding this last is called the governing part by antoninus who makes little account of the inferior powers as being in common with the beasts he makes a kind of diffection of some pleasures perhaps a little too far and speaks of them with disparagement but every sensation as well as every motion of the soul is surprising to think of even smelling which is counted the most frivolous of all the senses is of more use than we can imagine and in fact we see it can raise the spirits as it were by magic   l it is generally in favor of the senses that the passions are exerted these are alarmed and rise in arms when our pleasures are in danger it belongs to the understanding to regulate the passions or affections or in other words to keep the pleasures in order for it cannot alter our sensations or feelings and if it be said that the understanding which is but passive it self like the bodily eye cannot be called the leader of the rest of the faculties it must be granted that strictly speaking it is rather the light than the guide for if we consider it in the apprehensio judicium discursus three operations mentioned by the logicians it is still but one light operating in three different manners the governing power therefore must be something of life force and activity which sets all the other faculties at work and though the will is a more vital principle than the understanding and the memory the spirit may be considered as somewhat superior to the will it self since the same person may have a very different will at different times sometimes the will is manageable sometimes obstinate a man will not so much as hearken what is it that makes him reflect and yield sometimes the persuasion is addressed to the understanding sometimes to the heart and entreaty commonly prevails more than reasoning the memory is only applied to as a register   ae shall we say then that there is a first mover within us a mind rector or presiding faculty over the rest indeed we may be indifferent what is concluded in such speculations for it will not alter the state of the things people frequently do speak of such a leading principle and of a spirit in man and then this spirit is as frequently denominated or receives its character from any quality that appears most prevailing not only with regard to the moral dispositions but even the complexion temper genius and whatever is most observable in the person thus we say a proud spirit a violent spirit an active spirit and many other kinds of spirits some better some worse that are to be met with in the world   l to assert the superiority of the human spirit or if it shall only be called the human nature above that of other animals upon this earth has been the endeavor of many persons who i cannot but think have made their system more coherent than those who have endeavored to put men and beasts upon a level some of this last party indeed acknowledge the advantage that mankind have from the frame of the body and its organs which they pretend makes all the difference but what texture of the brain is sufficient to perform all the various operations they assign to it sensation reflection wishing loving hating of what figure are the cells for poetry and those for mathematics and what lodgings of the brain are honesty and knavery to be found in   ae whatever sensations and powers inferior creatures may be endued with the bodily organs are but the instruments of their operations and it must be something even within them that sets those engines a going the be and the elephant have little resemblance of each other in their outward figure and there may be supposed as little in the texture of their brain but each performs very remarkable things for which there had need to be recourse to some inward principle actuating their different machines   l the same conclusion holds as to man whatever is performed in him bateing some actions called vital such as those of the heart and other inward parts is properly the action of the soul upon the body and the change is first made within the soul is touched before the blood flushes out in the face to proclaim either bashfulness or anger and the notion of a contact and reciprocal action betwixt the soul and the body is but a way of speaking for if it were strictly true the soul would depend as much on the body as the body does upon it or rather all would be reduced to body according to lucretius tangere enim and tangi sine corpore nulla potest res the truer philosophy seems to be the body is touched the soul feels tangitur corpus sentit anima  it is pretty evident the soul moves the body as the hand moves the glove but that the body moves the soul is not evident if they say music strikes the soul and raises different passions and music is sound and sound is body and therefore etc it may be granted that bare sensation is excited by the means of bodily things as all sounds make impression upon the hearing but in music you know all ears are not equally affected some people only hearing the bare sound without being sensible of the harmony and so are said to have no ear much less is it mere sound that raises any passion in us but some other thing that we have no name for as it is not mere words that touch the heart even in friendly expressions but the persuasion we have of some friendship designed by them common compliments affecting us but little  but in all this they will say the superiority of man does not appear the beasts having sensations and passions as well as he a dog or a horse is sensible of a kind word and a gentle stroke   ae that is very true but it is seldom affirmed that dogs and horses have as high a sense of friendship as mankind if any were really of that opinion we should easily know what estimate to put upon their friendship   l that which is called moral sense implies both a tenderness of affection and a relish of justice or benevolence and honesty and it is remarkable that this tenderness or benevolence it self must be regulated by justice as appears in that precept not to respect the person of the poor for in a claim of two persons the one in great poverty the other flowing in riches there would be a natural bias in the poor mans favor which would also be increased if he were found to be the honester man and yet both these considerations must be overruled and right take place the same rule every body grants should be followed if a man were one of the parties himself where the benevolent bias may yet be supposed stronger but because of this bias neutral judges are applied to though it has sometimes happened that mutual references have been made by each party to the other and both interests equally safe   ae this shows there is such a thing as disinterestedness and it seems to be the highest quality in man an honest heart implies a great deal nor is there any weight in the objection that this honesty is only from considerations of the next world for such an inclination to justice may be found where the belief of another world is not very strong and if the peevish objection be pushed farther that it is for the sake of a character in this world this is nothing but an assertion without proof and the contrary may be asserted with more probability every one must judge for himself   l what is most valuable in man is certainly his kind affections and his sense of equity he has even inferior faculties which also distinguish him from other animals i wish every body may make the best use of their faculties that they can and that it may be remembered they are all but gifts as well as the objects of them that man consequently is but a mere void and must be miserable if he has not objects to satisfy him that in the placing his esteem and his affection the giver is to be considered above all gifts these and many other truths would naturally present themselves to the mind if it were composed and free of distraction   ae it is strange that so natural reflections come so seldom into the mind they must certainly be very obvious because the very mentioning them is often tedious and shocking   l there are other reasons for that you know people have their heads taken up for the most part with their business or their amusement and then they dont love it should be thought they wanted instruction   ae they shall never be instructed by me   l nor by me but there is no reason why two friends may not talk together of whatever they please   ae i know none   part ii a short account of the world i the world taken in different senses aemilius and lucinus ae sometimes by the world is meant the whole creation visible and invisible it is also called the universe sometimes there is a distinction of the natural world and the moral and among some persons we find much talk of the polite world  the natural world is justly acknowledged to be a beautiful and harmonious system as implied in the  mundus very names of it we are obliged to the astronomers for the accounts they have given of the motions and order of the planets and to the natural philosophers for their discoveries of the productions of this earth but a great deal of beauty lies open to the eye of the simplest beholder the sun and the fields are delightful to the farmer as well as the philosopher every animal and every vegetable have their beauties both to consider them in whole and in the parts that make them up a leaf of the meanest plant is a demonstration of an infinite wisdom   l this earth of ours is but a small part of the world notwithstanding all the disputes about it and often about very useless parcels of it dr burnet theory of the earth speaks of the whole globe as meanly as if it were a turnip the greatones says he slice it among them he shows also the ruins and broken state of it since the flood to which another excellent theorist mr whiston ascribes the same ruins this latter author reckons it has suffered more by the fall than the former takes notice of and not only has the earth suffered in its make and luster but all the creatures upon it are said to groan romans viii    ae there are however great excellencies and beauty remaining in this lower world and no deformity can be found except in the manners of men  it is this moral world therefore we are chiefly to consider in order to discover our duty to shun what we ought to shun and follow what we ought to follow i call it the moral world though there is little morality in it only to show that it is with reference to mens manners or actions that inspired writers exhort us not to be conformed to the world giving us this good reason that all that is in the world is the lust of the eye etc they exhort us it is true not to love the world meaning the love of the creatures as well as the love of the fashion because it is not in their nature to suffice our hearts and they contribute to nourish in us that principle of selflove by which we covet every thing without justice and common sense   ii the world divided into two cities l it is a fine passage of st augustine de civitate dei two loves have made two cities selflove makes the city of the world which is also called babylon even to the contempt of god the love of god which is called jerusalem makes the city of god to the contempt of self he has been very happy in this thought as in many others for it lets us into the causes both of strife and concord in this world and shows the foundation of misery and happiness in the next as we cultivate the one or the other of those two loves or principles   ae selflove will be readily acknowledged to be the cause of strife and confusion in the world if we consider it but in the least impetuous of its streams sensuality but what is meant by sensuality and why is it less impetuous than pride and covetousness sensuality may indeed include the pleasures of all the senses and so the lust of the eye may be sensuality as well as the lust of the flesh and the flesh is often taken for all the desires of the natural man and put in opposition to the spirit but it is probable that by the lust of the flesh st john means what is generally understood by voluptuousness in eating and drinking and all pleasure and indulgence of the body abstractly from elegance and parade which are properly the pursuit of the eye and are peculiar to the human kind as well as pride the beasts contenting themselves with plain sensualities  covetousness supposes both a desire of fine things and a superfluous abundance of them pride a desire of distinction and superiority  sensuality alone without supposing covetousness and pride in company with it is looked upon as an inoffensive thing and if a man falls into intemperance of any kind all the harm is said to be done to himself   l but it rarely happens that sensuality is free of the other two vices our fancy suggests to us imaginary wants and also makes us think nature is not so easily contented as we find upon experience it is thus we covet things both as to quality and quantity and then our pride which is seldom asleep wants to have witnesses of our magnificence and of our elegant taste it is said luxury wants many things and covetousness all things but pride is certainly the most insatiable of the three   ae what is condemned under the name of sensuality is not the sensation of pleasure for there is no crime in feeling but in the exorbitant desire of pleasure and the excess of the indulgence by which the mind is indisposed for other seize antoninus allows man to indulge his nature as he is an animal but with this caution that it make not his nature worse as he is an animal endowed with reason and designed for virtue  in this view the harsh idea of selfdenial would be softened as contributing to our higher interests though its proper and solid foundation is only upon justice   l but why did you call sensuality less impetuous than the two other streams of selflove   ae because we see these make more mischief and desolation in the world particular persons are indeed carried away by certain pleasures but the general competition is for riches and honor wars are now seldom made for a mistress and even few duels are fought in that quarrel   l very true luxurious people may agree together better than the covetous can be supposed to do for the natural effect of covetousness is to disunite and alienate men from one another every individual aiming at nothing less than to engross what belongs to the whole society such men says the prophet would add field to field till there be no place that they themselves may be placed alone in the midst of the earth the covetous man would leave the world to starve whereas the luxurious though without designing it is an instrument in the hand of providence for supporting many who would otherwise be destitute and so luxury in some manner supplies the place of charity indeed the luxurious cannot be acquitted of injustice for it is not fairdealing that one man should drink as much wine or any other liquor as would cherish the hearts of twenty and that the expense of adorning his single person might keep a greater number from going naked   ae of all the three branches of selflove covetousness has something in it so peculiarly grasping and appropriating that a covetous and a selfish person are almost convertible terms what is most remarkable is that this grasping selfish temper sometimes produces a sort of illegitimate selfdenial and renders the poor miser hardhearted and uncompassionate to himself you know how mr lives   l there have been instances of this disease of the mind in all ages ingenious men have exercised their wit upon it long ago but such diseases seldom yield either to raillery or argument   ae in this case money is the object of the love not because it answers all things but because it is money and so this love of money can hardly be reduced to selflove because the desire seems wholly to terminate upon the metal   l it must be granted however that covetousness is for the most part attended with luxury and pride or it may be said as properly to attend upon them for it is very natural for the profuse and the ambitious to desire much money and to take many ways of getting it alieni appetens sui profusus those extremes in catilines character are often united prodigality makes some atonement for covetousness in the world but when this last vice is predominant it is the most contemned of any and is indeed the least restrained by shame and creeps the lowest   ae but at the same time that the love of money is despised the possession of it generally draws respect salust was sensible of this in one of his discourses to caesar where he proposes as a great stop to reformation in the commonwealth to take away the respect given to money pecuniae decus concluding ubi divitiae clarae habentur ibi omnia bona vitia sunt fides probitas pudor etc orat    de rep ordinanda that the paying such honor to it proves the contempt of all virtues but how to bring about that point of reformation is not easy to conceive   l not easy indeed the shortest way to wealth would be plain stealing and robbing but these being too hazardous cunning people have recourse to the safer arts of tricking and deceit and hence all those infidelities in trusts and contracts those disappointments in trade and politics and sometimes this love of money produces disappointments yet more delicate and vexatious   ae is not pride the third branch or stream of selflove the most raging and impetuous of all   l no doubt it makes cities and kingdoms desolate and the earth a field of blood   ae this spirit also discovers it self most universally mr pascal says vanity has taken so firm a hold on the heart of man that a porter or a turnspit can talk big of himself and is for having his admirers philosophers do but refine upon the same ambition  we see therefore that pride which may be called the eldest daughter of selflove has still a more ample dominion than either covetousness or sensuality it enters into the privatest houses it breaks the closest ties covetousness divides friends but pride divides nearer friends   l the difference between pride and vanity is seen in the different appearances of men and sometimes by their appearances we may know what they have most at heart a man that delights in fine clothes shows them upon his back so that vanity consists in outward show and ostentation in general and a mans vanity appears in the finery of his servants and all his parade without doors and within pride is a sturdier kind of thing and lies deeper in the heart thus says the duke of rochefoucault pride always saves its interest even when it renounces vanity   ae sometimes pride aims at dominion over others sometimes barely at their applause and it is strange to see what some people will endure for this light thing selflove or rather pride is said to live upon nothing and to find its account in austerities and voluntary mortifications from that desire of applause though pride seldom takes that way of showing itself in this island  indeed the excessive desire of esteem without doing something for it argues small experience of the world for it is seldom so goodnatured as to give praise for doing nothing   l the desire of esteem and the fancy that we are esteemed are very different things the former may be without the latter but the latter is never without the former   ae as the fancy that we are esteemed when we are not arises from selfconceit so the same turn of mind makes us eager to show our selves upon all occasions we run into every company and affect to shine in every conversation but sometimes we think to show our selves more superior by a profound silence and then we are the proudest   l you are a little severe but whatever way our pride discovers it self to others it must be a torture to the soul that is possessed with it and an inlet to many disturbances of which it may be called the parent the proud man is the aptest to fall into jealousy which he would have to be thought a just concern for a delicate part of his property not perceiving that it is rather pride than either justice or love that tortures him could jealousy be stripped of pride it would neither be so racking nor so ugly   ae but what do you think of envy   l it is a more shameful ulcer of the soul than jealousy and more visibly the effect of pride and the more unaccountable that it grieves at the good of another when we our selves lose nothing by it this it is true is the idea of pure envy but generally there is in it a mixture of other passions which render it somewhat more excusable such as anger or grief arising from competition or disappointment however there is nothing a man labors more to conceal than that he has any envy at all   ae i believe we are at no less pains to conceal our hypocrisy though it is a more voluntary thing and all over art and design rather than infirmity and having a more extensive view than envy it runs more through our whole life and actions   l we are got into a sad field   ae there are other effects of pride more undisputed to wit hatred and revenge the pulpit declares against these and the stage though it does not always speak so dishonourably of them as they deserve yet it shows many of their bad consequences nor does the stage fail to expose ill humor not so much indeed because it is the effect of pride as upon account of the ridicule that is found in it vanity is also exposed upon the same account and this shows us another part of our constitution called shame which some resolve wholly into pride but there is a right and a wrong in every thing we see from stultorum incurata pudor malus ulcera celat again  falsus honor juvat quem hor  and plautus tells us plerique homines quos cum nihil refert pudet etc   fine spirits of old the distinction betwixt two kinds of shame and honor which some moderns struggle hard to get free of and take help from some old hands and they forget another distinction betwixt the sense of shame and the excessive fear of being ridiculed we see how people are laughed out of their virtue and sometimes out of their life they drink for fear of being thought abstemious and they fight for fear their courage should be called in question as my lord rochester honestly acknowledges   l this puts me in mind of a contrary supposition of the characteristicks which does not show so much knowledge of the world i can very well suppose says that i    author men may be frighted out of their wits but i have no apprehension they should be laughed out of them i can hardly imagine that in a pleasant way they should ever be talked out of their love for society or reasoned out of humanity and common sense now an appeal may be made to the world if the reverse of this be true indeed men cannot well be said to be reasoned out of humanity and common sense but they are certainly talked and laughed out of both we have a more natural account from vision of hell quevedo where speaking of those in the righthand way he says some of them stopped their ears and went on without minding our raillery others we put out of countenance and they came over to us   ae it is certainly the fear of being put out of countenance and suffering confusion that keeps mankind especially those who affect most politeness in such a subjection to one another notwithstanding their contempt of one another this is the foundation of many troublesome modes and points of decency invented by no body knows who and yet observed with a rigorous exactness   l it is indeed very remarkable that many who set up for an universal independency and exemption from all rules should be governed at so easy a rate   ae it tends much to preserve some quiet and good order in the world and it is really a satisfaction to observe that vain extravagant man is so easily governed that a straw is sufficient to bind him   l a little experience of the world and careful observation of what passes within our selves where indeed we should properly begin joined to the information of some of the best books and the best company will let us see what the world is and how we ought to behave in it   iii the mixed state of things ae had not the doctrine of the fall some footing among the heathens   l it had but not being so thoroughly received and understood by them the accounts that many of them gave of the world and of human nature were so much the more defective some who have enquired into the sentiments of remotest antiquity inform us there was a pretty general belief of a former state wherein justice and innocence prevailed which they called the golden age without any disorder in the elements perfect health and perpetual spring they spoke also of a revolt which reduced things into the present confusion and weakness and that all would be renewed and brought again into the primitive beauty and perfection  a few indeed among the ancients did argue for the present state of things as if it were the best state they could possibly be in and so they concluded there was no evil nor defect in the universe but that every thing contributed to the perfection of the whole   ae the last part of the conclusion may be true in some sense but what could they make of sickness and death it is hardly natural to say they are things indifferent much less that they are really good every body knows this doctrine of fatality landed in atheism and how spinoza improved the notion of the universe to exclude the maker and governor of it a design antoninus is never suspected of the characteristicks who have taken much of their scheme from that emperor are at great pains to persuade the world that it is they who do the greatest justice to god in banishing evil from the creation affirming that to suppose it to have entered into his works the government of the world is arraigned and the deity made void   l it must be left to the public judgment who are the best apologists for the deity if any apologies are needed they who speak in the common way and acknowledge there is evil both natural and moral or they who acknowledge neither if the inference were certain to wit that there is no god if there be any evil the last part of the proposition would be contradicted by few and truly the arguers against evil expose themselves much to the scorn of another set of people who are as adverse to revealed religion as they themselves can be there is one thing remarkable the old stoics did not deny there was such a thing as pain but only maintained that pain was no evil so if their followers say no further the dispute is only about words   ae we are told by moses that moral evil entered first man abused his liberty and fell into disobedience the fault is specified whatever allegory may be in that history there must be truth also in the letter now the outward state of man being still to be suited to the inward his body to his spirit this spirit is condemned to inhabit a frail heavy body very unlike to what it seems to have been in the first state and stripped of several advantages which the bodies of many animals have at present moreover the earth is said to have been cursed by which a considerable change may be supposed in its beauty as well as its fertility but this alteration is also wisely adapted to the condition of man now become mortal and proud who must work hard both for his life and his humiliation   l st augustine has preserved to us a passage of in libro   de republica tullius hominem dicit non ut a matre sed a noverca natura editum in vitam corpore and nudo and fragili and infirmo animo autem anxio ad molestias humili ad timores molli ad labores prono ad libidines in quo tamen inesset tanquam obrutus quidam divinus ignis ingenii atque mentis   rem vidit causam nescivit latebat enim eum cur esset gravt jugum super filios adam lib   contra jul pelag   cicero which shows at least the present state of man in lively colors it is to this purpose that nature has brought man into the world rather as a stepmother than a mother his body naked frail and infirm his mind anxious timorous and soft prone to lusts but that nevertheless there is a divine fire of genius and spirit though in a manner buried after which quotation he adds  cicero saw the thing but knew not the cause for he was ignorant why the heavy yoke was laid on the children of adam the same father had said in his confessions which some reckon the most useful of all his works confess lib   cap    that man carries his mortality about with him as a testimony that god resists the proud   ae the best authors are far from bestowing flattery upon man you know what dr burnet we must not by any means admit or imagine that all nature and this great universe was made only for the sake of man the meanest of all intelligent creatures that we know of  surely if we made the least reflection upon our selves with impartiality we should be ashamed of such an arrogant thought  man that comes into the world at the pleasure of another and goes out by a hundred accidents  a knock on the head makes him a fool stupid as the beasts of the field and a little excess of passion or melancholy makes him worse mad and frantic in his best senses he is shallow and of little understanding and in nothing more blind and ignorant than in things sacred and divine theor   b c xi says in particular   l i remember some of his words but as to this heavy infirm machine of a body though it is very soon to be void of all sensation and reduced to a state of great disgrace yet st paul informs us it is raised in honor and in another place he says jesus christ shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body   ae as we are informed that mans pride brought such disgrace upon him so we are informed by the same sacred history though in few words that he was tempted and seduced by a spirit of more cunning it is much easier therefore to account for the sin of adam than for that which happened first only st jude speaks of the angels who kept not their first station and a prophet mentions lucifers affecting an equality with the most high by which pride is generally believed to be the first sin but the difficulty still remains how it could ever have entered ingenious men have given their conjectures but it seems to be one of those secret things which belong to god  we know how things stand at present with regard to man all his faculties the earth he treads on and the elements that serve him and often master him it were an endless as well as a melancholy task to enumerate all the infirmities and diseases of the human body alone some of these so very painful and loathsome that nature shrinks at the very thought of them if we are told that pain is confined to that sense alone which is called feeling it is very true that racking pain or torture and indeed all those uneasy sensations which commonly go under the name of pain are confined to that sense the nerves being stretched out of their natural position or whatever be the cause but the rest of the senses have their uneasy sensations too the smell the taste the eye and the ear are grated and offended or in general rendered very uneasy whatever term the uneasiness is expressed by a delicate person would be shocked to find himself led into an hospital or to have a list of diseases laid before him all representations of pain and nastiness are disagreeable two things however the body in its present state is very liable to and the general tendency of all bodies animate and inanimate to corruption and dissolution is very conspicuous   l if the disorders of the mind were inquired into they would be found in no smaller number and the discovery no less unpleasant the disorders of the imagination are the most harmless but often exceeding melancholy to behold as any body will acknowledge who has ever seen a madman even the common distempers of the fancy in those that are not reckoned quite out of their senses we may say in their best senses are not the marks of an original state and it were pretty well if all that could be said of a person were that he is a little fanciful dark sullen peevish are less agreeable epithets unjust and cruel less still  but it is best not to dwell upon evils and what is shocking and afflicting if we turn our eye to the other side we shall find many fine things still left and also be forced to acknowledge that the disagreeable things mixed with them are the effects of wisdom and goodness in the supreme governor whose purposes of doing good remain invariable and whose mercies are over all his works   ae infallibly so the contrivance of the divine artificer appears in the frame of the meanest animal nay of the meanest vegetable which is made up too of its fibers and canals and woven and joined together with order and beauty how agreeable does this still life appear from the cedar to the hysop how gay are the flowers how sweet how refreshing this single subject would be a large province for declaiming to any who had that talent nor is the wisdom less conspicuous in the care taken for the propagation of all these inanimate beauties as so many philosophers and divines have observed whose works are in every bodys hands cicero ray derham and many more  but as the idea of goodness is more endearing than that of wisdom so every thing that has life and fecling does actually feel the effects of the former attribute of the deity and rational creatures both feel and can reflect with pleasure and love it would seem to be this capacity in man that made ovid call him a more holy creature than the rest   l i know not what ovid has meant by holiness but these two words righteousness and holiness are very near akin most actions that are called impure are only such because they are unjust and it were easy to give examples i am still glad to suppose there is some righteousness remaining even after the fall nor will this clash with st peter in the character he gives of the new earth wherein dwells righteousness for though it is to dwell there openly and in triumph a little of it may lurk here under a cloud there is yet some honesty and friendship in the world which is a very useful consideration in a dark fit of the spleen   ae there are really so many good things remaining after the fall that one would sometimes think there had been no curse nor must we take that word for an execration since it is chiefly to be taken for a change to an inferior from a superior state we cannot indeed know how great the change is and it is much for our ease the scripture being so short in the description of the former state to consider only the body though it is called both frail and vile yet still it has its attractions and whatever is shocking about it is well disposed of out of sight to say nothing of the usefulness of those things that may be counted the vilest as the gall it self then with relation to the spirit which inhabits this body as there is a congruity that such a spirit should be so lodged or imprisoned let it be considered what disorders would be committed if this vehicle were not so gross and heavy as it is what would greater degrees of strength and agility have produced but more mischief how good is it for the public quiet that we are subjected to hunger and thirst cold weariness and all the rest and if we are designed for a higher state after this such defects and vexations seem also designed to keep us from doting upon this jayl for as sir thomas more used to say to aim at honors here is setting a coat of arms over a prisongate   l there are so many smiling things still in the world and really pleasant and good that many would wish to live in it for ever even when their share of comforts appears to be very small and when they confess this to be a state of trial and discipline as the state before the fall was a state of trial alone mr lock calls this life a probationership this supposition would be of great use both for regulating our own conduct and vindicating the author of nature when the humor arises of criticizing his works   ae but moral evil say they is harder to digest   l without doubt and it is certainly a more melancholy thing to think of but there is a great difference betwixt some moral evils and others betwixt a flash of anger for instance and deliberate malice those little humors and whims and oppositions of temper so common in the world do contribute to the mutual discipline of its inhabitants beside what they must all suffer from the disorders of the elements and the infirmity of their own bodies indeed when instances of cruelty and fraud are objected this is a greater blot upon the divine workmanship and a severer discipline still but who could ever say he was forced to be a villain did fate or we when great atrides died urge the bold traitor to the regicide the good emperor it is true speaks of mr colliers translation necessary rascals yet any body may take the liberty to say the world would be better without them a government indeed may find some advantage from spies and informers and other servants but those necessary men are only so at times and the ministry could fall on a more agreeable way of employing the money many things therefore called necessary are only convenient in certain situations and cases as one poison is made use of for driving out another   ae we have but one of three opinions to follow that things could not possibly have been in a more perfect state than they are at present or to believe what the scripture says of a fall or lastly to suppose that man was created with all the corruptions of soul and body that we find in us and the earth and all other things about it to have been always as they are at present   l the first opinion will have few followers that know any thing of the world and are acquainted with complaints and groans it is much if the most unthinking beau that is carried in a chair can believe it the third opinion though not blasphemous does not seem honorable for the deity whose works can scarce be supposed to have been made imperfect originally though if that were true it would make no alteration upon the duty of rational creatures who should still do the best they can and struggle with their infirmities and bad tendencies which way soever they have come the second opinion therefore seems most rational that evil has entered though we cannot comprehend how   iv remains of virtue l it is agreeable to leave the gloom and to consider what remains after such a melancholy shipwreck we did not indeed speak much of the fall nor can it be represented by mortals if such an event had been capable of description miltons imagination had bidden fair for it pascals reasoning to evince the fact art iii and elsewhere from the contrarieties of human nature is very fine   ae all he writes is so   l but to come to what remains after the sad overthrow external nature is generally granted to abound with good things no body denies the beauties of the spring summer and harvest the winter itself has its beauties the great dispute is concerning the moral state and two sorts of authors are at war with one another upon this point the controversy was pretty ancient as pascal observes between the stoics and epicureans and other clashing sects of philosophers among the moderns the duke of rochefoucault is thought too rigid in his sentiments upon virtue but he only reckons the thing a greater rarity than the pretenses to it monsieur bail is indeed severer and seems to resolve it wholly into complexion and education upon which a delicate affair the womens chastity has been brought upon the carpet bail may be put at the head of the moderns who strike against virtue in general and my lord shaftesbury because of his quality may get the command of the other party who reckon the balance of the passions may be so easily kept and all the virtues to be of our own growth   ae it may be granted to the severe men that whatever is the bare result of complexion is no virtue it is but a mechanical sort of thing nor can it be called vice neither as being but a tendency of nature to its relief or pleasure without any reflection of the mind upon the moral good or evil one may have naturally a greater thirst than another and drink more to satisfy it and yet be as sober as the other there are very different constitutions in both sexes and it was an injury done the women to place their chief virtue in the point of chastity as if it were their greatest difficulty and trouble whereas men have much more to struggle with of that kind and indulge themselves without much blame from the world the sex are at another loss in that way of reckoning they are tempted to believe this single virtue may give them a dispensation from observing all the rest the men therefore have themselves to blame in making their system of virtue so imperfect which seems to have arisen from their jealousy and pride   l some of bayles followers have kept no measures with the sex at all and would seem to have forgot the difference betwixt being capable of love and being lewd he at least keeps the appearances of civility and is much more a master in the art of this comedy deserves not to be forgot mons bail was accused before the divines of rotterdam for advancing unfound doctrine in his pensees diverses in his continuation of those thoughts he answers mons jurieus accusations and i believe quotes him fairly jurieus words are he pretends that the virtues of christians do not proceed from a principle of religion but only from fear the love of worldly honor and other worldly principles a scandalous proposition which destroys all virtues as if there were no true christians see the causes he gives of the chastity of women he treats that matter after an impure and scandalous manner pretending that women are not chaste through virtue and religion  bail answers of all that my accuser has done this is what confirms me the most that he is like the unjust judge who feared neither god nor men for if he had had any respect for the public and any concern for reputation would he have dared to suppress the exceptions i always made did not i positively except the truly faithful and the true religion i renew my declaration in these terms i have declared already and declare once more that i except from the general rule a good number of persons who are guided by the true spirit of the christian religion and whom god preserves from the contagion almost universal  i know not if the poor clergyman made any reply but it was difficult to argue with one who had such a talent and not to come off with loss bail goes on in his grave ridicule appealing to his readers if he treats the article of womens chastity after an impure and scandalous manner are not they comprehended in that good number of persons guided by true christianity thus what i have said does not concern the predestinate and regencrate women it only concerns the women comprehended in the absolute decree of reprobation who according to the theology of the synod of dort are incapable of doing any thing for the love of god and live and die in the slavery of sin all that my adversary can allow them unless he will contradict the decisions of that synod is that the servile fear of hell may restrain them but is it not a greater glory to the sex to ascribe their chastity either to the complexion or the ideas of honor and reputation rather than the fear of punishment nor ought my accuser to forget the severe and rude manner of his preaching several times upon that subject and the indignation a number of women conceived at him  from the french edition p     this is a specimen of a fly writer frequently imitated with less dexterity   sneering but in short when rude hands attempt to draw the picture of both sexes it looks as if prostitutes had sit to the one and cowards and sharpers to the other   ae the restraints of pride and shame are evident enough but why may not virtue have its attractions as well as vice not is it properly vice but pleasure that has the charm as in the story of hercules sir thomas more is of opinion that virtue is attractive and i will read you his account of the sentiments of the utopians they think not felicity to rest in all pleasure but only in that pleasure that is good and honest and that hereto as to perfect blessedness our nature is allured and drawn even of virtue whereto only they that be of the contrary opinion do attribute felicity for they define virtue to be a life ordered according to nature and that we be hereunto ordained of god his utopians set up much for harmless pleasures and a merry life but he adds in all things this counsel they use that a less pleasure hinder not a bigger and the pleasure be no cause of displeasure which they think to follow of necessity if the pleasure be dishonest etc here are different ideas of pleasant and honest and conscience and remorse supposed they had already contemned the foolish pleasures of the imagination gewgaws and common honors and preferred the pleasures of the mind to those of the body saying the chief part of them does come of the exercise of virtue and conscience of good life etc  by this account of human nature which may be admitted to be pretty just before bad example and habits have added a second corruption to it we see the opposition is not betwixt virtue and pleasure but betwixt honest and dishonest pleasure nor is the opposition betwixt the pleasures of the body and those of the mind no pleasures being dishonest that are natural but that which spoils all is the bad principle from which the actions and intentions proceed   l what do you think of those that call virtue a thing so much of our own growth   ae i differ very much from them but suppose it were yielded the consequences would not be so dangerous if it were considered that whatever we have that is good is free gift and that of our selves we cannot think a good thought no more than we can keep our selves in life and health the only question is whether we are not born with some tendencies to virtue as well as to vice i ventured to say above that there is still some honesty and some friendship in the world which some of the advocates for selflove do not deny maintaining only that it is all for our own ends but i would beg leave to put the following questions  may not a judge give a just sentence without any view to applause or any fear of censure he may be supposed to be in such circumstances that his name shall never be heard of and his belief of a future state can likewise be supposed to be very little or nothing may not a merchant give up a fair account when he might give up a wrong one without all possibility of discovery we can suppose the same of all trustees and whose belief may be sometimes of the same size with the judges so much for honesty in dealing then may not a man eat and drink moderately and unexpensively from a better motive than the fear of being sick or for saving his money and to suppose a greater temptation may he not abstain from violating the tenderest right of another when he might encroach with all the safety imaginable to his own person it were hard if the same favorable supposition could not be made for the sex as if the fear of discovery were their only restraint have not they the same sense of justice and a much greater sense of modesty implanted in their nature but to talk of ourselves if a man had two women in his power and equally charming but the one free and the other not it were a strange perverseness to go deliberately to his neighbors property merely for the sake of encroaching it was caesars opinion that if right was to be violated it was only to be for the sake of a crown which shows a natural tendency to justice when there is no temptation to the contrary and i shall easily grant that men are overcome with very small temptations but it is enough in the present enquiry if it can be said that they would naturally go the straight road if there was nothing to allure and seduce them even when we are deceived it is under some specious appearance or other decipimur specie recti  so that if we should allow that a man might be so perverse as to wrong his neighbor in the point already mentioned we may suppose him to have been previously deluded by false ideas of glory and gallantry he has imagined it a pretty thing to break through all laws it is a sort of conquest too and he can talk of favors he has obtained and of more than he has obtained   l it seems when the springs of actions are laid open it will be found that it is vanity or the love of glory which determines men rather than the love of pure vice or the doing ill for ills sake if it be said that men in their honest actions are neither determined by ill nor good but by mere chance this word has nothing in it that can make it to be the motive of any action whatsoever and when we see men acting in the same uniform way as we have supposed in the case of your honest accountant it may be fairly concluded that the natural love of honesty which also implies an abhorrence of roguery is the determining principle though it may not be much reflected on by the person himself   ae as to friendship it will perhaps be alleged there are so many endearing things in it that we are ready to do good offices to our friends because we are fond of their persons so that in this affection there can be no virtue a man would not cheat his friend no more than he would cheat his son because he loves him etc  it must be confessed that where there is true friendship there is surety enough for fair dealing and all the good that can be done besides love is the strongest of all ties but if an honest man should have to do with known cheats a thing that may readily happen will he not find himself obliged to give them fair play it is true my lord rochester says satire on man you will be undone and one may really be at a loss but this lively piece of poetry every body knows is not to be set up as a standard of virtue and at the bottom it is rather a banter upon vice   ae i believe it is difficult to determine whether men are more capable of honesty or of friendship both are comprehended in virtue and both seem to be natural but men differ from one another very much in their tempers and dispositions some are strictly honest to all but very limited in their affection if the benignity be universal it will draw honesty along with it but the contrary cannot be affirmed however virtue in general may so far be said to be innate or of our own growth let the word pass that all the instances of it are pleasant to hear of friendship and all other sentiments of humanity justice and all that falls under the idea of honor some of which sentiments are upon occasions actually exerted in minds corrupt enough good offices are honestly done and perhaps none are born so very corrupt as not to wish they could do better the understanding sees very often what is right if the will follows it but seldom there are at least intervals of regret and a man is angrier with himself than with all the world   l had not the author of our nature implanted in us some tendency to virtue we might have had ground to complain of our unhappy constitution and of his severity greater than that of the egyptian taskmasters in requiring so much and furnishing so little book iii milton says  yet once more he shall stand on even ground against his mortal foe which had not been the case if all our natural byasses had been entirely to the wrong side but the moral sense extends both to the understanding and the heart though every body knows which of the two proceeds with the most warmth the one barely approves or disapproves the other loves or abhors when they act in concert and under the right direction then all is right  but that vain man may not imagine himself to be something he will do well to consider the weakness and disorder of all his faculties a very little selfexamination would soon undeceive us if we have sometimes a pleasure in doing good and the kind affections stir in us we too often find what may be called unkind affections we are affected with anger and resentment and feel a sort of joy in prosecuting those unhappy motions mans heart is compared to a seedplot where very opposite things spring up together and the worst plants need no cultivation as the best and tenderest are brought up with difficulty and soon choked   ae sometimes this soil is almost incapable of producing any thing either good or bad stupid sloth extinguishes all we are all fire or all ice by turns this is some little account of our heart as to the understanding the shortness of its reach agrees with the slowness of its apprehension and how often are we but dazzled and deceived when we think we see best the fall has produced very contrary effects upon us we are fanciful stupid giddy timorous stubborn impatient etc in short if we would dwell at home as persius says we should find our household furniture very poor and scanty   l but after all we have something given us to cultivate and improve mr lock does not deny the vis insita you know it is on the title page of his book of education and in his essay on human understanding he does not deny neither  book i chap     that there are natural tendencies imprinted on the minds of men he says indeed    another reason that makes me doubt of any innate practical principles is that i think there cannot any one moral rule be proposed whereof a man may not justly demand a reason and he adds should that most unshaken rule of morality and foundation of all social virtue that one should do as he would be done unto be proposed to one who had never heard it before but yet is of capacity to understand the meaning might he not without any absurdity ask a reason why and were not he that proposed it bound to make out the truth and reasonableness of it to him   ae it would be strange i think if a man of capacity to understand the meaning of that rule could really want a reason for observing it it must be supposed he has some notion of right and wrong or he can never see the obligation of any moral rule let it be put in any shape or terms whatsoever if he has any notion then or sense of equity his friend the proposer can have some access to his mind and will be able to make out the reasonableness of that rule to him in some other form of words more adapted to the slowness of his apprehension for the defect must be only there the principle is innate only a particular proposition may not chance to be assented to on the first hearing or there may be no innate idea of a moral proposition any more than of a mathematical one before the first hearing and even not till certain steps are made for getting at the bottom of it but as to that sacred rule of doing as we would be done unto it is highly probable that having been given by the savior of the world and spoken to the simplest multitude every man will see the reasonableness of it at a glance and also wish if he is not wholly abandoned to be able to put it in practice   v helps to religion l i suppose though all virtues are comprehended in religion yet there are some of them that must properly be called divine and spiritual and consequently not of our own growth or natural to us since the fall   ae no doubt and upon this seems to be founded the distinction of the virtues of nature and those of grace or religion  again the virtues of religion itself are all comprehended in charity or the love of god without which they would signify nothing   l but this divine love seems to be quite lost since the sin of adam faith which is previous to that virtue being now extinguished before we can love we must believe since according to the old maxim there is no desire of a thing unknown all the faith natural men can pretend to is worked up by their reason   cor xi      the things of god appearing foolishness to them we may see god indeed in his works for the heavens declare his glory and there may be an impression of his almighty power upon our minds some other way than by our own reasoning or making inferences from the things that strike our senses but this is only what they call believing a posteriori and we could give no demonstration of the existence of god to others who doubt of it but that either they must believe it or they must believe a contradiction as dr clarke very well argues in his discourses upon mr boyles establishment the substance of which is this  either there has always existed some independent being the author of all others or else there has been an infinite succession of dependent beings produced one from another if this supposition were true there would be nothing selfexistent and then what should have determined such a succession of beings from all eternity necessity is already excluded because there is nothing supposed necessarily existing chance is but an insignificant word and can produce nothing so of two cases equally possible to wit whether any thing or nothing should have existed the one is determined rather than the other by pure nothing which is a palpable contradiction and therefore some unchangeable and independent being must have existed from all eternity  this reasoning which does better in the doctors own words is still but reasoning and an ignorant countryman may have as strong an impression of an eternal author of all things but the impression is still faint in comparison of true faith which may be called a spiritual sensation as st paul speaks of things that are spiritually discerned he also calls faith the evidence of things not seen   ae how weak the belief of invisible things is at present may be easily gathered from the practice of the world even of those who make a profession of believing we are much more determined by the love of things on this contemptible earth which we are so soon to leave and the fear of what a few of our fellowmortals will say of us than by all the encouragements and threatenings of the gospel our hopes and fears are confined to this life we are so far from believing an immortal life to come that we hardly believe we shall die notwithstanding we have carried many of our acquaintance to the grave and yet upon the least fit of sickness we are in fear of death but hardly fear any thing after it and hardly wish for any thing after it sometimes it is true there is a confused sort of fear of things invisible but it rarely operates so far as the fear of natural death or of bodily pain or common censure   l being thus stupid and without sense of future and invisible things faith is the first thing we have need of in religion but as it is itself a part of religion and contains several articles we have need to cultivate our natural faculties to employ our reason and exert our activity so far as it can go in proper enquiries and researches in order to obtain this lively faith   ae but is there not also a necessity of praying in order to obtain our wants of all kinds   l no doubt for though our pride is unwilling to acknowledge our wants yet prayer is among the first helps to religion and a part of it also then every body knows that prayer signifies nothing without sincerity by which i mean an upright intention of observing whatever we shall believe our duty and to do the best we can in our uncertainty about it as prayer therefore is supposed previous to faith sincerity is previous to prayer or the first step of all is to wish to do well   ae i know not what thoughts would occur to us and what we would do in a mere natural state without the advantage of some instruction mr wollaston has given a scheme of the religion of nature very handsomely and toward the end of it confesses he wants a guide but then he had plato and cicero and the rabbis to be guides to him as they had others before them so that unless a man was writing who had seen no books and had received no verbal instruction we can hardly tell what his selftaught opinions would have been perhaps of very small consequence it would seem enough to allow to man a power within himself of discerning things after they are presented to him in ordinary way or a capacity of being instructed which irrational creatures have not and if the usual means of instruction should be denied as in the case of a man brought up by some strange accident among wild beasts we can set no limits to the source of light the eternal reason which may communicate it self in such circumstances and very easily supply the loss of all ordinary means whatsoever but these enquiries are of no great use   l some would say you were a quaker and an assertor of the light within   ae i am pretty easy i have heard others say that truth is split and each party had got a bit of it but to return to the helps of religion sincerity and common sense being supposed a person that finds himself so indigent and out of order will naturally have recourse to prayer either with words or without them finding that he is far from being selfsufficient he will readily ask the assistance of the almighty for it is here likewise supposed that he has some belief of the supreme being and a confidence in his goodness faith implying both these  again supposing our imperfect believer to have been born in a christian country and to have read the bible he will see more positive marks of the divine goodness which will incline him to praise and thanksgiving as well as to prayer fear would seem to be the source of the latter as love is of the former even the writings of some philosophers  platos in particular show us the properest kind of prayer which is to refer to the deity to choose what is best for us his dialogue named the second alcibiades is well known and upon that model juv sat x pers sat ii juvenal and persius have formed two admirable poems epictetus arrian lib i chapter    makes praise the chief character and business of a rational creature indeed true prayer and true praise are much of the same nature and each of them is accompanied with love of the object to which the solemn addresses are made   l no doubt the eminence and purity of that love is the end of all religion as appears from many clear passages in the old and new testament for though faith and prayer and other duties are called parts of religion yet since they lead to that charity which is the end of the commandment the distinction betwixt the end and the means is very obvious and among the means themselves there is a distinction betwixt those things that are to be done and those that are to be avoided but there are still things of an inferior class which are only to be called helps to religion and therefore not properly parts of it as any body may see   ae if the love of god be the point or stage to which we must arrive selflove seems to be the stage from which we must set out those two loves as st augustine tells us having made two cities they are certainly two states of mind diametrically opposite the one also contemning the other or two contrary principles by which we are determined but as they are not for the most part in their utmost force but the one sometimes weaker than the other and sometimes stronger so we may be said to be inhabitants of both cities and to go from the one to the other by turns which of the two we are oftenest found in is easy to discover   l the removing of hindrances is much akin with the helps to religion and both these are so numerous that we cannot enter into the detail every body talks of bad company and the example of the world as being very pernicious  every body likewise speaks of greater and less duties and of religion or the tie that binds us to all duties as the word imports if some contemn this tie or profess to contemn it the number of such professors is very small and it is but in some random expressions over a bottle or else from a singular affectation of being impudent the professors on the other side are vastly more numerous   ae i believe this may be farther observed that among the several parties into which the christian world is now divided most people are mightily pleased with their own choice which god knows is very accidental but the wonder is not so great that they should like their own opinions as that they should hate the persons who differ from them and this sometimes when there is no interest to interfere to make the quarrel look a little solid   l but most people having just as much religion as to make them hate one another and to go to their particular houses of devotion the wonder ceases that they load each other with names of contempt viz superstition enthusiasm bigotry there are no doubt such characters in the world but to whose share they should fall heaviest would not be easy to know without more labor than people commonly are at before they censure a reasonable diffidence therefore of our selves and a due respect for others may be reckoned among the chief helps to religion though they are properly two states of the mind which produce one another and the esteem we bear our neighbors contributes to make us love them which is a great part of our duty accomplished and without which the other part is impracticable for he that loves not his brother whom he has seen how can he love god whom he has not seen   ae it were to be wished that they who own the sacred authority of the scriptures would apply themselves more to the study of these books wherein they will find a great variety of things some for speculation i mean the exercise of the understanding but more for practice which is by far the most important perhaps curiosity will sometimes take it ill to be stopped short and put to a nonplus but impatience becomes a reader ill who has once aknowledged a writing to be divine his inattention argues disrespect of a different kind and it cannot well be denied that folly accompanies both the one and the other   vi the equality of men by nature ae it is a current maxim that all men are born free equal and independent   l the equality is more easily made out than the other two for all men are born helpless and many ways in subjection if by freedom is meant the liberty of the mind there would seem to be little ground for dispute about that no man having any power over his neighbors thoughts farther than he can persuade him either by reason or sophistry for in compliances from fear or profit the opinion stands much as it was   ae the natural equality therefore should be granted both as to the mind and the body all creatures of the same kind are in that respect equal there are indeed differences of complexion genius disposition and temper all which may be called natural as appearing very early and continuing very late but these differences are only in the particular constitution of souls and bodies or in the degrees of certain qualities every man having less or more of the same quality as for instance pride compassion hatred joy curiosity penetration etc for of every quality or power relating to the affections the understanding or the five senses every man has somewhat  every man has something in him of the mathematician the mechanic the lawyer the statesman the mountebank and so of all other trades or professions a man no doubt may mistake his genius and enter upon a wrong trade but still he may know some little thing of his business though as little as you please xxxi mr pascal observes there is a wide difference between a genius for the mathematics and a genius for business or policy the french word is finesse which is not always taken in a bad sense he shows at some length the different principles on which those professions are founded and drawing to a conclusion he says  mr kennet has taken a good deal of liberty generally in his translation the french is mais les esprits faux ne sont jamais ni fins ni geometres but then it is certain between both that a false genius will neither make a geometry professor nor a privy counselor   l natural differences are no less remarkable in things relating to the heart than in things relating to the genius you shall meet with one man whom you would not trust with a halfpenny another whom you could frankly and safely trust with all you have it is true bad education and example are often to blame and even good natures benenata are corrupted but still there are natural differences and if it should be asked whence do they come or what makes one man differ from another no answer can be given but that in fact it may be said one man has got two talents and another ten st pauls question is very much to be remembered what have thou o man that thou have not received but i believe people are not so much inclined to think that what they have received is not freely given as that their gifts are greater than in reality they are   ae the natural equality of mankind appears most of all in certain unavoidable states and appointments of the great lawgiver it is appointed for all men once to die and after this the judgment the first part we see the midwives know how equal men are at their birth and the gravemakers at their burial and in all the passages between or the states intervening the equality is not disputed if any man arrives at the weaknesses of old age he must pass through the raw state of an infant the silliness of a child the rashness of youth in short the common follies and miseries adhering to all the periods of life   l outward vexation and trouble is another point of equality not only affecting the several periods of life but all the situations and circumstances which men can be placed in  ecclus xl great travail is created for every man from him that wears purple and a crown to him that is clothed with a linen frock   ae but besides the troubles annexed to the different circumstances of fortune every man has a particular state of his own which few are or can be acquainted with and there are some little things that may be called the troubles of the day the french call them les occasions journalieres and upon these daily or hourly incidents the quiet of our life is observed very much to depend those that are in the highest stations will be the most sensible of such nameless difficulties   l there is one thing to show the natural equality among men which may help also to sweeten some uneasy reflections upon life and that is the natural promptness of contracting friendship i believe we observed it before we shall find men engaged in the closest ties of good will and fidelity from the purest accidents imaginable a stagecoach or a trackscout it is true as st paul said to the athenians god made all nations of one blood which shows a common relation among men as well as an equality but how this relation is minded every body knows the very words relation and blood are confined to certain narrow degrees of kindred into which some persons are admitted with great reluctance or truly because they cannot be disowned   ae and among those who admit each other into that distinction the friendship is seldom very warm so that we often find it the most hearty when it has risen the most accidentally i say without blood without any combination of interest any design of overturning governments or of quietly making rich under them or any private view whatsoever we shall see friendships contracted which can only end with death if they end then   vii accidental characters l there are differences among men by nature which may be called natural characters as the differences occasioned by fortune may be called accidental characters though all power is from god yet to us it appears a great accident that one man should have been a king another an archbishop another a colonel of horse and so of other offices and employments   ae whichsoever way power comes into a mans hands it is natural for him to endeavor to keep it and even to increase it as the desire of it is pretty natural to all men these are new instances of their equality and many other instances of it may appear in their accidental situations   l power and dominion seem to have been appropriated before any property could be fixed in goods and money the natural power of parents is not to be called appropriation because the safety of the young depends upon the care of the old and this is a dominion founded in love but if we could suppose a company of any grownup people to have met together by some uncommon chance unless they agree that one or more of themselves shall have the rule there is great likelihood of war to ensue among them if every one should suppose himself as fit to govern as his neighbor and had an equal stock of courage to back his pretensions whose hands would the government fall into but we see even among pirates there is command and subjection and great need for it how far cunning or force or a mixture of both are used in the forming of governments is needless to mention nor how they go on afterward for some time pretty regularly like a piece of clockwork in both instances there is more to be ascribed to providence than is commonly imagined you know philip de comines ascribes a good deal to it   ae even horace acknowledges that the dominion of this world is from the powers above dis te minorem quod geris imperas roman     l it were a difficult task to enquire into all the different forms of government and much more to adjust the prerogatives and privileges of the governors and the governed it is enough that every body is satisfied of the necessity of government and that whatever the form be it must be absolute though this last point is not so much taken notice of because of the disagreeableness of the sound one design of government no doubt is to secure property but then the governors will call for such a quota as they shall find expedient for no body has yet said that eight shillings in the pound may not be demanded as well as four all the question is where this great trust shall be lodged and here an opportunity might be taken of extolling the british constitution but that it is needless most people being agreed that it is a very good one all panegyricks upon an administration are yet more to be avoided since they are liable to be suspected either of flattery or a design of reproaching with safety   ae private property being secured by the government there arises a mighty equality among the subjects as to that point in a free country every man being allowed to get as much money as he can provided he keep within the bounds of the laws   l why do you call it private property   ae because the governors must determine in the first place what is necessary for the support of the government but though the subjects are equally allowed to get all the money they can there is a great inequality in the hits of fortune which creates distinctions without number hence nobility and gentry of several classes and denominations hence officers of the church the state the army the excise and the rest but still every man has his chance for preferment and most men are still climbing and still many breaking their necks   l but men venture for money as well as for preferment and no wonder since money answers all things and that a good deal of it would purchase an empire as it actually happened at rome where the empire was put to sale by the soldiers and bought by a substantial citizen   ae men venture a great deal also to shun poverty or rather the contempt of it per mare pauperiem fugiens per saxa per ignes   by the way the change of the roman taste is remarkable between the first ages of the commonwealth and the age in which horace makes his observation and livy makes a boast in his preface that there was no people among whom poverty was held in so much honor and for so long a time this poverty does not mean beggary but food and raiment with which these old heathens were content   l property being an exclusive right to use and dispose of the goods one has acquired or is master of for the time it might be thought that when great estates are got they would be kept for ever but it seems in the course of things there is a natural tendency to equality or a level as heaps artificially piled up fall almost by their own weight if men were determined by covetousness alone they would have a fairer chance for keeping their goods and transmitting them to their representatives but having vanity and other inclinations also at heart the far greater part of their wealth must be for others who assist them in those gratifications and thus when the estates are tolerably good there is an opportunity for shopkeepers and tailors and a world of other trades to make something for themselves till the profits arising from the several bubbles produce a new one that is a new family to make a figure and to be served like the old ones   ae it seems the word bubble has two significations and both agreeing to the subject   l there is an universal circulation ranks must be still shifting about new meteors appearing and forgetting their old acquaintance and even their bloodrelations but in the humor of taking care of relations people differ very much some are willing at least to see their friends and to do for them what they can others are of a different humor and conclude that those who are already under the hatches should be kept under   ae but fortune often takes care of those whom nature forgets some who are born to nothing and sometimes one may say of no body make a mighty appearance instances of the present time would be disobliging i shall only mention two neither very modern nor very ancient sextus quintus and castruccio prince of lucca the latter a foundling and the former a keeper of hogs their friends indeed could do no better for them the pope used to jest upon his family and call himself the descendant of an illustrious house because the light came through the roof for want of tyling but fortune takes care of many who have not such metal as those two had one would often wonder how some are raised so unexpectedly while others are as unexpectedly depressed and this unequal proceedure of fortune has made her sometimes be called a goddess and sometimes especially by those she neglects a blind gypsy   l but to talk of the matter soberly it would seem there is a secret direction in the affairs of very private persons either to make them beneficial to others or for their own particular discipline second causes being still allowed to work if some are said to be raised up to be scourges to others it certainly may be called a particular misfortune to themselves however the abuses of power and distinction are not of so bad consequence as the want of them would be in the present disposition of men how wisely has it been ordained to distinguish men rather by the exterior show than by the interior endowments here is another person and i disputing the way who shall have the preference in this case why the better man of the two but i am as good a man as he so that if no expedient be found he must beat me or i must beat him well but all this while he has four footmen at his back and i have but one this is a visible advantage we need only tell noses to discover it it is my part therefore to yield and i am a blockhead if i contest the point see here an easy method of peace the great safeguard and supreme happiness of this world xxix mr pascal has a pretty illustration of this subject which mr kennet translates with some humor   ae but the odds of four footmen to one is a real distinction of power as well as of figure it is a sort of life guard to a great man it is even remarkable how far a bare name will go without much attendance or much money to secure a man from insults and to keep those who have a dependence upon him in some order among themselves so that name and rank have a magical kind of power in the world which as things now stand is of no small benefit   l mons domat who has very good reflections on the nature of society and the distinction of ranks gives us a view of the different orders of persons who compose the state or commonwealth as they are ranked in his polite nation le droit public live i tit ix sect   they stand thus  after the general distinction of the clergy and laity in which the clergy has the preference the first order among the laics is that of the officers of the army the second the council of the prince the third the administration of justice the fourth the finances the fifth the sciences and liberal arts the sixth trade the seventh handycrafts the eighth and last order husbandry and the care of flocks he seems to make an apology for putting agriculture in the last place and makes a sufficient encomium upon it yet he place above cited x adds but as this labor is very painful and employs the greatest part of men and removes them farther than any other from ranks and precedence those who exercise it are placed in the last rank  this way of classing men we see is pretty arbitrary domat says on place as if he had said custom has so determined and that is all   ae indeed in all nations there is scarce any other rule of living than as custom determines people seldom enquiring any farther than whether a thing is done or is not done but to say nothing of the hardships of putting men in the last rank because they have the most toil which affects only those who work at the plough and other parts of husbandry and many other trades have as hard labor too if agriculture were to be considered in the view of taking a lease of a piece of ground the farmer may be looked upon as a partycontracter with the proprietor and sometimes he may be the richest man of the two and may do as little work as his landlord in this case his employment will scarce be reckoned derogatory and if there is any honor in being independent the farmer is more upon that lay than the followers of the sciences and liberal arts illustrations upon this head would not be very agreeable neither but some gentlemens sons would probably make more of their patrimony by laying it out upon a good farm than in several trades they take to and if it once become fashionable it would have a double advantage   l some have made a division of mankind into the good people that is the people of fashion and the mob if this division has no great foundation in nature it has a good deal in the appearance for it is very easy to discern who is of the mob by ones clothes but mr cowley if i remember well makes a distinction between the great vulgar and the small and he has vulgus autem tam chlamydatos quam coronam voco non enim colorem vestium quibus praetexta corpora sunt adspicio etc de vitabeata senecas authority upon his side with these two and some others it is the qualities of the mind and not the clothes that raises persons from the character of the vulgar but this reckoning would be a little dangerous  the canaille or rabble is another term for the great body of the inferior people it is much the same with the mob or the mobile which denotes inconstancy and giddiness and in this character also many of the rich and fashionable might be included but the mob signifies principally the crowd got together sometimes for bare curiosity sometimes to make disturbance and of which king william used to say the mob is not always in the wrong indeed the common people may be said to see pretty exactly within certain limits though they cannot be said to see far the canaille is mostly applied to the dregs or the worthleslest of all   ae it is pity that people are so ready to look with contempt upon others of an inferior rank which i suspect they will do still but they would do well to reflect upon the equality by nature though this may be attended with some other reflections a little uneasy for if they once begin supposing pride to keep a while out of the way they will probably regret the senseless fashion of the world which has separated them from the great body of mankind and so has deprived them of the familiarity of some persons who would have made excellent friends had it not been for the coarseness of their clothes marriage suffers by this confinement as well as friendship and the choice in that state is still more confined through particular views of money or alliance it is pity the appearances of good humor though sometimes they are but appearances and the reports of a good education are so much neglected i believe i have been upon this head before   l you have so i wish the world may not take you for a leveller   ae you know i am pretty cautious in declaring my sentiments to the world and truly any body will easily see that though all ranks by some miracle were reduced the equality would not continue half a day and for the renouncing of property it will be reasonable to wait till one sees the apostles at whose feet the goods are to be laid   l we have as yet talked of the different characters among mankind chiefly with regard to their fortunes and it is these indeed which make their natural characters appear more remarkably so that the same may be called natural and accidental both  with reference to religion every body knows it is accident for the most part that makes us of one religion rather than another it is either the religion of our parents or the religion of the times and our parents seem to have been determined the same way that we are this is with reference to forms and systems those defects and blemishes in religion called superstition enthusiasm and the like are owing to the particular temper of persons and not to the system they espouse for we shall find some of the same profession very warm and others very indifferent  there is hardly a pamphlet comes out that does not take notice of those two characters both the superstitious and the enthusiasts i believe have a design of pleasing the almighty and the enthusiasts imagine they please him better than they do the superstitious have more of fear than pride and so they are rigid observers of little things without which they think there is no salvation both characters may meet in the same person but it is the prevailing one that gives the denomination enthusiasm is apt to despise all observances superstition to magnify and multiply them   ae the disease of enthusiasm has more or less dangerous effects both for society and the persons themselves according to the tempers it seizes if a man whose pride is not excessive should fancy himself inspired or clothed with some extraordinary commission from heaven the government may be pretty safe from his attempts but if one should think himself gods peculiar favorite and that his commission was given him on account of his singular merit or even though his fancy should not carry him to the extremity of inspiration if he but thinks himself a peculiar favorite it will be enough to make him set up for temporal dominion and fight if he have courage like john of leyden  bigotry and zeal may be called the offspring of superstition and enthusiasm  carelessness in religion is much the same as the having no religion it proceeds partly from stupidity and partly from the love of pleasure the contempt of religion is chiefly from pride or the love of independency hence it is easy to trace the sources of atheism and deism   l if the atheists are sincere in their profession they must be very dull the deists may be suspected of affecting more unbelief than they have nor can they be altogether freed of the character of dullness but then their antipathy at the clergy whose post they envy either for its ease or its grandeur added to the pain they have to enquire any farther makes them take up with very weak arguments against revealed religion sometimes they put on respectful airs and call it in irony their most holy religion pretending to differ from those scepticks who think characteristicks iii     there is a great fertility of insinuations in that whole chapter the holy records were compiled by an interested party in behalf of the richest corporation or monopoly that could be erected   ae that is shaftesbury but these are poor doings   l but they are sufficient to make a young gentleman swear it is all a trick the priests contrived the bible but i can never believe the priests would have contrived it so well if one should ask the lad what priests did contrive it the popish priests or the protestant he will be a little at a stand when it is told him the books are older than popery it self again if he reflects that some of those books are called the old testament and others of them the new he will find the old was in the keeping of the jews long before christianity was heard of it would perhaps be some loss if the deists were hindered from writing against christianity for their arguments are sometimes of more use to help a weak faith than some arguments that are brought in its behalf but in return for this privilege of writing they ought to do it in a fair honest way   ae vanity and illhumour being known to be the springs of most of the doings of men there needs little to be said concerning the characters of most other professions as every man has got a particular stamp from nature so every trade or profession has its particular air or appearance the military men have their airs the clergymen theirs the courtiers theirs and so on there is also the air of a rake and the air of a deist but this rank of men are best discovered by their conversation and their writings   l it may be some help toward keeping ones self in good humor to consider the equality of mankind both as to their nature and their proceedure and to give allowance also for accidents if all desire esteem it can be no surprise that they take the way to obtain it that appears to them the fittest and if a man happens to be remarkably saucy perhaps he might have been less so in a different post or had he not been spoiled with flattery   ae allowances indeed ought to be given and the consideration of natural equality will likewise help people to some humanity and make them wish at least that every body were easy in their different statious in this view there will be some care taken of the meanest servant   l one thing must indeed be granted that if this life be designed as a state of trial and discipline the inequality of fortunes and humors answers that end very well   ae it is very remarkable too that the same principle of selflove which divides men from one another and produces such a variety of fanciful distinctions should yet in some measure unite them again their necessities making them subservient to one another and which is still more remarkable the inferior ranks often serving their superiors cheerfully and without the least disdain domat has very good observations upon this head in his treatise of the law showing how out of selflove which is the poison of society god brings remedies for its subsistence and there seems to be the like impression on the minds of the generality of mankind very much to the honor of the divine wisdom that god draws order out of confusion   l there is farther a certain mildness to be observed in the conduct of providence sapientia disponit omnia suaviter by which society not only hangs together but the great body of it upon whom the drudgery of labor is thrown has an equivalent of sounder sleep and generally speaking more contentment   ae that divine truth is of an extent that reaches to the whole creation a fine ad finem pertingit fortiter   viii conversation l the thing generally understood by conversation is that grand amusement of talking when people meet together either by chance or design to pass the time or as the french say to murder it drinking or gaming does that pretty effectually the former making the conversation very tumultuous as the latter confines it to narrow bounds   ae the persons who have most time on their hands are they whose indulgent parents or their own particular good luck have left them rents to live on without the necessity of working either without doors or within  the laborers in the field and tradesmen handycrafts mechanics artificers generally work the most part of the day they eat their meals with a good appetite they speak little and sleep sound  men of public employment such as officers of state judges lawyers clergymen etc have more or less time for conversation according to the nature of their employments and their diligence in them   l it were neither kind nor civil in this argument to forget the women for they can speak too but to say the truth idleness and speaking for speaking sake is not their general character they are more active more foreseeing and better managers than we if a foolish education sometimes spoils them as whom does it not spoil the fault should be laid where it ought  but since there is such an equality in both sexes as to the operations of selflove that the same principles only seem to act in a softer or rougher skin the same motives to conversation and the same errors in it must prevail in both   ae the first project before vanity begins to stir is to make life easy and this is founded on selfinsufficiency as it may be called but supposing people once met together it is natural enough to endeavor to shine a little and to be glad to be in such companies where one shines most est quod gaudeas te in ista loca venisse etc   l it were too severe however to affirm that a man never opens his mouth but out of vanity and that he never goes into company but with the view of leaving a respectful impression of himself such reflections would lead to melancholy they serve but to imbitter life or at best to make it tasteless nor are they true in fact for a great deal of that talk or superfluity of words which seems to proceed from vanity is often but mere habit or infirmity and just so in the case of detraction which though it seems to spring from illnature and vanity both yet is rather a senseless custom than any thing else indeed the duke of rochefoucault says it is more from vanity than ill nature that we are slanderers which is a milder construction than he generally makes of actions but i humbly think he might have been a little milder still   ae there are certainly other inducements to conversation than vanity and ill nature there is curiosity amusement and friendship the mind naturally desires knowledge though there was no pleasure in showing it to others that curiosity which is the bare itch of hearing a new thing is much the same with amusement but friendship may concur with both or it may be alone the inducement of going into company there being a pleasure in the very sight of faces where no great information is to be expected   l to turn this affair to some account there must be a good deal of familiarity and some little philosophy i believe we observed it before that horace lays down a very good plan of conversation wherein he tells what his friends and he talked of and what they did not talk of one cannot think of it too often sermo oritur non de villis domibusve alienis nec male necne lepos sallet sed quod magis ad nos pertinet and nescire malum est agitamus utrumne divitiis homines an sint virtute beati quidve ad amicitias usus rectumne trahat nos et quae natura boni summumque quid ejus etc again brundusium numici melius via ducat an appi quem damnosa venus quem praeceps alea nudat gloria quem supra vires and vestit and ungit etc    ae here is a good deal of scandal and many frivolous things cut off and useful things insisted on but they would be too philosophical for most conversations one must often hear stories of a cock and a bull and talk of them too with an air of contentment when one cannot make better of it it is in familiar conversation and chiefly between two that free sentiments can be exchanged upon grave subjects in promiscuous company such discourse must be avoided lest it should look like cant and give a disgust  but care must be taken in familiar chat not to fall into detraction to which it must be confessed there is a natural tendency especially when two heads are got together this whispering puts one in mind of the hissing of serpents and for the most part some body is stung but in this there is much of habit as was said before though it is a very unlucky habit and often produces very bad effects   l among the several abuses of speech mentioned in the government of the tongue there is none the author desires people more to beware of than that of detraction giving this reason for it that few seem to be sensible of its guilt he says many who would startle at an oath whose stomachs as well as consciences recoil at an obscenity do yet slide glibly into a detraction etc the good author probably has had the sex in his eye when he mentioned the recoiling at an obscenity but upon the matter what is it but obscenity that is so currently talked under the peculiar term of scandal the talking of bastards has a great resemblance of obscenity what are the scandals about court or in the nearest village which will do just as well for discourse but obscenity and yet this is a great subject of conversation among much commended women   ae among gentlemen it is of use to have some knowledge of history the common news running soon out whereas history can last a while and can be as little suspected of vanity as any subject a man can talk of for it chiefly requires the memory which few are ready to value themselves upon and it gives opportunity to others in the company to tell what they remember too and even those who have read very little can keep their countenance by putting in a word or asking a question but to dwell too much upon history will not be diverting and therefore allowance must be given to something that is more familiar and tending a little to mirth with this caution always that it be at no bodys expense either in the company or out of it   l here a question might arise concerning jesting whether it be consistent with the rules of christianity some are apt to conclude it is not from the words of st paul to the v     ephesians but fornication and all uncleanness let it not be once named among you as becomes saints neither filthiness nor foolish talking nor jesting which are not convenient but rather giving of thanks etc it is hard to understand the precise sense of the two last things to be avoided at this distance of time though the christians in those days have been at no loss to know it but among us foolish talking is an undefind expression and if nothing were to be admitted into discourse but what is wise there would be little talking at all as to jesting people are not agreed even about the translation of the  word it may mean either scurrility or quaintness or buffoonery castellio translates it facetia but facetiousness has not a hard meaning in english nor do i know who can justly condemn it i am sure very grave persons and who have a great regard for christianity sometimes use it on the other hand who can take upon them to give formal allowances when they are not absolutely sure but it may contradict the meaning of an apostle for st paul after he had exhorted the ephesians to abstain from bad actions and bad discourse tells them how they ought to employ their time to wit in giving of thanks which agrees with the directions of st james is any of you afflicted let him pray is any cheerful let him sing psalms but every body knows these directions are not for common conversation wherein too great gravity is to be avoided as well as too great liberty how hard is it to keep the midway it is vanity to pretend to it all we are to endeavor is to keep as near it as we can   ae i think instead of inconvenient  ver   our translators might have put unbecoming or impertinent which seems to agree better with the greek word all i would infer is that there is such a thing as decency as well as religion and though we cannot now so well judge of what becomes saints yet we may know what is becoming or unbecoming to be said in honest company and therefore all trash scandal and detraction will be carefully shunned where the taste is not already vitiated by ill habit for it must be owned that some things have a relish or smack beyond others as scandal in comparison of common prate and even in these it is well known how much precious time is wasted   l wasted indeed   ae but as to jesting when it has no worse tendency than to keep the company in good humor or from falling asleep some grave enough persons have not declared against it and there may be as little vanity in that sort of discourse as in any other there is an advantage too that to tell any merry thing said by any other person is all one to the company as if the jest were the repeaters own and in this he only shows a little of his memory which generally succeeds better than when he endeavors to show his wit as we find little tales are more taking than quirks and raillery and other things that are called smart   l there is one thing that may justify a harmless jest and it is the natural disposition men have to laugh which other creatures have not nor the faculty it self monkeys can grin but it hardly comes up to laughter i shall not however affirm that it is one of the distinguishing characters of a rational creature since it often arises without reason the fancy being only tickled and an unvoluntary convulsive motion produced little better than coughing or sneezing   ae solomon says of laughter that it is madness we must allow that besides his inspired character he was in a situation to know the value of things better than most men and had left nothing untried it might therefore be concluded from his words that laughing should have no place in this valley of tears but it seems more probable that the wise king spoke only against excesses and that he would not have refused a little innocent laughter to poor heavy mankind no more than taking the air to revive their spirits  i shall not set up to be a casuist but we see in fact that one of the greatest plots in life is to laugh even drinking would go heavily down without it though men are not wholly indifferent about the liquor neither yet to laugh seems more to be the end of their meeting than to drink   l but however allowable laughter may be it had need to be put under regulations and as to these prudence and good manners must judge pro re nata   ae the most allowable as well as agreeable kind of laughing is that which proceeds from cheerful good humor the person that laughs is pleased and no body offended the satisfaction even runs through the whole company on the other hand the laughter that proceeds from contempt argues a disturbance of soul and gives a quite different air to the countenance it is really an effect of the spleen nature taking that way to relieve it self though there is something involuntary in it too the fancy being touched uneasily not tickled   l a very disagreeable kind also of laughing to the beholders is that which is affected wherein the fancy is not touched at all and the sides are only shaken artificially or rather aukwardly as well as the face is put in a foolish set without any charm or life such is the laughter of those who study to please attendants upon levees pages chambermaids and many others   ae that which makes boys and girls and generally young people more ready to laugh than the older seems to proceed from the temperature of the body as well as the state of the mind since we see all young creatures are merry and sportive care must be taken however both in young and old that this mirth degenerate not into insolence and derision young women arriving sooner at their wit and mettle are apt to laugh at young men and are great observers in general of what is heavy and blundering or any way ridiculous either as to persons or things sometimes children are corrected but who shall correct the older mean time it is remarkable that the excess of laughter is generally succeeded with lowness of spirits uneasiness and pain in the breast and sides concerning which mechanism the anatomists may be consulted   l it were to make too great a panegyric upon laughing even the best sort of it that can be imagined to say that it gives the greatest pleasure in conversation for people are truly better pleased when the understanding is well informed than when the imagination is tickled and then a kind word is more delightful than the greatest discoveries of speculation the understanding and the heart are very different regions indeed in common conversation a laugh is the best fruit we can propose to reap but to be convinced there is no great excellency in it we have but to consider that it is only frivolous things that make us laugh most a word out of joint an odd gesture and the like and which is still more unphilosophical we sometimes fall a laughing alone on the remembrance of some of those outoftheway things we have seen or heard nay a thing will tickle the foolish fancy that was never seen nor heard before   ae what shall we make of that readiness to laugh when one slips a foot and tumbles over we are even afraid he is hurt and yet cannot refrain from laughing in very small instances we may discover plain evidences of our disorder   l what do you think of smiling   ae smiling may be called laughter in its infancy and sometimes it is most agreeable when it goes no farther the difference between a natural smile and an artificial is easily perceived for though the same muscles seem to be employed in both yet there is a sweetness and vivacity wanting in the artificial smile which one needs not go to the drawing room to be convinced of but may discover it upon all occasions   l the tedious drawing room   ae it seems sneering is meant both of scornful laughing and scornful speaking and is far from being a pleasant thing there is a severity in it as it exposes a weak side or a ridicule a thing that no body is reckoned to be free of it is a standing maxim that every man has his whim and his ridicule there is likewise national ridicule as well as personal and there is the ridicule of every profession but it belongs rather to the playhouse than private conversation to lay open these infirmities it is true the stage is seldom successful in the cure but it is at least of some use to let people see the follies of their neighbors and if they will not look at home the stage cannot help it but as new questions arise at every turn it may be asked who shall correct the stage when it goes wrong it self i know no cure for dullness but plain immorality is a staring thing and the wisdom of the legislature must take notice of that the best way it can   l as history is among the proper materials for conversation so the more particular the better such as memoirs and lives if they be well done because the nature of man and the springs of actions are there best discovered travels afford good materials too as the different customs of nations their climates and what they produce   ae what shall become of romances   l in some cases i am very unwilling to give a precise answer so i must ask again who would part with virgil and milton was not telemaque writ by the bishop of cambray who would even part with hudibras and several other performances the old voluminous romances are well out of fashion   ae some novels are even but dull   l as to the attention that should be given to frivolous discourse it is enough if one appears to give attention to it he may take some liberty of thinking with himself of what he has a mind and a nod now and then will be enough there should be some appearance of attention or else it would be very mortifying like what is told of the prince of lucca who hearing a tedious discourse one day of which he took little notice and the poor man who began to perceive it making an apology for having spoke so much answered you need make no apology for i hardly know what you were talking of  this was a little severe but perhaps the prince had reason   ae but it is much easier to know how to hear others than what to say our selves the government of the thoughts is previous to the government of the tongue how shall the wheel of the imagination that is continually in motion be either stopped or regulated but since the tongue must talk of what is rumbling in the head it were to be wished that every one should empty his head of the high opinion of himself and the contempt of others i think cardinal de retz says a man ought to be much upon his guard against the pleasure he is apt to take in raillery for upon many occasions it cost the prince of conde dear it seems contempt and derision are very ill to digest when it is to ones face it is hard to shun a quarrel and when it is behind the back it usually comes round again to the disturbance of both parties so that jesting is often inconvenient according to our translation   l complaining is also a poor thing and when groundless very unjust but as affectation is ready to enter into every thing these complaints are put on to procure sympathy and a little esteem as being the due of a patient sufferer it is not prudent however to be still complaining especially of unkind usage because people may be apt to think there is not much in it or that it is taking the first word   ae it is really strange how affectation runs through our whole behavior we are every thing by turns we affect to be weak and we affect to be strong we affect to be poor and we affect to be rich we affect to be temperate and we affect to be debauched the desire of esteem still working in us and producing it self as seems most likely to turn to the present account   ix books l here is another amusement which those that are at leisure have more at their hand than those that are harassed with hard labor or with business it is true a book may be for more use than bare amusement but that depends upon the qualities of the performance some books being good for very little   ae if a man were to consider for what end life is given him quidnam victuri gignimur he would readily enquire after the books that could direct him best but in this he is apt to meet with very different advices if he be already sworn to a party he must be directed by his masters and if he is only to follow the starts of his own fancy he can hardly have a worse guide if again he is to ask counsel from every party he must be much divided about what he shall choose here is one fixed point however as to books of religion all parties of christendom acknowledge one book which is called the bible as the standard of all belief and practice and though it is called but one book yet it is a collection of many and has a variety of subjects which i need not enumerate there is also a variety in the style according to the character of the writers that irony does not signify much characteristicks iii     that in the composition there is nothing miraculous or selfconvincing a miraculous style is a new phrase but the style of the scriptures is by most people acknowledged to be natural and by some even to be longinus not only instances moses but in a ms in the vatican he makes mention of paul of tarsus as an author of great excellency sublime conviction must also come another way than from the words of a book a selfconvincing style is another curiosity   l but the deepest objections are against the authority of those sacred books i should have called them insinuations rather than objections for generally they are nothing else and where any arguments have been really formed against any particular book or single prophecy they have been answered by very good hands and the impartial reader will judge whose arguments are the strongest but for those who acknowledge the scriptures both to be authentic and divine and who may want to know the best rules of living in order to be happy in the next world and even in this such persons i believe will find in that neglected collection of writings what will be useful for both these ends and an agreeableness of style very distinguishing i could name several books wherein plainness or simplicity has been studied but the authors have not been able to hinder the art from appearing   ae when a person happens to have such a value for the bible he will of consequence make it a good part of his study and will approve of other books on religion as they shall appear to agree to that standard let him dip in commentaries and sermons and wherever he thinks his weak faith may be best assisted and though he may chance to think some of those religious books a little heavy he should not reject them all in a lump for that which he may suppose to be the effect of his delicate taste may be in reality but the weakness of his appetite nor let him think that dullness is confined to the labors of the pulpit and works of divinity since not only the workmen for the stage who must labor for their bread but even fine gentlemen who might live at their ease and yet labor for esteem do often produce works of great heaviness it is also to be considered in behalf of the clergy that they are so limited to a few topics and these often insisted on that their fancy has little scope to exert it self in comparison of the authors whose aim is ridicule and sometimes ribaldry things that rarely do well in a sermon and so they whose profession is seriousness must be at a considerable loss and therefore ought to have the allowances that justice requires   l after books that treat expressly of religion those of morality have the next place perhaps mr cowley when he recommended to dr sprat to publish nothing in his compositions that might be offensive either to religion or good manners has by good manners chiefly meant decency because morality has a higher meaning and is a part of religion and it is remarkable that there was nothing found in the works of that fine gentleman which a worthy divine could have any scruple to publish   ae morals and divinity are by no means to be separated and as to those writings that are properly called books of morality it is among the old philosophers they are principally to be sought after not to say but some of those great men have also left many instructions concerning religion and discoveries of the divine nature as a small acquaintance with plato and some others will testify though socrates wrote nothing himself in which he resembles the great instructor of mankind yet we have his sentiments and his manner of life recorded by those who were familiar with him and at the same time the finest hands in the world epictetus wrote none neither but we have that loss supplied by simplicius and arrian nor are the poets to be overlooked among those ancient writers morality being their aim too in another dress it would seem the earliest authors have wrote best horace recommends those who were counted ancients in his time as being worthy to be read day and night  as to modern authors a man is to make the best use of them he can without disparaging or overvaluing them all searches are painful and much rubbish must be turned over before coming at the best books and before coming at what is excellent in several books that are not despicable this i mean of some books where instruction is openly intended where it is intended more covertly the authors have a better excuse to plead for the rubbish that must be turned over and the readers intention being often amusement he will still find his account less or more even in that view all then it seems must be looked into even the common performances of the time wit is always wit and dullness always dullness   l it seems you have a mind to keep the balance between the moderns and the ancients   ae it is true but i have some biass to the ancients but non nostrum est tantas componere lites   l there is one point in which a reader has a considerable advantage of an author any dullness he has is apparent whereas the readers is best known to himself unless he set up against his stars as a critic and give his opinion mal a propos it may happen also that what has been writ in good humor shall be read in bad humor which is another disadvantage of an author and there is still something expected that is new which is a hard demand upon one hand and a foolish pretense on the other such authors who are to blame in their turn should mind honest chaucer for out of old fields as men says comes all this new corn fro year to year and out of old books in good faith comes all this new science that men lear    ae pretending is very silly when a book is brought into another language it is a translation of the words and when the thoughts of one book are brought into another book this is but a translation still   l there can be no better description given of some books upon all subjects than ovid gives of the chaos for five or six lines together  rudis indigestaque moles etc  but a reader cannot always free himself either of want of penetration or want of attention so that authors have a harder fate than is imagined   ae writing is indeed a ticklish sort of affair for the same advances by which one grows into a familiarity with the world are apt to make him forget the respect he owes it and on the other hand to bring him into contempt with it   l since amusement is the great design of conversation no wonder it is the design of reading and why not of writing i think horace calls it playing with paper yet sometimes he seems to have been weary of writing upon ludicrous subjects  valeat res ludicra si me palma negata macrum donata reducit opimum   and to have bid farewell to it because of some bad consequences   ae but horace might have writ what he pleased and have been pretty sure of approbation others ought to risk but moderately nor can there be a greater mistake than to think of pleasing people of quite opposite tastes the sincere and the scornful the wise and the foolish but there is a certain incontinence of fancy which often proves too hardmouthed for the judgment as the tale of a tub honestly acknowledges it is pity mr hobbess human faculties art v toward the end cautions upon this head were not more observed than they are a witty man happens to let some flings at religion and the scripture for both which he has a real value and his words are treasured up by shallow heads and retaild against his intention but what help they have a mind to shine by the repeating as the author could not shun it in the writing   l in a country of liberty whatever is published will be read and it were hard to take away this privilege though it were practicable as to that of publishing it must be left to the discretion of the legislature and whatever difficulty there might be in restraining the liberty of the press there would be much more in restraining the private use of pen ink and paper and therefore one would think it were not unworthy of the care of the government to appoint a moderate sallary for some who have a little scholarship and common sense to enable them to translate the most approved books whether ancient or modern this would keep them from a certain theft and transmit to us the sentiments of those standardperformances entire and unmixt   ae i wish that were done   l there are two kinds of books almost exploded a while ago the voluminous romances and school divinity it was pity some of the schoolmen had not employed their talents upon more solid things for they have been great men and had a sense of religion but their metaphysical subtilties made their writings of little use to the world and served principally to nourish dispute and contradiction the writers of large romances had some very good ideas of virtue but all was lost in tedious narratives and sometimes they gave too favorable ideas of vice as revenge in particular our novels deal most in scandal   ae considering the great variety of humors it is no wonder there is the same as to books but when a man reflects on the variety in the former it will hinder him from prescribing or recommending entertainments in the latter concluding that people are generally best pleased with their own choice you will see i have here chiefly in view the books designed for amusement harmless raillery is universally acceptable gibing is pretty passable and it is the more honest when it discovers itself in the very title of the performance for instance the praise of folly a tale of a tub and the like if a dash of unlucky humor happens to mingle it is what an author cannot always help sneering is seldom taking because of the air of insincerity that attends it there is somewhat more agreeable even in writings of professed remissness to use mr hobbess expression i shall not say positively that all books are to be read but every body will agree that many of them may be read with very little attention i am sorry i cannot see you again for some days being obliged to go a little into the country   l pray return as soon as you can   ae you know how uncertain all things are but i will endeavor to see you in a few days   two discourses on decency discourse i decency is the least of all laws and the most observed this reflection we have from an eminent person who knew the world very well and it shows how much we stand in awe of the opinion of men but whence comes it that we are so very much afraid of what others will say of us even when we have a very mean opinion of their judgment words are but imaginary lashes and still more when we do not hear them nevertheless some would choose to undergo the severest whipping if no body was to see it rather than undergo the lash of censure and this dread of censure goes yet farther we are afraid of what others will think of us as well as of what they will say  and here it is all one whether decency has any real foundation in nature or if it arises only from the fancies of men since it is the fear of reproach that chiefly makes us avoid indecent things or what passes for such in the eye of the world though it cannot be fairly denied that there is a real as well as an imaginary decency as there is real as well as imaginary honor and though the reality of both is denied by a few persons it is a great question if they are in earnest  it must be granted that decency whether imaginary or real reaches no farther than the outside and circumstances of an action without rendering it either morally good or bad virtuous or vicious decent is one thing and lawful another it is unbecoming to eat alone when a man can have company though no body reckons it unlawful in some other actions no witnesses are to be admitted for very good reasons and the cynicks who had all manner of decorum in such contempt only discovered their own pride and ignorance of human nature the dignity of which must needs put our actions under different regulations from those of inferior animals  if any should ask how we make out this dignity of human nature it might be answered that the power which decency has in the world is at least a strong presumption of some respect justly due to the sentiments of our own species for we are not afraid of what dogs and horses will think of us and we may judge of this power of decency by its being such a restraint upon pleasure sometimes in the most voluptuous  decency then owes its force to some tacit consent and conviction of the dignity of mankind what may be called real decency has its foundation in the natural congruity of things and what may be called imaginary depends only upon custom if any has a mind to call it customary decency as being a softer term i shall easily go into it  it seems to be this last sort of decency which the duke de rochefoucault calls the least of all laws by which term he would seem to have an eye to the great obligations of religion and humanity the laws of the land being tolerably well observed for fear of temporal punishment and some things belonging to religion are pretty well observed too either to compound the matter with our consciences or to get the name of religious persons or at least to be called observers of good order  there is even some reason for observing customary decency or the modes of the world in things that are harmless of inferior classes because an affectation of singularity must be pride or folly or both if a man for instance living in a country where they wear hats should wear a turbant how impertinent would this be in things that are not unlawful nor too inconvenient a compliance ought to be given both on our neighbors account and our own why should we offend others or expose ourselves to laughter for nothing at all indeed if the thing required by this decency appears unlawful about which a mans own conscience must be satisfied he is to stand as firm as he can and if the thing is too inconvenient which must be determined by his prudence a compliance in this case would be want of sense as in the former it would be want of religion although a man is to wear a hat he is not obliged to have a new one every week nor to put lace about it unless such hats were as much the fashion as once were shoulderknots but as some things are evidently fantastical as well as superfluous it would seem deference enough to custom to comply with it only in things of the latter sort and a good mixture of folly will be found even in these there is no help one must be a little foolish in a foolish world  it were much easier to lay down general rules than to point out all the exceptions and limitations that are to be made upon them the world abounds in good maxims but the difficulty lies in the application we see imaginary decency often interferes both with religion and prudence and often gets the better of both but the greatest wonder is that even pleasure sometimes submits to it  the matter seems plainly to stand thus we are at more pains to please the world than either to please our selves or the almighty the foundation of all which is the vain fear of getting a mean character among the few persons that know us or among those that chance to hear of us  it is true there is a desire of praise as well as an aversion to reproach but since they both produce the same good behavior and may proceed from the same vanity it is a matter indifferent which of them be considered as the foundation of decency that great disturber of quiet and pleasure as in another view it may be called the great security of our most valuable possessions  civility and politeness are comprehended in this notion of decency we have been talking of which is but a sort of tenderness for our own character but there may be a civility really proceeding from a fear of making others uneasy which may be called a branch of humanity and is capable of continual advances in true friendship  some hints given by cicero who had the practice of decency much at heart may be of good use to fix some notion of the thing itself speaking of the difference between the words oportet and decet he says to this purpose oportere enim perfectionem declarat officii quo and semper utendum est and omnibus decere quasi aptum esse consentaneumque tempori and personae quod cum in factis saepissime tum in dictis valet in vultu denique and gestu and incessu contraque autem dedecere de oratore to be necessary is understood of the indisputable part of a duty or the perfection of it which is to be observed to all men without distinction and thus we say it must to be decent or when we only say it is fit or proper implies no more than the sutableness of the thing to the time or the person which though it is to be understood most frequently of actions is to be understood also of words and descends even to looks and gestures the failing in any of these things is indecent  this great man always distinguishes carefully between things of a perpetual obligation and such as only depend upon times places and characters and he is so willing there should be nothing wrong even in the smallest matters that he has not forgot to mention the air and gait  he had but little occasion to say any thing about dress and some other points of decency that perplex the world now such things being at that time under more stated regulations  it would appear sometimes as if the apostles themselves had not looked on decency as a thing altogether unworthy of their care for st paul speaks of honest things in the sight of men it is true the two words which are translated into honest and decent and by some persons ridiculed are used promiscuously by that apostle but they would seem in some places to denote somewhat of a lower order than the duties of religion and morality perhaps they may be considered as being opposite to shameful when it does not imply moral turpitude but only some impropriety shocking to the eye as when he says it is a shame for a man to have long hair and that nature even teaches the same no doubt this instance has appeared stronger at that time than it does now but we need observe no more about it than that there are some natural congruities and incongruities neither to be called virtues nor vices which persons of good taste must be more sensible of than others and it is generally reckoned the ancients had a better taste than the moderns  indeed any body that knows the world but very little will see how many difficulties must arise from the fantastical customs of men and their clashing opinions concerning decency now that plainness and simplicity of manners are banished the world some new thing happens every day or almost every hour to put ones discretion to the trial for it is impossible to have rules for every thing laid down to our selves beforehand we find cicero for instance advising to treat people according to their ranks and offices which is certainly a good rule in the general but how are we to treat those persons whose rank is not fixed nor their office known if their fortunes are made that is if they have got some money the quantity of which is not fixed neither it is not usual to enquire any farther but to treat them according to the value they put upon themselves and we find they make their way into the greatest assemblies of what kind soever but as this indulgence may be a good expedient to make such persons easy it must naturally make others uneasy at the same time who look upon the illplacd respect as if it were so much robbed from themselves  for as decency respects not only a mans own character but the character of those he must hold commerce with in the world the difficulty of observing it with reference to others is often greater than with reference to ones self alone for though the world will meddle to judge of a mans fulfilling his character purely as to what he owes himself and his station yet in dealing with others he must both satisfy those that are not concerned and those that are the last of whom will be so much harder to please that they are parties as well as judges  in short there are so many little things to be observed under the notion of decency that as matters now stand it is become a very troublesome affair in the instance of personal respect there seems to be a contradiction between the rules given by cicero and st james which might be such a strait upon christians as to make them free themselves from very much of the burden jam ii   the apostle forbids the respect of persons in very plain words and gives a very plain example of unjust preference and partiality it is true the natural tendency of this would not be to overturn all civility it would rather make it more equal and extensive for another apostle bids us honor all men   pet ii     but the face of christianity is so much altered since those times that in several things relating to politeness and customary decency i am afraid we must follow cicero rather than the apostles since it would be an illsuted thing and contrary to true decency to join the forms of primitive christianity with the spirit that now prevails which may be called a modern heathenism i shall leave this point without any further explication  the first thing that occurred concerning decency was the power it has in the actions of men without regard to its foundation in nature but it seems there is a real congruity in things altogether independent on fancy or on custom and the violation of this congruity or order of nature is in some cases not only indecent but abominable if any body should ask a proof of this assertion i know not how it could be proved by any thing clearer than itself an appeal may be made to any man in his senses whether he is not persuaded there is right and wrong in general if any should deny such a distinction he would cease to be a member of human society and all correspondence must be given up with him as if one should deny there is any difference between light and darkness or bid us prove that we see and hear we must take leave and part even those who would pull up the fence of worldly decency would introduce very wretched doings but they will make very few proselytes while the desire of pleasing is so rooted in the heart of man  most people are not only convinced of the distinction of right and wrong in things of highest consequence but they allow it to take place even in trifles there are certain demonstrations of civility which are more or less shocking to the eye but as such things are properly the dancingmasters care so an error as to them is not to be called incivility but aukwardness an honest farmer may be a very civil person though he knows not how to make a leg and his clownish behavior is even more agreeable than finical airs and speeches  such things are indeed but arbitrary signs of civility and purely depending upon custom though still there is a better and a worse manner of performing them and it were strange if the mind of a rational creature made for truth and benevolence were not shocked with things of an immoral kind as well as the eye is uneasy to see such frivolous incongruities  the very word bienseance supposes there is a natural fitness or agreement or something that every body understands by the words proper becoming fit seemly and twenty more to the same purpose which may have taken their rise from some sensible ideas as that of peoples clothes sitting well or hanging well about them the tailor being here the great lawgiver and hence decent pride has come to be a current expression for it is certain that one persons pride has a more becoming air than anothers  to say that all this proceeds purely from custom and education is to begin at the wrong end for these are founded upon decency and not decency upon them imaginary decency will allow custom a large enough province but real decency will allow it no province at all it stands upon it is own foundation and when instances are brought from the miserable behavior of the hotentots and such rude tribes to overthrow decency in all its acceptations the objection can have little weight against the general sense of mankind in all ages these poor people are certainly ill educated and so are many of the polite world in a different respect education is commonly but a servile imitation of others the rule that parents propose in bringing up their children being to make them mere apes as they have no better standard of life themselves and so the world goes on but the mistake is in supposing that education constitutes the beauty of things whereas it only helps us to see it as a musickmaster may be said to help the ear to perceive the harmony at the same time that he teaches the hand to play and here indeed we see the force of custom very remarkably the external practice is not only facilitated but the internal relish is improved also the frequent hearing good music and the seeing good painting improves the taste in both and the contrary tends evidently to corrupt it  nor can this influence of custom be denied in matters of virtue and even in speculations as some little things in dress and outward behavior are called either decent or nasty just as they happen to be fashionable or unfashionable many persons have hardly a better rule either for their opinions or their practice but as philosophy cannot pretend to account for those impressions all the use that ought to be made of the observation is to guard against bad examples and to think as freely and deliberately as possible i have not designed in any of these little byreflections concerning the dignity of man and the order of things to carry the notion of decency any higher than was given of it at first that is only as it affects the circumstances of our actions without making us innocent or guilty in the sight of heaven it is very true that every thing that is sinful is indecent the lesser being comprehended in the greater but every thing that is indecent is not sinful and many things which the world would reckon indecent are far from being so in reality but the vexation that arises upon censure or the fear of incurring it works so strongly upon that fund of shame within mankind that they hardly do or omit any thing without putting the question as it were to themselves what will be said of it and it is well that this restraint is in the world  there is indeed a true shame as well as a false or rather it takes its denomination from the things we are ashamed of if they are contrary to real decency the shame is just either when we feel it or fear it if they are only contrary to fantastical decency the shame is foolish but the confusion and dejection of mind may be the same as people are sometimes really frighted at a shadow the mauvaise honte of the french often means bashfulness which is much owing to the complexion the blood being more easily put in agitation in some persons than others and the appearance it makes in the countenance is far from being unbecoming in the sex and in young men  that the passion of shame is peculiar to mankind is generally agreed on as also that it is often the result of pride another quality peculiar to our species fear and fierceness belong to other animals but they are hardly touched with shame or capable of reflecting on the consequences of their actions all their motions are sudden and they go directly to their aim if in their anger they seem to deliberate before they attack it must be from some apprehension of getting the worst but in following their appetites they have neither reflection nor remorse in which respect mankind are not so happy who have their pleasure to gratify and their character to support at the same time and when the one or the other must give way decency pleads for the character and is sometimes hearkened to and sometimes not  the greater the pride is this decency has the greater dominion we find every body complaining of the tyranny of custom which is in other words the tyranny of decency but it gets a new dominion from the elevation of persons or their rank in the world for though the meanest person has his pride and his decencies to observe yet they are far more numerous and troublesome to those in higher stations who having for the most part little else to do contrive many fanciful things and subject themselves and others to the observance of them and as the world is the school where these painful rules are learned the thing chiefly recommended is the acquaintance of people of fashion and the advice is by no means to be despised but it should be remembered that the world is also the school of vanity wherein selflove is more nourished than either virtue or true decency which may be called its offspring so that we should look out for persons of virtue and good taste in order to form our manners as well as to make our few days pass with the less chagrin  our quiet must certainly have some other foundation than the decency of the world or we shall have no true quiet at all we may well hug our selves a little in the concealment of our actions and motives and reckon it clear gain what is thus hid from the eyes of men but still many discoveries will be made against us notwithstanding our slavish hypocrisy so long as we have no better principle than the desire of mens esteem or the fear of their reproach any body may consider how poor a thing a life must be that is spent in grimaces and airs though religion were out of the question even our observance of punctilios ought to be from the heart that is from an honest intention not to shock our friends and acquaintance and upon that account chiefly the trespasses against decency of all kinds are to be avoided singularity is very offensive as being a tacit reprimand of the behavior of others who fail not in their turn to call those singularities ridiculous and they may really appear so through their unusualness  it is always to be remembered that we are to consult the world no farther than as to our outward behavior nor does it pretend to teach us the rules of virtue but only how to shun ridicule a thing on the other hand we ought not to be too much afraid of lest we make a sacrifice of our virtue our convenience and all there is the more reason for this caution that the world is made up of so many different tastes that it is simply impossible to please all this man shall complain that you use too much ceremony with him if you use less of it with another he shall think you brutal and perhaps the former complainer would not have been so easy if any part of it had been omitted this is but one instance it is impossible to mention all the trespasses and regulations in the affair of decency and the mistakes people fall into by their injudicious endeavors to please very often mistaking the objects of their civility and complaisance as well as the right proportion of the thing if a man should be surly to his own family and his nearest friends and obliging and frank with those he only makes an afternoons visit to this were no argument either of his good sense or his good humor but would look like a vain desire of applause from those he has little to do with and if a woman should fall into the same affectation it would be nothing to her praise husbands and wives have certainly a title to good looks and good words as well as strangers  the world will be a good enough school to form our behavior in many little things to tame our natural wildness to smooth our roughness and even to qualify our civility that it may not dwindle into formal ceremony or too soft complaisance all which must bring ridicule upon us and it is the proper business of this schoolmistress for so the world may be likewise called to prevent that mortification  the severity of the schoolmistress will hardly be complained of when we consider the allowances that are given to gratify the strongest inclinations of the heart a man is not found fault with for striving to get as much money as he can or aspiring after the highest employments and honors in the commonwealth he is rather blamed if he omits any opportunity of raising himself or neglects any pleasure all the instruction the world gives is to keep free of certain blunders in our conduct and weak appearances which affect the outward character without any regard to vice or virtue the neglect of that instruction does expose us to the severity of the world which in different respects may be called tyrannical and gentle and the highest prudence is to know when to make it our guide and when to despise its maxims  discourse ii plerique homines quos cum nihil refert pudet ubi pudendum est ibi illos deserit pudor  as creatures of the same species have commonly a pleasure in herding and flocking together the like pleasure is found among mankind with the desire of mutual approbation added to it solitude and selfapprobation will not always support us nor will company and our own approbation do it separately we must often have the approbation of others in order to reconcile us to ourselves it is true there is one sort of pride which will very much lessen the desire of approbation that is when a person is thoroughly possessed with an opinion of his own excellency but this pitch of extravagance is very rare inferior degrees of it will be enough to slacken the toilsome pursuit of applause nay if one is hot in the pursuit of any other thing he will mind the judgment of the public so much the less and applaud himself as the miser does when the people hiss him  but as any inclination is seldom so strong as to make one renounce all views of popular applause so the too eager pursuit of that uncertainty is called vanity rather than pride vanity denoting the emptiness of the thing as well as the frivolous temper of the person and thus some have made a distinction between pride and vanity giving us an idea of two different sorts of men those who content themselves with their own approbation and those who are uneasy without the approbation of others but perhaps the first temper is not only very rare but impossible in nature and so the difference is only in the greater and lesser degrees of selfsufficiency or in the way that pride discovers itself in different persons those that are fond of outward show or of making an appearance are called vain those that value themselves upon their inward endowments proud but both parties value themselves and both parties may be called vain as both are really proud some proud of their native ornaments others of borrowed ones and the very proudest can hardly be supposed free from the desire of esteem from others they are indeed freer from ostentation and their desire of esteem is more concealed but pure independent selfsufficiency is not a natural state of mind and if the notion should enter the thoughts of any created being it must argue the greatest disorder of the understanding that is conceivable  by selfconceit is meant a much inferior disorder implying only an opinion of ones own merit not well enough founded and this state of mind is only chargeable with more or less folly but the simple desire of approbation is neither chargeable with folly nor vice for it is as natural to desire the approbation of others as their friendship though friendship is the most delightful possession and commonly draws the other after it we always esteem those we love though we dont always love those we esteem  there are other kinds of pride which belong not so naturally to the present subject such as the desire of power or deminion over the persons of others and the desire of subduing their judgment the latter of these is most found in spiritual matters though a desire of temporal power may sometimes be at the bottom the desire of a little triumph in conversation is less extravagant but more common and arises almost upon every subject whether grave or frivolous but this observation may be made that according to the several kinds of pride in man in conjunction with their several tempers and humors some are more inclined to company others to solitude the pursuers of fame must expose themselves to public view cost what it will the less ostentive are more disposed to solitude those again who are remarkably afraid of contempt will for that very reason prefer solitude thinking they make a good bargain rochefoucault to renounce all the good that others might say of them upon condition they would say no ill  this maxim by the way might infer some middle state between approbation and reproach which is not so conceivable unless the saying nothing should proceed from an absolute suspense of the mind but this is not usual most minds being forward enough to pronounce sentence one way or other and most actions and motives being pretty evidently either worthy of praise or blame  there is likewise a certain distinction betwixt approbation and applause the former being understood to be given by good judges and the latter by the multitude applause will never be desired where there is wisdom and the desire of approbation is only pride when it is courted for itself without desiring a virtuous disposition and again though the fondness for reputation may be an argument of pride the neglect of it will be no argument of humility but of an abandoned character or being without shame but man is not only under different directions or impulses from his pride but also from his opposits inclinations these also varying according to different circumstances of age or fortune so that our motions must be very uncertain and irregular and sometimes our opinions are excited by our inclinations and sometimes our inclinations by our opinions  these reflections and many more that will easily occur may be of some use to discover the foundation of decency as well as to show wherein it consists if some things are naturally becoming men must be pleased to see them observed and the doer is pleased doubly by his adhering to nature and his pleasing others there is good humor and complaisance as well as vanity in mankind but this very complaisance had need of regulations that it go not to an excess and as things now stand a little pride must often come to the support of weak virtue if it shall be called only the support of a character it may be granted that the aim often goes no farther but then the character may be reckoned at least among the outworks for the defense of virtue  religion and good manners seem to express all the obligations men are under natural affection and humanity no doubt are obligations too but they are included in religion as all the duties are that concern our neighbor but by good manners people generally understand morality or moral virtue which is reckoned inferior to religion and yet is a higher thing than what is called good breeding or decency which though the least of all laws is more observed than any  our obligations standing in this order it may be thought strange that the lowest should be so much minded and the highest so little all other laws have a sanction to enforce their observance decency has not so much as the name of a law and the sanction of it is only censure and yet the fear of incurring this imaginary pain is sometimes greater than the fear of hell many persons i know would take it very ill to have their belief of a future state called in question but let them examine themselves and see how far their belief affects their conduct and whether their fears are not more awakened as to the temporal confusion than the eternal and all the exquisite torments they believe are joined with it  this fear of shame and disgrace contributes not a little even to the observance of temporal laws it sometimes goes farther than the fear of death and where the opinion of the world makes a crime extraordinarily disgraceful it is very rarely committed as theft among men of fashion if the opinion of the world should happen to change the taking a bribe would be as little hear of among some ranks as the picking a pocket  but as neither opinion nor custom can alter the nature of things there will still be a party however small that will approve and blame according to reason and so decency will be allowed all the privileges it can justly pretend to and no more  could a man be contented with the approbation of this small party he would find himself considerably at ease good judges are not only just but mild so far as the thing will bear and are not severe upon every little trespass or punctilio the multitude indeed by whom are meant the cager followers of custom are very indulgent in some matters of consequence but sometimes they cannot forgive the least trifle again the great body of the people as they are almost without the sphere of decency established by custom which does not dazzle them so they see better in matters of real decency and abhor those crimes which the higher ranks overlook  if this distinction should be quarreled as if it were making two different multitudes or two classes of the mob it may be answered the distinction is not new and only shows that the difference between seneca fine clothes and coarse can add no weight to the judgment of the wearers and certainly it is a great point gained toward a mans quiet when he knows who are his proper judges and is indifferent about the opinion of others this if one could get at it is not going too far in stoicism nobody would choose to be on the rack to their lives end and a creature that pretends to reason had need also to consider what life is designed for as well as what the best means are to make it easy  now upon a very little reflection a man will find that he has not been made to be a mountebank but to act a more solid part to do what good he can and to endeavor heartily to acquire a delight in all virtues in proportion to their value and delight every body knows makes a facility in practice  but this is still to be remembered that though the delight in virtue is said to be acquirable yet the sense of it or the faculty of relishing it is brought with us into the world as we bring the faculty of reason itself which ripens by degrees and all our powers are improved or weakened by good or bad management to say nothing of the foundation that is laid in this state of trial for our future happiness or unhappiness  it is true decency and virtue have different provinces and the former may be said to lie only within the verge of this dream of life wherein our fellowpassengers may indeed set up tribunals to judge of our behavior but we know all the harm these judges can do us  as we discover our pride therefore by affecting an universal esteem and our cowardice by the subjection we put ourselves under so in both instances we discover our folly the thing in the world we would wish to discover least we can put a plausible face on some of our weaknesses and imagine other people will show the like favor our fear we can term prudence our covetousness good management and so of other failings but folly is laughed at and hissed by every body and when our own good opinion forsakes us it is natural to conclude that we are ridiculed by others nay sometimes through the disorder of our judgment we think we are more ridiculed than we are or that certain practices and omissions will draw more contempt upon us than possibly they can and so we fall into the very thing we would avoid by our apprehension of falling into it  thus mankind by mistaking their judges and their duties are still upon the rack and in constant slavery unless we should except a very few emperors to whom no rules are prescribed but their own will but though we do not know all that passes in their breasts we may presume they have some fear of censure like other mortals nor if we turn our eyes to the opposite and lowest rank can we affirm that they have got over all human regards it is probable that even sturdy beggars are afraid of some reproach among their own gang  whatever be of that we are pretty sure the greatest rakes among gentlemen have some qualms about their reputation and though they talk and write against decency as if they wished it were out of the world and probably they do bear it a grudge yet they cannot shake off its yoke and are as much hypocrites in another way as those who pretend to have a value for it both parties paying it a sort of homage whether they will or not  decency it seems will triumph over all ranks and characters and will be a constant discipline to mankind but our pride and ignorance make it a greater discipline than otherwise it would be for if virtue be agreeable to a taste that is not wholly vitiated decency will be agreeable too it is not inconsistent with virtue but rather is inseparable from it as the shadow from the body  virtuous persons therefore will observe decency from the principles of virtue the love of order and true civility as the vicious will observe it from selfinterest and so it may be looked upon as a great instrument for preserving some peace and good order in the world few persons being so thoroughly virtuous as to need no restraints and few so thoroughly abandoned as neither to be capable of remorse nor shame  perhaps it would be expected after these little speculations concerning decency that some instances should be given of the trespasses against it but as it would be but a disagreeable task any person of tolerable sense will easily know such trespasses when he sees them and it is no advantage to have the head filled with unlucky images all trespasses against virtue are certainly trespasses against decency though the contrary position does not always hold but several things that are only looked on by some as breaches of decency are really breaches of virtue and even of religion if any man among you seems to be religious and bridleth not his tongue but deceives his own heart this mans religion is vain st james  but not to make the world worse than it is a great deal of the humor of detraction proceeds not so much either from pride or malignity as from a mere habit of idle talking till at last the head becomes a register of trash and scandal and the itch of repeating increases with the itch of hearing if this apology should not be kindly received i should be content to know another source of the errors in conversation than either vanity or illhumour or downright folly and there is sometimes a combination of all the three  the instances of indecency in common conversation which would make a very large book are not the only trespasses we trespass against decency in most things we do for our pleasure and even for the support of our character though in things of this latter class it is custom under the name of decency that misleads us for if we are but told that such a thing is done or not done we enquire no farther but as we are not to torture ourselves with the fear of being ill spoke of we must even shun too great a squeamishness or the fear of doing ill where religion and virtue are silent common sense must determine the best way it can  the sex have their particular decencies both natural and artificial which they observe with great exactness decent pride is appropriated to them and though it is but a poetical expression both sexes being under equal obligations as to virtue and under equal restraints as to vice yet the women have a right to value themselves a little upon their native charms and the outward advantages of fortune that men who have more ill nature than they and as much vanity of another kind may not look upon them as too easy a conquest good sense and some religion to which women are more inclinable than men will help to keep this selfesteem of theirs within due bounds that they may not forget their loveliest and even brightest character good humor nor appear without the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit for it must not be forgot that there is a difference between decent pride and decency itself and it seems to be this decency is a certain gracefulness in actions decent pride is a regard to reputation with some mixture of selfesteem not too observable and it were good upon some occasions that even men had a little more of this quality till a better principle takes place if selfinterest could be wholly separated from the regard to reputation it would immediately be of the number of the pure virtues and if a man had any view of being useful to the world the more reputation he has the more he is useful  pride would get very little footing in the midst of applause and approbation if a man knew himself well and what he is in soul and body at his best he would soon acknowledge the truth of that ancient expression pride was not made for man the same knowledge would inform him that applause is a dangerous thing for a mind so easily puffed up and as the knowledge of ourselves and the knowledge of the world are subservient to each other so by this latter knowledge we find out the difficulty and the emptiness of that airy conquest and by seeing the ridicule that others fall into we are somewhat on our guard to shun it the fear of shame being as natural to us as the fear of pain and shame is truly a pain of the mind as every one that has felt it will acknowledge  those who allege that shame is only artificially worked up in human nature may as well allege that any other sensation is so worked up the fear of it indeed may be artificially excited in us as the fear of several things may be excited the same way we may be afraid where no fear is as well as ashamed where no shame is and we may be insensible both as to fear and shame when we have most reason to be sensible of both as the old comedian has told us  one might easily be led into a dissertation upon shame especially from the words of the text designing only to make a few reflections upon decency such a connection there is between the two and the different sorts of ridicule or the variety of ridiculous characters are ready also to come into the mind but as such characters are without number and are all trespasses against decency many of them are represented every day in books of wit and humor and even in books of divinity so that the world may be well instructed in the ways of shunning derision and indeed all the authors have reason for touching upon that string since the fear of shame is so prevalent with men it is a thing that stirs very early for even nurses endeavor to shame their young ones into good behavior and decency before reason is awakened in them and it often has a good effect beyond the threats of whipping  this sense of shame is often a promising disposition toward virtue and is a very agreeable delicacy of spirit impudence is stupidity it is the want of one kind of sense or of something implanted by the author of nature in rational creatures we see how carefully those decencies are observed that relate to the body as if there was a respect due even to it and men were conscious of some advantage in their outward form no nation goes upon all four the body is not only covered but adorned it is true this may infer a consciousness of defect and some natural disadvantages which must be granted but it is the part of reason to supply and rectify all disadvantages so far as it can we even observe numberless decencies naturally without art and instruction from a sense of what is beautiful as well as of what is unseemly if we hear sometimes of poor doings and great degeneracy in human nature it needs give no more surprise than when we see a good tree illtraind or a piece of ground overrun with weeds it happens on the other hand too often that external decencies are minded with an extraordinary carefulness when there are horrid trespasses committed against virtue  a few hints or items well remembered will save a multitude of illustrations that might be made upon this subject of decency what follows is not proposed to have the authority of maxims but is offered only to the consideration of some persons who have not much leisure to read large treatises and upon a very little attention a variety of reflections will spring in their own minds in a short time  there must be a fund to work upon in concurrence with good instruction  man naturally loves virtue and decency and when he is deceived it is under an appearance of something that is good  we are often led by mere imitation and often ruined by it  decent with most people is but another word for customary hence the interfering of decency and virtue  decency in opinions is more properly truth in inclinations and actions it is virtue and goodness but the common province of decency goes no farther than the circumstances of actions or the manner of doing them  we often fall into extravagances and follies thinking to avoid what is reckoned indecent and the contempt that follows upon it but more frequently we fall into these inconveniences from the humor of distinction and superiority  the indecencies of conversation arise from vanity illhumour and a bastard kind of good humor this false complaisance appears much in the custom of detraction it goes on against the absent because it is supposed to be agreeable to the present who become the absent the next moment and suffer in their turn  professed indecency of any kind is insolence vanity is commonly the first inducement to foolish talking thus smutty jests oftener show the ostentation of wit than the inclination to lewdness and impious expressions are no sure argument of unbelief  an excess of talking of any kind is seldom free from the same vanity  moroseness is the effect of pride as if the company was not worthy of our mixing with it the indecency lies in the sullen air  indecencies in apparel are as much shunned as any herein custom triumphs eminently it is the chief point of uniformity among all ranks and parties  in all other articles of expense that which is nearest the middle must be decency the precise point not being discoverable the extremes of high and low are either called extravagant or sordid  we see of what use this inexplicable thing decency is for regulating all our different motions it keeps our pride itself in some order though it be called its daughter and if it does not restrain our inclinations and aversions it often hinders them from breaking out it lulls our spirits asleep and by turns rouses them in short decency may be now reckoned of such service in the commonwealth that without it the judicatures both in church and state would have much more to do than they have to say nothing of the tranquillity it helps to preserve in private families  an essay on selflove modus ergo diligendi praecipiendus est homini id est qu se diligat aut prosit sibi quin autem se diligat aut  sibi dubitare dementis est an essay on selflove introduction the disputes upon this subject have been very much increased as it still happens by the different acceptations of the terms which ought regularly to have been adjusted before entering upon the merits or demerits of the thing some men have exalted selflove so high as to make it the source of the greatest duties while others have looked upon it as the sink of all wickedness and sometimes its greatest advocates when they are pressed with difficulties declare plainly they meant no other thing but selfpreservation which if duly regulated no body can have a good reason to condemn  from this obscurity and contradiction have arisen new disputes concerning human nature some making very unfavourable reports of it and others affirming it to be without fault the former party assert that a man is not capable of the least act of common honesty or common friendship without a deliberate prospect of his own interest as the prevailing motive and thus the selfish principle which may be compared to the dead fly in the apothecarys ointment is set up as the only wisdom or true rule of all actions and designs this is also a false account of religion if we suppose man to have a higher end than himself or consider religion as the duty we owe another being and a being of such perfections as are only to be found in the deity  the latter party maintain the principle of disinterestedness sufficiently but as they deny the infirmity and corruption of human nature their doctrine labors under insuperable difficulties  these two partys are diametrically opposite to each other in their schemes and opinions agreeing only in their aversion to revealed religion which indeed would be an useless thing if either of the schemes was true a creature so highly exalted and able to govern itself needed no other assistance and a creature so very low and deprived of all liberty must be incapable of any degree of virtue  there is a third sort of men who admit the difference between right and wrong and show likewise a great respect for the christian religion i ought to say farther that i believe them to be sincere but at the same time they are so violent advocates for selflove or the interested principle as to speak of the pure disinterested love of god in very unbecoming terms  since any controversy that may arise in this essay is chiefly with those who own christianity i shall say little in behalf either of its proofs or its doctrine both which have stood firm against the attacks of more subtle spirits than we have at present my principal design being in a rational way to show the best and the worst of selflove and in what sense it is to be understood before it can be set up either as the principle of vice or virtue  sect i selflove commonly taken in a bad sense the d of rochefoucaults account of it custom which determines the signification of words has generally put a bad meaning upon selflove so that a selflover is reckoned the same with an interested unjust person whose interest or pleasure in whatever form it appears to him will be his constant aim without any regard to the rules of equity  when st paul says in the last days men shall be    timothy iii   lovers of their own selves no body doubts but that he speaks of a very remarkable degeneracy there selflove is put at the head of a great train of vices as if it was the parent of them all lovers of their own selves covetous or lovers of money boasters proud etc we find also in st augustins lib x cap    confessions an account of a very extravagant perverse state of mind wherein selflove or selfcomplacency is carried so far that the person minds the pleasing of no body but himself and values himself upon those gifts he receives freely from god despising others who he thinks are not so privileged and envying such as are hence the idea of spiritual pride  conformable to these acceptations of selflove the french and other nations generally understand by it pride and all other ill qualities of the mind but pride most frequently selfishness is every where a vile character  among the easiest acceptations of selflove is such a selfcomplacency or selfconceit as is represented by the fable of narcissus and which is only considered as a folly but it is accompanied for the most part with arrogance and a desire of engrossing all things and thus selflove has become a current term for pride as was said before or another word for corrupt nature in all its tendencies at the same time it is a softer word and so has been introduced by polite persons when they had not a mind to shock delicate ears  there is a masterly description of selflove supposed to be done by the duke of rochefoucault as it now works in the heart of man it is a small book and very much known he begins thus see the additions no ii selflove is the love of ones self and of all things for the sake of ones self after which definition he proceeds to mention the effects it makes men idolaters of themselves and would make them the tyrants of others if fortune gave them an opportunity this supposes the total subversion of our duty both to god and man we not only act as if we were independent of the almighty but we set up ourselves to be worshipped in his stead and are not only careless and unmindful of our neighbors interest but make a sacrifice of it and him to our own such is the modesty of selflove  mean time the first part of the definition selflove is the love of ones self gives us but little discovery and the second part of it is not quite so proper for the love of things for our own sake implies only a desire of them as being serviceable to us the love terminating upon ourselves and thus some have blunderd who confound selflove with the love of pleasure or any thing the heart is set upon and sometimes additions no i pleasure and interest and happiness are all jumbled together and made convertible terms for selflove which is a greater confusion still but this criticism has nothing to do with the duke of rochefoucaults account of selflove who seems only to have intended to give a representation of that principle in its various shapes and bad consequences accordingly he next considers it in its impetuousness its subtilty its refinements and adds that it is often invisible to it self that it hatches and nourishes an infinite number of inclinations and aversions some of which are so very monstrous that it cannot believe them to be its own brood he says it is made up of contradictions and can act the most contrary parts proud and fawning it changes its pursuits of glory riches and pleasure according to our complexion and the changes of our age and our condition but it is equal to it to have many pursuits or but one for it can divide itself into many or contract itself into one as it has a mind he gives a view of its inconstancy both as it proceeds from the insufficiency of things which please us and our own natural changeableness he shows its extreme positiveness which makes a man do the most fantastical things and even such as are hurtful to himself for no other reason but merely that he may gratify his own will and this gives the idea of positive blind selfwill instances of which are very frequent in life he concludes that selflove is found among all ranks and in all conditions it lives every where it lives upon every thing nay it lives upon nothing it finds its account even in the most rigid austerities hoping it seems to get the reputation of sanctity in exchange this says he is a lively representation of selflove the continual agitation whereof may be compared to the restless ebbing and flowing of the sea the prophet isaiah makes use of the same image isaiah lvii  0  the wicked are like the troubled sea when it cannot rest whose waters cast up mire and dirt  from that description of selflove abridged as it is we may form an idea of it as of a bottomless gulf out of which issue those three rivers of pride covetousness and sensuality as there is nothing that proceeds out of the corrupt heart of man but may be reduced to one or other of those impure streams or as mr pascal calls them those rivers of fire all that is in the world is the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life  sect ii the change made on selflove by the fall as the fall of adam is concluded by all christians from the authority of sacred writ to have made a strange alteration upon all the powers and faculties of human nature so mr pascal gives different accounts of selflove before the fall and after it he says sect xxx  man was at first created with two kinds of love the one for god the other for himself but with this condition that the love for god should be infinite that is without any other end but god alone and that the love for himself should be finite and leading to god as the end  rapportant a dieu man in that state not only loved himself without sin but he could not lawfully have ceased to love himself when sin entered into man he lost the first of those loves and the love of himself having remained alone in that great soul of his which was capable of infinite love this selflove spread itself and overflowed the vast space which the love of god had forsaken and thus he loved himself alone and all things for himself or in other words he loved himself infinitely  this supposition of the fall makes the injustice of selflove certainly no less than it was before and the folly of it infinitely greater if man was to love himself when he was uncorrupted and entire only with such an inferior and subordinate kind of love as mr pascal represents shall he love himself now in his corruption and misery with such a supreme and ultimate love as if he were the deity itself this is a thing that even some of the deists exclaim against as the highest extravagance and it is shocking to common sense though christianity were out of the question  we see mr pascal does not pretend to account for the fall of man but only tells by way of history that when sin entered his condition was so very much changed that he is now overspread as with a loathsome disease no iii  but what idea can we have of sin it is but a negative thing we can only consider it as an apostasy or some perverse state of mind which has brought such miseries upon man and all things about him and what is this apostasy but some defection in our own favor the source of which seems to have been pride and pride is but selfesteem forgetting the original from whence all good things are derived and so transgressing every day as at first but it may now according to the common phrase see its sin in its punishment we ourselves and whatever we may be said to have commerce with being reduced to such extreme infirmity and disorder the charity also of the great author may appear in changing the state of things from what they were that so man might have wherewithal to be undeceived both from within himself and from the defects of the inferior creation  sect iii what may be called lawful in selflove from some of its improper acceptations that art or address which the divine wisdom has implanted in every living creature for its own good is often called selfpreservation and sometimes selflove though it is thus common to all animals and is no more than an impulse or determination toward their own safety every animal is dear to itself without thinking of it and at the approach of any danger we find a sudden effort used for selfdefence as when we are falling we naturally throw out our arms the want of this care and address would be stupidity  the same divine wisdom which is also called nature has added to the impulse of selfpreservation another impulse in every living creature toward its ease or its delights and though in rational creatures we hear much of a desire of happiness and they actually have it yet it operates often without reflection or any deliberate project and design if this desire be called natural good will to ourselves selfaffection or even selflove there is no harm in any of the terms if we but allow of a principle of good will toward other creatures upon their proper account as well as upon our own that is if we allow of a desire of good to them as well as of good to our selves in both cases the benevolence or desire of good operates first reason serving to direct us in the choice of proper objects and the means of happiness  in rational creatures when they act rationally the desire of happiness is the same with the desire of perfection here is meant the highest happiness when a man discovers the dignity of his nature he immediately wishes to arrive at all the excellency he is capable of and his good will to himself far from being extinguished is put under new regulations  the question at present is not how we come to discover our dignity whether by our own natural light or a supernatural all the design is to show that the desire of happiness in general was before that discovery and continues after it independent of reason the due exercise of which would indeed inform us that our happiness must be founded in the disinterested pursuit of truth and justice  sect iv the desires of man considered more particularly we may therefore consider in man these several kinds of desire   a desire of simple existence   a desire of ease or indolence   a more positive desire of pleasure either for the body or the mind and   a desire of perfection or true happiness which is only to be found in the love of the sovereign beauty and goodness the three first desires are natural and can only be called criminal in so far as injustice or vice enters into them the fourth must have been natural to man in his original state though it is not so natural in the present and therefore now appears to be rather a divine desire than a natural so rare and so languid is the desire of perfection nor supposing it to be in the strongest degree would it be virtuous unless it were animated by the love of truth and justice  it must be remembered that the idea of love implies more than simple desire it supposes some acquaintance and notion of the object which it esteems and with which it desires to be united it is a secret attraction and the pleasure or charm is derived from the object whereas desire is here supposed to be only blind appetite in which the understanding has no share and the value of the object is not considered it must be remembered too that even love the more it is struck with the beauty of the object will still act with less reflection on itself and still have its own interest less in view this may be applied to love in general which is often called blind as well as desire but where the object is supposed worthy of the affection blind is too harsh an epithet since no more can be meant but that the heart is captivated and only if it be unreasonably so is the love to be called blind or blinded  besides the several desires abovementioned nature has farther implanted in us a desire of the approbation of others our own not being sufficient to support us which seems to be founded on a tacit respect that all mankind have for one another or a conviction of the dignity of human nature with all which desires there is a selfcomplacency almost constantly supposed to attend us and to have been wisely given to reconcile us to our low state and to support us against the contempt of others but the selfcomplacency here supposed to be without fault is a quite different thing from that which was spoke of in the foregoing sections as implying either folly or arrogance or both and the desire of approbation is an additional tie upon men to observe the rules of humanity and all good order  now as the gratification of all our lawful desires lawfully pursued may be called our true interest so this interest cannot properly be called selflove because a very great degree of that principle may be found in the pursuit of things altogether destructive if it shall be said that it is not a right selflove that makes men pursue such destructive things it may be said just as well that it is not a right pride or a right covetousness that makes men pursue them which would not be a very significant way of speaking  sect v the two principles of action or the opposite sources of virtue and vice in rational creatures there are but two principles or two sources to which all deliberate actions are reducible viz selfinterest and disinterestedness if we seek for the moral good or ill of an action the virtue or vice of it we must have recourse to one of these two principles what a man does merely for his own ends has no share of virtue in it on the contrary the sole motive of interest rather stains an action that is otherwise materially good to use a plain instance if i do a man a good office to receive in return either a good office from him or a good character from the world no body will reckon this a virtue we may therefore conclude that the virtue or worth of an action is only to be rated by its disinterestedness  it is not indeed in our power to put things always to that touchstone and we may be imposed upon by false appearances but we know well in the general whence the worth is derived and fail not to pronounce things both worthy and worthless when no interest of our own can possibly determine us friendship has been accounted a sacred thing all the world over whence can it have that character but from the disinterestedness conceived to be in it and however interested the common friendships of the world may be yet every man in his particular professions thereof disclaims any view to interest being sensible that a friendship founded upon that bottom is but mere traffic and merchandise  this shows the general sense of mankind as to the speculation of the thing from which we may conclude the reality of it and it is not easy to conceive how that can be good which every body is ashamed to own even horace who was no extraordinary divine seems to intimate to us that we ought to examine ourselves upon the motives of our friendship that we may discover quidve ad amicitias usus rectumne trabat nos after this essay was written and it is now some years i had the satisfaction to find the same passage cited by the bishop of cambray and also some of cls expressions to support the doctrine of disinteressed love he makes use of more testimonies from the heathens for truth is always truth the reader may see the  volume of his spiritual works discourse xli whether we are engaged by profit or a better principle and he had reason for the desire of any thing merely for its usefulness to us implies that we have no more regard for it to use the words of another butler poet than for the desk we write upon  if virtuous actions thus derive their value from their disinterestedness the baseness of vicious actions must be from their interestedness for contraries cannot come from the same principle no more than sweet and bitter waters from the same fountain  vice no iii  and sin and wickedness are but different words for the same thing they certainly imply some great corruption and injustice two other words or qualities the source of which we can find no where but in selfregards or interestedness no man nemo gratuito malus est  says salust is wicked for nothing when we are unjust it is still some way or other in our own favor the scripture says of ahab that he sold himself to work wickedness so in many instances of corruption men may be said to sell themselves even when the abominations are not so heinous but there is still some interest or bait presupposed to induce them to make the wretched bargain  sect vi the corruption of selflove farther considered with respect to all virtues and friendship in particular though i was against the making a jumble of selflove with true interest so as to make each of the terms stand indifferently for the other yet selflove and selfinterest may be convertible without any confusion that is when a person is said to act from selflove he may be as well said to act from selfinterest or from the principle of interest the view of his own advantage whether he act prudently or no being his principle and often his sole motive and this leading motive or interestedness is frequently enough expressed by the short word self as such a thing has a great deal of self in it and the like but to pass to what is more material  if selflove be not the same with corruption in things relating to virtue at least it may be reckoned the cause of the corruption men often talk both of corruption and integrity but can neither define the one nor the other and it is no wonder since it is as hard to give a definition of sweetness and bitterness or such things as strike the outward senses but we see in fact that a man led by his own interest will ruin every thing committed to his trust when he can do it with impunity and will even venture on the highest punishment and infamy when the temptation is great this made mr pascal say le sect xxix moi est haissable self is a hateful thing both because it is unjust in making it self the center of all things and oppressive to others in designing to subject them to it self for every selfish man is a common enemy and would be the tyrant of all others if he could again our sect ix inclinations ought to stand toward the public and this bias toward ourselves is the first spring of all disorder in war in politics in oeconomicks  it is this bias toward ourselves which spoils all in war it makes disputes about command and just so in politics and even in church matters the desire of preeminence is a great spring of division the same selfish bias is the ruin of domestic affairs not only as it occasions what is called bad economy but which is of more importance as it destroys the tenderest and closest unions  an older author says stronger things yet of the selfish principle calling it by the names self me nature the old man and affirms it to have been the cause of adams fall and the devils before both having affected to be somewhat and arrogated to themselves what they ought not it is a small book entitled the german theology and much esteemed by protestants and papists  but to come lower down to the damage that friendship suffers from selflove it can hardly be better illustrated than by lib ii cap xxii arrian upon epictetus he makes friendship as uncertain as the agreement among children or little dogs who play together very cordially till some bone of contention is thrown among them and he adds that fathers and sons will be divided in the same manner if they chance to interfere in their amors or in any thing else he also gives the instance of eteocles and polynices two brothers who were brought up together and lived in the strictest friendship till the sweet of dominion set them by the ears and made them fight hand to hand and kill one another on the spot it is indeed unnecessary to go to old examples  the same philosopher says farther that if men take it in their heads that the gods are opposite to their interest they curse them and overthrow their altars but his design seems to be far from advancing the interested principle or the bias toward ourselves he only shows how this selfishness is so rooted in our nature that if we shall make a separation between interest and virtue we shall of course run to the side where we think our profit lies for this he says is dearer to us than all things this is our father our brother our country our god arrian therefore like the rest of the stoics applies himself chiefly to direct the understanding thinking if it was rightly informed all the work was done but it is easier to make the understanding see what is right than to make the heart adhere to it according to the famous exclamation  video meliora etc   that honest confession of seeing the good and approving it and yet doing the ill is also made by st paul himself when he says the good that i would i do not but the evil which i would not that i do etc a lively representation of our inconsistency and the war arising upon it in the mind  it seems very plain that whatever relish we may have of virtue in our present state we are not necessarily determined by it as our natural bias to vice is not so strong neither as to deprive us altogether of our liberty but it is no less plain that being blinded and corrupted as we are a superior principle grace or whatever it be called is absolutely necessary for expelling that poison wherewith selflove has one way or other infected and confounded us  sect vii natural love considered under different denominations as all love implies both a desire of obtaining the beloved object and a delight in it after it is obtained selflove in the first of these views is nonsense and in the second it is the next thing to delusion nay if the complacency exceed the due bounds no delusion can be greater it is silly and foolish in the eye of the world  but there are three sorts of love all granted to be natural and even reasonable our love to our children our love to the sex and our love to our friends if any of these loves is right or what it ought to be selflove is wholly out of doors at least the more perfect they are it has proportionably the less place a father loves his children by a happy instinct or whatver it be called without a view either of profit or pleasure from them for as liberis consultum volumus etiamsi posthumi futuri sunt propter ipsos de sinibus cicero says we wish them to be happy after we are gone the pleasure that may follow upon loving is by no means the cause of the love nature has wisely and kindly designed that every man should take care of his own children in the first place the care and affection of mothers is yet more remarkable and what tenderness is there observed even in nurses the love of children to their parents not being so much determined by instinct has been sometimes called piety  as to the instinct by which parents are said to love their children a burlesque question has been asked viz if this love be an instinct free of selfishness whence is it that they feel that instinct for other peoples children when they believe them to be their own and on the contrary feel no such instinct for their own when by accident they are ignorant of the relation if a serious answer was to be given this perhaps might be it that the question makes neither for selfishness nor against it and that in such cases nature is hoodwinked but still the end is obtained which is the caring for the young helpless creatures  the love to the sex is a more delicate article every body knows what the desire of continuing their own species leads them to this is hardly to be called love and if any will call it selflove they must allow other animals the same cool deliberate motives of proceeding it is plain that when a man is heartily in love all selfconsiderations provisions and settlements must yield and the lover will pursue his aim unless an extraordinary principle of justice or regard for the person make him lay it aside and this too is honorable for love that the mind is first engaged by the qualities of the woman if fancy now and then gives the object a value which in reality it has not this is still another thing than selflove the man is taken and there arises not only a desire of possessing but he feels a tenderness as a parent does for a child and for proof of this we may appeal to dilexi tum te non tantum ut vulgus amicam sed pater ut gnatos diligit and generos ad lesbiam catullus whatever the body may claim for its share this cannot be said to proceed from reflection but is rather a kind of mechanical sweet impulse  love then is a concurrence of ardor respect and tenderness but some people seem hardly to have a right notion of any sort of love when they suppose we must still be reasoning and reflecting in it with a view to our own interest an old naturalist speaks more sense upon the love he treats of unde feritur eo tendit    and it is remarkable that lucretiuss metaphor here agrees with the modern philosophy of gravitation and indeed st augustine speaks of love in general as a weight or force by which we are carried amor meus pondus meum etc but it seems the love of our philosophers sits very light upon them they think they may put it in their pocket like their gloves  the love that enters into friendship is only free of that ardor which tends to the sex but is accompanied with no less respect and little less tenderness save what the weakness or delicacy of the sex calls for at the hands of the stronger but the power of love among friends is sufficiently known and remarkably expressed in these words of moses if the wife of thy bosom or thy friend whom thou love as thine own soul etc  it is evident now that wherever love enters the delight is from the object not from self the person is delighted or pleased but the pleasure is not from himself since he receives it from somewhat else if they say he still loves the object from selfinterest or his interest is the cause of his love this is contrary to nature and as horace seems to reject the supposition in the case of friendship cicero is more express and full upon it no xii he shows excellently that love is the principle and motive which engages us in friendship that interest or profit may be made even by a friendship which is but acted but in true friendship all is for the sake of the friend all is free genuine and real therefore adds he love appears to be founded on nature and not on our necessities and occasions on a certain relish and bent of the soul  applicatione animi rather than any thoughts of reaping profit that though interest may attend friendship yet it is not the aim of it but he says most people choose their friends as they do their cattle to make a gain of them and therefore have no experience of that most beautiful and natural friendship by which we love a friend for himself and cultivate friendship for its own value that in short as we love ourselves without a view to any reward at our own hands we ought to love our friend after the same manner for to love one is to cherish him for his own sake without any regard to our own indigence or interest much more will be found to this purpose in that excellent little treatise upon friendship he supposes all along that virtue or personal worth is to be the cement of friendship and the only thing that can render it durable and he reckons the charms of virtue so great that we cannot but love it even in those we have never seen and can never hope to see and from whom it is impossible we can receive any advantage  the only evasion some have fallen upon is that we love for the pleasure we find in loving and so it is still say they selfinterest at the bottom but this as it would take away the distinction of vice and virtue and imply a fatal necessity without leaving any thing to reason so it is plainly a mistaking the effect for the cause we are attracted first and seized on by the object without design upon either side unless on some occasions where certain agreeable intelligent objects are said to lay traps for lovers by showing their own charms but then this forwardness of appearing which the sex is sometimes accused of proceeds more from curiosity and a desire of amusement than of exciting love or even of drawing common admirers but this is a speculation foreign from the purpose whatever be in it the natural attraction whether love or friendship is accompanied with a certain sweetness in which we are but passive and can challenge nothing of it as our own contrivance pleasure is the result of friendship not the inducement to it  now if the constitution of our nature is such that pleasure is inseparable from loving our friends and doing them friendly offices this is the contrivance of our maker and we cannot alter our frame nor have we any reason to wish it altered because our maker seems thereby to have designed that self love should be swallowed up by a more generous principle in which our nature finds its account without laying a plot for it and as generosity consists in giving not in receiving our savior declares that to give is more blessed at this rate one would think friendship should not be such a rarity since so much pleasure attends it but let self answer for that it is enough for us to have the agreeable conviction that our nature is capable of a finer cast and they who would resolve every thing into sordid interest do only argue from the abuse of our faculties without a right knowledge of the natural use of them  sect viii of other engagements of the affection beside the three kinds of love mentioned in the last section there are other things more properly called attachments than love such as the concern about ones family separate from the love to children and the lawful concern we ought to have for our posterity and kindred which lies in the desire of having representatives and keeping up a mere name we shall hardly discover a foundation for this love in nature unless it be said to proceed from an abhorrence of extinction or from an anxiety that at least a sound should remain after us to keep us from being forgot pride will affect that this name should be highly regarded because of its seeming relation to our persons and so we wish our representatives to be rich and potent not so much for their convenience as our own glory  to this sort of love the love of our country is frequently sacrificed but there is a nearer kind of selflove which gets the better even of it for we see good estates played away or otherwise squandered according to the humor of the proprietors and these will be called no extraordinary discoveries  the love of our country has more of nature in it than the former as if it was an instinct planted by the great ruler of the earth that all the habitable parts of it might be inhabited with contentment and improved to the utmost without wandering to finer climates and dislodging other people and we see how alluring the native soil has been in all ages but the love of our country farther implies and with greater reason a peculiar affection and concern for the society wherein providence has placed us as if we looked upon it as the household we belong to and which we are therefore chiefly to care for the general law of humanity always observed as being its most immediate and proper members however if that kind of selflove which aims no farther than the present gratification of the person gets the better of the concern for the family it is no wonder the concern for the country is so much forgot and looked upon as an oldfashioned simple thing the wife selfloving man has no country no family no friends but where he can eat best or make the greatest figure there he lives  there is a love which had almost been passed over viz partylove it owes its rise to selflove plainly enough whether it be considered as an accidental agreement of opinions or a combination of interests and designs without any cement of virtue or regard to truth and though we see this attachment to party sometimes producing strange offices of friendship yet it must be a very ambulatory affair according to the various changes of our situation or our humor  the short conclusion may be this that friendship is the soul of all relations and the soul of it is disinterestedness  sect ix the meaning of disinterestedness two sources of natural virtue perhaps it will be thought strange that disinterestedness being but a negative sort of term implying only an incorrupt or unselfish state of mind should yet be mentioned as a positive quality and called the soul of friendship to answer such people in their own way it may be maintained that disinterestedness is really a positive term as well as a positive quality for interestedness is but the negation of integrity and disinterestedness is the taking away that negation an interested person is generally taken for an unjust person  but not to dwell upon words if man was originally upright and incorrupt by the removal of the opposite qualities he is reinstated in his primitive integrity so that an incorrupt man is the same with an upright man and disinterestedness but another term for uprightness this way of speaking therefore when the matter is well considered will pass both with christians and deists for both parties suppose man to be originally upright the latter only denying his defection from that state and most christians though they acknowledge the sad effects of the fall yet do not deny that there remains some sense of equity and some fund of goodnature  there seems to be a natural love of justice and order as there is of proportion and harmony we are pleased with a fine character as well as with a fine picture or fine music it is true the heart is properly called the seat of love but the understanding has its objects of pleasure too and what pleases is loved the understanding not only sees but it approves and approbation implies delight let us say plainly every man has a sense of equity and fair dealing whatever stretch we may make in our own favor and every man is well persuaded of the difference between right and wrong independent of education and example as in things relating to the external senses no man can be taught to see or taste so no man can furnish another with a sense or relish of virtue all that teaching can do in this case is to lay things before the mind in such a way as it may perceive either the beauty or the deformity of them by its own native force instruction no doubt is of great importance as it helps to cultivate those innate powers of the soul that doctrina sed vim promovet insitam etc vis insita as horace calls it but that is another affair  to return a man feels when the rules of equity are broke to his own prejudice and he sees when they are broke to the prejudice of his neighbor if the injury is done by a third person for he does not always see it when it is done by himself thus the prophet accosted david under the parable of the ewelamb which made him see his error immediately and his conscience was convicted  mr hobbes himself does not deny there is such a thing as leviath chap xi right and wrong he only says the doctrine thereof is perpetually disputed both by the pen and sword whereas the doctrine of lines and figures is not so  and he gives a very good reason for it just after because in this subject men care not what be truth as being a thing that crosses no mans ambition profit or lust a frenchman would have put lamour propre for all but the principle still holds good that truth and justice and virtue are naturally agreeable to the mind when it is free of byasses in its own favor and the character of an honest man will be as lovely as that of a scoundrel will be hateful which it sometimes happens to be even among such folks themselves  this sense or relish of virtue without any view to selfinterest is one source of moral actions though often very unable to produce them as was observed before sect vi to which this may be added that our inclinations not only hinder us from following what our reason sees to be good but they confuse and darken it in the first instance making it often take the ill for the good but we are here supposing reason or the understanding faculty to be free of any influence from the inclinations in which case it sees and judges of things within its sphere distinctly enough and so may be called one source of disinterested actions or human virtues  we may observe farther that beside that relish or approbation which the mind gives to truth either after a process of reasoning or a more instantaneous perception there is still in man fallen as he is a fund of compassion or tenderness operating in a more warm and feeling manner without any help of reflection and this is another source of disinterested actions seated in the heart as the former is in the understanding which yet being but a happy constitution of soul a man is no more to value himself upon it than upon bodily health  perhaps benignity had been a fitter word than compassion to express that affectionate temper which prompts men freely to do good to others but compassion came first up and in the present distressed state of things every man is some way or other an object of it so it may be taken for a general inclination to relieve and assist however benignity has a more extensive signification not only importing pity for the afflicted but a desire to see every body happy and an endeavor to make them so and such a temper must extend to the whole sensible creation the just man is merciful to his beast  whoever then has any thing of this compassionate temper in him as none but a devil is supposed to be wholly void of it ought to cherish it carefully for it is a surer and a more fertile principle of good actions than that wherein the understanding is only engaged most men can love better than they can reason and thus they are to blame who talk of pity as a contemptible thing as seneca called it the defect of little minds but this great man was carried away by a false philosophy which did not allow what was due to the affections and would needs set up for an unnatural stiff composure that was good for nothing even supposing it to be free from grimace benevolence generally implies a warmness of heart and care should be taken that be not too cool otherwise it degenerates into indolence  no doubt the warm temper ought to be regulated by discretion a judge for instance is not to be prevailed on by more tenderness for one party than the other but must give the subject in dispute to the person whose right is clearest though the other may be more necessitous and merit is not in the question neither again in giving charitable assistance a man is not to strip himself in favor of the first object he meets but to proportion his charity so as none may justly complain for want of a share and that mercy may agree with judgment as to our reserving for our own occasions selflove will readily take care of that  sect x some acceptations of conscience conscience is either the sense of equity in general or the consciousness of our adhering to it which is supposed to carry its reward along with it as was said in an old elegant speech  and mens sibi conscia recti virg  and a good conscience is called in sacred writ a continual feast if on the contrary we are conscious that we have done wrong or departed from equity this reflection carries a pain along with it as the former carried a pleasure and all the account we can give of those different effects upon our minds is that such is the establishment of things st paul informs us very plainly that this operation of the mind has been uniform in all ages of the world when romans ii the gentiles which have not the law do by nature the things contained in the law these having not the law are a law to themselves which shows the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience also bearing witness and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing etc he says in another place he had kept a conscience void of offense toward god and toward men so that conscience may be considered as one of the powers or faculties of the mind like an ear for music with this difference that some few persons have got no ear but no man was ever without some conscience the taste indeed may be corrupted and so it fares with conscience  this view of conscience as a natural relish of moral rectitude and not mr lock gives that definition in his essay on human understanding and arguing against innate principles he says if conscience be a proof of innate principles contraries may be innate principles since some men with the same bent of conscience prosecute what others avoid but this argument would seem to strike most against virtue as it seems to take away the difference of right and wrong or to render every thing so arbitrary and uncertain that an appeal could not be made to the common sense of mankind in no case whatsoever but mr lock cannot be suspected to have had so bad an intention the regard he expressed for the christian religion as well as moral virtue is sufficient to clear him from such an imputation it is remarkable too that some professed deists not only set up for the moral sense but also acknowledge the innate principles which they call after epictetus anticipations or previous notices of the mind merely our own opinion or judgment of the moral rectitude or pravity of our own actions as an ingenious author defined it will help to solve some difficulties arising from the different opinions of men particularly christians and their mutual persecutions each party really thinking themselves in the right for it is to be observed that these differences are chiefly in matters of belief and concerning the interpretation of revealed doctrines and that all parties are nevertheless agreed in the principles of justice and natural equity for instance every ones conscience declares to him that god is to be honored in the most perfect manner so that the dispute comes only to be what is the most perfect manner as to which though men must necessarily be divided so long as they differ in the interpretation of what has been revealed or do not all equally agree upon the things that are to be received as revelation their consciences if they would hearken to them would tell them that they ought to love one another notwithstanding any such differences of thinking but hurry prepossession and interest darken the understanding making people take human inventions for the commands of god or less earnest to observe the weightier things of the law than the most inconsiderable ceremonies but this confusion of the judgment does not infer that we have no such faculty since it might be as reasonably said we have no sight because sometimes we do not see clearly nor is christianity to be charged with the persecutions among the different sects and parties which its enemies make a handle of in their arguments against it for religion is commonly but a pretense for such severities the quarrel rather rising from ambition or covetousness or both and if blind zeal or fury without any other mixture which is even very rare should really be the cause of the severities what more could the founder of the christian religion do to inform mens understandings than by making their love to one another the principal mark of being his disciples if people will call themselves christians as each party call themselves the only christians and yet retain their pride and illhumour and all the vices of nature is christianity justly to be blamed for that they who thus blame it as they are no less corrupt than the christians are also guilty of a manifest piece of unfair dealing since any body that can read may see what the gospel requires and what it forbids  the same view of conscience as a natural sense of equity may help to settle the debate about innate ideas which is not now so high as it was some years ago for it needs not be asserted that we came into the world with the ideas of virtue or dictates of morality no more than with the ideas of squares and triangles and their several properties it is enough that the mind ripens as to its comprehension of truths both geometrical and moral and whatever may be called science in either is only as it were an evolution of some first principles which mankind are agreed upon and so in matters of right and wrong there lies an appeal to the moral or internal sense as in mathematical demonstrations there lies an appeal to the external  it was very agreeable to find that sir matthew hale had asserted both the moral sense and the moral dictates in a discourse on our saviors precept of doing as we would be done to here are a few of his words as contemplat part iii from page     to     the eye of sense as soon as it is open discerns the light without any solemn process to evince it to be such so there be some kind of truths that the eye of the understanding assents to as it were by intuition  he adds the great reason of inequality in our actions is selflove that makes a man partial to himself and warps him from that equality and justice that should direct him  and speaking afterward of the several parts of charity he mentions a general frame of humanity and benignity to all mankind whether relations or strangers friends or enemies  the contrary whereof says he is selfishness making a mans single self the center of all he does and having said again that selflove blinds and seduces the judgment whereby a man often attributes to himself such circumstances as render the very same action done by him to another to be just and righteous when the very same action done by another to him seems to be unjust he therefore proposes a transposition of persons which would put the matter in a quite different light so he concludes most ingeniously the truth is this precept does discharge selflove from having to do in this business of moral righteousness or charity or at least puts it in that condition by transposition of the persons that it speaks as much for gaius as it does for titius when titius sustains the person of gaius and so selflove becomes equally an advocate for titius and against him  our savior has in a manner proposed such a transposition of persons in that same glorious precept when he says therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them for this is the law and the prophets and he has made the command universal and absolute without any prudential limitations which selflove would be too ready to suggest but the same natural reason which sees the fitness of the command sees also where the transposition is to take place and that the precept is not designed to defeat order and government among men as a parent is not to abstain from correcting a child nor a judge from punishing a criminal such power being given for the good of others must be exercised accordingly and is sometimes exercised with grief  a world of things might be said about conscience were it not for fear of being too intricate or too obvious but it is remarkable that the same thing which acts within us sometimes as a judge acts at other times as an accuser and even as an executioner and hence the usual expression of the lashes of conscience nor is it any argument that people have no conscience because they do not always feel those lashes nor are troubled with any remorse for not to say that they sometimes feel more than they are willing to own they are under the power of another principle selflove which hinders them from seeing that they have done wrong or may at first push them on to commit it contrary to their plain conviction it is this liberty they take of doing what they know they should not that makes it be said they have no conscience or which is the same thing a large conscience both expressions importing that they stick at nothing  it is not possible to account for the difference of souls in the point of conscience some have it of a very delicate sense others of a very dull one and this difference would seem to be in their very nature like the difference of complexion or any thing else why the same person has this sense quicker and duller at different times is another secret but the thing is certain in fact for the same temptation will prevail at one time that would have no force at another  a scrupulous conscience implies a defect in the understanding and is akin to superstition and bigotry with this difference that these two which differ very little often prompt men to do extravagant things whereas scrupulosity restrains them from doing what may be very reasonable  but it is not always scrupulosity to differ from the current practice of the times the multitude being an ill guide and bare example strong enough to carry people away even when neither interest nor pleasure solicit but this one observation may be made that whatever may contribute to raise scruples interest is very apt in most cases to remove them  sect xi the reality of virtue if there is such a thing in man as conscience there must also be such a thing as virtue though this is as hard to define as the former but the existence of both is discoverable from the distinction of right and wrong and so virtue may be considered as the adhering to what is right the loveliness of which the conscience was convinced of before nor does it strike at the existence of virtue that it is sometimes represented as no vi an abstracted notion of the mind for all qualities are nothing more when they are considered separately from any particular subject and men speak of such qualities that fall under the outward senses as well as of those moral qualities affecting the mind as they speak of streightness both in lines and actions what is there more common than to talk of sweet and bitter without joining these words to any particular thing tasted or any other way perceived  this pedantry seemed the more allowable that some men have called virtue a chimaera a phantom and at best an arbitrary thing but honest people are at no loss when they hear of a virtuous action to know whence the virtue of it proceeds and they call both actions and persons good without hesitation so that virtue and goodness often pass for the same thing and no confusion ensues only it must be remembered that the idea of goodness is less restricted than that of virtue which is chiefly applicable to rational agents called also moral agents and their actions and intentions  as every body allows that goodness is the object of love so virtue must be the object of it too yet there is a sort of reasoning which if it took place would destroy the very being of virtue and that is when people affirm that no man can love any thing but under the notion of good with respect to himself but this in the first place is contrary to experience since we love many things under the notion of good with respect to others with whom we have not the least connection and therefore cannot be said to love those things with respect to ourselves in the second place by that reasoning we could acknowledge no difference between good and evil but in so far as we found our account or thought we found it in the one or the other or in other words the goodness of things consisting only in their being good to us or giving us pleasure the ideas of goodness and virtue would be swallowed up in the sole idea of pleasure and since vicious persons must be owned to be pleased with their pursuits as well as virtuous persons are with theirs the moral difference between these two parties would vanish i do not say that both parties are equally pleased with their pursuits but both certainly are pleased nay mad people are highly pleased with their extravagant fancies and where shall the difference lie between them and the sober if pleasure is the only thing to be appealed to and no appeal to be made to the common sense of mankind in their right wits both must be equally mad or both must be equally sober  those reasoners bring themselves into this farther difficulty that when it is asked them why they love any thing and they make answer because it gives them pleasure a second question why pleasure leaves them nothing to say at all unless they say they are pleased because they are pleased whereas others who acknowledge the moral difference of things independent of private good could answer readily they loved a thing because it was lovely or good in it self which is much the same  the idea of virtue as a thing lovely upon its own account shows the reasonableness of the old expression viz virtue is its own reward and that mere pleasure without justice does not constitute the happiness of rational creatures otherwise vice might have been as well said to be its own reward twas pity indeed the sincere stoics had not had some more lively thing to fix on than their abstracted notion of virtue if brutus who perhaps had more of it than any man at that time in rome had seen a little farther he would not have called it an empty name but it is possible his virtue without disparagement to him has been pretty much tinctured with the desire of applause which is empty enough and likewise the distress and perplexity of his mind at that time may have forced that expression from him but cicero and those who wrote of virtue deliberately always represent it as a real thing and infinitely charming  however though the understanding may be pleased with certain ideas and speculations of moral goodness and the heart supposing it honest may partake of the delight yet the heart must have something to cleave to that has life since otherwise the affections would not have an adequate or suitable object so that if such a way of speaking can be allowed we must conceive virtue and justice and all that is lovely even love itself as it were in person or united to an intellectual nature  virtue then is still a real thing whatever way it be supposed to affect men and there can hardly be a greater proof of its reality than the melancholy state those are reduced to who see it and forsake it if a curse was to be wished to any there could be none imagined heavier virtutem videant intabescantque relicta   the pleasure that is found in the practice of virtue is much owing to the relish or good taste of the soul but as this taste is much vitiated since the fall of adam virtue is sometimes represented as a very uneasy thing and no doubt is so in many respects for if it were so very natural and easy as some make it our saviors precept of selfdenial would be superfluous and if it were so very unnatural and hard as others make it his declaring that his yoke is easy would not be agreeable to truth but that which is easy to nature in a state of order is not so in a state of disorder for nature is one thing and corrupt nature another and they who never heard of the distinction nor of the fall had reason to recommend a life according to nature and to maintain nunquam aliud natura aliud sapientia aixit juv n v that she never differed from wisdom but the case is now altered and to live virtuously and wisely is a matter of difficulty and labor so that indeed our saviors declaration seems to import that his yoke is easy rather in the consequences than that it is always so in the first instance  now what makes virtue uneasy at any rate but some unhappy turn of nature some poison of selflove something that is not right whatever name it get but this is certain on the other side that corrupt as our nature is there are many practices of virtue which are mighty agreeable and therefore to affirm absolutely that nothing can be virtuous but what contradicts and does violence to nature is not only false but looks like a design to discourage all attempts toward virtue whether natural or divine  sect xii religion as religion is principally meant of mans duty toward god it is therefore considered as a higher thing than virtue yet if the distinction of natural and divine virtue be admitted the highest things in religion will suffer no disparagement in being called virtues  but the design here and all along is only to give a general view of religion and to confront it with selflove in order to see how far it gains or loses by its being mixed with that principle  if a formal definition of religion were to be asked perhaps that might do well enough with some variation which the civil law gives of justice viz a constant and perpetual will to render every one his due a man cannot be said to have religion unless he has a love for justice and this love ought to be in a very great degree as our savior has made use of the words hunger and thirst and placed it in the number of the beatitudes blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness  it is very true the above definition represents religion as a thing that is internal and lying chiefly in the heart but this does not take away the idea nor the obligation of external religion which consists in outward practices either moral or instituted no more than the actual exercise of justice is taken away by the perpetual inclination of doing justly virtue and vice both are internal things breaking out according to the occasions that fall in our way we call those practices of religion instituted or positive the reasons whereof do not appear clearly to us though there may be good reasons for them in the wisdom of god if it was but to make them the figures of higher things and to excite the dull affections by striking on the outward senses the jewish ceremonies were remarkably calculated for that purpose and christians will hardly disown that they have need to be awakened by sensible impressions but this by the way  there is a more express definition of religion given by a late author which raises the idea of justice very high it is in these words religion then is nothing but a respectful worship of justice and truth which makes us treat god as god and the creatures as creatures perhaps few definitions will be found more exact and there is none that captious spirits will not censure this at least agrees with mr wollastons rule religion of nature  to treat things as they are it is also very plain that the truest worship consists in imitation and imitation is the effect of love so that whatever ideas we form of religion if they be formed right they all hang together in an order that may be called natural and whereof reason itself may see the consistency  as to mr wollaston his rule is most just but then we can make no more of it but to treat things only as they appear to us or according to the notions we have of them and however imperfect these may be we may be said to act justly if we follow our light but the same apostle who tells us that the gentiles do by nature the things contained in the law tells us also that the natural man knows not the things of god and that they are spiritually discerned the things therefore contained in the law should seem to be those acts of humanity and natural justice which we find instances of in all times and places and the things of god may be supposed to be meant both of his unsearchable nature and the mysteries of religion which are but revealed as it were historically or that they are not how they are and therefore as the apostle concludes only to be discerned by a spiritual light  the natural ignorance of man will easily be confessed by those who acknowledge revealed religion and let those who deny it tell us honestly what things they know really or in their true nature indeed the rule of treating things as they are holds very well as to certain relations and characters parents for instance ought to be treated as parents and children as children and so of other relations again people of worth are to be treated in a different manner from the worthless and in all cases prudence and equity which are never separate will know how to distribute and render what is due to every relation and character  by thus considering the difference of relations and characters we may form some imperfect notions of our duty even to our maker and the creator of all things if we suppose a being of infinite power wisdom and goodness the obligations of fear reverence and love naturally arise reason itself goes so far as to make that plain inference and conclusion nor can we hinder ourselves from making such a supposition if we allow reason any exercise at all we see and feel enough to persuade us of the existence of such a sovereign being unless we are stupid or hurried out of our reflection though we cannot comprehend the divine nature we cannot fail to see that it is else we must fall into the absurdities of imagining things that are made to have made themselves or to have been made by nothing or else to confound the maker and the works together like spinoza who in that point imitated some of the stoics and with them is imitated by later authors  religion now is principally to be taken for the duties we owe to god what we owe to men is usually called morality though it is also a considerable part of religion as being enjoined by god who puts no value on any thing we do to show our homage to him if we neglect our duties to our neighbor this is confirmed by many places of scripture  religion also may be divided into the internal and the external and this again into the moral and the ceremonial what a man has of the internal can only be known to god and the external will only be approved by him as it proceeds from the internal to instance even in the moral part giving of alms which is of more value than going to church is rejected by god when it is done only to be seen of men or it is so far rejected as it is tinctured with that principle for our savior told the pharisees they had already their reward  it is true the ceremonial part of religion is much abolished by the christian dispensation the jewish ceremonies certainly are and the few institutions or positive precepts in it may deserve a higher character though still they are but ceremonies when the heart does not go along with them what else is taking the communion to secure an employment baptism also is a matter of parade in the parents for the most part and the children generally think as little about it when they come to age as in their infancy there is this difference therefore between the moral and positive institutions that the former are of use to others even though they are not done from a right principle but the latter unless they be done from a right principle are good for nothing  but true religion as it contains all virtues so it will not omit any the least observances whether it may think them appointed by god or men having his authority nay though it is not so sure of the authority it will submit for peace sake when the things enjoined seem to impart no disadvantage to society nor any dishonor to the divine nature  it is only with reference to that disadvantage and dishonor that the distinction of true and false religion has come in use for false religion is no religion there is indeed a difference between the disowning all religion which is atheism and the defects arising either from the confusion of the understanding or the perverseness of the will and the last is by far the unhappiest bigotry and superstition flow from a disturbed understanding blind zeal or religious fury arises more from the temper or complexion if these are proper words and what is called enthusiasm is generally from the same fountain i have no intention to enquire into all the sources of error but religion which may be called the wisdom that comes from above is first pure and then peaceable etc hypocrisy does not even deserve the name of false religion it is a cheat upon the world either to get money or applause or both when they can be had  how many things may be added on this subject but i shall refer to a few hints in the no v appendix from which the reader will easily draw a thousand more  sect xiii the unfitness of self as an object of love the common ideas of love happiness and justice show pretty evidently what rank selflove should stand in some persons indeed seem to be fond of the very word but if they mean by it the desire of happiness it is plain we ought to desire the happiness of all men and thus we should fulfill the command of loving our neighbors as ourselves  but as love implies more properly a complacency in the object what sense would it make if self were said to be this object the love of other creatures that is an ultimate acquiescence in them is justly reckoned an absurdity as well as an impiety because of their natural insufficiency to satisfy the heart but still they are supports of a certain kind which self cannot be since it is like a void that wants other things to fill it so that the selfcomplacency of a creature is much of the same import with selfdelusion the notion of a creature always supposing indigence for as the body cannot be food to itself so the soul must depend for its nourishment upon some other thing than itself and this difference is to be remembered between these two that the soul cannot fall to pieces like the body but subsists by its unexstinguishable nature in misery and anguish when its desires are not satisfied  it is very true in this short dream of life the soul has several desires and these more upon the bodys account than its own nay often we cannot say the things we desire are of use either to soul or body for instance titles and ribbons but the fancy with a mixture of pride finds its account in such things and to that source we may refer most of the desires of men women and children  if it shall be said that those marks of distinction not only draw more money but also the esteem of others it must be only of such as are fanciful like ourselves a through pride leads to the contempt of all external riches and pomp that we may be thought sufficient for ourselves like the philosopher in his tub i shall not determine that diogenes was led by the sole desire of esteem and admiration though it was so said by some of his contemporaries who have seen his weak sides as he has seen theirs but wherever that desire prevails it concludes for the insufficiency of self as an object of love or complacency since we cannot be eas but from without  nor can we ever be said in this life to be satisfied but only amused by getting one rattle or feather after another the delights of friendship are not of this class and when we come to shake off this body and our stupidity with it what a state can we think the soul will be in that has been only accustomed to delight in vanity and follow shadows when all its imaginary buildings are pulled down and nothing remains but remorse shame horror and what no words are sufficient to express this is upon the supposition of a future life and christians profess a belief even of the resurrection of the body the senses of which will be infinitely more quick both as to pain and pleasure than here men will make little by their selflove at the day of judgment  as the consequences of selflove are such as have been represented though saintly the consequences of loving the most perfect object with the most perfect love are not only rest and joy to the heart but the whole man is dignified and exalted the understanding is enlightened and the heart enlarged as david expresses it if the divine love possessed us we should be no long those little narrow proud angry confused creatures shut up in a hard shell we should then be free in another element and without strife charity is the principle of union selflove the principle of division  all this appears from the nature of things and experience of the world bateing a few gentlemen who follow the stoics every body complains of the imperfections of nature which is indeed in a very poor state and not only imperfect but wretchedly disordered to take a view of body and soul many things occur that are very disagreeable and particularly with respect to the moral world still more out of order than the natural and let any body judge what those things are owing to our selflove not only makes us the tyrants of others but also our own executioners and selftormentors whereas the divine love by making us lose sight of ourselves leads us both into truth and peace it rectifies our corrupted taste it is no longer insufficient miserable we that are the deities but honor is given where it is due if we see any thing excellent in our neighbor we love it and him as rays of the divine excellency if ever we turn an eye to ourselves and the seldomer we do it with complacency the better we shall consider ourselves and every thing we have as derived from that source  if we observe this order there can be no error we can hardly love ourselves too much if we love our neighbor as much that is if both these loves center in a higher and lest people should deceive themselves with a fancy that they love god when they do not they ought to examine themselves and see whether they love their neighbors also for he that loves not his neighbor whom he has seen how can he love god whom he has not seen  sect xiv the love of the creatures as we have no commerce or known connection with any rational creatures of another species than our own and love always supposing a desire of union with the object we can only be said properly to love mankind and but to desire the possession of other created things which are still less able to satisfy our heart  it is to be considered too that the creatures of our own species as they are desired by selflove only for our own utility are reduced to the same class of inferior things to the great indignity and contempt of human nature nor are the defects of human nature either as to soul or body any reason for treating it at such a low rate if the body decays and rots it is but in the condition of plants and vegetables and if gold and precious stones are of a firmer consistence and duration than any animal or vegetable body yet our love of those glittering things is more on account of the distinction they give us than for any sensible pleasure they are able to convey it is true the eye has a certain pleasure in looking at them but then the eye is never satisfied  let us suppose that all the creatures together are not able to satisfy the heart of man and then see what inference reason might make from the supposition the inference would seem to be this that mankind must naturally have recourse to the deity as the sole object of their acquiescence and love but we see how small advances reason made this way the great body of mankind were intent only on satisfying their lower appetites and their pride and the philosophers who despised them were ignorant themselves of the true state of things the corruption of man and the fall was not found out by man but discovered to him by revelation this is so true that some of the philosophers who were sensible enough of the defects of the visible creation raised an objection from thence against providence and even a creating power  no body shows better than mr pascal the opposite and imperfect schemes of the philosophers sect iii etc  for want of that discovery of the fall if at present the great roll of miseries and calamities are objected to disparage the divine providence and those dismal scenes appealed to that are fo frequently heard of murders robberies frauds war pestilence famine earthquakes hurricanes inundations in short all the evils whether natural or moral which afflict and destroy poor mankind to say nothing of bodily diseases and common death which attacks us in so many forms and often without any warning if all those things be objected it will mend the matter nothing to deny with the stoics that there is any evil it will be more reasonable to acknowledge with st paul romans viii  that the whole creation groaneth and likewise it will be very proper to keep in mind the difference between moral evils and natural and to impute all that belongs to the first class to the corruption of man and even to selflove as the natural evils may be reckoned either as punishments of the moral or sometimes as preventions how many extravagancies are prevented as well as punished by sickness and poverty  as to the natural evils and death itself they cannot be supposed no more than the moral evils to have been in the first establishment of things wisd i    god made not death  but farther all the evils that are either felt or heard of sometimes indeed very terrible may yet be called little in comparison of the good that remains in the creation the eruption of a burning mountain is but like a chimney on fire in a great city and the service of the elements in general is a large equivalent for the desolations they sometimes occasion as the pleasure and fertility of a river makes well up for what it carries away in a stream not to mention the beauty and regularity of the heavenly bodies with their beneficent influences a theme often and to good purpose insisted on which sufficiently psalm xix declare the glory of god  some late ridiculers of providence who do not speak out have occasioned this little digression in acknowledgment of the infinite power and wisdom that framed the world and still supports it in a surprising luster and harmony they would also have it believed that the world is without virtue as well as without a governor and argue from the common practices of men of whom they reckon christians the worst and take a handle from thence to disparage christianity but their cavils against revealed religion signify nothing who deny the natural as theirs signify as little who ascribe more to the natural than its due and who are justly suspected of a design against all religion and as secret abetters of atheism by denying that religion which alone accounts for the present disorders of men and things  we are indeed in a mixed state and a very tolerable one as we are among thorns and briars so we are among roses and violets and our state here is justly reckoned a state of trial and discipline the belief of a better life afterward and if we add the fall from paradise will make the present afflictions light and account pretty well for affliction itself  it is in the view of the afflicted broken unsatisfying state of things that the love of the world and the creatures is so much forbidden in sacred writ mankind being often addressed with arguments from their own interest as well as from the point of justice the natural disorders of the world seem to be the consequences of the moral our lives are short our bodies weak and full of diseases as if the souls that inhabit them could not have a fitter lodging and from these proud and giddy souls proceed more sorrows than can be numbered the enquirers into the origin of moral evil will ever be at a loss to account for it we see there is pride though we cannot tell how it first entered and all our speculations labor under difficulties but we see that of pride comes contention and that it does more mischief in the world than covetousness and luxury put together  the love of the creatures then is condemned because they are frail and unsatisfying of themselves and by the love of the world may be meant the passion of following common custom as well as that of gratifying our own inclinations some of which we must often drop for fear of censure  but the love which is thus condemned is more properly a dotage even the love of rational creatures may be so and the love of money and fine things deserves not so good a name as dotage but rather avarice and folly the love of rational creatures is more excusable on account of their relation to us and the natural capacity they have of delighting us as any body will acknowledge who has the least sense of friendship or even a satisfaction in seeing faces and keeping company at the same time rational creatures are full of imperfections and but like apparitions for their duration so that our rest is not to be in them nor on the other hand are their imperfections so to disgust us as to make us hate and despise them the command of loving our neighbor imports a great deal and is a divine thing wherever we are not allured to it from our own satisfaction for in that case it may be called natural love the object making an agreeable impression upon us but not selflove or interested love unless our own interest were the only spring of it and it is still to be remembered that the divine principle does not extinguish the natural and that the pleasure resulting from the constitution of things is not to be called selflove nor the effect of selfishness no more than it is selfish to be pleased with the light of the sun in fine though we should neither suppose a fall nor a future state the arguments for selflove by which all along has been meant the selfish principle can have no foundation for if we do any thing that can be called good with reference to others it is only so far good as we do it upon their account and for this we may appeal to the common sense of mankind especially to those who have not been corrupted with books  sect xv the love of god religion being considered as our duty to god the highest part of this duty is love which may be called the mother of all duties particular commands and prohibitions seem only to have been given for leading man back to that love which was natural to him in his first state  it was said before sect vii that love in general implies a desire after the object and a delight in it now the perfections of the divine nature demonstrate the love of god to be perfectly reasonable both in the pursuit and the acquiescence and though love is called blind as in some respect it is really so yet the understanding being enlightened actuated and influenced by the same unerring spirit that influenceth the heart both these powers are in perfect order and harmony and their operations consequently must be complete rational and natural every way right strong and consistent nothing feeble nothing foolish nothing defective the poor expressions of men are more defective than their conceptions  but however imperfect either our words or our ideas may be we can well enough perceive the distinctions of things and their properties nor does any distinction seem more necessary to be kept in mind than that of the understanding and the heart by the former we discern the beauty of an object and by the latter we love it or cleave to it in agreeable objects each of those faculties is pleased but the pleasures are different again our understanding is the seat of our opinions the heart is the seat of our inclinations  upon the different operations of these two faculties dr henry more forms an argument for the disinterested or pure love of god no iv the substance of which is that as truth is the object of the intellect and is assented to because it is true without regard to the particular understanding that contemplates it so goodness is the object of love which is loved chiefly for its own excellency and he concludes we may as well affirm that there is no understanding but what is selfinterested as that there is no love but what is selfinterested  no body was ever found that denied to mankind a faculty of loving as well as a faculty of discerning and one may be bold to say that love is so much the perfection and happiness of our nature that it is deplorable it were not directed to the proper objects and attended with all the conditions that render it worthy  the heart is a term both for the loving faculty and love itself where your treasure is there will your heart be also and thou shall love the lord with all thine heart it is indeed added and with all thy might to show that the dignity of the object requires that all our faculties and their utmost force should be employed in love and adoration again an honest heart is taken for a sincere intention and in short the heart is considered as the principal thing in man my son give me thy heart  i have the rather mentioned this obvious distinction of the heart and the understanding that some and i believe very good persons have considered the love of god only as an act of the understanding by which the supreme being is adored for its excellencies and loved also but chiefly loved because those excellencies are beneficial to us and such persons are so much afraid of falling into enthusiasm meaning the extravagance of a warm imagination that they exclude love wholly from the heart lest it should be called a passion or an indiscreet thing but why may there not be divine passions as well as human spiritual affections as well as natural the imagination is by no means the seat of love any more than it is the seat of hatred joy or any other affection of the soul however imagination may impose upon us or be imposed upon itself this is but like seeing through a false glass the operations of the heart belonging to a quite different province  the true love of god says a late freethinker no ccxvi writer is calm and sedate and permanent the crackling blaze of passion is soon over it dazles and it scorches for a moment but leaves no lasting warmth whereas the silent glowings of the heart are strong and durable and preserve an equal temper of heat  this is very well expressed the author does not exclude the love of god from the heart he rather says it ought to be there always only in a calm sedate manner but who can give rules to love the state of the heart either as to its sedateness or its disturbance its coolness or its warmth depends chiefly on the divine power that acts upon it and the same person at different times is under very different operations in distress in joy in hopes in fears as is evident from many passagges in sacred writ  i have not the least intention of falling into a dispute with this author for i know nothing at all about him nor have seen any of his papers but this single one i am willing only to quote some of his expressions as being among the best and the modestest that are to be found in the advocates for selflove who often write both saucily and confusedly  he says whoever traces our love of others he will find it ultimately terminates in ourselves and that our affection toward any person is in reality a retaliation of some kind offices we either have received or do at least expect from him it is true we often have a tender regard and a value for those who have been benefactors to others though they never extended their kindness to us but he who searches deep into human nature may observe that here likewise we give a secret glance toward ourselves and love the generous person not so much because he did good to another as because we imagine we also should have felt the same effects of his munificence had he seen us in the like indigent circumstances  here the charge against selflove is carried as high as necessary though the author seems to have designed it no disparagement the search into human nature can hardly be deep enough so very latent is the bias toward ourselves but the retaliation of good offices is by no means to be found fault with gratitude being a part of justice and it can have no tincture of selflove when we expect no such offices for the future what seems to be unnatural in the account given of our love of generous persons is the founding it on an imagination that we should have felt the same effects of their generosity which is at most but a posteriour reflection and it is possible the fancy might never enter into ones head and though the apostle says we love god because he loved us first this is to show the excellency of gods love above ours we having such motives for loving him whereas he had none for loving us  the opposition made to the pure love of god by persons of integrity and good sense has certainly arisen from the abuse which has been made of that doctrine by weak people or vile pretenders the former really taking their own fancies for the operations of the almighty and so falling into shameful familiarity and nauseous expressions and the latter sort having no sense of religion at all have by their pretenses to the highest things in it imposed upon the society they lived in and sometimes subjected them to their dominion and tyranny as in the case of john of leyden and others hence the cry of enthusiasm heated imagination and the like hence the love of god is put in opposition to all affection and confined to a simple acknowledgment of the divine attributes and perhaps a desire of keeping the divine commandments which may be more from a regard to ourselves than the deity true love leads naturally to the keeping of the commands of god and our savior only makes it the test of love to undeceive any who may vainly think they love him without that inward disposition and outward mark  another thing that may have frighted people from the pure love of god is their imagining it must cut off all natural and lawful affections but this fear is groundless husbands love your wives says the apostle though god is to be loved with all our heart yet we may and ought to love some inferior things if we love them in the due order and measure even selflove may stand if it be turned down to its proper station  but as our happiness does not consist in the love of ourselves but in the enjoyment of things suited to our several faculties so the supreme happiness and perfection of all intelligent natures must consist only in the love and adoration of the eternal goodness no words can express the perfections of the divine nature and mortals when they speak of it should be afraid of speaking absurdly the heavens are not pure in his sight and he charges the angels with folly what is man wretched man that he should presume to open his mouth on such a subject but the love of god is a known expression and a thing of all things the most reasonable and yet unfortunately disputed by the love of god must be meant the whole of mans duty and happiness two distinct ideas but inseparably connected together  st augustine gives a reason for that great duty besides the point of justice from the design of our existence and the nature of our soul he says  fecisti nos ad te and inquietum est cor nostrum donec requiescat in te confess lib i cap   god has made us for himself and our heart must be unquiet till it rests in him mr pascal likewise after taking a view of all the hurry and amusement we are engaged in and the different springs that move us concludes no vii that man can find no rest neither in himself nor in the creatures but in god alone  it is true moses lays it down with the authority of a lawgiver thou shall love the lord with all thy heart etc but the command carries its reason within it if the mind is but attentive for without doubt the most proper object of our love must be that which is in itself the most perfect that which though we love ever so much we can never love up to its worth having still new and greater cause to love it and this can be nothing else but the alone uncreated the infinite and eternal beauty platos method of ascent from the love of beauty which we see in the body to that which we see in the soul and from that to the immense ocean of beauty is very remarkable  there are some who do not deny that god ought to be loved with all the heart or the affection in the words of moses but then they would make selfinterest the only foundation of all love which seems not at all reasonable and as it was observed before dr henry more sufficiently exposes the opinion i know moses though he speaks as a lawgiver begins yet with an encouragement hear therefore o israel and observe to do it that it may be well with thee etc but the highest encouragement that can be given to excite men to their duty cannot take away the principle of it otherwise duty would be subservient to interest or a mans highest duty would be to himself which no christian ever asserted in plain terms and the idea even horace gives of a nec furtum feci nec fugi si mihi dicat servus habes pretium loris non ureris aio non hominem occidi non pasces in cruce corvos sum bonus and frugi renuit negat atque sabellus cautus enim metuit foveam lupus accipiterque suspectos laqueos and opertum milvius humum oderunt peccare boni virtutis amore  good man shows how much he was of another opinion for the difference between a good man and a bad must consist in some other things than a regard to themselves since the bad are afraid of hurt and desirous of happiness as well as the good and no body would bestow the epithet of virtue or goodness upon kites and foxes  there is still a principle of justice and it is the adhering more or less to it at makes the difference between the good and the bad prudence is one virtue and justice another the former indeed respecting ourselves the latter somewhat else and cicero says justitia nihil expetit pretii nihil praemii per se igitur expetitur de legibus justice desires neither price nor reward but is desired upon its own account if there is any beauty in virtue any loveliness in moral characters the charms must be independent of any profit since they strike before such views or expectations can enter  the greatest part of what has been said in this article has been to settle a point of speculation or bare philosophy rather than to make encomiums on the thing itself for there need none to those who feel it and those who feel it not will hardly be affected with words all a person can do who presumes to say any thing of it without feeling it is to ask pardon of those that do or wish to feel it and perhaps the pardon will be granted when it is considered that this doctrine has been so much decryd of late and the opposite doctrine magnified as the highest virtue and made the foundation of religion a miserable foundation it has contributed to the disparagement of christianity and given a handle for ridicule and triumph to its opposers not to be answered but by owning the disinterested principle and placing religion upon that solid and cleanly foundation  the reader may see how far the ridicule has been carried in the characteristicks by the quotation in the margin modern projectors i know would willingly rid their hands of these natural materials and would fain build after a more uniform way they would new frame the human heart and have a mighty fancy to reduce all its motions balances and weights to that one principle and foundation of a cool and deliberate selfishness men it seems are unwilling to think they can be so outwitted and imposed on by nature as to be made to serve her purposes rather than their own they are ashamed to be drawn thus out of themselves and forced from what they esteem their true interest  and indeed with good sense as well as severity but the blame falls only upon the modern projectors not upon the christian doctrine which ought not to suffer from the weakness of some who meddle to explain it and one thing is remarkable that the deists sometimes agree with those very projectors they had despised for their system of calm benevolence and selfapprobation is much about one with the cool deliberate selfishness of the other party  but the unquiet heart of man must have somewhat else to satisfy it than its own approbation as may easily appear from the insufficiency of created beings and the restless pursuits of men and here one cannot but observe how this set of the deists and some of the clergy distress each other on the article of selflove the deists charging the clergy with a finer sort of epicurism since the most corrupt person in the world is willing to renounce smaller pleasures for greater and on the other hand the clergy object against the deists that it selfapprobation is their principal aim they must hug a phantom and not only so but their pride which fills them with the notion of their own excellency must render them incapable of those joys and perfections only inherent in the deity and only communicable to such spirits as are dispossessed of such imaginary fullness and real arrogance  by the by this stoical oldfashioned pride has been of late dressed up into a kind of system by which the defective nature of man to say no worse of it and the whole visible creation are represented as quite free of imperfection and evil now though it is difficult to argue against experience or to talk people out of their senses yet it is possible some minds of a certain cast may at length imagine their own particular nature to be of such perfection as to stand in need of no helps but what they have from within themselves or in other words that their reason is a sufficient guide for all purposes of belief and practice and consequently that they are not obliged to assent to any thing but what they see clearly by this light nay that it were absurd even to be in suspense about it but immediately to reject it and that as to practice their inclinations being free from any wrong biass or tendency there can be no better guides than these neither from hence proceeds the aversion to all revelation and to the clergy or priests of all religions whom they look upon as too cunning for the rest of mankind and sometimes do them the honor to call them the compilers of the sacred records themselves not adverting to the demonstration of the facts nor the purity of the doctrines from which indeed the lives of the clergy as well as the laity are very different to the hearty regret of the sincere among all ranks and there is nothing but insincerity a hard supposition or plain delusion that can account for such a strange representation of the excellency of human nature as to reject all necessity of a mediator revelation and the continual influences of the divine spirit on the impure fallible spirits of men who are blunderers in the commonest affairs when one thinks of the ignorance and corruption of human nature one is almost in danger of falling in with the opposite party of deists and perhaps the name is too good for either party who allow nothing at all to mankind that is good not so much as the least approbation of virtue nor any virtue and decency but what the fantastical humor of people happens to establish but it is hard to say which of the extremes is worst and some persons have been very unsuccessful when they undertook to go the middle way and would needs lay the foundation of religion and all duty upon selflove the very thing which religion designs to extirpate that is the selfish principle in which a mans good is his highest motive or himself the center of all his aims but to return  the asserters of the disinterested principle have this to support their doctrine that if one was to consider love as it is in the divine nature the first idea that would probably occur would be that of a free communication of good as the sun sends forth its light and its heat  the source of joy and bliss can want nothing for himself so that the design of making creatures is to impart happiness or good to them and it is very remarkable that st john says god is love and god is light as if he had designed to exhibit the deity to our imperfect conception under the characters of disinterested goodness and diffusive joy  it is true god is said prove xvi   to have made every thing for himself for every thing must be made for some end by an intelligent agent and the source of all power wisdom and beauty and whatever is excellent must be an end to itself since there can be no end higher again we hear of the arbitrary pleasure of god revel iv he has created all things and for his pleasure they are and were created but the idea of goodness is inseparable from that pleasure  such is truly the inexpressible love of god that he may be said to hire us to do good to ourselves he has annexed pleasure even to those low things eating and drinking as if we were to be bribed to support our own poor fabric as well as to replenish the earth nor are these pleasures denied to the inferior creatures every thing living has its enjoyments so that though the common way of speaking be true god has made every creature for his own glory and all things here on earth for the use of man yet it is no less true that he makes every creature that has life for its own good and if we might suppose greater and lesser motives in the incomprehensible god we would have reason to conclude that the good of creatures is his greatest motive in creating them he has no need of us and we have need of every thing from him  we are farther told that mankind stands in a near relation to the deity for we are his offspring as st paul says from a greek poet which was the fittest authority he could bring to those he was arguing with though it was a bold stroke enough in that poet but it is supported by moses who says god made man after his own image and jesus christ has enjoined us to be perfect as our father in heaven is perfect showing us at once our relation and our duty  this relation which we could not have supposed without the greatest arrogance makes the duty the more apparent we ought to imitate the divine nature and be perfect as far as we are able now where can this perfection lie in us but in disinterestedness it is the only thing wherein we can imitate the almighty who we are told again does good even to the wicked and unthankful love must be disinterested or interested or mixed it is undisputedly disinterested toward ourselves and is enjoined to be so toward others even the wicked how much more so ought it to be toward the fountain of all good this seems to be plain reasoning and no high flight as the pure love of god has been unfortunately called by some professors of christianity and thence a handle given the enemies of that religion to disparage it  if god then loves us disinterestedly it is reasonable to think we ought to love him after the same manner and if love implies union that condition of loving purely cannot be wanting as it is only in purity or disinterestedness that we can find the idea of justice by which every thing has its due and is loved for its own worth  the two objections against the pure love of god for a third can hardly be imagined are first that our nature cannot attain to it and secondly that it is not required of us if the first were true the second would be so of course for impossible things would not be required by the god of righteousness but it is plainly required in the old testament that we should love god with all our heart and by our savior in the new who makes it the sum of the law and the prophets the annexing promises and threats appears easily a condescension to human weakness  let our nature be called as weak and corrupt as any body has a mind for it is certainly in a very pitiful condition but let not the capacity be denied of being transformed into a new nature by the power of god or what is called grace as being out of the number of ordinary or moral virtues which must be owned to come from above also it is for grace that prayers are so often put up by the clergy of all denominations and the love of god is prayed for in express terms properly grace means favor and the love of god to us is the highest favor that can be vouchsafed as our love to him is the greatest tribute we can offer and at the same time the most perfect state we can be in and the happiest for ourselves by grace is farther understood the removal of those impediments and obstructions which hinder the divine influences from operating on the hearts of men and so the prayer runs cleanse our hearts by the inspirations of thy holy spirit etc for the divine nature may be compared to the sun than which we have no visible object of more force and efficacy and what can be more necessary to be done away than that selfish disposition of heart which has no reason either for its love or aversion but the appearance of gain or loss to itself  this article of the love of god has been drawn out to a much greater length than was designed and it is pity any thing should have been mixed with it that looks like wrangling but as was before observed the advocates for selfinterest have raised it so high as to make it the only principle of acting not only among common men but the apostles and ambassadors from heaven they have like wise perplexed the matter by substituting selflove for selfinterest and so have rendered it an unfavourable thing to differ from them since it is so natural to love ourselves and even to consult our interest but they are to understand that there is no difference but in this single point whether god is to be loved principally for his sake or our own  it is not to be denied that rewards and punishments are laid before us in the scripture and that many of its arguments are accommodated to hope and fear but religion designs also that our hopes and fears should have a just and reasonable foundation in which case they are of great service to us as the spur and the bridle to animate our dullness or restrain our forwardness  but though hope and fear have their place in religion they are not to have the highest place st john has assured us that   john iv perfect love casts out fear and st paul has very decisively given charity that is love the preference above all gifts and graces   cor xiii   both hope and fear may be considered either as divine virtues or natural dispositions qualities or what other term the reader shall choose  the objects of our hope and fear are pleasure and pain in the general and though fear serves as a restraint upon our actions yet it serves also as an inducement the shunning of pain being often as strong a motive as the procuring of pleasure  again it is chiefly with reference to pleasure and pain in this life that our hopes and fears are awakened so that our present quiet or security as to the next life is very much owing to our stupidity and the pain that we are principally afraid of in this world is the censure of others who we cannot but see will take the same liberty with our character that we take with theirs and thus we pass our few days in dread and slavery this certainly will be owned by the polite part of mankind and there is hardly the meanest person but has his fears and his pride  what is shameful in the fear of censure is the excess of it and when we are convinced our judges are ignorant what is shameful in the fear of death or bodily pain or loss of goods is when we are too much disconcerted and especially when we are frightened out of our virtue  when hope and fear are directed to the next world they must continue in such a station with every thing that god has planted as perfect love shall assign them we are told it casts out fear that is any apprehension about ourselves for by fear is meant also honor and reverence which can never be cast out and this divine hope is founded on a sense of the infinite goodness and not on selflove for this were but presumption we may see nothing worthy of love in ourselves and yet have a great confidence in the divine mercy and we are never fit objects of that mercy till we lose our good opinion of ourselves and see our own insufficiency and corruption for god resists the proud  the pure love of god may be called an element which we can never breathe in till we get free of selflove or these two loves having as st augustine says no viii made two cities a man cannot at the same time be an inhabitant of them both but a very little reflection may show us which of the two cities or elements can afford us most pleasure for the highest pleasure is to love and the highest perfection is to love what is most excellent  whatever helps we can think of to excite our love to the deity whether it be the consideration of his goodness or his power hopes or fears gratitude prudence or any thing that can occur to a reasonable mind should all be made use of in their order and conspire to lead us to that indispensible duty which though it be our insallible interest is yet to be pursued chiefly as our duty otherwise we have neither the true notion of love nor justice nor even of our own interest but confusedly jumble all three together or perversely give interest the preference and set up ourselves in the place of god and consequently fall into the element of trouble or at most into a delusive quiet while it lasts  additions no i selflove pleasure happiness interest selflove is a compounded sort of a word the lover and the beloved being one and the same and the object and the faculty linked together as in dr mores phrase gingerbreadlove moneylove etc it is true these expressions are not used in our language we say the love of money brotherly love and the like but other languages make but one word of two as     when the french speak of a reasonable selflove which they seldom do and make it the foundation of virtue they only mean the reader may see the preface to a little collection of thoughts sometimes joined with the duke of rochefoucaults and the three first maxims themselves which serve pretty well for settling the ideas and limits of selflove and virtue human virtue or such virtuous actions as aim only at the rewards of this life of which sort of virtue self is undoubtedly the foundation and it must be allowed to be a very unstable one  the selflove that is argued for by wellintentiond persons as the foundation of all duties both in morality and religion is that selfaffection which nature has planted in us but all manner of affection and the desire of all manner of rewards must be regulated by justice  it seems fittest therefore to understand selflove according to the most current acceptance as the sink of all vices or as a bad tree which if the branches are lopt off upon one side will put forth new ones upon another so long as the ax is not laid to the root  the argument against cutting down what god has planted has no place in this idea of selflove for god plants nothing that is ill and therefore nothing that he has planted is to be destroyed in an absolute sense though several things are so to perish as to make way for what is more perfect meat for the belly and the belly for meat but god shall destroy both here is a kind of destruction and yet the works of god can never perish our savior says he that loses his life shall find it the meaning is obvious and thus self love or lawful affection for ourselves may be conceived as a thing not to be extinguished or lost in a physical sense but swallowed up by a siner principle as a river is lost in the sea  pleasure pleasure consists in the agreement of objects with our faculties so to have agreeable sensations or perceptions is to have pleasure reflections are also capable of giving pleasure though sainter  in the mere sensation of pleasure there is neither vice nor virtue shame nor praise for we are but passive under the impression  the love of pleasure and selflove are far from being convertible terms we love pleasure for our own sake and if we are but pleased we are indifferent what the object be and we readily quit one from the view of more pleasure in another and all this is reasonable provided we do not transgress the limits of justice  pleasure is often taken for the lower kinds of gratification a man of pleasure lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god  it is from the different pleasures men follow that they are to be called childish fantastic brutal dishonest impious or the reverse of all these for besides the pleasures of the five senses there are the pleasures of the understanding and the pleasures of the heart the pleasures of speculation and the pleasures of practice with an infinite number of little pleasures depending on the animal spirits as exercises diversions mirth etc all which are very good in their own order  false pleasures must be allowed to have a certain reality in them since they actually do please but the pleasure is owing to a vitiated taste for instance the delight in hearing of other peoples defects even when we have no design to exalt ourselves  happiness happiness and pleasure may be used promiscuously without much impropriety of discourse for whatever pleasure men eagerly pursue they have no other notion of happiness at that time  thus the revengeful mans revenge is his happiness the luxurious mans luxury is his happiness and a man will sometimes be happy with the smallest matter in the world  interest much the same may be said of interest it is not confined to moneymatters but whatever the heart is set upon that is interest  thus men forego small pleasures or little interests for greater or willingly suffer pain from the hopes of pleasure afterward or take their hazard of excessive pain afterward for a short pleasure in the mean time and it is not easy to calculate either the degrees of the intenseness or the duration but it is enough to suppose in general that it is the prospect of greater interest that determines us to such changes  the right notion of interest and the pursuit of it upon a deliberate examination is prudence for often men are hurried on without any consideration at all and often they are very confused in their deliberations  but the ideas of interest and justice are diametrically opposite our interest often suggests to keep what justice would require us to give away  yet nothing is our true interest but what is just or nothing is really profitable but what is honest  and thus some moralists had reason to make honesty and profit inseparable and they had this view likewise in forbidding us to separate them because we are so ready to go over to the profitable side as see no ix arrian upon epictetus argues very handsomely  no ii description of selflove selflove is the love of ones self and of every thing for the sake of ones self it makes men idolizers of themselves and would make them tyrants to others if fortune furnished them with the means of doing it it never takes any rest but within itself or dwells longer on any other objects than bees do upon flowers to extract what may be to its advantage nothing is so impetuous as its desires nothing so secret as its designs nothing so artful as its conduct in agility it surpasses all representation in transforming itself it exceeds all the metamorphoses and in refining goes beyond all the art of chemistry there is no fathoming the depth or piercing through the darkness of its abyss here it is concealed from the most penetrating eyes and makes a thousand insensible turnings and windings here it is often visible to itself and conceives and breeds up a vast number of inclinations and aversions unknown to itself some of which are to monstrous that when they are brought forth it does not know them or cannot be prevailed on to own them from this obscurity with which it is overcast arise the ridiculous conceits that it has of itself hence proceed the errors ignorance the gross and silly mistakes it entertains of itself hence it is that it fancies those passions dead in it which are only laid to sleep that it imagines it has laid aside the desire of pursuing when it does but rest to take breath and thinks it has lost the appetites which it has only satisfied for the present and yet this obscurity thick as it is to hide it from itself hinders it not from seeing perfectly the things which are without itself in which it is like our eyes which perceive all things and are only blind with respect to themselves indeed in its greatest concerns and most important affairs where the violence of its desires summons all its attention it sees and feels and hears and imagines and suspects and penetrates and foresees every thing so well that a man would be tempted to believe that every one of its passions was quieted by a sort of magic peculiar to it nothing is so close and strong as its engagements which in vain it attempts to break at the sight of great and threatening disasters yet sometimes it effects that in a little time and with little pains which it could not effect in the course of many years with all its endeavors from whence it may probably enough be concluded that its desires are kindled by itself rather than by the beauty or merits of its objects that its own palate gives them the value that enhances them and the gloss that sets them off that itself is the thing it pursues and its own humor what it follows when it follows the objects that suit its humor it is made up of contraricties it is imperious and submissive sincere and hypocritical compassionate and cruel timorous and audacious it puts on different inclinations according to the different tempers that dispose and devote it sometimes to glory sometimes to riches and sometimes to pleasure all which too it changes as our age fortune or experience change but as to itself it is indifferent whether it has many or but one because it divides itself into many and collects itself into one as its pleasure or necessity requires it is inconstant not only from the changes produced by foreign causes but from a thousand others that spring from itself it is inconstant from inconstancy levity love weariness and disgust it is whimsical and may be observed sometimes to labor with the utmost vehemence and with incredible pains to obtain those things that are not only of no advantage but are hurtful which yet pursue it will merely because it will it is fantastical and often sets all its application at work about the most frivolous employments takes delight in the most insipid things and preserves all its haughtiness in the most contemptible circumstances it enters into all states and conditions of life it lives in every place it lives upon every thing nay it lives upon nothing it makes itself easy either with the enjoyment of things or with the want of them it takes part with the people that make war upon it engages in their designs and what is wonderful joins with them in hating itself conspires its own destruction and works its own ruin in short its whole care is to exist and provided it does but exist is content to be its own enemy we ought not therefore to be surpised to see it associating itself with the most rigid austerity and entering boldly in league with its adversary to destroy itself because at the same time that it loses in one place it gains in another when we think it renounces its pleasure it only suspends or changes it and when it is so conquered that we fancy it entirely routed we find it triumphing in its own defeat behold the true picture of selflove the whole life of which is but one great and long agitation the sea is a very sensible image of it the waves of which in their flux and reflux faithfully express the turbulent succession of its thoughts and the eternal commotions of its mind  no iii vice sin evil vice implies both defect and corruption  sin and evil that is moral evil are of the same signification with vice and all the three words stand in such an opposition to virtue as darkness to light confusion to order sickness to health  there are many other words used for sin as iniquity transgression trespass etc  iniquity though a negative sort of term implies a positive breach of justice and order and so long as the mind is in the selfish principle it is in the state of iniquity even when it does not break out into actions  the idea of sin must be hateful because it implies a violation of order which is lovely  the fear of punishment and the abhorrence of sin are different things  if selflove in the best sense it can have were the principle of religion the greatest sin would be against ourselves  a man is indeed unjust to himself when he acts not up to the dignity of his nature and he is cruel to himself when he brings shame and punishment upon his own head but the notion of offense and crime still supposes a higher person injured  sin or vice is the only thing that is hateful personal hatred is hateful itself and can only spring from some disease of the mind  evil physical or natural evil as a thing felt is but another term for pain which is also the consequence of moral evil those who deny evil and pain must only have a quarrel at the words and any other words might indeed do as well if they were as current for expressing the opposite things to good and pleasure  moral evil may produce both natural pain as sickness after a debauch and remorse which may be called moral pain and both these follow upon sin by the natural establishment of things  thus men are said to encompass themselves with sparks of their own kindling and thus god has made the wicked for the day of evil  no iv from h mores letters let   moreover as the object of the intellect is that which is simply true and is assented to as such and not as true to this particular intellect that contemplates it for this is not the sense of such an assent but that it is simply and absolutely true and cannot but appear so to all intellects that are fitted to contemplate it so there is an object that is simply good and lovely and to be loved as such without regard to the party that thus loves it but ought to be loved of all without regard to themselves but upon the account that it is so universally good insomuch that if god should love all intellectual beings except one that were at the same time to be damned for his excessive and unparalled wickedness and contumacy against god it were yet an immense specimen of his goodness and he were infinitely good and were so to be acknowledged even by that intellectual creature that was to be damned and ought to be loved by it though this wicked sunk condition makes it incapable of so fit a duty as well as a true proposition is to be assented to by him whose disinterest it were that it should be found true and a man may as well say that there is no reason but what arises from selfinterested understanding as no love but what arises from selflove there is that which is absolutely lovely and to which love without any selfregard is due as well as there is that which is absolutely true and which every understanding ought to subscribe to if not some default in itself hinder  and that things and persons are lovely without consideration of our own utility methinks is further evident from that pleasure and content we take in the history of worthy persons and their excellent virtues and famous exploits in former ages and in far remote countries without any reflection upon any interest or profit we have in their virtues or actions but we love them and rejoice in their memory as absolute objects of deserved love from those lovely perfections in them and where cicero says that if virtue could be seen with outward eyes mirabiles amores sui excitaret can we understand such love as is grounded upon selflove not rather such love as ravishes one out of himself and transports him to the object  but to pass by reason and the sense of philosophers that main duty of every christian thou shall love the lord thy god with all thy heart and all thy soul and thy neighbor as thy self to me is not easy sense if selflove is to be at the bottom into which as the very principle all love is to be resolved the former part of this precept is such an injunction that takes a man quite off from himself and all selflove for how can i love god with all my heart and all my soul if that love be resolvible into the love of myself and subordinate to it here is a piece of barbarouslike philosophy very well applied propter quod unumquodque est tale id magis est tale suppose then my love to god how ardent you will my love to myself will be much more ardent so that god is so far from having our whole heart or soul that he does not so much as go halves with us wherefore it is manifest we are entirely and absolutely to love god first and to love ourselves in reference to him as also the rest of our fellow creatures all which love being in reference to god rapportant a dieu as m pascal says it hinders not but that god is still loved with all our hearts and souls and the love of ourselves and of our neighbor as ourselves is but the fruit of our entire love to god and we shall be sure then to love our neighbor as ourselves and so as we ought to do  it is hard to know what to leave out of those letters here are yet some more strokes of them   who can endure to think or where st john says perfect love casts out fear that he understands perfect selflove casts out fear which is rather the source of all jealousy anxiety and distraction of mind  let me offer one passage more out of our saviors sermon on the mount love your enemies etc now it seems to me a mavelous unnatural analyze to resolve the love of our enemies into selflove or love of ourselves the hatred indeed of them is evidently resolvible into that    cor xiii again how can this transcendent grace of charity be lodged so low as in selflove or if it be so how can the apostle undertake for it that it will not seek its own etc  there is a fear of god and there is a mercenary love of god and these indeed are resolvible into selflove and the scripture often applies itself to this principle to hale us out of the hurry and dirt of this world by forcible arguments upon those passions  let   he acknowledges in the next letter that selflove may be an occasional beginning or excitement to religion making a familiar comparison of gingerbread given to a boy to make him in love with his book but selflove he says is a default and blemish and rottenness in religion and virtue rather than an essential principle or basis thereof  his opponent had said that religion does not extirpate selflove but raises and ennobles it and keeps it from sinking into the animal life  but this replies the doctor is impossible for as much as selflove is the sink and fetulency of the animal life i understand here by selflove loving ones self as self and therefore religion does at last quite extirpate it  he intimates afterward as most christian divines do that the extirpation of selflove must cost mankind very dear the old and the new man in the language of the scripture signifying two opposite principles one of which must unavoidably be destroyed in order to recover our lost happiness  no v religion charity st james defines religion thus pure religion and undefiled before god and the father is this to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction and to keep ourselves unspotted from the world we see what practices are most recommended by that apostle and the keeping ourselves unspotted from the world implies all that is forbidden by religion both as to our acons and our heart  religion further requires the observance of other practices either supposed to be instituted by god or appointed by those to whom the regulation of such things belongs  the end of religion is the same thing with the end of the commandment which is charity  all external practices of religion are designed for promoting that internal disposition of mind both with respect to god and our neighbor and from it they derive all their value and this religion is often called a spiritual and new life  that which is called the religion of a country with respect to forms usages and opinions resembles the municipal laws of a country which are peculiar to it and so mr pascal says orthodoxy on the one side of the pyrenees may be heresy on the other whereas among christians there is properly but one religion  the christian religion therefore may be considered as a body of doctrine and precepts delivered from heaven which men ought to follow as the universal standard and according to which they ought to form their particular societies  but there is this difference between the religion and the laws of a country that a man must submit to these of necessity but not always to the religion as an englishman may dissent safely from the church of england  when people talk of the cruelties of religion christianity has nothing to answer for in that charge and when the clergy are accused of pride the accusation lies properly against the defective nature of men  most men allow there is a distinction between the end of religion and the means they allow also a distinction among the means themselves as to weight or importance but the mortal dispute remains what the weightiest are and the end is often forgot in the controversy  the end of religion is therefore to be considered both as the point to arrive at and the principal thing in the affair  some things may be called parts of religion as well as helps to it as faith prayer temperance and whatsoever jesus christ has ordered to be done and believed  particular forms of religion that is such things as are but the inventions of men may be called helps to it but not parts no more than the clothes are parts of the body though they are of indispensable use to it and in religion the very observance of particular modes comes to be a duty that besides their usefulness there may be no offense given to the society one adheres to the parallel between religion and clothes cannot be expected to run exactly  it is with reference to religious forms and speculations that zeal a good thing in itself becomes both ridiculous and tragical  again as no human inventions are perfect to a scornful temper they appear more imperfect than they are  charity charity is taken sometimes only for giving of alms sometimes for having a favorable opinion of others but the proper interpretation of the word is love and st paul has fixed the meaning of it and clearly shown its effects   cor xiii  if we believe that god can reward us hereafter this shows that we have faith if we suffer on a prospect of reward this shows that we have hope but if we go no farther where is our charity or where is our religion the devils believe and tremble and hope without charity were but presumption  religion not only requires a change of the objects of our affections but a change of the principle likewise  that which is not loved for itself says st augustine is not loved at all it is only wanted for its usefulness  thus charity and selflove are ever to be considered as two opposite principles and whatever the apostle says of the one the reverse is to be said of the other for instance charity seeks not its own suffers long and is kind thinks no evil rejoiceth not in iniquity etc selflove is interested impatient unkind and delighted with scandal  no vi see no x virtue justice disinterestedness virtue is sometimes taken only for some natural good quality in things thus it is said such a thing has a virtue or it has lost its virtue the virtue of medicines etc  virtue in persons is meant of the integrity of their intentions and actions and it may be considered too as a line or rule by which they are to be examined  virtue considered in itself abstractly from things and persons has its existence only in the mind and is called an abstraction of the mind as a mathematical line is considered without any breadth and thus people talk of color beauty proportion and an infinite number of qualities without regard to any particular subject  when some persons talk of the deceitfulness of virtue they do not mean that the rule is fallacious or uncertain but that men act not from the motives they pretend to the duke of rochefoucault says max  0  what the world calls virtue is commonly but a phantom formed by our passions  this is far from denying there is such a thing as virtue on the contrary that same author says max     hypocrisy is an homage which vice renders to virtue  if a man denies there is any virtue in the world he is only supposed to speak for himself and his own club  cicero makes all virtues to center in justice and st augustine quod si virtus ad beatam vitam nos ducit nihil omnino esse virtutem affirmaverim nisi summum amorem dei namque illud quod quadripartita dicitur virtus ex ipsius amoris vario quodam affectu quantum intelligo dicitur itaque illas qua virtures quarum utinam ita sit in mentibus vis ut nomina in ore sunt omnium sic etiam definire non dubitem ut temperantiam dicamus esse amorem deo sese integrum incorruptumque servantem fortitudinem amorem omnia propter deum facilc perferentem justitiom amorem dco tantum servientem and ab hoc been imperantem caeteris quae homini subjecta sunt prudentiam amorem been discernentem ca quibus adjuvetur in deum ab iis quibus impediri potest de moribus eccl cath l   cap    makes them all to center in the love of god which may be called the highest justice  virtue according to the oldest acceptance of the word is particularly reckoned a force of mind and the inclinations of man being much corrupted it consists much in the struggle with these inclinations but yet no body denies that virtue has charms and attractions  justice justice or righteousness is another abstract term that is considered sometimes without regard to actions but it is only from it that they can have their worth  man is so framed as to see justice and even to love it naturally and to have no sense of justice is the same as to have no conscience  thus the sense of justice conscience moral sense are words of the same signification and the moral sense is as natural to man as any of the senses that belong to his body  disinterestedness disinterestedness is that upright state of mind by which a man acts from a higher view than that of his own good or a disinterested man may be said to have no bias that is capable to turn him aside from his duty  however duty and interest may unite in the event yet they differ widely as to the motives  the disinterested state goes indeed higher than we are aware of but it is still a real one not chimerical  disinterestedness may at least be considered as health by which the functions of the animal life are performed with easiness  and as health is considered as a foundation for bodily pleasure so disinterestedness which is a soundness of the mind may be reckoned a foundation for those pleasures that are called virtuous and spiritual  again when disinterestedness is called the soul of friendship the life of religion and the like it is indeed considered in a positive sense and as a principle itself though strictly speaking it is but the effect of a higher principle  it may be called a disinterested action which the agent would have done just the same way though he had foreseen no profit in it to himself  no vii from mr pascal sect    mankind having no infallible remedy against ignorance misery and death imagine that some respite some shelter may at least be found by agreeing to banish them from their meditation this is the only comfort they have been able to invent under their numerous calamities but a most miserable comfort it proves because it does not tend to the removal of these evils but only to the concealment of them for a short season and because in thus concealing them it hinders us from applying such proper means as should remove them  thus by a strange revolution in the nature of man that grief and inward disquiet which he dreads as the greatest of sensible evils is in one respect his greatest good because it might contribute more than all things besides to the putting him in a successful method of recovery on the other hand his by recreation mr pascal means not only mens diversions and some harmless ones cannot be condemned but the serious business of their lives as will appear by the strain of the whole section and that serious business st augustine puts upon a level with the plays of children majorum nugae negotia vocantur recreation which he seems to prize as his sovereign good is indeed his greatest evil because it is of all things the most effectual in making him negligent under his distemper and both the one and the other are admirable proofs as of mans misery and corruption so of his greatness and dignity for the reason why he grows sick and weary of every object and engages in such a multitude of pursuits is because he still retains the idea of his lost happiness which not finding within himself he seeks it through the whole circle of external things but always seeks without success because it is indeed to be found not in ourselves nor in the creatures but in god alone

sapientiam  no ix arrian lib ii cap xxii this philosopher after cicero and socrates considering the force that profit or what appears profitable has over mankind and designing to recommend virtue to their earnest pursuit labors to persuade them that nothing is profitable but what is virtuous he affirms that it is only wisdom to love what is really good and useful but that we have such a bias to ourselves that if we shall place virtue and utility on different sides we shall of consequence betake ourselves to the side we think profitable so arrian designs in this chapter concerning friendship to inform our judgment as to our duties and to give us a view of our innate selfishness the whole chapter should be read and it will appear whether this good heathen has been an advocate for the interested principle or not  it is true he says no creature is so much reconciled to another as to its own profit which no doubt is the case with men in the common state of nature but those who own christianity as they are still more persuaded of this corruption so they see a greater difficulty of getting free of it for the heart is corrupted as well as the understanding is darkened and it was to this latter faculty that the stoics chiefly applied themselves thinking if the understanding was rightly informed all the work was done  but it does not infer that they thought interest the chief principle that should determine men because they pointed out where the true interest lies no more than the scriptures can be brought to support that principle because in teaching men the way to happiness they sometimes make use of arguments from hope and fear  in the same manner some great men among the heathens have condescended to the weakness of those they were endeavoring to instruct they knew that virtue is not perfect nor such at it ought to be while interest is the motive and they themselves could be virtuous without regard to it but they knew likewise the disorders of human nature and that profit was the chief bait and have therefore taken pains to show that virtue and profit are inseparable but if we would judge of the purity of their sentiments it must be from the places where the dispositions of their own hearts are marked the following words of epictetus may be considered and they add a great luster to the doctrine of the stoics  is it thy will that i continue in life i will continue in it and in a free and generous manner as it pleases thee for thou have created me of such a nature that i cannot be constrained in what concerns me  but have thou no more for me to do blessed be thy name it is for thee and for thee alone that i have lived unto this hour and now i go away in obedience to thee  how would thou go thy ways i go my ways as it pleases thee as thy servant as having had the advantage of knowing what thou command and what thou forbiddest  but what station do thou appoint me while i live and converse among thy works a prince or a private person a senator or one of the common people a soldier captain schoolmaster or father of a family the place and the station which thou have assigned to me i will maintain and die a thousand deaths rather than desert it i go where thou would have me to rome or athens to thebes or to the gyaraeislands i go willingly only be thou there mindful of me if thou sendest me where men cannot naturally live i will not leave it contrary to thy will i will wait till thou command me to retire i will not forsake thee i will think thou have no more occasion for my service arrian book iii chap xxiv  one might easily heap up quotations of the same kind from this and other authors but it would be to no purpose for allowing defects in the heathen philosophy the christian doctrine is still out of the reach of censure and disinterestedness is one of its distinguishing characters  no x truth truth is of the same import or signification with reality so that to know the truth is to know the value of things  truth says sir francis bacon is a naked and open daylight that does not show the masks and mummeries and triumphs of this world half so stately and daintily as candelights essays i the same thought is very well expressed in another way by a later authorhow fading and insipid do all objects accost us that are not conveyed in the vehicle of delusion how shrunk is every thing as it appears in the glass of nature so that if it were not for the assistance of artificial mediums false lights refracted angles varnish and tinsel there would be a mighty level in the felicity and enjoyment of mortal men tale of a tub   the love of truth considered morally is the same with the love of justice thus the apostle says charity rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth  all truths are equal as to their reality but very unequal as to their importance and the knowledge of the highest truths if it goes no farther than bare speculation is but amusement  the opposite things to truth and reality are falsehood error lies delusion and the mind takes pleasure in the one side or the other according to the disposition it is in  the greatest breach of truth or the worst kind of lying consists in the intention to deceive or injure a lie that has no end to serve is not very conceivable but there are ends which must be owned to be very frivolous  mans love of truth is an argument of his dignity  honor is properly a regard for truth false honor is a sort of contradiction or at best it is but a regard for punctilios but even this common honor of the world is a considerable guard against several kinds of prostitution and falsehood  no xi why the words heb xii are supposed to mean instead of the joy set before him etc rather than because of the joy etc passing by all the arguments that might be brought to prove the sufferings of jesus christ to have been the effect of his pity to mankind and not for any advantage to himself or the prospect of interest such arguments seeming derogatory as well as superfluous from the instances of moses and st paul who went such lengths for their brethren as cannot naturally be resolved into selfinterest however people may differ as to the meaning of these expressions blotted out of the book of life and the like i say waving all these arguments i shall confine myself to the words themselves as they stand with relation to other words not far from them the text being still best explained by the context  i shall not insist neither on the common acceptance of the preposition  since if at any time it be found in a different meaning it may be contended to have that meaning here however castellios translation runs pro laetitia sibi proposita beza has it pro sibi proposito gaudio and the vulgar latin suppressing the preposition entirely renders it proposito sibi gaudio but perhaps the word proposito has been designed to be divided and the preposition to stand bezas note or paraphrase on the margin is still more remarkable qui quum omne genus beatitatis in manu ac potestate haberet tamen ultro ignominiam crucis subiit which is also to be sound in english on the margin of our bibles  but let us look at the end of the first verse of that chapter and we shall find the same words repeated in the second and consequently they are to have the same interpretation in order to make out the parallel or comparison by which the apostle exhorts christians to run the race or undergo the conflict appointed or set before them as our savior endured the cross instead of the joy that was appointed or set before him the same words set before appear in both verses and it is just so in the    greek which shows that the joy set before our savior was not a thing at a distance or proposed to him as the condition of his enduring the cross but that he chose to bear the suffering when he was already secure of the joy or had it before him his example is indeed recommended to us that we may not be wearied and his recompense is also represented to us  in his sitting at the right hand of god as a motive to make us run that race without fainting but there can be no inference that he needed such a motive and here the comparison fails between him and mortals the joy having been still in his power  we see also a choice made by moses in the former chapter rather to suffer affliction with the people of god than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season we must suppose a difference in the pleasures set before moses and jesus christ it was but the pleasures of egypt that were proposed to moses and these he rejected the joy proposed to jesus christ or set before him was at a distance from moses and we are only told he had an eye to it as the reward of his choice  it is observable that jesus christ is not included by st paul in that cloud of witnesses as being in a superior order he is the author and finisher of our faith and sat down at the right hand of god as taking possession himself of his recompense or reassuming what he had left for a while and what he always might have kept  i need not run through all the parallel between our savior and moses it will easily appear wherein it agrees and wherein it differs as all comparisons do differ in something it is not indeed in that instance of mosess rejecting the pleasures of egypt that we find such proof of his disinterestedness as of his wisdom though still there may be an eye to a recompense consistent with the love of justice and this prospect and love of reward may be so far from excluding the love of justice that upon occasions all views of interest may be extinguished in the same person and justice remain the only motive or consideration as in the instance of mosess offering to suffer for his brethren inferior motives may certainly consist with superior ones and the former may sometimes give way as they always ought to do when order requires it it is opposite things only like fire and water that cannot be united or consist together superior and inferior motives are not opposite but different  but i will not trouble the reader with any more reasoning upon that point having only designed here a sort of criticism upon a text of scripture to support a reading that all foreign churches agree to and it cannot be affirmed that our english translators though they have left it a little doubtful have positively designed that their translation for the joy should be understood to signify because of the joy we see in other places that for very often signifies instead of or in exchange as they rewarded me evil for good and the like nay the translation of bezas qui quum etc whereas he had all kind of blessedness in his hand or power yet suffered willingly the ignominy of the cross  this note is much supported by a remarkable text phil ii       note on the margin of our larger bibles is a fair presumption that they have meant as he meant  milton makes the sense of that particle very plain when he regrets the loss of his sight in such moving terms but cloud instead and everduring dark surrounds me from the cheerful ways of men cut off and for the book of knowledge fair presented with an universal blank   no xii amor ex quo amicitia nominata princeps est ad benevolentiam conjungendam nam utilitates quidem etiam ab iis percipiuntur saepe qui simulatione amicitiae

indigentia nulla utilitate quaesita cic de amicitia passim  no xiii with submission to the duke of rochefoucault i am unwilling to call by the name of selflove all the irregularities of human nature neither the violence of our passions nor the foolishness of our imaginations are selflove we feel and imagine and we cannot help it our senses are all passive and our imagination is often crowded with things we would gladly be rid of our understanding is in a manner passive too as it sees by intuition like the bodily eye its activity consisting only in comparing things together in adding substracting weighing measuring and the like all which are of the province of reason and thus reason may be called both active and passive passive as it perceives the connections and proportions of things and active as it examines and lays things in order but neither wrong reasoning nor right reasoning is selflove nor can the disorders of any faculty be imputed to the faculty itself reason is sure within its own sphere but is bewildered and lost when it pretends to go father and selflove is lawful within due allowances but unlawful when it violates order  to know this order and what we are designed for has been much at heart with some good heathens quid sumus and quidnam victuri gignimur ordo quis datus  they were faithful to their light what a change would revelation have made in their doctrine how differently would the good antoninus have writ had he heard of the fall of adam and of the present corruption of nature one set of the deists borrow most of their scheme from him  the violation of order would never happen in a sound mind without some wrong biass toward selfthe heart seems to be first corrupted so that interestedness may be called the source of disorder nor is selflove and interestedness properly the same much less is it true that has been affirmed by some persons that all love must be interested not excepting the love of god to his creatures it is but very few that are of this opinion and the ancient persians had a quite different notion of god when they said he is the author of all good and entirely disinterested  disinterestedness may be considered as the foundation of that active principle called charity all love strictly speaking is disinterested the love we bear to ourselves is certainly so as cicero observed and ought to be the measure of our love toward our neighbor the love of god is a higher attainment  there was one thing that gave a great discouragement from this poor undertaking viz that what is said on the love of god will be very insipid to those who have felt ever so little of the thing or are acquainted with such authors as have wrote of it from their own experience but i have told all my design in the introduction  though the enemies of christianity have taken advantage of some expressions of the clergy in favor of selflove and the sufficiency of reason yet neither of these doctrines is espoused by any party in the gross but rather rejected by the greatest number of all parties papists protestants and all the branches of these last be on your guard says dr evans against selfishness or such an addictedness to yourselves as shall confine your regards within the narrow circle of self such a selflove is the main principle of all the evils and disorders in the world it makes men undutiful to god and useless if not pernicious to those about them and how finely has mr butler of the rolls chapel expressed himself against selflove in his sermons evans says also of the love of god that it is indeed the first and great commandment it is first in order of nature and in the preeminence of the object to which it relates etc  among the writers of the church of rome the expressions are no less remarkable both against selflove and for the pure love of god citations might be produced in great plenty from writers in all ages those who wrote the earliest gave their testimony to pure love and no doubt had insisted more upon it but that the doctrine of selflove had not then set up its horns these words of there is another reason why good men are afflicted with temporal evils as in the case of job that the mind may be put to a trial and discover the force of its own piety or how much it loves god for nothing st augustine can hardly be forgot habent aliam causam boniquare temporalibus affligantur malis qualem habuit job ut sibiipsi humanus animus sit probatus and cognitus quanta virtute pietatis gratis deum diligat as to job a question was indeed put by the devil does job serve god for naught but the following part of the history sufficiently showed jobs disinterestedness as well as his patience   no body can deny that the scripture insists upon rewards and punishments as arguments drawn from our own interest but interest ought not to justle out duty justice and order nor even to be preferred to these henry more had reason to mention that maxim of aristotle odd as it looks propter quod unumquodque est tale etc for it is certain that whatever is regarded chiefly for the sake of another thing is the least regarded of the two but it is carefully to be remembered that the scripture is accommodated to the state of mortals and speaks to the stronger and the weaker to those of better dispositions and those of worse yet jesus christ says to all be ye perfect etc we must observe farther that the promises annexed to our duty are not given barely as an incitement to it but also to show the dispositions we must be in before we can attain to the happiness designed for us as for instance before we can see god we must be pure in heart  a modern logician mons crousaz says very well upon the different dispositions of people with respect to virtue it is to this purpose the bare knowledge of virtue determines one person to cleave to it another needs the majesty of a lawgiver to be added a third has need of promises a fourth of threats and a fifth of blows here is a gradation of virtue from the highest form to the lowest the lowest is very low and the highest as high as dr more or the bishop of cambray would demand if mons crousaz speaks sometimes favorably of selflove i mean the interested principle the like has happened to very good persons even among the clergy which led me into that criticism no xi and i am not yet sure if it should stand but it was owing to a sermon of bishop bull which every body may see in print it is uneasy to differ from a learned and good man but what shall one do when a greater number of learned and good men are on the other side of the question here is another bishop of the same church bishop lake he says in his sermon on math xxii    if there be any thing that may be loved jointly with god it must not share equally with god but keep its distance and receive our love by a reflection from god thus if we love god we love him above all things and we love him for himself for that must needs follow when we love him for no other thing no not for our own selves but are willing to hazard all even ourselves and all for the love of him how far is disinterestedness carried in that prayer of give me o lord a lively faith a firm hope and a lively charity a love of thee incomparably above the love of myself that i may love nothing to thy displeasure but every thing in order to thy satisfaction  give me o lord a longing to be with thee not for avoiding the calamities of this wretched world nor so much for escaping the pains of purgatory or those of hell nor for attaining the joys of heaven with respect to my own advantage as purely for the love of thee   sir thomas mores i have often wondered how this principle should give such alarm as if the quiet of the world was in danger from it in the first place it is not likely to be much practiced and then it can never be so interpreted as if people were forbid to take due care of themselves for if a man did not so he would be ill taken care of as the world is but in dealing with the world and almighty god the rules are widely different with him there is no use for caution and reserve but the more unlimited the trust and dependence so much the greater the safety and happiness how agreeable is it to reflect on the constitution of things and to find happiness result from the observance of order and duty  how disorder first entered into the world is like to remain a secret to mankind and it seems to be of little use to go into metaphysical inquiries about it since whatever way the question were resolved it would make no alteration either in our duty or in the nature of things disinterestedness will always be our dury and our duty will always be our interest but the ideas of these two are different however they may coincide in the event and in all duties the value will ever be measured by the motive  in this point even christians and deists seem to be agreed for disinterestedness is a common principle between them and when any christians set up for interestedness the deists make a handle of it to disparage christianity again when christians set up for the sufficiency of reason the deists are fond of their expressions and quote them to prove christianity an useless thing one great difference between christianity and deism is this christianity represents human nature in a state of disorder the understanding limited and confused the passions tumultuous and the heart corrupted and consequently a necessity of superior assistance deism gives a quite different representation as if every thing in man was entire and nothing so easy as the balancing of the passions and all the rest the difference between christianity and deism in the point of selfdenial follows of course christians at least profess it and if the deists allege they are not in earnest and believe less than they pretend to it can never come to a demonstration and the christians may allege that the deists believe more than they own the external and rational evidences for christianity being so strong nor is christianity a doctrine of vexation and sorrow it only sets things before us as they are that we may not be deceived with false appearances what situation of fortune can be sufficient to transport any person that reflects on the present state of the world and the variety of evils both natural and moral the world is felt to be what it is philosophy is for the most part but grimace  but it is not so much the insufficiency of things as the injustice of selflove that i had a mind to represent that principle by which a man would make himself the center of the universe and i hope it will not be reckoned too presumptuous if i endeavor this once to state the question concerning selflove and the love of god in such a way that all christians may if possible agree in it  the question here is not whether we are to love god or whether it be our interest to love him or whether it be the will and the glory of god that he should be loved by all intelligent creatures for in these things all christians are agreed but the question is whether we are to love him from the motive of his perfection or from that of our own indigence whether we are to love him for the sake of our own personal advantage be use we cannot be happy without him or because he is indeed the most amiable object without considering our own advantage whether we are to love him because it is just and right in itself or because our own hopes and fears determine us if it be said we ought to love him both because it is just in itself and also because it is our interest it may be answered that as these motives are not to be equal otherwise we should love god and ourselves equally the question comes to be whether interest shall give place to justice or justice give place to interest for however both these motives may subsist together at first yet the lesser motive will and ought to be swallowed up by the greater now if we will but consider as carefully the justice there is in loving god as the particular profit that shall accrue to us by it we shall at last be so penetrated with the sense of the justice of the thing as to reflect no more on our profit or if we do we shall find that though profit accompanies our love yet it is no longer worthy to be the motive of it and that as the least byview to interest renders love less perfect so it is only that love which is without any such view that is absolutely pure and perfect because in that love the lover forgetting himself wholly rejoices only in the beloved and this however some have called it a refinement is no more than what the nature of the thing requires and what cicero has even required in friendship  again if we still love ourselves with a distinct love independent on that of god how shall we ever get so far out of the selfish state as to love god with all our heart and all our strength and yet this great duty is acknowledged by all christians and the practice of it in the full and literal meaning of the words is the highest perfection for the end of the commandment is charity and love is the fulfilling of the law whatever inferior motives therefore our imperfections may stand in need of in the beginning yet they must at last give way to a more perfect principle so that if any shall take upon them to condemn the pure disinterested love of god i see not how they can reconcile this with their own acknowledgement that he is to be loved with all our heart  finis books printed for j osborn and t longman i introduction to natural philosophy or
