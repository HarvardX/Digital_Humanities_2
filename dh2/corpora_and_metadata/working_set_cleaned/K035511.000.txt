an easy and very practicable method to enable deaf persons to hear together with a brief account of and some reflections and observations upon the several attempts formerly made for the benefit of such persons  translated from the german of andrew elias buchner professor of medicine and natural philosophy in the university of halle  london printed for mess hawes clarke and collins booksellers in paternosterrow mdcclxx  introduction the more extensively useful and the more adapted to the occasions of life the matters are which an author takes upon him to lay before his readers the more he answers that end which every virtuous man ought in justice to propose to himself in every address to the public and the more such matters claim the attention and patience of the reader these considerations have principally weighed with me in favor of the present undertaking and i promise myself on this occasion the approbation of every one who can put a due value on the enjoyment of his senses as well as of him who can be sensible of the great disadvantage arising from the loss of any of them  sight and hearing are undoubtedly two of the principal external senses as they supply us with the knowledge of a far greater number of external objects than the other senses put together which though indeed of considerable are yet of a more limited usefulness and their impairment or loss more tolerable but blind or deaf what melancholy objects both blind and deaf what accumulated woe  i wave at present the several attempts which have been made in order to correct the manifold defects of sight at least to lessen or render them tolerable confining my reflections on this occasion to that of hearing and for that purpose i shall relate the several means devised in order to amend this sense when impaired or retrieve it when entirely lost or by help of the other senses and a tolerable degree of understanding in the patient to render its loss in some measure more tolerable and lastly i shall select among the several methods proposed that which to me appears to be the easiest and most simple but previous to this i shall briefly explain the reasons of the principal defects of the sense of hearing both from their causes and from the structure of the outer and inner ear and then more accurately determine the greater or less utility of the methods hitherto employed in order to amend these defects  an easy and practicable method etc chap i containing reflections preparatory to the following discourse among the defects to which the sense of hearing is subject the greatest without dispute is the entire loss thereof or that which in a word we call deafness this when either brought into the world or contracted before a child comes to the use of his understanding and before he learns to speak renders him very unhappy as thereby he continues to be speechless or dumb and thus precluded all social intercourse and this is the reason why persons born deaf are at the same time also dumb if not taught to speak by some peculiar devices or by means of the other senses to this defect of hearing we are to class that which is called difficulty of hearing which besides that it comes nearest to absolute deafness proceeds for the most part from the same causes only in a less degree all the other defects of this sense as not being to our present purpose we shall wave at this time  all the senses have from nature their proper organs which are in a certain determinate manner affected and altered by external objects and first in that they propagate these affections or alterations to the common sensory and thereby render our sensations complete and communicate them to the soul now as deafness is the inability to perceive those tremulous or vibratory motions of the air which produce sound the cause of this defect must necessarily be either in the organ itself namely the ear or in its connection with the common sensory the vibrations of the air being prevented from producing the necessary and determinate alterations in those parts of the human body the same thing holds with respect to difficulty of hearing as being only a less degreee of deafness  the ear consists of several distinct parts which together concur to produce the sense of hearing hence if the causes of deafness or of a difficulty of hearing are in the ear itself one or more parts thereof must be injured that is be in a preternatural state to show this the more distinctly it is necessary to consider those parts separately and to explain the preternatural alterations which occasion deafness or a difficulty of hearing  anatomists commonly divide the parts of the ear into two sorts namely those which belong to the external ear and are situate without the temporal bones and into those that constitute the inner ear comprising all the parts that lie within the said bones  to the first sort belongs that which is properly called the outer ear and the meatus auditorius or auditory passage or canal the inner part of which last anatomists generally refer to the inner ear but it may be here very commodiously treated together with the external parts as being only a passage from them as the different defects of that which is properly called the external ear if in other respects the aperture of the auditory passage is not at the same time affected may produce a difficulty of hearing or other defect of this sense but are never the causes of perfect deafness so i shall not insist on this but directly handle the several defects of the auditory passage as an external part of the ear so far as they are to my present purpose  the use of the auditory passage is to propagate the vibrations of the air communicated externally thereto by repeated repercussions in its cavity to the inner parts of the ear and thence it is necessary that this passage be neither obstructed nor extraordinarily constricted or straitened in the first case deafness is the consequence in the last a difficulty of hearing at least the first defect often arises either from a long accumulated a condensed or a greatly indurated earwax or from foreign bodies introduced into the auditory passage as for instance cherrystones peace leadshot etc or from tumors and imposthumes or from fleshy or spungy excrescences therein or very often from the concretion of its sides from such imposthumes or lastly from a pellicle or membrance growing across it as is frequently observed in newborn children the other defect of the auditory passage namely its too great constriction may arise from the very same causes if we only except the preternatural membrane stretched across it or the obstruction of the auditory passage by fluid matters which diffuse themselves on every side  the second species of the parts of the ear mentioned above constitutes the inner ear and comprises the membrane of the tympanum or drum its cavity the labyrinth the tuba eustachii and the auditory nerves the membrane of the drum receives by the auditory passage the tremulous motions or vibrations of the air which it farther diffuses in its cavity and in the labyrinth but particularly in the drum we find four species of defects which prevent its ordinary use one the too great flaccidity of its membrane whereby it is unfitted for vibrations or tremulous motions and so transmits sounds either not at all or but faintly to the other inner parts and hence we may judge how it happens that a phlegmatic constitution moist and purulent ears damp air foggy and rainy weather and the like often increase a difficulty of hearing to a pitch of perfect deafness the other defect of the membrane of the drum is directly opposite to this and consists in an extraordinary tension thereof which when to so considerable a degree as too much to resist the insinuating tremulous air and prevent its vibrations gives rise in like manner to a difficulty of hearing and even to perfect deafness as may be often observed in the case of elderly people and emaciated constitutions both these defects flaccidity and tension may also arise from an undue action of the muscles moving the small auditory bones but as such considerations would carry us to anatomical and philosophical niceties we shall wave them at present as not greatly to our purpose the complete induration or even ossification of the membrane of the drum is the third defect which may besides from the same causes mentioned before under the extraordinary tension of this membrane impair the hearing and lastly its laceration constitutes the fourth defect which indeed does not so soon vitiate the hearing as the air insinuating into the auditory passage can freely pass into the inner parts of the ear and put them in motion but then by this immediate contact the just mentioned tender and sensible inner parts are blunted and rendered unfit for farther regular sensations  the cavity of the drum and the labyrinth are indeed as consisting of bones of a more durable substance than all the parts of the ear hitherto mentioned sometimes however subject to several untoward accidents whereby the hearing may be injured or depraved for as they are covered with a very tender and extremely sensible periosteum which may be affected with inflammation and imposthume and thereby be either destroyed or so indurated that no communicated vibrations of the air can any longer put them in due motion or also as these cavities are sometimes so choked up with purulent matter as to become unfit for propagating the vibratory motions of the air or that at length there sometimes ensues from the imposthumation of the periosteum a caries of the bones themselves which may entirely destroy the whole of this curious piece of mechanism and unfit it for its destination  in the last place before i touch on the defects of the auditory nerve i must farther mention the tuba eustachii which some reckon among the parts of the external ear but which i refer to the internal because the bony part of this passage lies between the temporal bone and the os multiforme besides the entire passage lies concealed in the cavity of the mouth and running from the cavity of the drum to the palate and terminating behind the tonsils with an aperture in the mouth is partly bony partly cartilaginous and partly membranous and internally lined with a fine membrane full of mucose glands this passage i say serves principally to renew or shift the air which is lodged in the inner cavities of the ear in order to prevent its entire loss of elasticity by a too long confinement there when this passage therefore is either obstructed or entirely destroyed the air contained in the ear will be unfit for the reception and propagation of that determinate degree of vibratory motion which is necessary for the act of hearing the obstruction of this passage often arises from a critical and catarrhous accumulation of mucus from an incrassation and induration of this accumulated mucus from the swelling of the mucose glands from membranous and fibrous excrescences which upon the erosion of the inner membrane of this passage sometimes happen particularly by a venereal taint and from numberless other causes the erosion in this case happens in the same manner as was mentioned in the erosion of the membranes of the bones of the ear  the auditory nerve is the last but yet a principal part of the internal ear and the alone copula or tie by which this peculiar organ of sensation is connected with the common sensory whence also its due and regular disposition is absolutely necessary in order to communicate to the soul by means of this sense its proper perceptions and sensations this communication or intercourse of motion is interrupted when the subtle fluid called the nervous juice by physiological writers is obstructed in its regular motion and passage through these nerves and their principal branches most pathologists reckon principally among the causes of this interrupted passage the obstruction of the nerve but as from physiological principles it does not appear how this extraordinary subtle fluid should be incrassated or the fibers of the nerves drawn together or contracted the obstruction in this case must be the same as when in the nutricious vessels and within the involucra or sheaths of this nerve accumulated indurated or even extravasated juices from lacerated vessels being collected compress the nervous fibers the principal defect which in these nerves can possibly interrupt the motion of the nervous juice is secondly their compression which may arise either at their origin or near the common sensory or in their entire length either internally or externally by accumulated or even extravasated blood or other juices of the adjacent parts as also in the ear itself from a caries or exostosis of its bones which last has often been observed particularly in venereal cases  besides these defects of the auditory nerve hitherto mentioned we are principally to attend to the seat of this disorder and to its greater or less distance from the common sensory for when deafness arises from compression or even erosion of the nerve spread over the labyrinth there still remains a resource to supply this defect in another and that an ingenious manner and even to produce such sensations as are otherwise communicated to the soul by the organ of hearing but if the origin of the nerve namely that part thereof which lies nearest the common sensory in the brain is injured it is not in the power of art to restore the sense of hearing yet by all this i would not on any account deny but that dumb persons of this class might by the eye by a long careful and attentive observation of the different motions of the mouth in the act of speaking be brought at last to understand the thoughts of those about them as in ammans method of which hereafter  chap ii an account of the attempts formerly made for the relief of the deaf how various soever the causes of deafness and difficulty of hearing hitherto mentioned may be many have for a long time past especially more latterly been employed in the quest and discovery of the means of removing some way or other or at least of diminishing this calamity the many essays for this purpose made by physicians and inquirers into nature may be very properly divided into two classes to the first i refer that method according to which a person either naturally deaf or become so by some accident may by means of the other senses without the intervention of the organs of hearing or any part of them be enabled to have those perceptions which others obtain by the sense of hearing the second class on the contrary comprises those methods in which the auditory nerve itself is put in motion and thus the very sensation produced in the soul which we usually call hearing this method again is twofold one in which the vibratory motion of sound is propagated to the auditory nerve by means of the ordinary but in other respects faulty parts of the organ of hearing by the intervention of some other bodies and by a variety of ingenious devices the other method on the contrary conveys sound in like manner to the auditory nerve and thus produces the sensation of hearing not only by means of the ordinary channels and organs but also by means of the adjoining firm parts of the head  several physicians and other learned persons have been at great pains on the discovery and improvement of the first method in order by the other senses particularly the sight without the intervention of the auditory organs to produce in the soul the perceptions peculiar to the ear but most of these attempts have only occasionally and incidentally proved of any benefit to the hearing as most of them have in all their attempts made it their principal view to enable the deaf person to speak though indeed the frequent and attentive observation of the motions of the mouth and other parts which concur to form articulate sounds may give such a degree of readiness to those wretched persons as to enable them to understand and distinguish with extraordinary quickness all the motions of a speaker and thus also clearly to comprehend all that is spoken nature herself has formed most persons uncommonly docile in this respect though otherwise not endued with the brightest parts experience very day almost shows that deaf persons may observe by the mouth that which others speak and their uncommon and great attention is the reason that they have the misfortune to be generally taken by the common people for very arch and roguish  but this very natural device namely by means of the nicest observation of the motions of the mouth in the act of speaking employed in order to hear and by imitating the very same motions also to speak may be reduced to several rules limited and determined by the genius of every language spoken and thereby the learning them made much easier this is that device in which for a century and a half back many learned men have employed their thoughts among whom peter pontius paul bonnetus dr wallis holder sibscota franciscus mercurius van helmont but above all others john conrad amman have most of all distinguished themselves it would carry me too far and be inconsistent with my present design were i to recite here all the attempts made by these learned men to this purpose and their success therein suffice it therefore to give a short account of the latest attempt in that way namely that of dr amman and at the same time to point out its principal defect but as to the others briefly only to mention their writings or other accounts we have of them peter pontius a spanish benedictine who lived toward the close of the sixteenth century made the first essay in this way and taught deaf persons both to write and to speak his method which he did not himself describe was afterward improved by paul bonnetus a mastergunner of the king of arragon and explained in a particular writing entitled reduccion de las letras y art para ensenar hablar los mudos i e the resolution of the letters with the art of enabling dumb persons to speak madrid    0 in  to dr john wallis who after both the former applied himself to improve this art gave a description thereof both in his tractatus grammaticophysicus de loquela and in his letter to the honorable mr boil de surdis mutisque informandis the former tract is also prefixed to his grammatica linguae anglicanae published in      and was afterward often published with dr ammans writing but the latter we have in the philosophical transactions no    as also in the ephemerides acad not curiosor dec   ann   in append p    and seqq about the same time dr holder subdean of the kings chapel published in      in  vo a book called elements of speech etc together with the art of teaching deaf and dumb persons to speak in the year immediately following namely    0 george sibsesta published also at london the following book namely deaf and dumb mans discourse or concerning those who are born deaf and dumb to which he subjoined a treatise de ratione loquelae creaturarum animatarum lastly the younger van helmont attempted to explain more distinctly the natural formation of the letters of the alphabet for the benefit of the deaf and dumb but the has confined himself to the hebrew language and given his rules in his alphabetum natural hebraicum which has been several times reprinted i have seen an abstract of it under the following title francisci mercurii ab helmont alphabeti vere naturalis brevissima delineatio quae simul methodum suppeditat juxta quam qui surdi nati sunt six informari possunt ut non alios solum loquentes intelligant sed et ipsi ad sermonis usum perveniant ann      in   mo cum fig  but above all others john conrad amman a physician of amsterdam distinguished himself more toward the end of the last century by his ingenious method of teaching the deaf and dumb to speak and after having happily succeeded in his method not only on a deaf and dumb girl at harlem but also on his own daughter and on several others he published in      at amsterdam his tract of surdus loquens in  vo wherein he laid open the whole of his method which being afterward published in english by daniel foot and highly approved by the learned he gave a new and more enlarged edition of it at amsterdam in   00 in  vo under this title dissertatio de loquela qua non solum vox humana et loquendi artificium ex originibus suis eruuntur sed et traduntur media quibus ii qui ab incunabulis surdi et muti fuerunt loquelam adipisci quique difficulter loquuntur vitia sua emendare possint and afterward there came out several editions thereof a proof of the good reception it met with from the public on this foundation william kerger established his method in his epistle de surdomutorum cura published in the appendix to the ephemerid acad not curiosor cent i and ii p     seqq accommodating his instructions to the german language together with a succinct account of his predecessors in the same method of treatment  the whole of this method rests on that well known physiological principle incontestably confirmed by daily experience namely that we communicate our thoughts to each other by means of articulate sounds formed by the organs of speech which we call language and by a daily practice we insensibly learn to form with every conception a certain articulate found the simple articulate sounds are generally four and twenty and in several languages fewer called letters of the alphabet which when combined according to certain rules and pronounced at once like a single articulate sound are called syllables and a farther combination forms that which we call words but all these articulate sounds in order to their production require at the same time a certain visible alteration and motion in the organs of speech namely the lips teeth tongue cheeks larynx etc for instance all sounds articulated by a bare aperture of the mouth in different degrees are called vowels and all others formed by means of the other parts are mutes or consonants and indeed the accurate attention to and careful imitation of all the particular motions requisite to the articulation of sounds constitute the whole of ammans method  as in this or in any other method of the same kind the organs of hearing contribute nothing to the effect it may indeed be employed in all the defects and imperfections of the auditory organs by which either deafness or a difficulty of hearing is produced this method however is subject to several considerable imperfections which render it greatly inferior to some of the following methods by which the auditory nerve itself is at the same time made to be affected in the first place let us suppose a case and which actually happens as appears from the history of diseases namely that such a persom is born deaf dumb and blind no one certainly though more dexterous than amman himself could by that method impart the conceptions which in other respects arise from the sense of hearing but then it may be alleged that if he cannot see he may feel at least i grant that he may learn to speak in that manner but then for one in this condition to lay his hands on the mouth and throat of the speaker would appeal clumsy and awkward not to mention that in forming sounds several motions are performed with the tongue the teeth the cheeks the gums etc mostly observable by the eye but not properly to be felt without interrupting the speaker at the same time  the second imperfection in this method consists principally in confining the conceptions imparted barely to language all those ravishing sensations which in other respects the sense of hearing is susceptible of are here quite lost nor can the thrilling motions of the organs of speech instantaneously lost in each other when raised with that rapidity in the expressions of the deeper passions as to strike and surprise the hearers be once distinguished by much less yield that melting sensation to a person so wretched much less could a skilful musician throw him into those soft and calm raptures when under his hands the strings in harmony truly divine thrill the hearer with unspeakable delight thirdly and lastly take a person of little or no natural abilities and attempt to teach him in this manner i am fully persuaded that all the pains taken with him would be quite lost not amman himself with all his art and practical skill could hope to succeed in a case of such indocility  i now proceed to the second order of the attempts made to restore hearing to the deaf by putting the auditory nerve itself in motion thereby producing the sensation of hearing i have already shown above that this order may be properly divided into two sorts to the first belong the methods of propagating sound in a due degree of motion by the ordinary though faulty organs of hearing quite to the auditory nerve to this we may justly refer all those contrivances which either by peculiar instruments or other means or devices raise or heighten the motions and repercusions of the air in the channels and cavities of the ear when those parts are so faulty as not to be put into the proper vibratory motions by the ordinary action of sound and in this case it is always requisite that the auditory channel be open  when the auditory channel is thus open or the other parts of the inner ear connected therewith are susceptible of some though a very faint degree of vibratory motion and only require a greater action of the insinuating air than is necessary in a natural state there hence arises a difficulty of hearing and not a perfect degree of deafness now as among the several methods of propagating sound by means of the parts mentioned to the auditory nerve in natural order they are only of service in difficulty of hearing but not in the case of perfect deafness i shall therefore mention only in brief some of the means of this species of method and one of the best known and which nature herself for the most part points out is to apply the hand bent and hollow to the ear and thereby not only to convey a greater quantity of vibrating air to the auditory channel but likewise to raise or heighten its repercussions with this view also such persons generally set the mouth wide open when they want to hear more accurately that the air reflected from the palate may be forced through the tuba eustachii into the cavity of the drum and thereby render more intense the vibration of the air but then we are to suppose this last mentioned channel to have no obstruction  and this very heightening the action of sound is procured by means of peculiar instruments of this sort are acoustic trumpets or horns instruments commonly well known and which require no particular notice to be taken of them here somewhat less known is the ingenious acoustic drum of father sebastian truchel a carmelite monk which in      he presented to the royal academy of sciences at paris and which had their approbation this drum consists of goldbeaters skin which is originally ox gut this skin is stretched either on a round or an oval hoop as is commonly done in drums so that when fastened to the ear it forms with the natural membrane of the drum of the ear a perfect drum the artificial skin exhibiting the part which is struck upon the ear itself again and the auditory channel the kettle or hollow cavity of the drum and the natural membrane of the drum of the ear the undermost skin of the drum the artificial skin had befides over it a raised cover in shape of a box whose aperture was turned to the mouth of the speaker a person hard of hearing in both ears may by means of a semicircle of brass or silver which goes round the hinder part of the head under the hair or peruke fasten two such drums to his ears  we are now at length come to the other method of the second class or order comprising those means which convey found and thereby restore actual hearing by extraordinary ways and not by means of the natural auditory channel to the auditory nerve but before i explain the peculiar methods under this head i must here borrow three prepositions as principles from natural philosophy and anatomy as they properly afford a natural foundation and reason for all the methods that are now to follow and to all the remarks that may occasionally offer as we proceed in the first place sound is propagated by bodies elastic and susceptible of a vibratory motion secondly propagation of sound is interrupted by softer interposing parts unsusceptible of any or of but faint vibrations thirdly the bones of the skull in which the auditory nerves are lodged form with the upper maxillary bone one continued hard and elastic body uninterrupted in their connection by any softer parts and hence extremely well adapted for the propagation of found  as i have adduced these prepositions principally with the view that the attentive reader may have them constantly in his eye either in passing a judgment on or in explaining the several methods which indeed produce the sense of hearing by means of the auditory nerve but not by the natural auditory channel to which class also my own method which i am now about to explain does belong so i shall at present first historically relate the several imperfect attempts of this kind and then secondly describe my own method in all its circumstances and in the whole of the manner of procedure thirdly and lastly explain it in its physical and physiological principles and at the same time determine the particular case in which it is absolutely inapplicable  we have extant experiments of a long standing the first careful attention to which is generally at least by father kircher in his musurgia universalis p ii p     ascribed to the celebrated neapolitan john baptista porta namely that we can for instance hear the sound of a ringing fork when striking its forepart or prongs on another hard body we hold its handle to the teeth the very same thing is observable in a pair of tongs a steel wire a swordblade etc when struck in the same manner and applied to the teeth moreover that we distinctly hear all the tones or notes of a musical instrument when played upon on taking it in the teeth or touching it with a wire swordblade etc held in the same manner travelers who happen to stray in the night upon laying the head especially the hinder part close to the earth may hear distinctly at the distance of a german mile or more people going riding or traveling in this manner some of the inhabitants of halle could on the neighboring eminences hear all the cannon fired in the glorious battle of rosbach in as distinct and plain a manner as if at no great distance from the action though at that time full four german miles off conrad victor scheider so celebrated for his description of the mucose glands of the nose in his book de ossibus temporum published at wittemburg in      in  vo p    relates the same thing of some peasants who sticking their staves in the earth held one end in their teeth to wave other instances at present  all these experiments succeed as well if not better with deaf persons than with those that have their hearing as those last upon stopping their ears feel a tingling and whizzing from the included air which the former are without the proof of this i refer to the experience of all deaf persons who will make the trial for cases where deafness cannot be relieved by this method and which i shall mention toward the conclusion are very rare nay the practice of setting the mouth wide open in difficulty of hearing in order more distinctly to hear is in some measure reducible hither though in explaining this observation i must differ from very great physicians who would account for this manner of hearing solely from the air insinuated into the tuba eustachii which i shall more fully treat below  that the methods of hearing but just mentioned without the use of the ordinary organs of hearing has been confirmed by the repeated observations of physicians and inquirers into nature i shall briefly illustrate from some credible histories which may at the same time clear up and show the different application of the method i am now upon boerhaave a man whose testimony is every where unexceptionable tells us in his praelectiones academicae in proprias institutiones medicas t iv p     according to hallers edition of a deaf musician who laying hold with his teeth in the upper parts of his lute at the tuning pegs played in a manner perfectly just and according to all the rules of art without the least mistake or blunder like instances we have in ingrassias in his commentarii in galeni librum de ossibus schelhamer in his book de auditu and in du verney in his treatise on hearing  du verney just now mentioned as also de lanis in his magist nature and artis p     and others have farther observed that deaf persons have been enabled to hear extremely well if in speaking one should direct the sound over and against the head a curious instance of this we find in the ephemerides academ not curiosor decur i ann i observe xxxv which is the more remarkable as the principal circumstance therein lies buried in the rubbish of trifling quack medicines emanuel ramiresius de cariour a spaniard is the inventor of this method of whom petrus a castro physician to one of the dukes of mantua learned it and to whom we owe the account the whole of it consisted in the following particulars in the first place the patient according as his constitution might require was to use a proper laxative and then once or twice a somewhat stronger purgative after which the head was to be shaved at the coronal suture for a handsbreadth and often rubbed especially morning and evening with the following salve take three ounces of the best brandy two drams of purified saltpetre one ounce of oil of bitter almonds set the whole to boil gently till all the brandy is evaporated then pour to it an ounce of orange water aqua naphae stir it with a spatula till it turns of the consistence of a thin salve lastly early every morning the patient must clean perfectly well his head and eyes and clear his ears and nose rinse his mouth and chew some mastich or other fragrant substance and then do his hair back with an ivory comb this done the speaker is to direct his voice just over the shaven part and the deaf person comes to hear perfectly and distinctly every word that is spoken and thus the deaf learn not only to hear but to speak the reason of all this will appear below  but as the methed of ramiresius is attended with many inconveniences and as it must be very troublesome not only to the patient on account of such antecedent preparation but to the speaker also the following methods of producing this sense by means of some elastic body held to the teeth claim by much the preference of this the experiments adduced above are sufficient proofs but the following account taken from the breslaw collection essay    p   0 is still a fuller proof a man at copenhagen had by distemper lost his hearing to such a degree as not to have the least sense of firing of cannon the beating ever so many drums nor of any other the most violent motions at last he accidentally fell on a method by which he could perfectly well understand any speaker and write down all that he said and this he did by means of a stick of wood of a moderate length one end of which he held to or took in his teeth resting the other end against the place where the speaker stood and thus at church he could understand the preacher and write down the sermon upon seating himself just under the pulpit with his face toward it and one end of the stick while the other was between his teeth resting against the foot of the pulpit  about ten years since john paul baumer a young physician of franconia undertook to improve this method and in a writing which we shall presently mention he pretended he himself had devised the whole of the method explaining it from the nature of the sense of hearing and from the different manner of propagating sounds but now and then something escapes him which bewrays that he was not altogether unacquainted with that which others had attempted before him in that way he published his method in an inaugural disputation at erfurt in      under the following title prodromus methodi surdos a nativitate faclendi audientes and loquentes the whole consists in taking a stick made of an elastic body or glass steel copper bellmetal silver etc flat and broad at both ends to prevent its touching the lips and being thus made fit for the due propagation of sound one end of this stick the deaf person takes between his teeth and the speaker the other with this precaution however that neither of them shall touch the stick with the tongue or lips in this manner the deaf person hears every word that is uttered  in order the more fully to establish the utility of this method the author gives an instance in his second remark   of a young woman of twentyfour who learned to hear in this manner though with an old rusty piece of a swordblade about two feet long for upon pronouncing only a few words she with a smile and pointing to her head intimated that she perceived every word that was said and directly attempted to imitate them but as there are many defects in this method as namely that the stick must not be touched either with the lips or the tongue in which case all the lingual and labial letters as b d f l m etc must be uttered indistinctly to obviate which the author indeed has    and    of his disputation proposed another method by using an acoustic tube and a speaking trumpet if the first the deaf person must take it in his teeth and the speaker must pronounce at the wide end of the tube which purpose a common funnel will answer as well but if a speaking trumpet the deaf person must open his mouth very wide while the speaker who pronounces through it holds its upper broad part close to the teeth of the deaf person yet without touching them  chap iii an account of the best and easiest method to make deaf persons hear to conclude all the methods hitherto metioned under this second class are rendered far more commodious more perfect and of far more general utility by considering a peculiar instance of an ingenious deaf person who gave the greatest attention to every incident that offered to his observation and this method i shall now propose at full length as the easiest and best to enable deaf persons to hear i am not indeed the first who published the account and an explanation of it as an unknown author under the initial letters c f w has already described it in the harlem journal for the year      p     seqq but as both his historical part is erroneous and imperfect and the explanation of its circumstances and the observations made thereon are groundless and false i had the whole matter more fully and more justly described a year and an half since in an academical disputation defended under my presidentship with the following title dissertatio sistens novae methodi surdos reddendi audientes physicas and medicas rations but as such dissertations seldom come into the hands of any but of physicians i shall here first relate the history of this deaf person in all its circumstances together with the manner in which he recovered his hearing then secondly give a rational explanation grounded on physical sical and medical principles of all the incidental circumstances observable therein  a reputable merchant of wesel in the duchy of cleves a venerable hoary old man of seventyeight had as early as his twentieth year a great difficulty of hearing which as far as he could recollect was occasioned either by a violent fall or by a profuse bleeding at the nose the most promising means against this disorder proved ineffectual it rather growing upon him from year to year till at last he became quite deaf unable to understand a single word without bawling loud in his ears both german and dutch physicians who were consulted on this occasion could not with all their art and skill afford any relief at length after an accurate examination of the external organs of hearing the case was deemed incurable however he procured a variety of acoustic tubes from amsterdam in order to afford some relief to those who wanted to speak with him but their use was afterward laid aside as being attended either with much inconvenience or as never procuring any distinct degree of hearing  afterward marrying and having two of his eldest children a son and a daughter taught to play on the spinnet he often came up to it and eagerly wished to hear the music as the musicmaster once happened to say that it was very possible for him to hear if according to an old and well known experiment he held a thin stick or a tobaccopipe with the one end on the bridge of the soundboard and with the other to the upper teeth this he instantly tried and was greatly pleased that he could both plainly distinguish each note and as he thought much stronger than formerly at his best hearing but all this was ineffectual to make him understand persons speaking till an accidental trial procured him also this happiness  in the year      he had the good fortune to light by mere accident on a peculiar method by which any person at the distance of twenty or even thirty paces may without greatly straining his voice speak to be understood this happened as follows as one time this deaf person had all his family about him and was pleasing himself with his daughters playing by means of his tobaccopipe his brother who happened to be present alleged that as he could plainly distinguish the sounds or notes of the spinnet he might also in the same manner understand the articulate sounds of a speaker for this purpose his brother took a speakingtrumpet and holding the narrow part or mouthpiece to the upper teeth of the deaf person he uttered a few words at the upper or wider part thereof this trial however proved unsuccessful the deaf man not being sensible of the least articulate sound but he himself directly fell upon a device which proved more successful the brother was to hold the rim of the wide end of the speakingtrumpet to his upper teeth and he himself to do the like with the lower end or mouthpiece upon which his brother had scarce uttered a couple of words but he directly repeated them with the greatest joy and also assured him that he understood them more distinctly than if he had bawled them in the loudest manner in his ear  the deaf man did not stop here in order to be convinced whether the success was not owing to the structure of the speakingtrumpet or whether the same thing might not succeed with other bodies he directly tried in the same manner his tobaccopipe and a little wooden stick and to his great joy found it not only possible but that the speaker might even speak as low as he pleased so the voice were only audible the curiosity of this man and his friends did not rest here they wanted to know at what distance one might converse with him for this purpose they took thin sticks or slips of wood of different lengths and one in particular six feet long an inch broad and of the thickenss of the back of a knife at wesel and in the country round about they call such sticks flooringslips or laths which they use in filling up the openings of the boards of the flooring when starting asunder and such slips are the more commodious as being thin they the less hinder the pronunciation and as in other respects they produce the same effect in propagating sound and even by means of a bundle of them tied together the lowest sound is distinctly audible when the bystanders can scarce perceive any  the farther trials and observations which were made in the use of this method have been confirmed by the following experiments in the first place upon bawling in the loudest manner in the mouth of the deaf person through a large tin funnel without touching the teeth or even without the funnel not a single word was understood secondly if the slip of wood be held too fast with the finger or laid hold on with shut lips the voice proves very indistinct but thirdly if held with the teeth the sensation is extremely weak fourthly if the slip be held to the under teeth there is not the least sense of hearing whereas fifthly the voice is perceptible and distinct upon bringing in using the slip the tongue to the palate or to the teeth sixthly the voice is less perceptible on joining the teeth together than on their standing asunder seventhly though the mouth be full of water the hearing is not in the least diminished eighthly when a brass or iron wire is held to the teeth the deaf person hears nothing at all but held between the teeth a little ninthly the deaf person may hear very well on holding by the lower rim a beerglass to the upper teeth or if with the mouth shut he presses it somewhat hard just under the nose and another person directs his voice up the glass close to it all which answers not with a wineglass tenthly and lastly the speaker must have good sound teeth without any loose ones at least in the upper jaw as then the voice is very indistinct  as the explanation of all the methods hitherto treated and the observations occasionally offering thereon are founded on the three physical and medical propositions advanced above all that is necessary here is to make a closer application of them to the present case and from the consequences thence drawn give a sufficient proof of the commodiousness and utility of the last method proposed to procure hearing to the deaf and thus in the first place i shall briefly handle the propagation of sound so far as is necessary to my present purpose secondly mention those parts of the body which either obstruct or promote this propagation thirdly deduce from their several causes the peculiar observations made in the foregoing paragraph fourthly and lastly determine briefly those cases in which the application of this method does not take place  inquirers into nature show that the propagation of sound depends principally on elastic bodies that is such whose parts resist the actionof another body upon them and which when thereby altered in situation restore themselves to their former state from a force not arising from their gravity but peculiar to them for sound is nothing other but the tremulous or vibratory motion arising from elasticity of the minutest airparticles whereby a peculiar sensation is produced in the auditory organs now as this vibratory motion and the sound produced thereby are solely owing to the elasticity of bodies we may thence fairly infer that all elastic bodies are sonorous for instance glass bellmetal copper silver steel etc but in order to one bodys acting upon another they must come either into mediate or immediate contact with each other for action at distance actio in distans is both by physical and metaphysical principles a nonentity a mere fancy now as daily experience shows that sound takes its rise at a distance from the ear and thus only mediately namely by another intervening body puts in motion the auditory organs it follows hence that the body producing this mediate effect must be elastic as the propagation of sound is not possible by means of any other body  the elastic body which commonly propagates sound is the air but it is possessed of this virtue from no other quality but from that of its elasticity consequently all elastic bodies without exception answer this purpose so that they only affect the organs of hearing or are continuous with them of this we have undoubted proof from wellknown experiments besides the instances adduced above it is a thing we may daily observe in musical instruments the tremor or vibration imparted to the string of a spinnet or violin and the like instruments is propagated from it to the bridge and thence again to the soundboard and in the instance we are now upon from the bridge of the spinnet to the tobaccopipe and thence farther on till it reaches and puts into a similar motion the organs of hearing and the parts themselves of our body are adapted for this propagation for instance hang a little bell cymbal pair of tongs etc by means of a metal wire or gutstring on the finger and with that finger stop the ear and strike upon or move any of these bodies and the sound is perfectly well perceived or take a watch by the chain between the teeth and stop the ears close and you will very distinctly hear it go  as in these cases the sound is propagated from the mouth to the ear though the air which is put in motion is no ways connected with the external ear in that case it must be that the parts of the head lying between the mouth and the organ of hearing are the means of propagation but as it is well known from physical grounds that soft parts susceptible of little or no degree of vibration are not only in themselves incapable of propagating sound but even obstruct or at least diminish its farther propagation when happening to interrupt the connection of the hard and elastic parts the hard and elastic parts therefore of the body uninterrupted in their close connection or continuity by the intervention of softer parts are alone fittest for this purpose  i shall now briefly mention as i promised above all these hard parts of the head with their several connections with each other from all which their capacity or incapacity to propagate sound will be more easily and certainly determined and shall begin with the under parts where according to the experiments above mentioned the communication and propagation of sound took its rise and thus shall proceed to the upper parts and first the teeth offer to consideration which are parts extremely hard and firm and by an articulation called gomphosis wedged or fixed immoveably in their cavities or sockets in both the jawbones so as not to drop out even in a skeleton in the second place follows the under jaw bone both whose apophyses condyloideae are obliquely inserted in the fovea glenoides of the temporal bone and move over the oblique eminence of the same bone by means of the cartilago interarticularis thirdly the upper maxillary bones come to be considered whose hinder and inner part is immediately connected with the apophyses pterygoides of the os sphenoides but the forepart firmly connected with the palatine to the ossa palati and with the zygomatic processes to the os zygomaticum then fourthly follows the just mentioned os jugale or zygomaticum which by a peculiar process is closely connected backwards with the temporal bone fifthly the palatine bones are connected with the os cuneiforme by the pterygoidal processes sixthly the os cuneiforme lies in the middle between the said bones and forms as it were the common copula or tie of these and of the temporal bones seeing it is connected forwards with the palatine bones by the pterygoid processes and by the temporal processes called by some the greater wing of the os cuneiforme with the os squamosum and petrosum of the temporal bone hence seventhly it appears that the temporal bone is immediately connected with the os jugale and cuneiforme and mediately with the palatine bones and both the maxillary bones and with the teeth yet so as that the connection with the inferior maxillary is interrupted by an interposing cartilage eighthly the connection of the temporal with the other bones of the cranium as the ossa frontis sincipitis and occipitis is either mediate by means of the os cuneiforme or immediate by means of the sutures which last in more advanced years entirely disappear ninthly and lastly to this head we refer the tuba eustachii a canal partly bony partly cartilaginous and partly membranous and closely connected with the temporal bone  from this connection of bones we may plainly see that sound is propagated by such of them as are continuous and closely connected together and are as much as may be either bare and naked or only covered with thinly expanded soft parts of this kind are principally the upper teeth then the upper maxillary bone also all the bones of the cranium when stripped of their hair and their other softer parts are a little stretched either by the hand or some astringent and this is the foundation of ramiresius method very easily explicable from that which we have just said on the contrary where there is neither no perfect and continuous connection of bones with each other particularly with the temporal which contains the internal ear or where too many softer parts lie round or between the bones the propagation of vibratory motion and consequently of sound is according to physical principles impossible on this account neither the under maxillary bone nor the tuba eustachii can properly propagate sound of the last we are moreover to observe that being membranous from the pterygoid processes to its opening into the mouth and partly also lax and on that account exhibiting a somewhat collapsed passage the vibrating air cap neither be conveyed in sufficient quantity to the cavity of the drum nor produce in it the due vibratory motion  as sound may be propagated by all elastic bodies in close connection or contact with each other so in this case may be of service all thin slips of wood spanish reeds swordblades tobaccopipes etc when pressed to the abovementioned hard and elastic parts of the head which stand connected with the temporal bones now as among all the elastic bodies just mentioned the fibers of wood are remarkably tough and flexible and on account of their loose and open texture give no great resistance to vibratory motions but rather afford them greater scope so thin slips of wood or slender spanish reeds are best adapted for the purposes of propagating sound to the elastic parts of the head and to the organs of hearing  from the principles hitherto advanced may be explained all those experiments which were made on occasion of actually employing this method and briefly recited above the first experiment either with the large funnel or with barely speaking into the mouth of the deaf person in order to produce the sense of hearing miscarried in the execution for as in this case the air alone is to communicate to the teeth and other elastic parts connected with them a vibratory motion it is in general unfit for this purpose as it comes greatly rarefied from the mouth of the speaker and consequently greatly diminished in activity and elasticity besides from the property common to all forced fluids as soon as it has escaped the mouth of the speaker it expands every way and thereby becomes still more weakened in its efficacy and consequently cannot in that case overcome the resistance of the teeth and other elastic parts of the mouth of a deaf person nor put them into vibratory motion sufficient to produce the sense of hearing  the second third and sixth experiments in which the voice proved too weak and imperceptible to the deaf man when the slips of wood were held too fast with the singers or shut lips and teeth as also when held to the shut teeth may be explained in the same manner from the foregoing propositions it is evident that the softer parts of our body interrupt the progress of sound receiving indeed the vibratory motion but for want of the requisite reaction not propagating it far enough and for this there is also another reason namely that in the three former methods of applying the slip of wood the same degree of force must put in motion a far greater quantity of the vibratory air than can happen in different and opposite circumstances whence of necessity a less effect must ensue now as in the third and sixth experiments a greater share of vibration is lost in the under jaw bone the sensation thereof must of course be extremely weak and indistinct  and this farther explains the fourth experiment by which the deaf person perceived not the least sound on holding the slip to the under teeth to explain this observation there can be no difficulty when we recollect the connection of the under jaw bone with the temporal the under jaw bone having its connection with the rest of the bones of the head only by means of soft interposing parts namely a soft cartilage which besides on account of the constant moistness of those parts is lower receiving indeed the vibratory motion but directly again losing it and as it were deadening it in its softer substance for want of the requisite reaction how is it possible then to expect any alteration in the other bones of the head from the vibratory motion of this bone  the fifth experiment on the contrary is somewhat more difficult to explain for as here the tongue a softer part is brought to the palate and teeth and yet that which another utters remains distinct and perceptible to the deaf person it should seem that this experiment contradicts the second third and sixth  but here we are to consider that in the first place the tongue is applied behind the teeth  dly that all soft parts as fully appears from physics receive not such a quantity of vibratory motion as do hard bodies whence it is as the teeth are as it were wedged in the upper maxillary bone being a hard part the greatest share of vibration will go to the jaw and only a smaller share thereof to the tongue but if you slip the tongue forwards over the teeth the same thing happens as in lips together either no sound at all or but very indistinctly being perceivable by the deaf person  the seventh observation namely that the hearing is not diminished though the mouth be full of water is easily accounted for as we learn from philosophy that there is much elastic air in water adapted for the propagation of sound as sufficiently appears from the example of diverse who under water perceive the sound produced above water now as water perfectly increases the continuity of the parts in the mouth and propagates the vibrations produced by sound from the teeth to the maxillary bones and the pterygoid processes of the os cuneiforme we may from the connection of these parts with the temporal bones easily judge that the sensation of sound is rather heightened than diminished by the water in the mouth  in order to explain the eighth experiment which was made with a brass or iron wire two things in particular are to be remarked first that such metal strings or wires are a great deal firmer than wood and consequently require a greater degree of force in order to vibrate than is possible to be produced by the air in speaking secondly that their base of contact with the teeth is by much too small for them to communicate a sufficient degree of motion to the whole range of bones reaching quite to the ear and this is the very reason that by laying hold on it with the teeth the points of contact being increased the deaf person comes to have some degree of sensation  the happy effects produced with the beerglass and the unsuccessful attempts with the wineglass which was the ninth experiment seem to depend either on the greater compass of the former or on some degree of compression produced in the air spoken into it which thereby communicates its vibratory motions and repercussions to the elastic glass and by that means to the teeth and upper jawbone though the lips interpose or lie between as they acquire a greater degree of closeness in their texture and greater susceptibility to propagate sound by the greater degree of pression made on them with the rim of the glass whereas a less portion of air goes into the wineglass besides its compass is smaller and the greater mass of foot or stalk diminishes the motion of the air so as to prevent its communicating to the teeth a sufficient pitch of vibration and lastly the reason why according to the tenth observation or experiment the loose teeth of the upper jaw rendered speaking indistinct to the deaf person is easily understood when we reflect that in order to propagate a vibratory motion a closer continuity of elastic parts is requisite  as the sensation which is perceived in the act of hearing produced by the methods of the second order of the second class seems to be formed almost in the middle of the brain backwards at the medulla oblongata we may hence according to anatomical grounds judge that the vibrations produced by sound put the auditory nerves in sensation from the os petrosum quite to their origin and hence arises this practical proposition that the easy method we have been hitherto upon to procure hearing to the deaf is adapted to all persons afflicted with deafness be the other auditory organs injured how they may provided the auditory nerves are not obstructed injured or quite destroyed at their origin for this last is the only case in which the present method is not applicable and on such melancholy objects all labor and pains are lost  finis
