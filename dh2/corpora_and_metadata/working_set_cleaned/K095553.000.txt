of lincoln my lord the fair authress of the following sheets being dead and the publication of them falling into my hands i could not think of any patron under whose protection they might with that advantage i desired venture into the public so properly as your lordships for where better could heroic love and all the patriot virtues find a surer and more auspicious refuge than under that noblemans protection whose distinguished honor and good sense has rendered him so eminently capable of the former and whose steadfast zeal for his countrys service in the most dubious and difficult of times has been so conspicuous to all that know any thing of our public affairs as that of your lordship yes my lord that heroic firmness and resolution you discovered then in your conduct has made you the peculiar darling of all true britons of all lovers of the best of kings and constitutions resolution and uncorruptible faith are not the common growth of this age which makes every consideration yield to the poor an mean prospects of immediate and personal advantages either in wealth or in power and dignities and few very few have been found whom neither the malice and ungenerous persecution of potent and disappointed enemies could break nor all the gilded baits of power riches flattery pleasure and the other cunning arts of insinuating into the minds of the young and uncautious in which vile arts those were no small proficients who had then the public management of affairs could corrupt or give the least shock to on whose wiles though many were deceived by them your lordship supported by a perfect integrity and just understanding looked down and despised  it is such a public spirit such an understanding that qualifies a nobleman to be worthy of the addresses of the muses for whoever loves his country must be pleased to see arts flourish which add to its glory and its felicity since that country can only be estemd truly happy and great where arts as well as arms find public encouragement and of all arts poetry is perhaps the chief which deserves the peculiar care of the great and the polite  if we may decide this by what we find in history it is plain that wherever heroic fortitude and martial glory have found a distinguishing success there poetry has met with the greatest indulgence  athens which polished mankind by her poets was able by her single valor under the conduct of miltiades with ten thousand men to defeat some hundreds of thousands of persians rome in her greatest glory and most established fortune became a rival of greece in that noble art while virgil horace varius tucca and many more found themselves the peculiar favorites of the ablest statesman and most illustrious emperor that nation ever knew  it would be no difficult matter my lord to carry on the proof of this in a less eminent degree through the several kingdoms that arose out of the ruins of the roman empire even from italy to hungary but that would be a work of too large an extent for the narrow compass of an epistle by hinting his here i only aim at stirring up if possible a generous ambition in our great men of distinguishing themselves in a manner so worthy of power and dignity  i have known a nobleman who i know not by what means got a popularity for his generosity who yet could only justly pretend to an injudicious profusion for he has given a piper three hundred guineas when a man of learning found but a very mean gratuity for a most valuable performance but several have indeed been bountiful to fiddlers and the thrilling throng while we have found very few sidneys and sackviles since we have pretended to politeness and yet the many excellent products of poetry with little or no encouragement are a proof that it is the natural growth of the clime and with a tolerable cultivation might arrive at the greatest perfection  the following sheets my lord are of this kind that is they are allowed by the learned to be a useful sort of poetry though without the advantageous harmony of verse for as all poetry is an imitation as aristotle justly observes it is plain that all fables are imitations of actions which is the essence of both the dramatic and epic poesy  but this prosaic poetry is of as ancient a date as the milesian tales which so charmed antiquity it self the moderns since the time of heliodorus have often varied their form some years ago they swelled them into large volumes but of late the general taste runs for such as are comprised in a much narrower compass from whence we derive so many books of tales which have not yet failed of success these that follow in my opinion fall not in the least short of the most excellent that have yet appeared there being a pathetic tenderness that runs quite through them supported by a noble and heroic fortitude  the preface will show your lordship that their foundation is laid on true history and the lady has so artfully grafted the fiction upon it that the whole bears the pleasing appearance of truth and reality  if they contribute to the diversion of any hour of your lordships more elegant leisure i have my aim my ambition to give this public testimony of my esteem and value for your lordships singular virtues would not suffer me to lose the first opportunity of doing it unable to delay my zeal till i had something more solid to offer though perhaps in justice it is not the most unmeritorious endeavor to contribute to our diversion and i hope it will be thus favorably received by your lordship from  my lord your lordships most humble and most obedient servant charles gildon  the preface i here present the reader with some few of those many transactions which made up the lives of two of the most potent monarchs of the milesian race in that ancient kingdom of ireland and although i have clothed it with the dress and title of a novel yet so far i dare speak in my own behalf that i have erred as little from the truth of the history as any perhaps who have undertaken any thing of this nature  what i have added is only the love and amorous discourses of murchoe and dooneflaith whose name i have presumed upon since in the chronicles and writings of all those which i have read who have treated on that subject make no mention of the name of maolseachelvins daughter though none af them hardly but take notice of the story and finding in dr ketriuss manuscript that of dooneflaith to be in use at that time and if i mistake not to be the name of her mother i therefore was the more willing to imagine i should not err so much from truth as if i had given her a feigned one to give that to her daughter  some upon what grounds i know not would needs have their manner and way of making love which i have brought as near as i could to our modern phrase to be too passionate and elegant for the irish and contrary to the humors they allege of so rude and illiterate a people when all the while they do not consider that although they may seem so now in the circumstances they lie under having born the heavy yoke of bondage for so many years and have been cowed down in their spirits yet that once ireland was esteemed one of the principal nations in europe for piety and learning having formerly been so holy that it was termed the island of saints and for learning so eminent as all their chronicles make out and some others who were not of that nation as bede in his hist anglic lib   cap        and lib   cap    bid and camden brittan p   0 edit land in fol anno   0  camden do avouch for them  it was so famous for breeding that many from the adjacent islands and most parts of the continent of europe came thither for it  insomuch as p walsh says in his prospect of ireland that when any were wanting from their own country it came to be a proverb he is gone to ireland to be bred  and another in the life of sulgenus has this distich  exemplo patrum commotus amori legendi ivit ad hibernos sophia mirabile daros and we find in their chronicles that there were four great universities in ireland viz ardmagh cashell dundaleathghlass and lismore besides many other colleges of less note elsewhere and as keting in his manuscript has it in the reign of couchuvair macdonochoe that there were no less that  000 scholars at one time in one of those universities viz ardmagh and that they were the irish in those days who gave a beginning abroad as some writers say to the schools of oxford but it is most certain they did to those of paris and pavia and many other great colleges of learning in foregn parts  and both camden and edmund spenser in his view of ireland page    do acknowledge that our ancestors in great britain learned the very form and manner of framing their character for writing from ireland  from what has been said though not a tenth part of what might be on this very account i hoped i might have liberty to dress their words in as becoming a phrase as my weak capacity could frame or the time that i did it in would allow  as for the other part of the story it is all historical and treads only the path of the true chronicle if we may give credit to my authors who are bid camden heylin spenser hanmor campion dr keting sir james ware flahertus and p walsh i have i must confess omitted several remarkable passages and twenty four of the twenty five battles which bryan boraimh fought in his reign and won but yet i have not foisted in any thing that might be injurious to the truth in their places and have only made a compendium of things as though done in four or five years time which perhaps were transacting half so many score  i have constrained my self contrary to the custom of most who write these sort of essays to make my lovers die unmarried since i could find no authority to the contrary and i should indeed have been very willing to have embraced the opportunity could i have found any color for it of making them after so many misfortunes to have ended their trouble in the married bed  lastly since my design in the beginning was to show the strange means by which ireland was once delivered from the tyranny of turgesius and the danes by the beauty of a virgin i thought it might not be impertinent to the story to make the same maid though in a more virtuous way be the instrument of saving it a second time by infusing of courage into her lover who well suppose for her sake did things that day which almost surpass all belief though at the same time she had little or no part it may be in the victory this license i presumed might lawfully be granted in a novel  irish tales lasting and terrible were the bloody wars which the ancient irish sustained against the powerful danes who by their vast numbers and continual supplies of fresh men who recruited them daily and were weekly landing at one port or other came to their aid they being then masters of the sea so harassed and tired the long defending islanders that at last they were forced to submit and their provincial kings become for some small space of time tributaries to the dane  turgesius the danish captain general being a soldier of invincible courage and no less ambitious made himself be styled monarch of ireland and with a splendid and magnificent train of hardy and resolute warriors whom peace and idleness the seeds of wickedness and the mildew of virtue had rusted into courtiers kept his court in the center of the country at loughribh near that place where now stands the town of athlone  he was a man so skilled and trained up in arms and martial fatigues that had he only followed the business he professed his conquests and victories might have been an everlasting theme for ages to come and had not his lust like a canker eaten away the inscriptions his sword had engraven his victorious memory might to this day have been the enduring song of fame  turgesius having subdued the best part of the people of this nation nay indeed we may say all but a few who knew not how to bow their necks in subjection to any but a lawful prince or stoop to any thing beneath their free liberties and obedience to their own kings had betaken themselves to boggs woods mountains rocks and inaccessible places whose wisdom and conduct being backed with an inimitable valor in a few weeks wrought out their own infranchizements and broke the servile bonds in which their fellow irish were enslaved notwithstanding the mighty care and circumspection turgesius used to the contrary for there was not a hole or a corner much less a town or a city in the whole realm that was capable of it in which he had not planted a garrison made as he thought secure by impregnable fortifications  all things being ordered in this manner he began to partake of the pleasures of peace which his long toil and indefatigable labors had newly established those cruel wars which had opened the veins of this distempered sick kingdom had not yet drained one drop of his ill blood which corrupting for want of usual exercise made him degenerate from the noble science of war to practice that of love and giving way to his unruly passion became in a short time wholly conquered by the fair eyes of dooneflaith the daughter of maolseachelvin king of mead  this lady was one on whom nature had lavishly bestowed all the graces and ornaments which could be to make humanity adorable she was so nobly endowed and so incomparably beautiful that to see her and not admire her was impossible yet was she capable of all the soft sentiments love could imprint and had already devoted her heart to a man to whom without blame she might warrantably do being prince murchoe eldest son to bryan boriamh who was afterward elected king of all ireland  this prince matchless in his gallant exploits was not less to be paralelled in his love it is enough to tell you he saw the beautiful dooneflaith and consequently lost his heart in the sight but so much awe did her virtue create in him that for some time he languishd in the torments of his flame without daring to utter one word of his love and all the while the charming dooneflaith was subject to the same malady  thus for a time did these two secret lovers live in hopes that fortune would at some time or other be propitious to their amors and although they were so enamored of each other yet dared not either of them show the least sign of their passion for now turgesius made it his business to win the heart of this lady and maolseachelvin himself was not the last who discerned it nor could he any way forbid his address knowing how dangerous a thing it might prove to stand in competition with so mighty and powerful a king murchoe was not insensible of it and to his inexpressible grief was forced in silence to bewail his misfortunes and see all the joy of his soul caressed and adored by another what lamentations and moans would he make when alone and what grief would possess him when he feared that his charming dooneflaith might in time consent to the love of the tyrant he became so melancholy and troubled that the whole court could not but take notice of it and notwithstanding he used all endeavors to stifle his flame yet he could not so closely conceal it but turgesius for no eyes are sharper than those of the jealous perceived it and under pretense that he suspected him to be ill inclined to his government banished him the province which was a far greater punishment to the young prince than had he instantly doomed him to die  dooneflaith was soon made acquainted with the misfortune of murchoe in which she took such part that she had much ado to refrain falling in a swoon before the king and was forced to feign an excuse to get from his sight she went slenderly accompanied having but two maids who kept at a distance into a garden at the farther end of which was a grove whose melancholy shades seemed fittest for her condition and in which obscurity she might have free liberty thinking no body by to vent her complaints while her women who seeing her sit down on a bank retired to an arbor hard by  it was not without much trouble and many endeavors that she could find utterance for her words her sighs and sobs still hindering her speech but at length having by large streams of tears which ran down her cheeks almost drained the channels of her eyes she began to give ease to her heart which without vent must have certainly burst  oh unfortunate and miserable dooneflaith says she whither will thou fly for ease since murchoe the peace of thy soul is banished thy sight and whose presence was the only stay of my life what avails life or eyes to me now that dear objects gone surely this tyrant who usurps our throne has found i love the prince and his jealous fears have drove him from the court that he might also usurp a place in my heart oh murchoe murchoe could thou but know my soul oh that my sighs could reach thy distant ears and make thee sensible of what i suffer for thee while she was thus complaining to her self ere she was aware turgesius approached her and found her in tears just at the same time as murchoe who behind an adjoining hedge had overheard all she had said was going to throw himself at her feet but seeing turgesius arrive he lay still as much pleased with what he had learnt from dooneflaiths own mouth as troubled and afflicted at the coming of so potent a rival who hindered him from making known to his mistress the sense that he had of her goodness and the absolute power she had gained over his heart  dooneflaith was greatly surpised to see one so near her whom she so much feared and had cause to hate she would have risen and left the place to the king but was prevented by his taking her by the hand and throwing himself down by her she not yet well awakened from the lulling cogitations of her dear murchoe her beautiful face all covered with blushes was forced to sit down by turgesius who casting a look which signified how much he was concerned for her trouble desired her to tell him the cause of it adding if it lay in his power to give her redress she had no more to do but command him  dooneflaith at the present was at a loss what answer to make him till after several demands she spoke in this manner  my lord said she you urge me to do that which i fear when performed will displease you it is not but that i know the honor you are pleased to confer on our family in vouchsafeing to cast your affections on me who so little deserve them nor is it but that i have confidence enough in your kingly word that makes me thus scrupulous but so it is unless with an oath you confirm that you will grant my request i shall still keep the cause of my grief to my self turgesius was strangely perplexed in his mind to see one whom he thought he might have commanded make capitulations with him and so much to distrust the word of a monarch that no less than an oath would serve to confirm her he told her that had she not gotten an absolute sway over his heart he would never have condescended to a thing the most powerful prince should never have gained from him in short he swore to her by heaven and all his pagan gods that whatever she demanded if it lay in his power should be granted upon condition that she would allow him to love her and give him leave to hope that in time his passion might be rewarded  my lord replied she you pretend to grant my request and tell me my power is absolute and yet you confine me to that which perhaps of all things in the world is opposite to my quiet as for your loving me it lies not in my power to hinder and as for your hopes that your passion may be rewarded is a thing i can willingly suffer so that you will not by your power and authority urge me to marry you against my consent and withall that you would recall the unhappy murchoe whom i know you have banished only for my sake turgesius after a small pause answered her madam said he although your father should command you to marry me nay though my life and my future eternal happiness only depended upon it yet will i allow you your own liberty nor ever wed you unless you freely consent to it but as for murchoes repeal it would indeed show in me too much love but too little discretion for i know well madam says he going on the princes thoughts are too aspiring and that so long as he lives in the province i must expect neither peace in my throne nor my love for i have more sufficient proofs than bare report that he rivals me both in your heart and my crown how much cause have i therefore to to hate him especially now since you are so much interested for him i shall but take into my bosom a snake that when warmed again with my favor will sting me to the heart and with his venom rankle all my peace and tranquillity however to show you that i pretend not to your love by that power the heavens have put into my hands i freely consent that he stay still at home nay even here in our court and i shall admit him to use all his art and make his addresses to you so that i likewise may be heard in my turn  turgesius remained some time silent in expectation of her answer but the blessing his words had poured on her heart was too mighty for her tongue nor knew she how to return him the thanks which were due for so noble an offer without betraying too much of her love but at last overcoming the conflict in her soul she uttered these words  most renowned conqueror your generosity and goodness have so far wrought on my heart that i fear there is nothing in honor you can demand that i shall have the ability to deny you and since it has pleased you to leave all to my choice i make a farther reference of it to heaven who i humbly implore to direct all my actions and since so freely you have told me your mind i will be as liberal of mine and here solemnly protest that murchoe has never so much as opened his mouth or made known to me by any means whatsoever the things which you lay to his charge turgesius was pleased at these words and took his leave of her with a promise immediately to recall murchoe whom he told her he believed was not departed from court it being yet within the limits of the time appointed for his banishment dooneflaith returned him such an answer as the nobleness of the deed did require she told him he had now took the right course to succeed in his love but no sooner was he parted from her but she began to accuse her own heart for what she had done and although it was only what her love for murchoe had urged her to yet she could not but lightly condemn the way that she had taken to gain his repeal she was too sensible there was no room in her breast for any but murchoe and that turgesius with all his endeavors could never supplant the esteem she had for him and withal vowed in her heart that if once murchoe should mention his love to give him such an answer as should not displease him  turgesius had no sooner left her but at a small distance he espies dooneflaiths two women who at present he knew not and his curiosity pressing him to see who they were that were most melodiously singing to an harp which they had brought with them into the garden music being the chief thing that did of late allay the melancholy humor of their lady he therefore retired under the covert of an hedge that was by and had but just laid himself down to give attention to the song but he espied murchoe with his sword in his hand turgesius called to his guards thinking he had some design on his person but murchoe dissipated those fears by throwing himself and his sword at the conquerors feet without so much as speaking one word  turgesius who was now in a greater surprise to see his most mortal enemy as he thought him in so suppliant a posture and not doubting but that murchoe had had some private conference with his mistress was inflamed with such jealousy that with a fierce and angry tone he pronounced aloud these words which dooneflaith plainly could hear  ha villain says he to murchoe what rash and inconsiderate thing art thou whom heaven has so far deserted that thou settst thy life at no higher a rate than thus to presume to approach one whom so justly thou have made thy enemy and thus dare to infringe those fatal orders i have given and thus by intrenching on the liberty i have allowed thee for thy two days stay to make preparation for thy banishment and take the privilege to interrupt the solitude of her whom my heart adores and thereby pull down thy sudden undoing murchoe heard these threats with a soul all inflamed with revenge but fearing the prejudice of his mistress who now he began to hope held not his life indifferent stifled at present his resentment and though at any other time he had a mortal detestation of flattery yet now he thought it most expedient for the working his interest with the divine dooneflaith answered him thus  most puissant yet haughty turgesius that title of villain you gave me i renounce and had you been ten times my conqueror would retort it back to thy face had i not by accident and not willingly heard how generously you intend to proceed it is not this miserable life i fear to lose nor is it that heaven has so far deserted me that makes me bow at your feet nor is this posture i am now in so suppliant as it is thankful i bow thus low to turgesius not that i fear the worst he can do but to return him my thanks for the freedom he gives me in once more seeing dooneflaith and for the liberty he has granted to permit me to make my humble addresses to her now witness for me all ye powers above my life my honor nay what is more my very soul i set at naught when she ever stands in competition i must confess and it is the first time i ever taught my tongue to say it i love i love the fair the charming virtuous and all divine dooneflaith but to my everlasting torment i love without expectance of return no were my hopes as great and high as sinners new absolved i should despair since i have you for my rival what power have i dejected banished i when such a resistless conqueror puts in his claim a crown a crown turgesius i fear will dazzle her fair eyes so glittering will the mighty glory shine that she will look on no less light enough murchoe says turgesius and as i conquered thee in arms i will conquer in my love henceforward i will lay by my crown that shall be no title to gain her nay more thus far i promise thee that i will never demand her for my wife nor seek her for my bed on such a price love only shall be current coin and that i will lavish to acquire my ends take then your sword take my forgiveness thy own liberty and if thou can take dooneflaith i will condescend so low to call thee rival now and since unurgd thou ownest thou love her thou will have punishment enough for all thy crimes to see her circled by her own consent within these arms by this time the guards were come up and turgesius in the sight of them and dooneflaith who also was come up when he called to his guards took murchoe from the ground and in the presence of them all pronounced his pardon and the freedom he allowed him to make his addresses to dooneflaith  dooneflaith was so taken with his generous proceeding that she could not withold from giving him a thousand praises which made him imagine he had no small interest in her heart already and were as so many stabs in the breast of murchoe who now began to think that her pleading for his repeal was only out of fear that in his absence he might raise new forces and so once more bring turgesiuss life into hazard after a walk or two in the garden turgesius making murchoe take one of dooneflaiths fair hands while he held the other they went in all together and now the whole court was talking of nothing but the aspiring love of murchoe and the noble condescension of turgesius  moalseachelvin was at that instant with brian boraimh murchoes father in consultation how they should shake off the tyrannous yoke of this usurper when this last adventure came to their ears moalseachelvin from thence gathered some hopes of accomplishing his ends but brian inwardly accused his son of disloyalty to his country who when he had the tyrant alone at his mercy preferred the love of maolseachelvins daughter before that of his honor and his enthralled kingdom wherefore they both parted at that time without coming to any result  the next day turgesius made his addresses to dooneflaith but found his reception colder than he imagined wherefore sending for her father he discovered his mind to him and contrary to his promise and oath to dooneflaith commanded him to use his utmost endeavors to reduce his daughter to accept his love  murchoe taking the advantage of turgesiuss permission went also to dooneflaith where he freely opened his mind and discovered to her all that he had heard from her the day before in the garden she saw it was now no time any longer to hide her affections and to the unspeakable joy of murchoe confessed that he had won so much on her heart that would their parents consent she was willing to accept him for her husband this was not so privately done but a spy whom turgesius had secretly placed there to that purpose made him acquainted with all that had passed which raised such confusion in his soul that he knew not how to be revenged on murchoe nor what punishment to inflict on dooneflaith but after many tormenting cogitations was resolved himself to be a private spectator and if that he found what he feared and was told him to be true to end murchoes life with his own hand  wherefore in a day or two after seeing dooneflaith was inexorable to all his entreaties he seemed to give over his suit and now murchoe had the greater liberty of prosecuting his amors he had endured all the reproaches that an incensed father could make him and had in vain solicited for his consent and although he found his mistress and also her father no ways averse but rather desiring the match yet to his affliction and sorrow he could see no probability of his happiness since his own father stood so much against it no prayers nor entreaties could move him and he had charged him no more to visit dooneflaith upon that account  murchoe who had yet never known what disobedience to his father was and had never broke the least of his commands now saw himself in a miserable condition either he must loose the love of his father or that of his mistress both equally destructive to him he resolves at last to follow his duty in hopes that in time his love thereby would prove more happy he failed not however to pay her his visits though with a countenance less assured than before and she could not but observe the great alteration that was wrought in his heart his words bore not those soft and sweet accents they were wont nor did he put that joy on his face as formerly he had she could not see so mighty a change but asked to be informed of the cause which with disjointed words and heavy sighs he at length told her  o madam says he with his eyes flowing over with tears how unhappy is the wretched murchoe since even the heavens conspire to his misery and but that i have reason to hope that i am not altogether indifferent to you i should not thus pine and waste to my grave but boldly at once leap over the battlements of life and seek for a death the nearest way dooneflaith hearing him talk of death took him by the hand and with a thousand soft charms in her eyes though half drowned in tears said to him o my lord can any thing make your life so burdensome that you would quit it so long as i love you can you thing of wounding a heart wherein i have an interest for so nearly allied are all your sufferings to my self that not one drop falls from your eyes but my heart answers with the like of blood say then my murchoe what has befallen has turgesius given you cause of jealousy or do you think because i allow of his visits which heaven knows is not in my power to prevent or i would that i ever can consent to his love no no murchoe not all the diadems in the world not all the monarchs on earth shall put you from my heart there you and none but you shall reign but play not the tyrant there and by turgesiuss example take delight to spoil and ransack what i so freely give  here her sighs broke off her speech and raised our lover from the ecstasies her tender words had cast him into  dry up oh my souls dear treasure says he these precious drops the moiety of which would largely expiate the sins of all mankind i know thou love me and am prouder in that title than were i monarch of the universe but my dearest charming dooneflaith thy love alone but makes me miserable since i must only see there is an heaven but never be admitted to it my  oh dooneflaith my cruel father has commanded me to love no more no more to talk and spend my happy hours in thy blessed company no more to sit and gaze on that dear face no more to change soft looks and prattle with our eyes the secrets of our hearts no more now must i wish for night that in my dreams my dooneflaith may delight me nor waking in the morning rise to make me blessed in my visits to you turgesius is all merciful and good his heart more soft and pliant than my fathers or were it not with this sword i would  here turgesius came from the place in which he had overheard all and was so transported with his rage that had not dooneflaith interposed murchoe ever he could have turned in his own defense had been laid as a sacrifice to his anger dead at his feet nor had he the patience so much was he blinded with passion to stay till he had called his guards but entered alone unarmed all but his sword  murchoe was so lost in his sorrow that till he heard dooneflaith shriek out he saw him not enter and was ready to save turgesius the pains and have died of himself when he saw his mistress hold his rival in her arms then falling on her knees still holding by his robe and profusely showring down floods of tears to save her lovers life o turgesius my lord my king and conqueror spare o mighty monarch spare my murchoes life and in exchange i will give you this of mine kill not a man the gods themselves would mourn to lose one whom their utmost skill can never parallel  turgesius by this time repented him of his entering alone knowing by that rashness that he hazzarded a life his love and a crown against a man most stout and much beneath him wherefore going to retreat he was prevented by murchoe who by this time had got between him and the door and stood ready with his sword in his hand to hinder his passage is this says he to him according to your kingly word do you esteem your vows and oaths so little then heaven refuse me when i beg its mercy if i let slip this opportunity no faithless tyrant now i meet thee single come from thy buckler there and meet me fairly now show thy valor and preserve thy life by taking mine for all the powers above have joined consent that one of us must fall  turgesius could no longer listen to his threats but disengaging himself from dooneflaith he cried out good gods if insolence like this to me who am thy king shall scape without its just reward and go away unpunished let every schoolboy whip me with a rod and may the women brand me with the hated name of coward die traitor goes he on making a stroke at him since one of us must fall take a death too glorious for so base a villain from thy monarchs hands  here they both engaged in fight but dooneflaith fearing the loss of her loved murchoe catches hold of turgesiuss arms by which means she gave murchoe opportunity to get within him and disarm him now sir says murchoe but that i scorn so poor and base revenge and would not use the advantage given me by a woman i would ease the kingdom of its thraldom and free my self from a perfidious rival it is she alone that virtuous lovely lady whose presence charms my hand from giving thee that death which thou deservest o madam says he turning to dooneflaith how inglorious have you made my name that had you given me leave might have resounded through the world and born the title of its countries saver ireland should then have had its native liberty again and i perhaps been chose their king proud only in that glory to lay my crown beneath your feet  turgesius with a dauntless front told him how much he was indebted to dooneflaith who had not only repealed his banishment but had now given him the advantage over him he told him withal how base and mean insulting was and bid him since he was in his power to use him as he pleased but charged him still to be mindful how he got the victory so much he boasted of murchoe could no longer endure the thoughts of making use of the advantage given him against a single man threw turgesius his sword and bid him use it once more but dooneflaith ran to him and with tears in her eyes besought him to desist but nothing could prevail and had not some of the courtiers and guards who by this time were come to the place hearing the clashing of swords prevented by disarming the valiant murchoe turgesius had a second time fallen under his mercy for just as they had seized on him turgesiuss sword broke short to his hand  it was not without many commands that turgesius himself could hinder the enraged soldiers from taking murchoes life and cutting him to pieces even before his mistresses eyes who now pleaded in his behalf so persuasively that she obtained of the monarch his liberty of life with condition that he forthwith left the kingdom murchoe after what he had done was glad at present on any conditions to get from the malice of the enraged danes wherefore without so much as taking his leave of dooneflaith he fled from the court but not being willing to leave his native soil by which he knew he should utterly be deprived of all means of serving his mistress whose absence now ran more in his mind than all his other misfortunes his life became in two or three days so cumbersom to him that he was resolved either to lose it or free it together with all ireland of the tyrannous burden it bore to which end he posts to armagh whereof turgesius was quickly informed and at four several times in one month caused fire to be set to that city to drive him from thence nor did he spare either monastery or church that stood in his way lest he should take sanctuary in them he likewise put to death all their priests and placed heathen layabbots in every cloister nor did his fury spare either sex or age whom he thought favored his concealment  the poor afflicted dooneflaith spent all her nights and days in most cruel condolement for the loss of her murchoe nor could all the fair promises or large offers turgesius could make win her to bestow on him even to his own face any other than the title of tyrant in hopes that thereby she might raise his cruelty to that pitch as to give her a death which next to the love of her dear murchoe would now be most welcome unto her  turgesiuss love now became so fierce and unruly in his breast that nothing but the enjoyment of dooneflaith could allay it or give him one moment of ease he resolved in himself nothing should impede his desires wherefore he once more sends to her father maolseachelvin to use his authority with his daughter and make her more pliant to his love or that all who belonged to her should feel the weight of his anger and know how fatal the consequence should be in case she refused and did not come willingly into his arms he had left off his addresses to her after having found her impregnable and waita while for an answer from maolseachelvin  some days passed and the unfortunate dooneflaith began to entertain hopes that the tyrant had quitted his suit and that her ill usage of him had banished his love she had now time enough to bewail her misfortunes and missed not a day in which she went not to the grove in the garden to ease her sorrowful heart by complaints one day among the rest she was got into an arbor where having wearied her self with her grief soft slumbers sealed up her eyes and laid her to sleep and in her dreams she imagined she saw murchoe all bloody come into her room and give her a thousand reproaches of being unfaithful then pulling a sword from under his robe he would have pierced his own breast at the sight whereof dooneflaith started out of her sleep in such an agony that she was not her self in an hour or two after but having well considered twas only a dream and the fancy of her distempered brain she fell to complaining again  oh merciless powers said she how long will you make me the mark of your anger why o relentless heavens are you so cruel oh ease me of my misery or life for what unknown offense do you afflict me thus thus rack and torture one who always to the utmost of her power has been obedient to your holy wills which even now amidst this mass of woe i willingly submit unto all i request is but one farewell sight of him i love next to your selves let him but once more bless my eyes and i shall die contented no sooner had she uttered these words but she saw at the entrance of the arbor one in a womans dress who at first view she knew not but recollecting her self she perceived to be murchoe thanks bounteous heaven said she now my prayers are heard this charitable act has cancelled all your former cruelty welcome my love says she running to take him in her arms but how was she surpised to see him shun her soft embraces and stood gazing on her as though he had never seen her before ah murchoe says the charming maid is it thus you requite all my sufferings can my embraces be thought troublesome or sure i do mistake and this is not my love but some illusion that does wear his face and come to mock my miseries  murchoe was so astonished at his sudden happiness that he could scarcely believe what he heard or saw and dooneflaith was so much altered with her continual pineing and grief that he scarce knew her but his senses assuming their former strength he ran to her and fell at her feet where he vented such a flood of tears and so many sighs that he was not able for some time to utter one word while the passionate dooneflaith fearing he was grown unkind or jealous fell down by him in a trance  murchoe not minding where he was and what hazard he ran of discovering himself and consequently of losing his life called out for help naming himself a thousand times over to have been the unfortunate fatal cause  oh murchoe murchoe said he what have thou done oh i could stab my heart tear all my limbs and gnaw my very flesh for being thus rash cursed be my life and blasted be my hopes which thus have made me take on this disguise o dooneflaith my lovely dear my charming saint look up look up thy murchoe calls more miserable now than are the wretched damned oh ye inhabitants above look down and lend your aid recall the parting life of her whose loss will make this kingdom poor dooneflaith by this time coming to her self again gave him a sign that she lived by a groan o blessed sound said he what music do thou make in my heart such a sad accent coming from my love at any other time would rend my very soul but now since it is the messenger of life it is more melodious than the songs of angels are repeat it once again and bless my ears  ha says dooneflaith where am i what superofficious hand has brought me back to life what more than savage beast could be so cruel to awake me from my long eternal sleep but opening her eyes and seeing murchoe she altered her note and gave heaven a thousand thanks for their kindness and asked him forgiveness for what she had said  he had yet no power to answer nor would his kisses permit her to finish what ever she began and to their mutual content and satisfaction they spent some time in the silent oratory of their eyes where each so feelingly did tell such stories as words could never express murchoe was the first who broke silence and returned her a million of thanks for the interest she had taken in all that he suffered they made a thousand new protestations of loving till death and gave each other firm assurances of future fidelity they were parting with promises to see each other as often as they could when maolseachelvin her father enters taking murchoe not minding his face which he took care to conceal for one of his daughters women let him pass by without the least suspicion  maolseachelvin told dooneflaith that she must prepare for in three days he had promised turgesius to send her unto him accompanied with fifteen other virgins as a victim to allay the fury that her obstinacy and murchoes treachery had raised in his breast he stayed not to receive any answer but went forwards to perfect the walk he intended and to think of the project that was working in his brain  no sooner was he out of sight but the afflicted dooneflaith betook her to the arbor again and throwing her self on a bank she vented her sorrow in this manner oh cruel barbarous father said she and have you at length consented to a separation twixt me and my murchoe to become the wife of turgesius but that i can easily hinder besides he has sworn he will never request it but by my permission which i will sooner grant to furies to hurry me to hell no inhuman parent though you and all the world would grant me his yet if none else will death shall forbid the banes but if forgetful of his oaths he forces me to wed him even in the tyrants sight i will pierce my heart and spurt the reaking stream full in his hated face  murchoe having seen maolseachelvin quit his daughter and observing her to retire back into the arbor followed after her to enquire what her father had said but in what a consternation was he when as he entered he beheld her tearing her lovely hair and imprinting the marks of her rage on her beautiful face and giving such strokes on her tender breast as were enough to force life from its seat murchoe ran to her and put a stop to her hands which surely else had ruined so much beauty as none but she could ever boast of oh unkind dooneflaith said he to her what new afflicton has befallen my love that thus she seeks to spoil the fairest temple beauty ever framed oh murchoe replies the despairing dooneflaith leave me to my self my griefs are catching and with its black contagion will infect thy soul heaven has not yet left pouring down its wrath and what alone was meant for me may fall on you the gods above have marked me out a subject for their utmost cruelties my father  oh i blush to call him so forgetting me forgetting honor and himself has given me over into the tyrants hands but three days time i have allowed to mourn the loss of thee my love and everlasting happiness  how short says murchoe and fading are poor lovers joys for but some moments since i thought my self in heaven and whilst infolded in my dooneflaiths arms i thought no misery could ever approach me then what a fall is here flung down at once from that stupendous height and dashed in pieces in the lowest hell oh maolseachelvin whither is all thy glory fled how can thou condescend to give this gem to one who knows not half the value of it while they were thus condoling their hard fortune and saying all the soft things love could inspire them with moalseachelvin returns and hearing his daughters voice in the arbor entered and found our lovers arm in arm in which posture they had resolved to end their lives together and never part but go hand in hand to death which had not her father entered and snatched the dagger out of murchoes hands had been effected  murchoe seeing maolseachelvin could not forbear discovering himself to him and giving him a thousand reproaches for yielding to the tyrants will maolseachelvin was amazed to find him in company with his daughter and in such a dress but having resolved with himself what to do he thought it but wisdom to conceal it till some fitter season wherefore not minding what murchoe said to him he asked his daughter if she had considered well of what he had told her  most honored sir replied the weeping dooneflaith can i admit such thoughts as those your self nay heaven must curse me if i do what wed a tyrant one whose wicked hands have ransacked all our holy temples demolished all our altars burnt all our churches and razed our monasteries ravished our nuns slain our pious priests and thrown the very sacred host it self to the dogs whose tyranny has murdered our nobles and fired our towns and cities can such an one be thought a match for her whom you with pious care have taught to hate oh rather sir upon my knees i beg it take back this wretched life you once bestowed me no daughter answers maolseachelvin it is not to be his wife for that is a name which blasts the lovers joys he would have you only for his concubine use you a while and then return you back you have taken care he never shall be your husband by the oaths you have made him swear and in revenge he is resolved to have you  his mistress replied dooneflaith hastily oh heavens my father sure is mad his reverend heart oerladen with its fears has banished sense from thence what be the tyrants mistress you cannot sure have such a thought as that you say but this to try my resolution o have some pity on your wretched daughter add not more misery unto my troubled breast already overburdend with my woes maolseachelvin could hardly refrain from tears to see the sad condition his daughter was in however he goes on and laid before her the power of turgesius and that if she did not willingly consent he would have her by force think says he to her how you could endure to see a loving father murdered before your face for that and more he swears to do if you consent not to his love he vows when he has had his will which all the powers above he is resolved shall not hinder he will give your body to the vilest danes and let the meanest soldiers use you as they please then think again how happy thou may live how high and glorious sit on irelands throne if by your love you sooth this mighty monarch  murchoe who all this while stood thunderstruck to hear these impious urgings of her father could no longer forbear uttering his mind with eyes sparkling with anger he stepped up to him and can maolseachelvin says he then become so base can he whom irelands hopes are fixed upon degenerate from his virtuous noble ancestors and from a prince become a bawd unheard of wickedness a pander to his child twill cancel all my former thoughts of virtue and make me think thou never did beget her for surely such a pure untainted stream could never rise from so impure a spring or were you ten times over her father if it were possible she should not now obey i with these hands would sooner give her death my self  no ambitious vainglorious boy answers maolseachelvin it is not in thy power to give her death or save thy life  so calling to two young gentlemen who waited without and whom he had won to his purpose and had promised in all things to follow his directions he commanded them to lay hold on murchoe and then went on now see rash youth says he how fatal it is to play with thunder whose bolt has fallen and crushed thee to the earth i will send thee bound in chains along with her which act will doubly gain turgesiuss heart  dooneflaith seeing them seize on murchoe ran to him and taking hold of his arms would have stopped him but her father loosing her hold she fell upon her knees and with a torrent of tears besought him to save the life of murchoe do with me says she what you please give my unspotted honor to the tyrants lust brand me with infamy but save this noble youth  yes mistress answers her father your honor is unspotted when in your arms i found the lusty lover for thy sake only it is he now shall die o good gods cries out dooneflaith where shall the innocent fly for refuge if you neglect protecting them am i the wretched cause that he must bleed oh heavens i thought it was not in your power to add to what i felt before but now my misery is doubled on me oh dearest father have you quite forgot all pity abandoned all remorse can you suspect me guilty of so foul a crime and let me breath i that till now you always counted good witness ye allknowing powers how guiltless i am of this blasting calumny by all that is holy just and sacred no lustful heat ever warmed my virgin breast bate but that thought and i will forgive the rest then look upon his youth his hopeful noble youth and pity his misfortunes he knows no sin unless virtuous love be such o dearest father i conjure you save his life by all the charms which honor can inspire by my dear mothers soul by all your hopes of irelands future happiness and by the glory you shall win by this good deed release him strait let not me beg in vain you was not used to see me thus in tears upon my knees and yet refuse to grant me my request murchoe seeing maolseachelvin so obdurate to all her entreaties fell likewise on his knees behold said he with tears the humble murchoe suppliant at thy feet who begs not to preserve his life but your dear daughters honor send her away and lay the blame on me i will own twas i who bore her from hisarms then to appease his wrath let me be sent unto him i will willingly endure his utmost rage and count my life well spent to save her virtue  oh no dear honored sir says dooneflaith first send me to his arms where you will only lose a womans life my virtue cannot suffer so long as there are means to stop my breath or when the letcher comes all fired with lust i will cool his veins by letting forth his blood or at the worst i will drown him in my own maolseachelvin could no longer hold out but running first to his daughter then doing the like to murchoe he took them both into his arms and wept a flood upon their necks right virtuous pair said he whom heaven has sent to make me happy in my latter days my loving children both forgive the trial i have made now witness for me all ye blessed above i hold ye equally as dear as life as honor or my precious soul and since i find so well you love each other cursed be that man who would untie this knot now wipe your tears away as i do mine though sprung from different causes yours from your sorrows mine from mighty joy stifle your grief as i conceal my vengeance make thee his mistress  now heaven forgive me if i would not sooner damn than harbor such a thought i for my dear loved daughters honor would set at naught my sweet immortal soul no dooneflaith no genereus murchoe i have so contrived it she shall be sent to him and as he writes to me here showing them the letter willingly has also commanded me to send him fifteen young virgins of our noblest blood to slake the burning lust of his chief officers i will send them too but since so well thy womans dress becomes thee thou shall be one and fourteen youths as bold and valiant as thy self shall go all clad and dressed like thee with each a sword beneath their gowns i have sent to those who have taken shelter in the woods mountains and boggs to be in readiness and have a thousand men who at the signal given shall fall upon his guards letters already i have dispatched to every city in our country to bid them rise on such a night  when you are entered and they all deep in wine frolic and gay their bloods all boiling hot secure each one his officer by death i will trust my daughter with the tyrants fate strike home my girl and dip thy dagger to the hilt then let him take his fill of love caress and court thee then but now we must disperse and you murchoe till after to morrow which is the appointed day shall lie concealed in my house these gentlemen who are my trusty countrymen and well approved friends shall forthwith to the scattered irish and get em to an head then lead them like a torrent on our foes they all swore secrecy and departed only dooneflaith and murchoe were not separated till it was late but went together into her chamber where to their inexpressible satisfaction and mutual joy they supped together and passed away the hours till bedtime then murchoe was conducted into an apartment by himself where he spent that night on the thoughts of the past days adventures and the important affairs they were to perform in a short time after  the next morning maolseachelvin sent a messenger to turgesius promising according to his commands that he had won on his daughter to obey him and that as he hoped for his kingly favor hereafter he would not fail upon the morrow night to send her accompanied with fifteen virgins more who were also willing to run the same fate and participate of the joys their mistress should receive in so splendid an entertainment  turgesius was almost ravished with this news for certainly no man ever loved or rather lusted to the degree he did he was resolved to have lost the whole kingdom but he would enjoy her his eager joy sat heavy on his heart for love is most impatient on crowned heads but finding her come thus easily he spared not for any thing that might make her reception magnificent he sent for fifteen of his chiefest commanders and told them what a treatment he had for them in short the whole court was almost new modeled the rooms adorned with rich beds and the most costly hangings  never was palace so galantly set out with gold jewels and tapestry as this not any thing below the dignity of silver and that curiously wrought and massive was used in any of the chambers cloth of tissue was the meanest furniture they had the candlesticks were gold so that all the wealth those sacrilegious danish heathens had despoiled the churches and monasteries of with all the plunder they had taken at sacking of towns and kings courts were all now brought to this palace so that it might be said that one spot of ground held more wealth than all ireland besides  nor were the wines but of the richest and all the variety of viands which could be procured were sent for to this place and every one was employed in some office or other and the king with his commanders almost mad for the arrival of the happy night their longing impatience thought that almost an age which was only but twenty four hours  the hour at length arrived and dooneflaith set out with a noble train of supposed young virgins whereof fifteen of them were of the most handsome and yet most stout and resolute youths of ireland as well and gloriously dressed as hands jewels and art could effect it each having one or two others to attend him as his servant or waiting woman in the same female apparel and each a short sword under his gown  turgesius went about a mile out of his court to meet them as soon as he had news of their approach accompanied with fifteen of his choicest commanders some whereof he had sent for out of strong cities wherein they commanded who also had with them an equal train of attendants  the first interview of the two parties was such a sight as might have equaled if not exceeded that of alexander when he met thalestris and her amazons upon the banks of the euphrates  it seemed as though mars himself had led the van of all the other gods to meet with venus and the female deities  turgesius and all who followed him quite forgetting their grandeur and martial habitude descended from their shining gilded chariots and went to those of the ladies nor had maolseachelvin spared cost to make his daughters equipage more magnificent and glorious than any that ireland had seen before especially that of the charming dooneflaith which was so richly furnished that at a distance in the glittering sunbeams it was too glorious to be looked upon and struck a sort of blindness in the spectators eyes who beheld it she was drawn by six milk white horses caparisond with trappings of gold an the chariot wherein she rode was open having rich embroidered curtains held up by young cupids who seemed well pleased and smiling at the deity that they attended nor were the others much less sumptuous  in short who ere had been to see the first greeting could not but have been astonished at so noble a sight turgesius as though he had long practiced the art of love so behaved himself that even dooneflaith was moved with compassion at the great action she was to perform however she seemed as eager to reveive his caresses as if she had met with the man whom her soul adored after some few compliments had passed on either side the women having by this time alighted to meet the men they all mounted again the monarch taking dooneflaith into his own chariot and the other commanders following his example did the like with those who came with her  and now being paired they set forward for the court all the way that they rode they were diverted by trumpets and windmusick which in their turns made a seraphick harmony but that which most of all charmed the ears of the warriors were the soft and melting expressions the counterfeit ladies did use which were so ravishing and tender that not one of turgesiuss train but could willingly have wished to have passed by the ceremony of supping and have gone immediately to their chambers even turgesius himself thought the time though spent in his mistresses company but irksom and long so eager was he to have the sweet charmer in his embraces  but supper being ended the description whereof would but delay the recital of things more material they prepared for their beds and dooneflaith was led up by the supposed maidens who came with her to the chamber that was assigned for the monarch he being impatient for the dear happiness his soul so much longed for thought them too tedious in undressing her and putting her to bed being no longer able to defer the happy moment disarmed himself below as all the rest of the commaners did laying their arms on a table in the great hall went each to his chamber expecting the coming of her he had chose but turgesius no sooner entered his room for he came alone than he was seized on and immediately gagged that no outcry might be made they had certainly killed him had not murchoe interceeded who told him he now paid him back a debt that he owed him ever since he was so generous to save his life formerly from the outrage of his soldiers and guards who were ready to have cut him in pieces when he fought with him in dooneflaiths apartment in retaliation of which he would now save his life from the threatening swords of those who justly thirsted for his blood  turgesius was not a little surpised at the unlooked for adventure but above all at the gallant generosity of his noble enemy and incensed rival he would have made him such an answer as suited the greatness of the act had he had the liberty of speaking but now his heart was so troubled at the loss of dooneflaith and all his ravishing hopes were so blasted that life to him was but an unnecessary thing he began though too late to think how dearly he must pay for his lust and how pompous the solemnity had been made for the bringing on his utter destruction  the thoughts of the loss of a crown came crowding upon him and he could not but be sensible what a lasting infamy this action must lay on his blind and inconsiderate credulity how would he in his mind curse the time that he first saw that charming seducer and now beheld her with more detestation and horror than heretofore he had done with love and pleasure  but we must leave him to himself and return to the rest who after the seizing turgesius had no better success than their king unless ending a miserable life might be accounted some mitigation of their misfortunes the signal was presently given out of the court windows to the small army that maolseachelvin had brought to the gates and all those attendants and servants who came with his daughter were in a readiness to give the onset to those in the palace  turgesius and his train no sooner rose from the table but the inferior commanders and officers were set down to it each with one of those under women who came with dooneflaith the bowls of wine were going merrily about and the danes who are potent in bacchuss battles were too busy and the music too loud to let them hear maolseachelvin when with his armed men he forced his way into the palace and they were greatly surpised when they saw a whole band of stout irishmen well armed enter the hall it was now no time to demand what they meant for ever they could scarce turn about to see who they were they met with their fate  a greater confusion was never seen the tables were all overthrown and the blood of the danes with that of the grape promiscuously mingled made a purple deluge on the floor nor was there a dane that night in the court who found not his death except turgesius the tyrant who was reserved for a more ignominious and miserable end  nor had this great undertaking any worse success in the other parts of ireland for those towns and cities whose governors were slain at the feast more bloody than that of the centaurs hearing of the loss of their commanders and their king lost with them their courage and yielded an easy victory to the brave irish who in a short time after released the whole kingdom from the slavish tyranny of the danes to their lawful subjection under a monarch of their own which was by the consent of the nobles placed on maolseachelvin for the gallant exploit he had done for then their monarchs were elective and with good reason the choice fell on him  now the irish had thrown off the danish yoke and were again at liberty each enjoying the benefit of peace which was introduced by a most bloody and furious war nor was there a dane left in the whole country but such who they used as their slaves and put to mean offices and those who were before so busy in demolishing and burning of churches and monasteries were now employed either as smiths carpenters or masons in their rebuilding and the church lands were all restored to their proper uses the layabbots whom the danes had placed there were cast out of the cloisters and slain and the whole kingdom began once more to flourish in christianty and was established in the true worship of god  it is necessary ever we proceed any farther to give a step back and see what became of our lovers and the deposed usurper who some time after his defeat was led about the streets through which so often he had rode in splendour and triumph now manacled and laden with chains and became a scoff and derision to those over whom so lately he triumphed and in this condition with a shouting throng of the vulgar was he conducted to the river laughainme into which he was cast and finished a burthensom life by being their drowned  our two lovers had now as they thought no other obstacle but the consent of bryan boriamhe father to murchoe who they hoped would agree to their marriage the valiant murchoe in that nights great action having shifted his womans apparel put on the more becoming one of arms and flew like lightning to assist his countrymen leaving the care and safeguard of dooneflaith to her father and it was some days ever he returned but to his great misery for now maolseachelvin having the prospect of a crown in his sight and having stomachd bryans denial of their marriage before was firmly resolved that interest should not bring him to consent to it now wherefore going to his daughter and taking her into his closet he commanded her on her duty no longer to think of her lover but when murchoe returned to use him as one who was most indifferent to her  oh dearest sir says dooneflaith can what you say be true can he who saved my honor and redeemed his mourning country be thus hardly used by me he save thy honor and redeem his country replies her father in an angry tone did you your self did i and all the rest of the brave princes of this land do nothing hear what i say and for your life obey me for what i have designed no prayers or charms though dressed in the best garb of eloquence adorned with all the tears and taking looks thy beauty can put on though on thy knees thou followst me about thou shall not shake or move my fixed resolve if when murchoe shall return with eager joys to run into thine arms with frowns and scorns avoid his soft embraces give him no answer but disdainful looks or here i swear i will stab him before thy face oh reverend sir says dooneflaith recall that cruel oath how can you think this heart that is all love all soft and tender to the noble murchoe can teach my face to put on such disguise could i consent to show my filial duty and obey my eyes would soon betray my heart and though my words were cold and all unkind yet they would shoot such fiery darts as would declare they were but counterfeit my very eyes spite of my best efforts would talk and tell the tenders of my soul each interrupting sigh i give will bear no consort with my tongue by heaven says her father do as i command show but one amorous glance one heave one pant or sigh and i will blind those telltale eyes of thine and give thee truly cause to sigh by giving him his death sure sir replies the weeping dooneflaith you cannot mean the thing you speak you say it but to try my love a second time which by the gods is still the same it was when in the garden you made the former test no minion says maolseachelvin i do it not to try thy love which i am too sensible is true i do it to revenge his fathers scorn who would not give consent that he should wed thee when i was a private man nor shall he now i am king therefore once more observe what i command and must the innocent murchoe says she who always dearly loved me and sought not heaven with more earnest prayers than he sought me be punished thus for his unkind fathers fault oh sir reverse your cruel doom if not for his sake yet for mine nay for your own for if i share an interest in your heart twill grieve you sure to see your only daughter die when with one word you may preserve her life what quit my love now after this misery and trouble we have passed through for it now grow unkind when he most merits love and after all those sacred oaths and vows those thousand protestations which even in your hearing i have made to love him ever now to recall that sacred breath and hurl damnation on my perjured soul i ask you not says he to break your vows but meet him as i now command you that his proud father may be humbled and fall a low petitioner for the love he once rejected a thousand blessings sit upon your head says she and make your crown more glorious than all your predecessors were those healing words have cured my bleeding heart now i will call you dear and loving father kneel and adore the very ground you go on use what severity you please against his father but let my murchoe not be put in pain let me not see him rather till his suppliant father begs your pardon for certainly to see him as you bid me will prove so fatal that twill break his heart trifle no more replies maolseachelvin but punctually obey my will i see them yonder entering the court and once more swear if that you fail in any point i have enjoined you you never shall meet him more but in the grave after this he left her and went to his own chamber no sooner was he parted but dooneflaith looking out at the window beheld her dear murchoe with his father just entering the palace and not being able to think on the severe injunctions her father had laid on her without a torrent of tears and a thousand imprecations on her unkind stars o barbarous father said she to her self more tyrannous and cruel to thy child than savage monsters are to those they hate not see my love but with disdainful looks not give him one kind glance for all his love not one kind word of thanks for all his pains this cruelty exceeds all precedent my unkind speech or eyes will do the fatal work and leave no business for my fathers sword o that some angel would instruct my love and tell him that my eyes and tongue are liars that my poor heart bears no consent to what they say tell him i am all over love and that my murchoe is more precious to my soul than all the world besides  murchoe and his father with several of his friends were now come into the outward court of the palace and casting his eyes up to the window he beheld his adorable mistress who no sooner saw him but withdrew from the place which murchoe thought was done to haste to him oh father says he almost extasied look how the treasure of my soul does fly to meet my longing arms now all the blood i have lost in irelands wars will largely be rewarded  bryan took such part in his sons transports that he could hardly forbear shedding tears of joy but murchoe lest he should be outdone in kindness made what have he could into the house and at the end of the hall beheld his fair dooneflaith whom he ran unto with all the speed his love could make oh thou charming soft and lovely maid said the transported murchoe let me upon thy tender breast breath the soft languishments of my over flowing joy but how did he start and look amazed when he not only saw she met him not half way but shunned his arms and after a small pause with gazing eyes he thus went on  what my dooneflaith says he are my embraces loathsome grown what do thou turn away the warming sunshine of thine eyes not one kind look to crown thy murchoes victory not one soft word to bid him welcome home dooneflaith could no longer turn away her head yet was afraid of her father who through a secret place looked into the hall and beheld her with frowns and fearing she should not perform what he bid her her love and she must part for ever cast so disdainful and scornful a look upon murchoe that he clapping his hand to his heart cried out o gods those cruel piercing eyes have stabbed my soul and given me a death my boldest enemies could never do then after a little stop he went up to her and would have taken her by the hand but she refused it him telling him the unkindness of her father had destroyed their loves and that now he had fallen from his promise and had commanded her no more to look on him with amorous eyes in pursuance to whose will she did from thence forward forbid him to visit her  murchoe during her talk stood like one without motion nor had he the power to utter one word till he saw her departing the hall but then running twixt her and the door he fell on his knees and begged her for her former love to hear his latest words but she overcome with the pitiful sight being no longer able to look on one in that woeful condition and one whom contrary to her will she her self had made so returned him no answer but snatching her hand out of his which ever she was aware he had seized without so much as looking back she went out of the hall and left the disconsolate murchoe on his knees  he continued in that posture till she was gone out of sight then rising on his legs again he drew forth his sword and had ended his life on its point had not his father and friends who expected no less stepped in and prevented him oh cruel father say he to bryan this last unkindness outdoes all you you have done to me before why would you have me live when lifes so great a burden were it not better i at once gave up my breath than live in lingering pain and deal it out by sighs o faithless woman says he a little after thou abstract of inconstancy where is now that charming voice which with kind protestations swore murchoe should ever be her souls delight farewell a long and last farewell for with your cold disdain you have blasted all my hopes and now no remedy is left but death  with much ado at last they got him home to his chamber but it was not in their power to get him to eat or take the least refreshment and it was a long time before his father could get him to promise to use no violence on himself to which he would never have consented had not bryan told him he would use all his endeavor to alter maolseachelvins resolutions  no sooner was his father gone out of the room but he commanded all who were with him to do the like and after two or three hasty turns in the chamber he flung himself on his bed where he poured out such tears such sighs and complaints that he drew moisture from the eyes of all who looked in at the keyhole of the door to see what he did but now let us return again to our history  soon after all things were settled in peace the victorious maolseachelvin was as is said before by the election of the princes and nobility of ireland deservedly made king of mead and then monarch of the whole country when there arrived three brothers out of norway viz amelanus cytaracus and ivorus with their families and great trains who in a most amicable and peaceable manner pretending to be merchants obtained leave for the better carrying on their traffic and trade to build three cities near the sea side which was permitted them upon condition that they paid tribute for them articles of agreement being consented too on both sides they fell to work and erected the three cities now called dublin waterford and limrick which they had no sooner finished and had made almost impregnable by strong fortifications but the irish began to see their error and now it was that they felt the power of an enemy no less prejudicial in all appearance than that they had lately subdued  these seaport towns giving entrance to fresh and numerous fleets of norwegians danes and oostmans insomuch that the irish were forced once more to have recourse to their arms and here it was that maolseachelvins heart became mollified and once more gave consent when the kingdom should be freed of its foes that murchoe should marry his daughter  the two lovers had now admittance to see each other and with a bleeding heart the charming dooneflaith made known to her dear murchoe the reason why she used that severity to him at his return from the former battle murchoe loved too well to think any of the fault was on her side and was now the most happy man in the world her father the king made him his general but the occasion was urgent and he was hasted away having scarce time to take his leave  however he had with a thousand soft and passionate speeches already parted with dooneflaith and was now come to maolseachelvin who received him with all the expressions of tenderness that could be go valiant youth says the king to him go and return crowned with laurels of victory revenge the hard usage you have suffered on those barbarous infidels forgive my rashness and believe i now set no difference betwixt thee and my own child no my dear son for so henceforth i will call thee and though your father shun all my advancements i thus will embrace his son go then victorious murchoe head our men my cheerful soldiers long to see their chief they think the time you lose in my embraces an age in their impatience  now mighty monarch says murchoe to him you shower such blessings on my head give me such courage and such hopes that if i conquer not let me hereafter bear the coward brand the power you give me united with the thoughts of my dooneflaith shall make me conqueror where ever i go and sweep your numerous enemies from off the earth after many endearing discourses murchoe took horse and went to the army who wellcomd him with loud shouts of joy and where he found such stout and resolute irishmen that wherever he came he carried victory on his swords point while his father bryan no less fearing the loss of the kingdom again in the southern parts of the country did such things as would almost seem incredible and in a short time was crowned king of munster still conquering where ever he went and soon after subdued one half of the nation nor did he put a stop to his irresistible force till he was publicly elected and made monarch of all ireland the nobility and princes deposing maolseachelvin to make way for bryan giving him leave to live which is the greatest misery that can befall a monarch after the loss of a diadem  bryan now being king of all ireland thought himself sufficiently revenged for the slights which maolseachelvin had put on his son and commanded murchoe to come home to his palace which then he kept at tomond to the unspeakable trouble and affliction of the two lovers who now were taking as they feared their last leaves of each other  oh my adorable saint says the afflicted murchoe to dooneflaith how unfortunate have all my undertakings been how cruel is my fate that now when i thought my happiness beyond the reach of any misfortune i find it dashed by that which i hoped would have been its chief stay now my dooneflaith my miseries come rolling upon me and soon will overwhelm me oh insupportable cruelty i must leave my love leave her good heavens defend i fear for ever but witness gods and all you saints above though absent from my sight i will never forget thee hopes once to bless me with thy sight again shall buoy me up through all my sea of sorrows if my dear love but promise to be constant  dooneflaith could not hear him make such a scruple without showing how much it touched her heart oh cruel murchoe said she do you take part against me and if i will be constant barbarous doubt have you thus long beheld me stand the shock of all misfortunes even when ambition and a monarchs crown would have shook the most firm and constant of our sex and can you make that scruple now if i will be constant oh heaven that if will stab me to the soul you have found the only means next to your hating me that could undo my peace you almost tear my heart up by the roots what doubt an heart like mine that is made up of nothing else but love and constancy but i forgive thee murchoe i know twas but the overflowings of thy tender fear and the excess of a too powerful passion and to confirm my dearest murchoes mind bear witness for me now oh all ye gods and shower upon me all your dreadful vengeance if what i say be not sincere and true when in your absence i forgot my faith either in thought or deed either for threats or all the proffers in the world if from this heart murchoe be ever absent then let the furies tear me limb by limb and dogs and wolves devour my scattered carcass  no more says murchoe i believe my saint and ever shall retain these precious words in the chief records of my memory they were forced soon after this to part but with such languishing and dying looks as if they never should meet again how many times did murchoe go to the door and then return again loath to depart printing his soft lips on her fair hand and she as often wished they might dwell there for ever they sighed and wept then wiped their watery cheeks making exchange of hearts at eithers eyes at last as though both their words had been prompted by one soul they together cried the gods preserve and ever be your comfort  murchoe having taken his leave went directly but most heavily toward his fathers palace in tomond called ceanchoradh where he was welcomed by bryan and the whole court but what were all the welcomes in the world to him since his dooneflaiths voice was wanting in the consort the music was not sweet or charming he wholly bent his thoughts on her and day or night she was the subject of his mind though he was ever accounted devout yet now the welfare and happiness of his afflicted mistress threw him on his knees almost each hour  his father and the whole court could not but greatly wonder at this mighty change he grew pale neglected meat and sleep walked all the day in melancholy places seeking recesses where the hunted beasts scarce dared to enter they were so dark and dismal where with his folded arms across his troubled breast he would vent the griefs which rankled at his heart  into one of these places was it that his father one day followed him and having privately listened to his usual complaints when the poor prince had thrown himself down extended on a rugged rock his eyes like rivers which had broke their banks poured forth a flood of tears with groans and sighs which almost rent the vault  how happy said he to himself had murchoe been had heaven been pleased he should have perished in his countries service his loss perhaps would then have touched his fathers hardened heart he would have then perhaps shed one tear and with a sigh have pittyd his untimely end but now he thinks i breath he thinks i live when as alas these signs i give of life are but the tokens of uneasy death for i am dead to all the world insensible of every thing but love and though i move and sometimes walk about it is but my more substantial ghost  he was going on when bryan interrupted him what murchoe said he is the cause that thus thou spendest thy youthful time in cells thus pine and like a woman drown thy self in tears thus leave the mighty business of the world and bend thy thoughts on a fantastic trifle thus shun thy friends and seek these solitary shades rouse up for shame awake thee from these idle dreams thy father bids thee and a king commands thy bleeding country wants thy aid ambition should methinks inflame thy heart and banish love from that too noble seat make thy self worthy to be my successor what can the sprightly murchoe lie dissolving in tears when all the land is almost drowned in blood think on a crown think of a monarchs power and see how poorly love will show to these or were those out of reach and that thy hopes stood not so fair as now they do think on thy honor and thy future fame  o sacred sir replies the prince can you behold these ruins of your son look on and see him sink in sorrow and not extend a parents hand to help him o sir remember you your self was young loved and adored and knew no happiness but in my mothers sight i do but tread your steps walk in that path which all the world goes once say but dooneflaith shall be mine and you will raise me unto life again without her honor titles power nay even a crown it self have nothing charming in them bryan could no longer hear him sue in vain but told him if he would take arms and show himself once more in the field and according to his wonted custom come home laden with victory he would so much indulge his love that if after this he still continued in that humor he would use his utmost power to make him happy  the prince overjoyed with this promise went home with his father and in a few days after headed a brave army against his countrys enemies victory still followed wheresoeer he fought and his courage and conduct were not a small cause of the renown and glory that accrud to his father for it is remarkable that bryan boraimh defeated the danes and their confederates in twenty five bloody pitched battles he was accounted one of the most puissant and noble monarchs of the milesian race and though he lived not to see these invaders quite expelled the kingdom yet he fought in the last battle that gave them their overthrow having in his life time reduced the kingdom especially toward the latter end of his reign to so tranquil and quiet a state that ireland was become all peaceable and flourishing nor were there to be seen any danes but such who lived quietly under his government and were either merchants handycraftsmen or artificers who had their chief residence in dublin weixford waterford cork or limerick and though they were a considerable number of them yet not so many nor so potent but that he thought should they at any time rebel he could master them at his pleasure  murchoe seeing no comfort accrue to him in all this general joy for he alone was excluded the benefit of tranquillity the whole nation pertook the conquests and honor he won added more trouble to his soul since he could not yet obtain his fathers consent he avoided as much as he could the pleasures of the court and betook himself wholly to the country where in unspeakable torments he wasted his time in complaints but being one day near the house of maolmordh mac murchoe his uncle whose sister by name garmlaigh bryan his father had married he thought to pass some time in a visit to him and was very kindly received  but bryan having an occasion for timber for the finishing some ships he had begun especially some masts he sent to his brotherinlaw maolmordh to furnish him with them to which he consented partly out of fear to deny him and partly for kindred sake he went himself to see them cut down and assisted with his men those who were sent for them in the getting them over a mountain to which they say some difference happening amongst the people he put his hand to himself and in the action broke off the gold clasps that fastened a rich fringed mantle of silk which bryan had sent him at length he with his nephew murchoe came to ceanchoradh  but no sooner did he arrive at tomad and had gone to his sister garmlaighs apartment to give her a visit and acquainted her how he came to break off his clasps which he desired her to get mended again for him but in a rage she threw the whole mantle into the fire and burnt it reproaching him with meanness of spirit in so unworthily subjecting himself and his people of linster whereof he was king to  bryan although he was her own husband  how basely said she becomes it the blood which thou sharest with me to fear the displeasure of any much less one who has made himself my equal by taking me to his wife how much below the honor and dignity of the king of linster is it thus like a bondsman or slave to lend thy assistance and like a coward grant whatever he demands from thee these words though at present he made her no reply sunk deep in his heart so taking his leave of her he went into the presence where he found a nobleman and murchoe playing a game at chess  maolmordh being touched to the quick with the reproof that his sister had given him and no longer able to stifle the sense he had of his fault advised him who was playing with murchoe on some draught which lost his nephew the game  murchoe who had not been used to receive such indignities for it was done in so palpable a manner as he could take it for no less being highly displeased told his uncle maolmordh king of linster in a deriding manner that if the advice he had formerly given to the rebel danes been no worse they had not so easily lost the battle at gleaun mama yet notwithstanding his mighty policy he could not win them the field  maolmordh being stung with this jear in a fury replied however my advice succeeded at that time the next that perhaps i shall give to the danes shall prove better to your cost so in a discontented humor was departing when the prince murchoe told him it should never break one moment of his rest to countermine what ever projects he could design and withal told him he defied him  whereupon the king of linster retired to his chamber and would not although he was sent for by bryan come down to his supper but flinging himself on his bed passed all that night in the extremest anxiety of spirit that could be imagined and early the next morning before any of the court were stirring takes horse and posts away for linster where his heart was so full what with the rebukes his sister had made him and the defiance his nephew had given him that he had no way to ease it but by giving if he could a stint to their insolence by making them to know that they had roused a sleeping lion whose fury and rage should not be allayed by any thing but their utter destruction  the next day he assembles the chief of his nobles and the gentry and represents to them the indignity that had been put upon them in the person of their king and so aggravates the matter that he drew them all to his side and made them all on fire to revenge it by throwing off their allegiance and fidelity to bryan and joining their power to that of the danes and in return to the the challenge that murchoe had made him to send him another  having gained his designs at home he flies with all speed to dublin and there engages the chief of the danes to send away instantly to their master the king of denmark for a strong and powerful supply to pull down the grandeur and haughty pride of bryan and to destroy their and his most mortal enemies which on the word of a king he promised to perform would they be assistant  while messengers were sent over into denmark he returns home again where with all the have he could use and most indefatigable pains he prepares for a war nor was it long ever he goes to dublin again where at his arrival two of the king of denmarks sons  carolus knutus and andreas his brother landed at the head of twelve thousand danes which they had brought along with them whom after he had kindly received and refreshed them well he forthwith knowing delays in such cases would be dangerous and give his enemies too much time to unite by an herald sends bryan a bold defiance daring him to meet him in a spacious field at clantarf within two miles of dublin  bryan had no sooner received this challenge but making what speed he was able joined together all the forces of munster connaught and mead for those of ulster he sent not to them being unwilling to stay till they should come up and believing he had power enough out of those other three provinces to encounter the enemy  the prince murchoe his son was sent to those in mead where he once more got a sight of his charming dooneflaith and whom after the success of the battle he had a promise from bryan his father that he should marry  never did two faithful lovers meet with such joy and dooneflaith even blessed the causers of this war which had made her so happy with the presence of her dear murchoe maolseachelvin though deposed from the monarchy had great interest in the province of mead and soon raised such forces as perchance none else could have done which bryan understanding made him general of that part of the army and sent for his son back to himself  but if the meeting of this amorous pair was so full of joy and content yet their parting was such as is not to be expressed they took their leaves of each other with such unwillingness and regret that their separation seemed to have rent their hearts asunder  murchoe was not altogether so overwhelmed as he had formerly been since his hopes now stood fair in a few days to crown all his sufferings with the enjoyment of his charming dooneflaith but the disconsolate fairone felt such pangs at his taking his leave as gave those who stood by especially her father cause to suspect they were but too fatal omens and he being willing they should have all the liberty the little time he had too see her to say what they pleased privately together he withdrew and left them to themselves  now it was that dooneflaith vented the tenders of her soul in such a manner that murchoe himself could hardly stay with her to hear the complaints which she made of her hard destiny oh murchoe said she you are going to leave me for ever i have something here at my heart that prompts my soul to think murchoe will never return to his dooneflaith again my presaging heart forebodes that the victory which you are going to win will be cause of joy to all ireland but my unfortunate self  murchoe used all arguments that could be thought of to dissipate her fears and told her that his courage guarded by the hopes of her love would make him do things that should fill the trumpet of fame to the end of the world i go my charming dooneflaith says he to set this kingdom in peace that so i with the more freedom may quietly enjoy the blessing the gods would bestow at the end of the conquest and that ireland might be so settled that he no more might have cause to quit her soft arms to follow the wars  go murchoe replied she with such languishing looks and so dying a tone as almost made him alter his firm resolution go and fight for thy country go and conquer go and  i would fain say return again to my arms but  oh something here at my heart will not let me believe the heavens will make me so happy no my murchoe these eyes will never behold thee again and the next embrace thou have will be that cold one of death methinks i see my dearest murchoe all pale and cold stuck through with a thousand darts and arrows his breathless corpse spurting fresh streams of blood when i unhappy i come by who am his murderer no more my charmer says murchoe to her drive these idle thoughts away they are but dreams which will disturb thy rest i shall return i know it by my heart oh that i did said he to himself or say i died i paid but natures debt what you and i and all must do at last my fall shall not be mean and thousands braver men shall bear me company oh dooneflaith what comfort will it be how will it soften death and blunt its sharpest dart to think i die beloved by thee while they were embracing in order to part maolseachelvin came in and told him he must make all have possible with his forces for all the others which they expected were come in but his  the prince as eager as he was to meet his proud challenger and not think of leaving his mistress behind wherefore by her consent and joint entreaty maolseachelvin promised to bring her with him this at last something appeased the sorrow of both and murchoe after a thousand soft kisses and embraces and as many sighs and tears on both sides took horse and posted before to his father and the next day after maolseachelvin followed with his army and at the rear of that the beautiful dooneflaith  in a few days after the armies of the three provinces joined all together and marched in good order to the place appointed being a spacious field near clantarfe called magnealta where they beheld maolmordh at the head of a vast army being sixteen thousand danes together with all the forces he could raise in leinster which was divided into three battalions that of the right wing commanded by carolus knutus that on the left by his brother andreas the two sons of the danish king and the main body maolmordh took care of himself  bryan drew up his army much after the same order committing the right wing thereof to maolseachelvin the left he commanded himself and at the entreaty of his son murchoe that he might oppose maolmordh himself who had given him a challenge the main body was under his conduct  early next morning it being good friday both armies drew near and after a short time the fatal signal was given on both sides never did two armies encounter more fiercely the shouts and cries with the thundering noise of the drums and sound of trumpets were enough to rend the very roof of heaven nor for half the day could it be decided upon which side hovering victory would light and had maolseachelvin who headed the army of mead came up they had soon turned the scale but he remembering the affront of bryan who made him be deposed to make way for himself as soon as the signal was given stood off with his men and was only a spectator of the most bloody and terrible fight that ever was acted on the tragic theater of irish ground nay though at one time he saw his own countrymen begin to give way and the danes in a probability of winning the day yet did he stand unmoved  bryan who headed the left wing of the army being old for he was now above fourscore and eight having to do with carolus who was both valiant and young was in the battle struck from his horse and had not prince murchoe come timely to his rescue he had been trod to pieces by the enemy which nevertheless so bruised and wounded him that he was forced to be carried to his tent leaving the charge of his army to prince murchoe  now was the time that he had the whole fate of ireland depending upon his sword he did such wondrous actions as surpassed all belief and so bravely behaved himself as though he had been some god sent down from above he spite of all their forces thinking of the liberty of his country and love of his dear dooneflaith made such breaches in their main body that notwithstanding they had all the inspiration of courage that martialconduct ambition glory revenge and despair could afford them yet so great was murchoes courage and conduct so happy that the danish and leinster forces could no longer withstand him having with his own hand first slain maolmordh who was the first occasion of this war and then at two several times the two sons of the king of denmark whose loss so disheartened the enemy that they gave way to an easy though dearbought victory for murchoe being too far engaged among the danish horse though overpowered with number fought till he had made a rampart of dead bodies about him which for some time secured him from fate but an unlucky accidental arrow laid him dead upon a pyramid of his fallen enemies  yet for all this did not the resolute irish loose one foot of ground or one bit of their courage but rather spurred on by revenge made the danes pay dear for his loss and in a short time became sole masters of the field thus without the assistance of maolseachelvin were the danes overcome one whereof whose name was bruador being commander of a danish party and who with his men flying in the general rout was forced to take that way where bryan the monarchs pavilion was pitched into which as he was passing by he entered and seeing the king whom he had formerly known bryan suspecting no such thing having totally gained the battle basely murdered him as he lay wounded in his bed but he soon had the reward due to so treacherous an act for he and all who followed him were by his guards and the pursuers cut all to pieces  maolseachelvin after this put in for his share and made himself once more monarch of ireland though his daughter no sooner heard the death of her lover but as though she had lain down to sleep flung her self on her bed and without so much as one groan sigh or murmur she cried my murchoe calls me and i must go to him so died in the presence of her father and the rest of the nobility who had escaped in the battle for there were but few left alive and on the monarchs side besides bryan himself and the renowned prince murchoe his son were killed in this battle seven petty kings most of the princes and nobility of munster and conaught and four thousand of meaner degree  but on the other side viz that of the danes and leinster party were slain maolmordh macmurchoe the king of leinster who was the original cause of this slaughter with all his principal nobles and three thousand common soldiers together with knutus and andreas the two sons of the king of denmark and all their great commanders with six thousand seven hundred of the newcome forces from denmark that they had brought over with them and four thousand of the old danes who were before their coming in ireland in all the slaughter on both sides that day amounted to seven thousand seven hundred men besides kings princes commanders and other noblemen  some time after this battle maolseachelvin who now the second time sat on the monarchical throne of ireland and was the last monarch of the milesian race took dublin sacked it burnt it and slew in it all those danes who had made their escape thither from the battle of clantarfe  the next year in the said maolseachelvins reign huaghaire macduniling mactuatil another king of leinster who succeeded maolmordh though of a more noble race and better interested for the good of his country gave a mighty overthrow which was the last that was given to stetirick the son of aomlaibh and the danes of dublin who after the battle of clantarfe and the burning of dublin by maolseachelvin had once more recruited from the isle of man and other islands which were yet in possession of the danes but were now totally destroyed throughout all ireland  thus did that warlike and ancient kingdom free it self from the tyranny of its mortal enemy the
