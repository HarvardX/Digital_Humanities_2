what if the swedes should come  what if the swedes should come with some thoughts about keeping the army on foot whether they come or not  london printed for j roberts near the oxfordarms in warwick lane mdccxvii price sixpence  what if the swedes should come i have been mighty willing to have had the king of sweden been my hero for some years past his early gallantry the injuries done him by his enemies which at first drew him into the war and many other considerations gave me warm inclinations to his interest for it is natural to all honest men to entertain favorable thoughts for gallant princes however unfortunate  the first shock i received in my opinion of his conduct was when he lay still so many months in saxony with a great army refused the glory of healing the breaches of europe which seemed then all to be offered to his arbitrium and went upon a desperate enterprise of dethroning the czar of muscovy a prince whose strength consisted at that time rather in the distance and barrenness of his country than the superiority of his force  it is needless to enter into the history of his swedish majestys affairs since then which indeed have been but one continued train of misfortunes yet even under these the vigor of his courage has carried him on with such an unmoved steddiness of resolution that had not some of his attempts seemed desperately extravagant it was hard not to have a secret respect for so much unfortunate gallantry  but if what we expect now from him should go on if he should make this most ridiculous attempt for such i must call it i shall believe him entirely demented considering his own present circumstances divested of all his german dominions destitute of allies without money and at war with five potent princes already who are every hour expected to land in the heart of his dominions if this attempt should be made i shall have no more to say than this what may not be expected from a king that sleeps in his boots and lies in the straw  having other discourses therefore before me than a bare enquiry by guess and a mere search after the conjectures of men whether the king of sweden intends to come hither or no i shall wave the insignificant debate and take it for granted according to the common opinion that we are really to expect him  i must make one provision however as i go on which the iniquity of the times makes necessary and which the malice of men also gives me reason for it being natural for some people to charge every man that speaks honorably of any enemy with being in his party i therefore premise that by saying i believe he will come i do not imply that i desire he should i neither wish it for his own sake or ours i do not wish it for his own sake because as in a quarrel with great britain i cannot wish him success so in some other of his quarrels i know not how to wish him to be beaten what infatuation has embarked him in so scandalous a quarrel as this against the king and nation of great britain god only knows i fear it looks like a judgment from heaven upon him for his entire overthrow and destruction  ceasing then to pity him as a brave and heroic prince i must while his eyes are turned this way look on him as an enraged enemy and i speak of him as such  it is no work of mine to enter here upon the design of his coming the views upon which he has undertaken such a wild and unaccountable attempt or the persons in whose cause he must seem to embark if he makes the attempt i could spend many pages on the improbability of success the strength of the government here the powerful alliances the king is supported with from abroad the poverty and desperation of the king of swedens circumstances abroad and the like but as all these are if he comes to be disputed at the muzzle of the musket and the point of the sword talking of them in paper will no way end the dispute nor help our troops  i am therefore turning my eyes another way and looking upon our expecting people our business is to see if there be any thing needful to be said to them this part of my discourse i shall form upon the supposition whether it shall be so or no that the swedes were now actually on shore here to the number of  0 or   000 men or any number what they please as their partisans here threaten they will be  some that know not the swedes and think englishmen are a kind of people that no body can look in the face talk cavalierly of it all and wish they were fairly on shore that a fair battle might decide it  for my part i must own that though i cannot be so phlegmatic as some are to be disheartened and discouraged at the very thoughts of it and if it was to be put to a day of battle should have a good hope of success yet neither am i so sanguine as to be fond of the trial battle is a terrible crisis be it how it will and we have no certain word though we have a good hope to direct us to know what the god of battle may have determined about it i must therefore be of the number of those who with a feeling concern for the miseries of their native country are ready to say we would not be glad by any means to hear that an army of swedes or of any other enemies were actually on shore here  but while thus we are looking with an eye of expectance on these events and that with some impatience it seems very necessary that with all the calmness and composure i can i should cast in my mite toward allaying the general anxiety which i see upon the minds of men about this great affair  this i cannot do upon any foundation so well as upon a supposition that they will really land upon us if they can and i think it is a very needful question to put to one another as was by a certain writer of those times in case of the pretender what if they should come  there is no doubt but many who have a feeling sense of the calamities of war will say what if he should come why it is plain what will be the case   the seat of a bloody war is fixed in our own country which hitherto we have blessed be god been delivered from and have only paid our quotas and sent our troops abroad into other countries where the fields have been ravaged the people plundered virgins ravished churches robbed old and young murdered and the fields covered with blood this will be then brought home to our own doors and we shall feel the miseries which we have only hitherto talked of at a distance as we have formerly pitied the desolations of europe now they will all be at liberty to pity us and we shall be the aceldama of the world   another thing will be the jacobite party will take heart rebellion revive and the party of men among us who so lately have been suppressed will all fly to arms again and the interest of the pretender will be set on foot with a foreign power to support it the consequence of which may be bloody and a terrible civil war and for how long god only knows  this is making it look as dismal as we can well do and i am willing to talk of it thus because the enemy should not be able to say i do not see it in a true light  also i would not appear insensible because i am not ignorant of the calamities of a country which is made the seat of a war especially of so bloody so inveterate a war as thi may be and a war carried on with so much animosity and perhaps personal rage as this may be if it comes to the length that these people persuade themselves it will the description of a war between a nation justly alarmed in its own defense and an enraged revengful party fired with the reproaches of their late defeat and enraged to the last degree of vengeance if they have power and this party now supported by a foreign enemy i say the description of such a war is not easy nor can the calamities that may attend it be well described  for first to talk of it with levity and without concern would favor of the gascogne and look like the blusters of one that intended to have no share in the danger and perhaps none in the loss such a temper i care not to represent or secondly to talk of it with anxiety and concern is to discourage people from that vigorous resolution to resist to the death which is the undoubted duty of every true protestant who has any concern for the interest safety liberty and deliverance of his country  i shall therefore take the middle and just method i shall give due weight to the invader the goodness of his troops the intrepid courage of their king the desperation of his circumstances the resolution they come hither with to conquer or to dye i am for allowing all these to be extraordinary and things that are not to be laughed at or jested with and i only desire that every man that thinks them fit to be laughed at may be obliged to be one of those that shall look them in the face and if he can laugh at them he is welcome  i remember a passage of the late king james the iid of which i was both eye and earwitness and is as follows when the king was expecting the prince of orange and preparing to put his army in a posture to receive him he ordered eight regiments of his light horse to be made curiassiers and to be armed with back breast and headpiece as the german curiassiers are and he appointed three regiments of them  viz of lanier fenwick and a third whose colonel i do not remember to pass in review with their armor on in st georges fields where the king himself saw them perform their exercise  he drew them up round him after he had reviewed them that they might hear him speak and told them he was very well satisfied with their appearance and did not doubt but they would behave themselves well when they came to action that it was his concern for their safety that had caused him to order them to fight armed and withal to give them a superiority in the field and he added i hope you will use your selves to them that they may not be tiresome to you in service you will find the advantage of them gentlemen said the king i assure you the troops we have to do with will not be afraid to show their faces  he did not say this to discourage but to animate his men and with the same design i hope we may be allowed to speak freely of the swedes that they are ironfacd fellows that will not turn their backs for a cut or two in their flesh they are used to blows and know how to dye in the service of their king but what then so much the greater will be the glory of the british troops in grappling with them what are they that we are not and what have they that we have not nay how much greater are the arguments our men have to engage they fight in duty and follow as they are led for glory for conquest and perhaps for plunder we for liberty religion estates countries wives and children and in a word for all that can be dear to us as men or as christians  but i wave this part it is fit for a commander haranguing as was the custom of old times at the head of his troops a trade as much out of fashion now as it was useless and insignificant then  my present discourse is not directed to the troops i make no doubt but they will do their duty we have not so many british cowards as some people may imagine but my present business is with the civil quiet people at home who however they are civil and quiet as i call them because of there being no danger of their troubling us much with their fighting yet are apt enough to bear their share in doing mischief and sometimes may have it more in their power than such people should indeed be trusted with to weaken or strengthen the hands of those that do fight than any that are in the action it self  and that i may tell those people their business with plainness it is thus in short if the enemy land let us have a care that we be not the instruments of our own discouragement that we do not weaken our own hands and wound our own helpers by our weakness and want of conduct at home for this is certain that it is more in the power of our own folly to do harm to our own cause and interest than we may imagine and there are among us men who may by their ignorance do more injury to the cause of king george while they even fit at home and seem to do nothing than the swedes themselves would do by the descent of an army  we see these people vaunting and swaggering now of the strength of the nation the alliances of the king the weakness of the enemy and the cowardliness of the jacobite party and the like very well without enquiring whether they are right or wrong let them hold there where they are but let me caution that they be not as is often the case with such people as unreasonably surpised and discouraged afterward as they are now without judgment insulting and defying i remember some of the high people in england a little before the revolution who laughed at the prince of orange and the dutch and made them the subject of their mirth and sport all the while they were talked of and expected no body could show any concern about them at that time but these men upbraided them with cowardice and a sneaking fainthearted folly when the news came that they were put out to sea but were driven back by a storm the company of these people was really not bearable if that word be so no not among their own friends nothing troubled them but that the dutch had not landed and been gloriously beaten and the like  afterward when they were actually landed and things began to look threatening and dangerous these were the men who grew melancholy looked dismally and in short many of them run quite away even before it came to a crisis and never came back to england for some years afterward  there is a vast deal of odds between not contemning an enemy and not being afraid of him it was a maxim of julius caesar not to contemn his enemies and all the world knows he was never a man of fear let us give the swedes their due weight that we may prepare to match them and when they do come as people tell us they will let us take care not to be surprised at it  the question is what shall we do if they come and the answer is as direct as the question do we must fight them there is nothing else to be done with them nor is there any need to fear but we shall be well able to do this they must be fought with and that immediately before they have time to rest and refresh themselves before they have time to extend and spread themselves and open the country to make way for rebels disaffected and jacobite rabbles to join with them and list in their troops before they can increase their own numbers get a footing in the country or give time for others to draw together and divert the kings army this must be done with vigor and immediate application and it is our duty that are not in the field and are not immediately called out to action to encourage and enliven those that are by the cheerfulness of our countenances and the readiness of our appearing on all occasions to support supply recruit and assist the king his government and family with our substance and with whatever necessary sums may be wanting on such an emergency as this to this purpose one great part of our duty who are in the interest of king george is this and it is on this account these sheets are written  viz not to discourage one another  and that i may speak plainly to the people that are more particularly concerned and tell you directly what i mean by discouraging one another i mean that cursed foolish and if i may so call it fatal way we have of running down all public credit and public funds and stocks upon the surprise of such things as these as if we were confederate with the enemy in the attempt upon our country  i know nothing within my observation more absurd and ridiculous than this practice and yet i see no disease among us harder to cure and the more because it is not always the mere contrivance or practice of the enemies to the government for if that were the case some measures ought to be taken and might be taken to prevent it but the very friends to the public are found to be the men soonest frighted and in their fright doing most mischief  if a highchurchman gets up bank bills and hurries them in for payment musters up all his party and friends to run down stocks and to sink public credit we know his design and the end of it but for the other people to take the alarm and to see them blindly follow though their enemies lead is preposterous and unanswerably weak  to what purpose also is it that the whigs do this and who are the losers when they run to exchangealley with their stocks funds annuities etc and sell them in a fright who do they enrich and who are they that make a prize of their fears are they not their enemies the high men who generally buy them up at the fallen rate to which the sellers own fears have reduced them and then in a few days fell them back again to the poor desponding creatures when their courage is a little revived and their spirits recovered at perhaps ten per cent again  exactly thus was the case at the late attempt for an invasion in scotland in the name of the pretender in queen annes time of which i shall speak more largely by and by in the mean time in order to prevent this mischief on the like surprise i would only recommend to those who are friends to king georges interest this one consideration  viz that this is the one and only thing by which you can effectually ruin your country and betray king george into the hands of his and your enemies it is pity indeed that the true interest of the nation should be so much at the mercy of mens fears and that a set of people who have such a sincere affection to the king and his interest as that there is no room to suspect them of an ill design should be able to do so much prejudice to the cause they are embarked in and be so unable to avoid it so just a remark is it that men in danger who let fear govern them run into their danger rather than out of it fear deprives men of the use of those helps which reason offers and men in a fright generally do themselves harm by the measures they take to do themselves good  let me turn this advice to the citizens of london in particular o ancient and famous metropolis the mart of europe and magazine of the whole world as immense in wealth as innumerable in people sumptuous in buildings rich even to profusion in furniture and equipage formidable in wealth and justly esteemed beyond all the cities in the world for shipping commerce inhabitants and credit  of you it has been a happy truth which has so seldom been contradicted that it almost became proverbial that in all the civil broils of the kingdom that side which the city of london adhered to always prevailed and whence has this proceeded but from the hearty generous and bold advances your citizens made as well in raising men furnishing armies and navies with provisions arms necessaries etc for the war as particularly supporting by your credit and cash the party you espoused in a manner and with a zeal peculiar to your immense riches and inimitable by any other part of this kingdom  in the times of the late confusions in the reign of king charles the courage and unanimity of your city in concurring with the parliament gave them such eminent advantages as well in levying armies fitting fleets as supplying those armies and fleets and their leaders with great sums of money on all emergencies as was the chief if not at some times the only support of that war and in the end gave to the said parliament that manifest superiority over the kings party as finally ended in the overthrow of all his majestys measures and made the parliament to whom you so constantly adhered invincible  your money restored their circumstances your numbers recruited their troops your steadiness and constant adherence to them made them antaeuslike rise up from every fall stronger than they were before  it cannot now be said that your affection to king george and his interest is less than that of your forefathers was for the parliament side in a civil war your wealth opulence commerce manufactures and especially your numbers are visibly and remarkably greater than ever  with you are found those immense sums of money which are no where else in the world so much as heard of they are your citizens who when two or three millions sterling are wanted to any inviting proposal frequently fill up the subscriptions in two or three hours and are ready to tread one another to death to bring in their money  you give the standard to our wealth and it is the glut of money within your walls that gives reason to the parliament to reduce the interest of money through the whole nation your banks are the center of the running cash as the stocks of your companies are the fund of credit and commerce money flows annually from these as from a fountain diffusing it self like the blood through the veins not of your city alone but of the whole kingdom  your growing wealth and the rise of families within your walls exceeds the imagination much more the description of the nicest calculators the nobility and the gentry of britain by well managing hereditary estates improving their revenues intermarrying with flowing fortunes etc maintain the luster of ancient families and sometimes grow up to great magnitude upon the ruins and decay of one another but in you the greatest fortunes are raised by industry and application from the smallest beginnings nay from mere air and in a word from nothing at all showing that an estate indeed is a pond but trade is a spring the one may contain its own waters within its firm and faithful banks but the other is an inexhaustible flux of wealth that knows no decrease but overflows its banks and enriches continually its adjacent parts with its plentiful streams  hence the most flourishing families of the nobility think it now not below them to search the opulent families of the london merchants to find immense fortunes for their eldest sons by whose treasures the mortgaged estates of their ancestors are redeemed and the daughters of our citizens never fail to become a coronet at the coronations of our queens  but why do we talk of these things it is to thee our princes apply for weighty loans upon the emergencies of state nor can the demands of the nation be so great but thou art able to supply them at the shortest warning it is thy credit adds currency to the royal exchequer whose bills are brought to thy bank to give them life and which visibly stagnated in their own worth notwithstanding their high interest till they received a new circulation at thy hands  even the imperial exchequer flies to thy unfathomable wealth for its supply and mortgages nations to thee for thy money nay is not the whole nation mortgaged to thee at this time and of fifty millions sterling which the government is now in debt and for which the whole island is burdened with taxes to discharge is not the gross of the money thine and is not the value of the interests and properties governed at thy pleasure  where shall we go to match the wealth of thy inhabitants and what city or nation is there in the world that we can describe thee by  let us bring back all this to the present case while this city stands while this wealth circulates while this credit supports it self and the spirit and courage of the citizens of london hold up no invasion no desperate attempt of foreign kings or domestic rebels can affect us  what madness then must possess the minds of the citizens of london that in case of any public dangers or the view of public disorders shall instead of bold declarations to stand by their sovereign and to support one another to the last fall immediately to stabbing and wounding the vitals of their own credit running every one to the baenk for their money to the markets with their stocks as if all was lost and they were every one to shift for themselves like sailors in a ship who while the ship swims and the masts stand assist one another and look well to the main but when she strikes upon a rock and is visibly splitting then every man prepares to swim and save his own life but to carry this simile home if men frighted with their own shadows abandon the conduct of the ship while she is sound and has suffered no damage they ruin themselves and are the only cause of the loss of the ship  what can be the condition of the citizens of london that they should suffer themselves to be terrified and disordered at the shadow of enemies while they are yet at a distance and why should they take this fatal way of expressing their apprehensions which not only weakens their own hands but gives inexpressible room of boasting and triumph to their enemies not making only but increasing the terror and vain apprehensions and besides all making their market  what an example had we of this practice at the attempt of the pretender in the late queens time to land in scotland it was then but too evident that had the pretender landed though at that time the disaffection was not reckoned so dangerous as it has been since yet the very stop of the bank the run upon stocks and the ruin of the public credit were such as in two or three days had it continued would have put all the nation into an inexpressible confusion it is true it was begun by the jacobite party who were enemies but the timorous party of the whigs who were friends to the government took the fright and like men in a ship who begin to strip that they may swim put the rest immediately into the same confusion too it was then all the stocks and funds sunk in value the run upon the bank was such that had the pretender landed though he had been beaten afterward yet it is certain the bank must have stopped payment and every thing was running into distraction  this is the folly i would arm the citizens against as the only injury they can do themselves and as the great discouragement to the whole nation if the swedes should land the jacobites arm the troops draw together to fight is that a time to show our selves uneasy to fly to the public funds and places of receipt to take in our money what is that less or more than to say we look upon all as lost and are willing to shift for our selves  and how scandalous is this to a city of that magnitude wealth and grandeur not to say pride as the city of london did our fathers do this when the royal army was marching up victorious from oxford after some advantage in the field and very few to oppose them and the king at the head of his army was come up to brentford when as it was said some even of the members of the house of commons were secretly fled and the cause was upon the point of being given up what did the city they raised new troops sent out their regiments of auxiliaries marched out in person and encouraged the troops so much by their example that the kings army received a check at brentford and durst make no further attempt  did the city behave then in a cause so disputable and at best so inferior to this now before us and shall we be all in an alarm and run down our public credit and public stocks and amass our money into our own hands as if we were packing up our all to be gone for shame o ye citizens of london who value you selves upon your sense of the revolution exemplified in king georges succession be not thus the destroyers of your selves  how scandalous is it that your stocks should fall and your credit seem to decline already even upon the notion of this remote invasion a thing which may be or may not be and which it is two to one now whether it be not already defeated and disappointed what can the meaning of this be why is your credit in the city worse if the king of sweden were actually on shore than it is now is there any doubt but he must be beaten is it possible we can be so dispirited as to fear king georges being dethroned and if there is no danger of that why are our public funds less worth and if that should be what are you and all your funds good for so that on the whole your only step is to keep up the credit keep up your esteem of all public matters for by that you keep up the value of your own estates keep up the courages of all your friends and do more to disappoint and discourage your enemies than ten thousand men extraordinary could do in the field  for it is plain one great expectation of the tories in the beginning of their success is that we shall be all in an amaze that stocks will run down the bank stop payment and the citizens show themselves in a fright than which nothing can be a greater mark of a general confusion and discouragement  while i am talking thus to the citizens who know these things i need say no more to show them the folly of this unhappy conduct they know very well how many ill consequences it is attended with and how many ways it is serviceable to the enemy  but perhaps some may answer we acknowledge the fact but which way is it possible to prevent it every one have their own fears aand their own apprehensions and thousands are in circumstances which render them more subject than ordinary to such apprehensions having little or nothing else to depend upon but what are in such public hands and being afraid to have the rate of things fall farther they therefore sell off and hasten the fall farther by increasing the fright  these things may be true in some particulars but cannot hold good in the general and there may be many useful things offered to the persons concerned to prevent such a confusion as is the usual consequence in these cases and had such measures been taken in former times the little malicious runs upon stocks and banks had not happened  upon the first appearance of any such disorder all that are friends to the present government that value the credit of the city and see the usefulness of keeping up the courage of the people to the common interest will if they have any regard to that interest stand together with their fortunes and stock of cash and support the credit of the bank and to encourage them in this work the names of all such citizens who having money in the bank forbear to call it out or who carry any money in to the assistance of the bank at such a time of exigence should be taken down in order to be laid before the parliament and in order to have them publicly known that the government may on all occasions make such acknowledgment to them and reward them in such a manner as so generous a conduct shall deserve  that on the contrary the names of all those bankers merchants or whatever other persons that shall be found making large demands on the bank at such a time as that should be taken down and laid also before the parliament that they might be known marked out and due notice taken of them as there should be occasion  at such a time as this it would seem an acceptable service for the citizens on such occasions as may offer to subscribe large advances of money upon such public securities as the parliament may offer that it may be seen the city are neither doubtful or discouraged in defense of king george and his interest  these are steps fitter and more becoming the zealous and loyal city of london than the confusions occasioned by running down their own credit and lessening the value of their own estates as if all was in a fright and the nation in danger of being lost and i am free to say such a step as this would go farther to the conquering of the king of sweden and discouraging the jacobites from joining them or from appearing together in order to encourage and support the swedes than the raising ten thousand men to join the army would do  i could propose many noble things such a city as this could do upon so eminent an occasion as this but i know none that can come up to this let the jacobites see the bank supported by the moneydmen see the stocks rise   per cent the very day they hear of the king of swedens coming and the city advancing two millions to the government upon new funds and then let us but observe their countenances such a step would as effectually dishearten and disappoint them as beating the swedish fleet before they landed would do i take upon me to say that in case such a thing as a swedish invasion is projected and a rebellion at the end of it the dependence of the enemy is as much upon the confusions and disorders such things usually make among the people in london by the stop of credit the fall of stocks and the like as upon beating the forces nay and more too for this is the thing by which they expect to discourage the friends of the government and hearten and encourage their own party to take arms and indeed what can raise tumults and disorders sooner than a stagnation of credit a stop of cash an interruption of trade and a general face of fright and terror upon the kings friends  is this the way to beat the swedes or is it the way to cause a despicable enemy to ruin us while they themselves are out of gunshot is it possible that our enemies through the infirmity of our friends should have found out a newinvented engine to wound a whole nation at a blow that kills while the person hurting is entirely out of sight and out of reach and cannot have the wound returned is not this to make them fancy to themselves that heaven is fighting for them as it did once for king jehosaphat and that we are as the children of ammon and mount seir who are killing one another for fear without any reason but by an infatuation from heaven  certainly it is an infatuation that there is no room to dispute whether it be from heaven or not let the casuists and divines answer that but for men who otherwise as it has already appeared have been able by their figure their wealth and their reputation to support their princes and keep up the spirits of the nation in a war against the mightiest nations of the world and to make such efforts in matters of money which have been the surprise of europe i say for these if a despicable handful of but seven thousand men for it was no more the pretender had with him or of fourteen thousand for it is no more the swedes have threatened us with should but land upon their country for these to be discouraged and despairing and run to the bank for their money and to exchangealley to sell their stocks for what they can get as if every man was making up his pack to fly or shipping off to be out of danger is not this an infatuation can any rational account be given for it o citizens o englishmen remember a little your own circumstances nothing but a little steadiness under all these things is wanting to make you the most formidable people in the world while this foolish temper makes you a terror to your selves and the scorn and laughing stock of your enemies  i have been told by those who say they know it very well that when the citizens of london were in that terrible fright at about twenty two sail of ships though twenty eight were at the heels of them and seven thousand men though the whole nation was ready to arm against them i say i have been told that when they sold their stocks at    per cent less than they cost them and had the pretender landed would have sold them for any thing they could get it was the tory party that bought them and that in less than a fortnight their fright being over they bought them back again from the tories for the old price again so that as was said the tories got two hundred thousand pounds by the needless fright the whigs were in and all this in less than twenty days time and laughed at them into the bargain was there any thing but madness and infatuation in all this  if you would not be thus dupd and let into the secret again if you have any regard to the cause you are embarked in and to king george who is ready to stand by you and merits that you should better stand by him than by such conduct as this you can be supposed to do be wiser show more steddiness more resolution more sense of the nature and consequence of the things before you in short remember your vows to king george your engagements to support and assist him is this assisting him or is it assisting his enemies cowardice is treason in its nature though not in its design and a coward is as ill used in an army as a traitor though not for the same reason and what is this but cowardice and that of the worst kind for it is a pannick that seizes you while your enemy is afar off and that of so fatal a nature that it does as it were open the door to him and invite him to come in nay which is worse it encourages traitors at home to open the door and assist to let them in  it makes the enemy appear as if they were more formidable than really they are and gives them a triumph even without a victory do you think they do not stand and laugh on such occasions to see the citizens crowd down grocersalley to the bank and come back hugging their money as if they had just snatched it out of the fire or saved it from a shipwreck is this like the citizens of carthage where the ladies cut off their hair which was then the greatest ornament of beauty and willingly gave it to make cordage and ropes for the rigging out their navy against the romans or is it rather like the citizens of constantinople who pleaded poverty with their emperor when he begged of them from door to door to contribute money to hire troops to defend their city and had immense treasures laid up in their coffers for the plunder of the turks  let these ignominions sights be seen no more among us but if you would strike terror into the swedes if you would convince your enemies that king george is invulnerable while he has such a city and such citizens to stand by him let it be seen by your conduct in times of danger for then indeed is the time to show the sincerity of your former vows and the weight of all your addresses  what do all our addresses and associations amount to if in a time of difficulty you abandon your selves to needless fears and suffer rumors and shams raised by your enemies to make an impression upon you in this most sensible part  and now i have mentioned associations things which i confess i have not seen so much benefit arise from as has been expected i do not mean now only but even formerly too i say since i have named the word association i cannot but put my fellow citizens in mind of it how they may associate now more to their own honor and to the interest of the king and the whole nation than ever they or perhaps any city in the world had an opportunity to do before for if the citizens of london would associate now as they ought to do i affirm it is in their power to form such an association at this time or at any time of public danger as would fright the most potent enemy in europe from ever making any attempt to disturb the peace of great britain  this would be by a general association of the moneyed men to stand together and assist one another with their utmost strength of money and credit to support the credit of the public stocks to maintain the currency and honor of the bank and to prevent any possibility of the enemy making a run or push as they call it upon the bank to the stop of their cash or hindering the circulation of their current bills  in virtue of this association the subscribers should agree and oblige themselves not to draw any money out or transfer any of their stock from the bank at an under or falling price for such and such a time or during any such time of public apprehensions of danger  they should on the other hand raise a capital subscription of seven eight or ten millions sterling to support the said credit of the bank as well by buying up all the stock of such as through malice or real ignorance and apprehensions shall offer to sell the same at any price not exceeding five per cent under the current price of the bank stock as it was at the time when those apprehensions and fears began  that they will out of the said stock subscribed enable the bank to advance any sum of money upon such security and such moderate interest as the parliament shall appoint for his majestys present occasions as readily and cheerfully as in time of freedom from danger and of general tranquillity  time and the narrow extent of this small tract will not permit me to enter into an enquiry what a glory such a transaction as this would bring not to the reign of king george only but to the memory of such subjects and such a city through the whole world were such an association entered into and bravely supported jacobitism would quickly learn to despair her advocates would forsake her foreign princes would cease to think of helping her they that hope now for our confusions would give it over and the spirit of rebellion would evaporate die in its own vapor and sink out of the nation  it is from a true and distinguished zeal for the prosperity and glory of the city of london the safety of the kings government and the peace of the whole nation that the author of these sheets has made these thoughts public and as he never entertained a thought or wished in prejudice of the protestant succession of hanover or in favor of king georges enemies so he wishes this may be received accepted and practiced so as that the government may receive the advantage and he may have the satisfaction of having thus seasonably made the proposal which is all the honor and all the reward he desires  such a method as this would so strengthen the hands of king george so encourage his friends and faithful subjects so establish his interest and secure his possession that we should for the future have on one side less occasion and on the other less anxiety about the keeping or not keeping standing forces on foot on these or any other occasions  and now i have mentioned that so often disputed point a standing army a question which lies in less compass than the many words which have been made on one side or other would make us believe i shall in a few words give a state of the case and therewith conclude  of a standing army the word standing army appears in several shapes but ought as it is esteemed a grievance to be understood only thus  viz a standing army maintained in time of peace  it remains to state what is or is not a time of peace and to the present case it is sufficient to say that a time of a threatened invasion unconquered disaffection and formidable faction is not a time of peace and that therefore in those cases the word standing army is out of the question  but when alliances and treaties pacifications and accommodations guarantees and such like things have dissipated all our just fears from abroad and rebellion faction and disaffection is suppressed and disarmed at home then indeed the nation may be said to be in peace and a standing army may be called a grievance  but as even then some forces are necessary to be kept up and are kept up by all nations to secure and preserve that state of peace which alone makes a standing army needful at other times the only question then lies what is or is not a necessary medium between the extremes what number of troops may be acquiescd in as necessary for the public safety and what shall be esteemed dangerous to the nations liberty  the answer to this is short and easy and was long ago discussed in answer to a tract published against king williams army at the time of the peace of ryswick  viz that the parliament are and ought to be the judges in the case that such a force as the parliament shall judge needful and that force being always subjected to parliamentary authority as to their continuance increase and decrease such a force and no other the nation will always be easy with and safe in and such a standing army is not inconsistent with the constitution of a free nation of this opinion the author of these sheets ever was and as he never saw any solid reasons against it so he never wrote one word inconsistent with it in his life  there needs but one word to add to this and that is that we have all the reason in the world to believe his majesty will always be satisfied with such a settlement of force notwithstanding the schemes of our projecting authors for formidable forces at home and nurseries of forces abroad in which it is very reasonable to think they have no direction from the king and this i gather from the last words of his majestys speech the most engaging in this very particular that could be spoken from a glorious prince to a loyal people as follows my lords and gentleman  i have an entire confidence in you and have therefore nothing to ask but that you would take such measures as will best secure your religion and liberties while you preserve these etc i shall sit safe and easy on my throne    finis
