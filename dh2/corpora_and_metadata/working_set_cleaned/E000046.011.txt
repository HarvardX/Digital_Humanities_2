correspondence and official papers   0 –         thomas jefferson january     0  washington henry dearborn to the secretary at war  henry dearborn j mss washington january     0  dear sir —your letter of dec    brings to my mind a subject which never has presented itself but   with great pain that of your withdrawing from the administration before i withdraw myself it would have been to me the greatest of consolations to have gone thro my term with the same coadjutors and to have shared with them the merit or demerit of whatever good or evil we may have done the integrity attention skill  economy with which you have conducted your department have given me the most compleat and unqualified satisfaction and this testimony i bear to it with all the sincerity of truth and friendship and should a war come on there is no person in the us to whose management and care i could commit it with equal confidence that you as well as myself  all our brethren have maligners who from illtemper or disappointment seek opportunities of venting their angry passions against us is well known  too well understood by our constituents to be regarded no man who can succeed you will have fewer nor will any one enjoy a more extensive confidence thro the nation finding that i could not retain you to the end of my term i had wished to protract your stay till i could with propriety devolve on another the naming of your successor but this probably could not be done till   about the time of our separation in july your continuance however till after the end of the session will relieve me from the necessity of any nomination during the session  will leave me only a chasm of   or   months over which i must hobble as well as i can my greatest difficulty will arise from the carrying on the system of defensive works we propose to erect that these should have been fairly under way and in a course of execution under your direction would have peculiarly relieved me because we concur so exactly in the scale on which they are to be executed unacquainted with the details myself i fear that when you are gone aided only by your chief clerk i shall be assailed with schemes of improvement and alterations which i shall be embarrassed to pronounce on or withstand and incur augmentations of expense which i shall not know how to control i speak of the interval between the close of this session when you propose to retire  the commencement of our usual recess in july because during that recess we are in the habit of leaving things to the chief clerks and by the end of it my successor may be pretty well known and prevailed on to name yours however i am so much relieved by your ekeing out your continuance to the end of the session that i feel myself bound to consult your inclinations then  to take on myself the difficulties of the short period then ensuing in public or private and in all situations i shall retain for you the most cordial esteem and satisfactory recollections of the harmony  friendship with which we have run our race together and i pray you now   to accept sincere assurances of it  of my great respect  attachment thomas jefferson jan    0  washington charles thomson to charles thomson  washington jan    0  my dear and antient friend —i see by the newspapers your translation of the septuagint is now to be printed and i write this to pray to be admitted as a subscriber i wish it may not be too late for you to reconsider the size in which it is to be published folios and quartos are now laid aside because of their inconvenience everything is now printed in  vo   mo or petit format the english booksellers print their first editions indeed in  to because they can assess a larger price on account of the novelty but the bulk of readers generally wait for the  d edition which is for the most part in  vo this is what i have long practised myself johnson of philadelphia set the example of printing handsome edition of the bible in  v  vo i wish yours were in the same form i have learnt from time to time with great satisfaction that you retain your health spirits and activity of mind and body mr dickinson too is nearly in the same way he exchanges a letter with me now and then the principal effect of age of which i am sensible is an indisposition to be goaded by business from morning to night from laboring in an augean stable which cleared out at night presents an equal task the next morning i want to have some time to turn to subjects more congenial to my   mind mr rose still stays on board his ship at hampton we know not why if he is seeking time we may indulge time time prepares us for defence time may produce peace in europe that removes the ground of difference with england until another european war and that may find our revenues liberated by the discharge of our national debt our wealth and numbers increased our friendship and our enmity more important to every nation god bless you and give you years and health to your own wishes remember me respectfully to mrs thomson and accept yourself my affectionate salutation thomas jefferson jan    0  washington samuel miller to rev samuel miller j mss washington jan    0  sir —i have duly received your favor of the   th and am thankful to you for having written it because it is more agreeable to prevent than to refuse what i do not think myself authorized to comply with i consider the government of the us as interdicted by the constitution from intermeddling with religious institutions their doctrines discipline or exercises this results not only from the provision that no law shall be made respecting the establishment or free exercise of religion but from that also which reserves to the states the powers not delegated to the u s certainly no power to prescribe any religious exercise or to assume authority in religious discipline has been delegated to the general government it must then rest with the states as far as it can be in any human authority but it is only proposed that i   should recommend not prescribe a day of fasting  prayer that is that i should indirectly assume to the u s an authority over religious exercises which the constitution has directly precluded them from it must be meant too that this recommendation is to carry some authority and to be sanctioned by some penalty on those who disregard it not indeed of fine and imprisonment but of some degree of proscription perhaps in public opinion and does the change in the nature of the penalty make the recommendation the less a law of conduct for those to whom it is directed i do not believe it is for the interest of religion to invite the civil magistrate to direct its exercises its discipline or its doctrines nor of the religious societies that the general government should be invested with the power of effecting any uniformity of time or matter among them fasting  prayer are religious exercises the enjoining them an act of discipline every religious society has a right to determine for itself the times for these exercises  the objects proper for them according to their own particular tenets and this right can never be safer than in their own hands where the constitution has deposited it i am aware that the practice of my predecessors may be quoted but i have ever believed that the example of state executives led to the assumption of that authority by the general government without due examination which would have discovered that what might be a right in a state government was a violation of that right when assumed by another be this as it may every one must act according to the   dictates of his own reason  mine tells me that civil powers alone have been given to the president of the us and no authority to direct the religious exercises of his constituents i again express my satisfaction that you have been so good as to give me an opportunity of explaining myself in a private letter in which i could give my reasons more in detail than might have been done in a public answer and i pray you to accept the assurances of my high esteem  respect thomas jefferson february     0  special message on neutrals february     0  to the senate and house of representatives of the united states— having received an official communication of certain orders of the british government against the maritime rights of neutrals bearing date the   th of november   0  i transmit it to congress as a further proof of the increasing dangers to our navigation and commerce which led to the provident measures of the present session laying an embargo on our own vessels thomas jefferson feb    0  washington james monroe to james monroe j mss washington feb    0  my dear sir —you informed me that the instruments you had been so kind as to bring for me from england would arrive at richmond with your baggage and you wished to know what was to be done with them there i will ask the favor of you to  0 deliver them to mr jefferson who will forward them to monticello in the way i shall advise him and i must entreat you to send me either a note of their amount or the bills that i may be enabled to reimburse you there can be no pecuniary matter between us against which this can be any setoff but if contrary to my recollection or knoledge there were anything i pray that that may be left to be settled by itself if i could have known the amount beforehand i should have remitted it and asked the advance only under the idea that it should be the same as ready money to you on your arrival i must again therefore beseech you to let me know its amount i see with infinite grief a contest arising between yourself and another who have been very dear to each other and equally so to me i sincerely pray that these dispositions may not be affected between you with me i confidently trust they will not for independently of the dictates of public duty which prescribe neutrality to me my sincere friendship for you both will ensure its sacred observance i suffer no one to converse with me on the subject i already perceive my old friend clinton estranging himself from me no doubt lies are carried to him as they will be to the other two candidates under forms which however false he can scarcely question yet i have been equally careful as to him also never to say a word on this subject the object of the contest is a fair  honorable one equally open to you all and i have no doubt the personal conduct of all will be so chaste as to offer no ground of dissatisfaction    with each other but your friends will not be as delicate i know too well from experience the progress of political controversy and the exacerbation of spirit into which it degenerates not to fear for the continuance of your mutual esteem one piquing thing said draws on another that a third and always with increasing acrimony until all restraint is thrown off and it becomes difficult for yourselves to keep clear of the toils in which your friends will endeavor to interlace you and to avoid the participation in their passions which they will endeavor to produce a candid recollection of what you know of each other will be the true corrective with respect to myself i hope they will spare me my longings for retirement are so strong that i with difficulty encounter the daily drudgeries of my duty but my wish for retirement itself is not stronger than that of carrying into it the affections of all my friends i have ever viewed mr madison and yourself as two principal pillars of my happiness were either to be withdrawn i should consider it as among the greatest calamities which could assail my future peace of mind i have great confidence that the candor  high understanding of both will guard me against this misfortune the bare possibility of which has so far weighed on my mind that i could not be easy without unburthening it accept my respectful salutations for yourself and mrs monroe  be assured of my constant  sincere friendship     thomas jefferson mar    0  james madison to the secretary of state james madison j mss mar    0  i suppose we must dispatch another packet by the  st of apr at farthest i take it to be an universal opinion that war will become preferable to a continuance of the embargo after a certain time should    we not then avail ourselves of the intervening period to procure a retraction of the obnoxious decrees peaceably if possible an opening is given us by both parties sufficient to form a basis for such a proposition    i wish you to consider therefore the following course of proceeding to wit to instruct our ministers at paris  london by the next packet to propose immediately to both    these powers a declaration on both sides that these decrees  orders shall no longer be extended to vessels of the united states in which case we shall remain faithfully neutral but without assuming    the air of menace to let them both perceive that if they do not withdraw these orders  decrees there will arrive a time when our interests will render war preferable to a continuance of the embargo that    when that time arrives if one has withdrawn  the other not we must declare war against that other if neither shall have withdrawn we must take our choice of enemies between them this it will    certainly be our duty to have ascertained by the time congress shall meet in the fall or beginning of winter so that taking off the embargo they may decide whether war must be declared  against whom affectionate salutations thomas jefferson march      0  special message on commercial decrees march      0  to the senate and house of representatives of the united states— i have heretofore communicated to congress the decrees of the government of france of november      st   0  and of spain february   th   0  with the orders of the british government of january and november   0  i now transmit a decree of the emperor of france of december   th   0  and a similar decree of the  d january last by his catholic majesty although the decree of france has not been received by official communication yet the different channels of promulgation through which the public are possessed  0 of it with the formal testimony furnished by the government of spain in their decree leave us without a doubt that such a one has been issued these decrees and orders taken together want little of amounting to a declaration that every neutral vessel found on the high seas whatsoever be her cargo and whatsoever foreign port be that of her departure or destination shall be deemed lawful prize and they prove more and more the expediency of retaining our vessels our seamen and property within our own harbors until the dangers to which they are exposed can be removed or lessened thomas jefferson march      0  special message on british negotiation march      0  to the senate and house of representatives of the united states— at the opening of the present session i informed the legislature that the measures which had been taken with the government of great britain for the settlement of our neutral and national rights and of the conditions of commercial intercourse with that nation had resulted in articles of a treaty which could not be acceded to on our part that instructions had consequently been sent to our ministers there to resume the negotiations and to endeavor to obtain certain alterations and that this was interrupted by the transaction which took place between the frigates leopard and chesapeake to call on that government for reparation of this wrong produced as congress have already been informed the    mission of a special minister to this country and the occasion is now arrived when the public interest permits and requires that the whole of these proceedings should be made known to you i therefore now communicate the instructions given to our minister resident at london and his communications to that government on the subject of the chesapeake with the correspondence which has taken place here between the secretary of state and mr rose the special minister charged with the adjustment of that difference the instructions to our ministers for the formation of a treaty their correspondence with the british commissioners and with their own government on that subject the treaty itself and written declaration of the british commissioners accompanying it and the instructions given by us for resuming the negotiations with the proceedings and correspondence subsequent thereto to these i have added a letter lately addressed to the secretary of state from one of our late ministers which though not strictly written in an official character i think it my duty to communicate in order that his views of the proposed treaty and its several articles may be fairly presented and understood although i have heretofore and from time to time made such communications to congress as to keep them possessed of a general and just view of the proceedings and dispositions of the government of france toward this country yet in our present critical situation when we find no conduct on our part however impartial and friendly has been    sufficient to insure from either belligerent a just respect for our rights i am desirous that nothing shall be omitted on my part which may add to your information on this subject or contribute to the correctness of the views which should be formed the papers which for these reasons i now lay before you embrace all the communications official or verbal from the french government respecting the general relations between the two countries which have been transmitted through our minister there or through any other accredited channel since the last session of congress to which time all information of the same kind had from time to time been given them some of these papers have already been submitted to congress but it is thought better to offer them again in order that the chain of communications of which they make a part may be presented unbroken when on the   th of february i communicated to both houses the letter of general armstrong to m champagny i desired it might not be published because of the tendency of that practice to restrain injuriously the freedom of our foreign correspondence but perceiving that this caution proceeding purely from a regard for the public good has furnished occasion for disseminating unfounded suspicions and insinuations i am induced to believe that the good which will now result from its publication by confirming the confidence and union of our fellow citizens will more than countervail the ordinary objection to such publications it is my wish therefore that it may be now published    madison mar    0  thomas jefferson message on public defence   mar    0  in proceeding to carry into exn the act c it is found that the sites most advantageous for the defense of our harbors and rivers and sometimes the only sites competent to that defense are in some cases the property of minors incapable of giving a valid consent to their alienation in others belong to persons who on no terms will alienate and in others the proprietors demand such exaggerated compensn as however liberally the public ought to compensate in such cases would exceed all bounds of justice or liberality from this cause the defense of our seaboard so necessary to be pressed during the present season will in various parts be defeated unless the national legislature can apply a constitutional remedy the power of repelg invasions and making laws necessary for carrying that power into execution seems to include that of occupyg those sites    which are necessary to repel an enemy observing only the amendment to the constitution which provides that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation i submit therefore to the consideration of congress where the necessary sites cannot be obtained by the joint  valid consent of parties whether provision should be made by a process of ad quod damnum or any other more eligible means for authorizing the sites which are necessary for the public defence to be appropriated to that purpose i am aware that as the consent of the legislature of the state to the purchase of the site may not in some instances have been previously obtained exclusive legislation cannot be exercised therein by congress until that consent is given but in the meantime it will be held under the same laws which protect the property of individuals in that state and other property of the u s and the legislatures at their next meetings will have opportunities of doing what will be so evidently called for by the interest of their own state thomas jefferson mar    0  albert gallatin to the secretary of the treasury albert gallatin j mss mar    0  if on considering the doubts i shall suggest you shall still think your draught of a supplementary embargo law sufficient in its present form i shall be satisfied it is so for i have but one hour in the morning in which i am capable of thinking and that    is too much crowded with business to give me time to think    is not the first paragraph against the constitution which says no preference shall be given to the    ports of one state over those of another you might put down those ports as ports of entry if that could be made to do   could not your  d paragraph be made to answer by making it say that no clearance shall be    furnished to any vessel laden with provisions or lumber to go from one port to another of the u s without special permission c in that case we might lay down rules for the necessary removal of provisions and lumber inland which should give no trouble to the citizens but refuse licenses for all coasting transportation of those articles but on such applications from a governor as may ensure us against any exportation but for the consumption of his state portsmouth boston charleston  savannah are the only ports which cannot be supplied inland i should like to prohibit collections also made evidently for clandestine importation   i would rather strike out the words in conformity with treaty in order to avoid any express recognition at this day of that article of the british treaty it has been so flagrantly abused to excite the indians to war against us that i should have no hesitation in declaring it null as soon as we see means of supplying the indians ourselves i should have no objections to extend the exception to the indian furs purchased by our traders  sent into canada affectionate salutns thomas jefferson april   0  washington cornelia jefferson randolph to cornelia jefferson randolph  washington april   0  my dear cornelia —i have owed you a letter two months but have had nothing to write about till last night i found in a newspaper the four lines    which i now inclose to you and as you are learning to write they would be a good lesson to convince you of the importance of minding your stops in writing i allow you a day to find out yourself how to read these lines so far as to make them true if you cannot do it in that time you may call in assistance at the same time i will give you four other lines which i learnt when i was but a little older than you and i still remember   i ve seen the sea all in a blaze of fire   i ve seen a house as high as the moon and higher   i ve seen the sun at twelve oclock at night   i ve seen the man who saw this wondrous sight all this is true whatever you may think of it at first reading i mentioned in my letter of last week to ellen that i was under an attack of periodical headache this is the  0th day it has been very moderate and yesterday did not last more than three hours tell your mamma that i fear i shall not get away as soon as i expected congress has spent the last five days without employing a single hour in the business necessary to be finished kiss her for me and all the sisterhood to jefferson i give my hand to your papa my affectionate salutations you have always my love th jefferson ps—april   i have kept my letter open till today and am able to say now that my headache for the last two days has been scarcely sensible     thomas jefferson april      0  cæser rodney to the attorney general of the u s  cæser rodney april      0  th jefferson returns the endorsed to mr rodney with thanks for the communication it is very evident that our embargo added to the exclusions from the continent will be most easily felt in england and ireland liverpool is remonstrating  endeavoring to get the other ports into motion yet the bill confirming the orders of council is ordered to a  d reading which shews it will pass congress has just passed an additional embargo law on which if we act as boldly as i am disposed to do we can make it effectual i think the material parts of the enclosed should be published it will show our people  0 that while the embargo gives no double rations it is starving our enemies this six months session has drawn me down to a state of almost total incapacity for business congress will certainly rise tomorrow night and i shall leave this for monticello on the  th of may to be here again on the  th of june i salute you with constant affection  respect thomas jefferson may   0  washington john armstrong to the u s minister to france john armstrong j mss washington may   0  dear general —a safe conveyance offering by a special messenger to paris i avail myself of it to bring up my arrears to my foreign correspondents i give them the protection of your cover but to save the trouble of your attention to their distribution i give them an inner cover to mr warden whose attentions heretofore have encouraged me to ask this favor of him but should he not be with you i must pray you to open my packages to him  have them distributed as it is of importance that some of them should be delivered without delay i shall say nothing to you on the subject of our foreign relations because you will get what is official on that subject from mr madison during the present paroxysm of the insanity of europe we have thought it wisest to break off all intercourse with her we shall in the course of this year have all our seaports of any note put into a state of defence against naval attack against great land armies we cannot attempt it but by equal    armies for these we must depend on a classified militia which will give us the service of the class from  0 to    in the nature of conscripts composing a body of about   0000 to be specially trained this measure attempted at a former session was pressed at the last and might i think have been carried by a small majority but considering that great innovations should not be forced on a slender majority and seeing that the general opinion is sensibly rallying to it it was thought better to let it lie over to the next session when i trust it will be passed another measure has now twice failed which i have warmly urged the immediate settlement by donation of lands of such a body of militia in the territories of orleans  mississippi as will be adequate to the defence of new orleans we are raising some regulars in addition to our present force for garrisoning our seaports  forming a nucleus for the militia to gather to there will be no question who is to be my successor of this be assured whatever may be said by newspapers and private correspondences local considerations have been silenced by those dictated by the continued difficulties of the times one word of friendly request be more frequent  full in your communications with us i salute you with great friendship and respect thomas jefferson may  0 0  monticello general benjamin smith to general benjamin smith j mss monticello may  0 0  sir —i return you my thanks for the communication by your letter of apr    of the resolutions of    the grand jury of brunswick approving of the embargo could the alternative of war or the embargo have been presented to the whole nation as it occurred to their representatives there could have been but the one opinion that it was better to take the chance of one year by the embargo within which the orders  decrees producing it may be repealed or peace take place in europe which may secure peace to us how long the continuance of the embargo may be preferable to war is a question we shall have to meet if the decrees  orders  war continues i am sorry that in some places chiefly on our northern frontier a disposition even to oppose the law by force has been manifested in no country on earth is this so impracticable as in one where every man feels a vital interest in maintaining the authority of the laws and instantly engages in it as in his own personal cause accordingly we have experienced this spontaneous aid of our good citizens in the neighborhoods where there has been occasion as i am persuaded we ever shall on such occasions through the body of our country generally our citizens appear heartily to approve  support the embargo i am also to thank you for the communication of the wilmington proceedings and i add my salutations  assurances of great respect thomas jefferson may    0  monticello james madison to the secretary of state james madison j mss monticello may    0  dear sir —what has been already said on the subject of casa calvo yrujo miranda    is sufficient and that these should be seriously brought up again argues extreme weakness in cavallos or a plan to keep things unsettled with us but i think it would not be amiss to take him down from his high airs as to the right of the sovereign to hinder the upper inhabitants from the use of the mobile by observing   that we claim to be the sovereign although we give time for discussion but   that the upper inhabitants of a navigable water have always a right of innocent passage along it i think cavallos will not probably be the minister when the letter arrives at madrid and that an eye to that circumstance may perhaps have some proper influence on the style of the letter in which if meant for himself his hyperbolic airs might merit less respect i think too that the truth as to pikes mission might be so simply stated as to need no argument to show that even during the suspension of our claims to the eastern border of the rio norte his getting on it was mere error which ought to have called for the setting him right instead of forcing him through the interior country sullivans letter his view of things for some time past has been entirely distempered thomas jefferson june    0  washington doctor thomas leib to doctor thomas leib j mss washington june    0  sir —i have duly received your favor covering a copy of the talk to the tammany society for which i thank you and particularly for the favorable    sentiments expressed towards myself certainly nothing will so much sweeten the tranquillity and comfort of retirement as the knoledge that i carry with me the good will  approbation of my republican fellow citizens and especially of the individuals in unison with whom i have so long acted with respect to the federalists i believe we think alike for when speaking of them we never mean to include a worthy portion of our fellow citizens who consider themselves as in duty bound to support the constituted authorities of every branch and to reserve their opposition to the period of election these having acquired the appellation of federalists while a federal administration was in place have not cared about throwing off their name but adhering to their principle are the supporters of the present order of things the other branch of the federalists those who are so in principle as well as in name disapprove of the republican principles  features of our constitution and would i believe welcome any public calamity war with england excepted which might lessen the confidence of our country in those principles  forms i have generally considered them rather as subjects for a madhouse but they are now playing a game of the most mischievous tendency without perhaps being themselves aware of it they are endeavoring to convince england that we suffer more by the embargo than they do  that if they will but hold out awhile we must abandon it it is true the time will come when we must abandon it but if this is before the repeal of the orders of council we    must abandon it only for a state of war the day is not distant when that will be preferable to a longer continuance of the embargo but we can never remove that  let our vessels go out  be taken under these orders without making reprisal yet this is the very state of things which these federal monarchists are endeavoring to bring about and in this it is but too possible they may succeed but the fact is that if we have war with england it will be solely produced by their manœuvres i think that in two or three months we shall know what will be the issue i salute you with esteem  respect thomas jefferson june    0  general james wilkinson to general james wilkinson j mss june    0  thomas jefferson presents his compliments to genl wilkinson and in answer to his letters of yesterday observes that during the course of the burr conspiracy the voluminous communications he received were generally read but once  then committed to the attorney general and were never returned to him it is not in his power therefore to say that general wilkinson did or did not denounce eminent persons to him  still less who they were it was unavoidable that he should from time to time mention persons known or supposed to be accomplices of burr and it is recollected that some of these suspicions were corrected afterwards on better information whether the undefined term denunciation goes to cases of this kind or not th j does    not know nor could he now name from recollection the persons suspected at different times he salutes general wilkinson respectfully thomas jefferson june   th 0  washington thomas mann randolph to thomas mann randolph j mss washington june   th 0  dear sir —i enclose you a mercantile advertiser for the sake of the extraordinary fabrication in its postscript by an arrival from cork with london dates to the  th of may the arrival of the osage in england which had been detained in france by armstrong himself furnishes the occasion of amusing that nation with the forgeries of fact which i have included in an inked line on the margin within which line every word is false yet this lie will run through all the papers few readers will think of asking themselves how this london or cork printer should know all the particulars he states  for which he quotes no authority the fact is that there never has been a proposition or intimation to us from france to join them in the war unless champagnys letter be so considered nor has there ever been the slightest disrespect to armstrong as far as we have a right to conclude from his silence and from that of turreau so from england we have in like manner had no such intimation except in holland  aucklands note subjoined to the treaty we have nothing from armstrong or pinckney indeed we can have nothing interesting from france while the emperor is absent i continue to send you the    public advertiser  citizen of n y while their fire is kept up on the presidential election the papers of the other states are almost entirely silent on the subject it seems understood that de witt clinton sinks with his tool cheetham we have proof on the oath of a credible man that he set burr on board the last british packet in the evening of her departure he was disguised in a sailors habit as were two other gentlemen unknown to the person but one of whom burr called ogden at taking leave he was met at n york by mrs alston whose child babbled out in his play with another that grandpapa was come i charged bacon very strictly to keep the water of the canal always running over the waste as shoemaker has made the want of water the ground of insisting on a suspension of rent and will probably continue to do it present my tender love to martha  the family and be assured yourself of my affectionate attachment  respect thomas jefferson july    0  washington meriwether lewis to meriwether lewis j mss washington july    0  dear sir —since i parted with you in albemarle in sep last i have never had a line from you nor i believe has the secretary at war with whom you have much connection through the indian department the misfortune which attended the effort to send the mandane chief home became known to us before you had reached st louis we took no step on the occasion counting on receiving your advice    so soon as you should be in place and knowing that your knoledge of the whole subject  presence on the spot would enable you to judge better than we could what ought to be done the constant persuasion that something from you must be on its way to us has as constantly prevented our writing to you on the subject the present letter however is written to put an end at length to this mutual silence and to ask from you a communication of what you think best to be done to get the chief  his family back we consider the good faith and the reputation of the nation as pledged to accomplish this we would wish indeed not to be obliged to undertake any considerable military expedition in the present uncertain state of our foreign concerns  especially not till the new body of troops shall be raised but if it can be effected in any other way  at any reasonable expense we are disposed to meet it a powerful company is at length forming for taking up the indian commerce on a large scale they will employ a capital the first year of  00000 d and raise it afterwards to a million the english mackinac company will probably withdraw from the competition it will be under the direction of a most excellent man a mr astor mercht of new york long engaged in the business  perfectly master of it he has some hope of seeing you at st louis in which case i recommend him to your particular attention nothing but the exclusive possession of the indian commerce can secure us their peace our foreign affairs do not seem to clear up at all should they continue as at present the moment will    come when it will be a question for the legislature whether war will not be preferable to a longer continuance of the embargo the presidential question is clearing up daily and the opposition subsiding it is very possible that the suffrage of the nation may be undivided but with this question it is my duty not to intermeddle i have not lately heard of your friends in albemarle they were well when i left that in june and not hearing otherwise affords presumptions they are well but i presume you hear that from themselves we have no tidings yet of the forwardness of your printer i hope the first part will not be delayed much longer wishing you every blessing of life  health i salute you with constant affection  respect thomas jefferson aug   0  monticello john langdon to john langdon private j mss monticello aug   0  my dear sir —the inclosed are formal and for the public but in sending them to you i cannot omit the occasion of indulging my friendship in a more familiar way  of recalling myself to your recollection how much have i wished to have had you still with us through the years of my emploiment at washington i have seen with great pleasure the moderation  circumspection with which you have been kind enough to act under my letter of may   and i have been highly gratified with the late general expressions of public sentiment in favor of a measure which alone could have saved us from  0 immediate war  give time to call home  0 millions of property  0 or  0000 seamen   000 vessels these are now nearly at home  furnish a great capital much of which will go into manufactures and seamen to man a fleet of privateers whenever our citizens shall prefer war to a longer continuance of the embargo perhaps however the whale of the ocean may be tired of the solitude it has made on that element and return to honest principles and his brother robber on the land may see that as to us the grapes are sour i think one war enough for the life of one man and you and i have gone through one which at least may lessen our impatience to embark in another still if it becomes necessary we must meet it like men old men indeed but yet good for something but whether in peace or war may you have as many years of life as you desire with health  prosperity to make them happy years i salute you with constant affection  great esteem  respect thomas jefferson august   0  monticello henry dearborn to the secretary at war henry dearborn j mss monticello august   0  dear sir —yours of july   th is received it confirms the accounts we receive from others that the infractions of the embargo in maine  massachusetts are open i have removed pope of new bedford for worse than negligence the collector of sullivan is on the totter the tories of boston openly threaten insurrection if their importation of flour is stopped the next post will stop it i fear    your governor is not up to the tone of these parricides and i hope on the first symptom of an open opposition to the laws by force you will fly to the scene and aid in suppressing any commotion thomas jefferson august    0  monticello albert gallatin to the secretary of the treasury albert gallatin j mss monticello august    0  dear sir —your letters of july   th and aug  th came to hand yesterday and i now return you those of waynne wolsey quincy otis lincoln  dearborne this embargo law is certainly the most embarrassing one we have ever had to execute i did not expect a crop of so sudden  rank growth of fraud  open opposition by force could have grown up in the u s i am satisfied with you that if orders  decrees are not repealed and a continuance of the embargo is preferred to war which sentiment is universal here congress must legalize all means which may be necessary to obtain its end mr smith in enclosing to me general dearbornes  lincolns letters informs me that immediately on receiving them he gave the necessary orders to the chesapeake the wasp  argus still i shall pass this letter and those it encloses through his hands for information i am clearly of opinion this law ought to be enforced at any expense which may not exceed our appropriation i approve of the instructions to general lincoln for selling the revenue cutter there  buying another and also of what you propose at new london  portsmouth and    generally i wish you to do as to the revenue cutters what you shall think best without delaying it to hear from me you possess the details so much better than i do and are so much nearer the principal scenes that my approbation can be but matter of form as to ordering out militia you know the difficulty without another proclamation i advise mr madison to inform general turreau that the vessels we allow to the foreign ministers are only in the character of transports  that they cannot be allowed but where the number of persons bears the proportion to the vessel which is usual with transports you will see by my last that on learning the situation of affairs in spain it had occurred to me that it might produce a favorable occasion of doing ourselves justice in the south we must certainly so dispose of our southern recruits  armed vessels as to be ready for the occasion a letter of june   from mr pinckney says nothing more than that in a few days he was to have a full conference on our affairs with mr canning that will doubtless produce us immediately an interesting letter from him i salute you affectionately p s i this day direct a commission for general steele vice general shee decd thomas jefferson aug    0  monticello to the secretary at war j mss monticello aug    0  dear sir —yours of july    has been received i now enclose you the letters of hawkins harrison wells hull  claiborne received from the war    office and as i conjecture not yet seen by you indian appearances both in the northwest  south are well beyond the mississippi they are not so favorable i fear governor lewis has been too prompt in committing us with the osages so far as to oblige us to go on but it is astonishing we get not one word from him i enclose you letters of mr griff  maclure which will explain themselves a letter of june   from mr pinckney informs us he was to have a free conference with canning in a few days should england make up with us while bonaparte continues at war with spain a moment may occur when we may without danger of commitment with either france or england seize to our own limits of louisiana as of right  the residue of the floridas as reprisal for spoliations it is our duty to have an eye to this in rendezvousing  stationing our new recruits  our armed vessels so as to be ready if congress authorizes it to strike in a moment i wish you to consider this matter in the orders to the southern recruits as i have also recommended to the secretary of the navy as to the armed vessels in the south indeed i would ask your opinion as to the positions we had better take with a view to this with our armed vessels as well as troops the force in the neighborhood of baton rouge is enough for that mobile pensacola  st augustine are those we should be preparing for the enforcing the embargo would furnish a pretext for taking the nearest healthy position to st marys and on the waters of tombigbee i salute you with affection  respect    thomas jefferson aug    0  monticello james madison to the secretary of state james madison j mss monticello aug    0  dear sir —yours of the  0th came to hand yesterday  i return you forondas tufts soderstroms  turreaus letters i think it is become necessary to let turreau understand explicitly that the vessels we permit foreign ministers to send away are merely transports for the conveyance of such of their subjects as were here at the time of the embargo that the numbers must be proportioned to the vessels as is usual with transports and that all who meant to go away must be presumed to have gone before now—at any rate that none will be accommodated after the present vessel we never can allow one belligerent to buy  fit out vessels here to be manned with his own people  probably act against the other you did not return my answer to sullivan but fortunately i have received another letter which will enable me to give the matter an easier turn  let it down more softly should the conference announced in mr pinckneys letter of june   settle friendship between england  us  bonaparte continue at war with spain a moment may occur favorable without compromitting us with either france or england for seizing our own from the rio bravo to perdido as of right  the residue of florida as a reprisal for spoliations i have thought it proper to suggest this possibility to genl dearborne  mr smith  to recommend an eye to it in their rendezvousing  stationing the new southern recruits  gunboats so that we may strike    in a moment when congress says so i have appointed genl steele successor to shee mr  mrs barlow  mrs blagden will be here about the   th may we hope to see mrs madison  yourself then or when i shall go to bedford about the  0th of september i salute you with constant affection  respect thomas jefferson aug    0  monticello james sullivan to the governor of massachusetts james sullivan j mss monticello aug    0  sir —your letter of july    has been received some days that of july    not till yesterday some accident had probably detained it on the road considerably beyond its regular passage in the former you mention that you had thought it advisable to continue issuing certificates for the importation of flour until you could hear further from me and in the latter that you will be called from the capital in the fall months after which it is your desire that the power of issuing certificates may be given to some other if it is to be continued in mine of july   th i had stated that during the two months preceding that your certificates received at the treasury amounted if i rightly recollect to about  0000 barrels of flour  a proportionable quantity of corn if this whole quantity had been bonâ fide landed  retained in massachusetts i deemed it certain there could not be a real want for a considerable time  therefore desired the issues of certificates might be discontinued if on the other hand a part has been carried to foreign markets    it proves the necessity of restricting reasonably this avenue to abuse this is my sole object and not that a real want of a single individual should be one day unsupplied in this i am certain we shall have the concurrence of all the good citizens of massachusetts who are too patriotic and too just to desire by calling for what is superfluous to open a door for the frauds of unprincipled individuals who trampling on the laws and forcing a commerce shut to all others are enriching themselves on the sacrifices of their honester fellow citizens—sacrifices to which these are generally  willingly submitting as equally necessary whether to avoid or prepare for war still further however to secure the state against all danger of want i will request you to continue issuing certificates in the moderate way proposed in your letter until your departure from the capital as before stated when i will consider it as discontinued or make another appointment if necessary there is less risk of inconvenience in this as by a letter from the secretary of the treasury of may  0th the collectors were advised not to detain any vessel the articles of whose lading were so proportioned as to give no cause of suspicion that they were destined for a foreign market this mode of supply alone seems to have been sufficient for the other importing states if we may judge from the little use they have made of the permission to issue certificates should these reasonable precautions be followed as is surmised in your letter of july    by an artificial    scarcity with a view to promote turbulence of any sort or on any pretext i trust for an ample security against this danger to the character of my fellow citizens of massachusetts which has i think been emphatically marked by obedience to law  a love of order and i have no doubt that whilst we do our duty they will support us in it the laws enacted by the general government will have made it our duty to have the embargo strictly observed for the general good  we are sworn to execute the laws if clamor ensue it will be from the few only who will clamor whatever we do i shall be happy to receive the estimate promised by your excellency as it may assist to guide us in the cautions we may find necessary and here i will beg leave to recall your attention to a mere error of arithmetic in your letter of july    the quantity of flour requisite on the date there given would be between thirteen  fourteen thousand barrels per month i beg you to accept my salutations  assurances of high respect  consideration thomas jefferson aug      0  united states to the emperor of russia j mss united states aug      0  great and good friend and emperor —desirous of promoting useful intercourse  good understanding between your majestys subjects  the citizens of the u s and

their sincere friendship and of their desire to maintain with y m  your subjects the strictest relations of amity  commerce he will explain to y m the peculiar position of these states separated by a wide ocean from the powers of europe with interests and pursuits distinct from theirs and consequently without the motives or the aptitudes for taking part in the associations or oppositions which a

majesty is a party rendering to all the services  courtesies of friendship and praying for the reestablishment of peace  right among them and we entertain an entire confidence that this just  faithful conduct on the part of the u s will strengthen the friendly dispositions you have manifested towards them and be a fresh motive with so just  magnanimous a sovereign to enforce by the high influence of your example the respect due to the character  the rights of a peaceable nation i beseech you great and good friend  emperor to give entire credence to whatever he shall say to you on the part of

monticello james madison to the secretary of state james madison j mss monticello sept   0  dear sir —i return you pinckneys letter the complexion of which i like if they repeal their orders we must repeal our embargo if they make satisfaction for the chesapeake we must revoke our proclamation and generalize its operation by a law if they keep up impressments we must adhere to nonintercourse manufactures  a navigation act i enclose for your perusal a letter of mr shorts i inform him that any one of the persons he names would be approved the government never recognizing a difference between the two parties of republicans in pennsylvania i do not think the anonymous rhapsody is cheathams tho mere declamation it is of too high an order for him i think it quite in gouv morriss dictatorial manner its matter is miserable sophistry i salute you with constant affection  0 thomas jefferson sept    0  monticello james madison to the secretary of state james madison j mss monticello sept    0  dear sir —i send you a letter of shorts for perusal  one of edgar patterson asking what is already i presume provided for and one of general armstrong which i do not well understand because i do not recollect the particular letter which came by haley i presume the counsel he refers to is to take possession of the floridas this letter of june    is written after the cession by carlos to bonaparte of all his dominions when he supposed england would at once pounce on the floridas as a prey or bonaparte occupy it as a neighbor his next will be written after the people of spain will have annihilated the cession england become the protector of florida and bonaparte without title or means to plant himself there as our neighbor ought i to answer such a petition as that of rowley the people have a right to petition but not to use that right to cover calumniating insinuations turreau writes like armstrong so much in the buskin that he cannot give a naked fact in an intelligible form i do not know what it is he asks for if a transport or transports to convey sailors there has been no refusal and if any delay of answer i presume it can be explained if he wishes to buy vessels here man them with french seamen and send them elsewhere the breach of neutrality would be in permitting not in refusing it but have we permitted this to england his remedy is easy in    every case repeal the decrees i presume our fredericksburg rider need not come after his next trip i salute you affectionately thomas jefferson oct    0  washington robert r livingston to robert r livingston j mss washington oct    0  sir —your letter of sept    waited here for my return and it is not till now that i have been able to acknowledge it the explanation of his principles given you by the french emperor in conversation is correct as far as it goes he does not wish us to go to war with england knowing we have no ships to carry on that war to submit to pay to england the tribute on our commerce which she demands by her orders of council would be to aid her in the war against him  would give him just ground to declare war with us he concludes therefore as every rational man must that the embargo the only remaining alternative was a wise measure these are acknowledged principles and should circumstances arise which may offer advantage to our country in making them public we shall avail ourselves of them but as it is not usual nor agreeable to governments to bring their conversation before the public i think it would be well to consider this on your part as confidential leaving to the government to retain or make it public as the general good may require had the emperor gone further and said that he condemned our vessels going voluntarily into his ports in breach of his municipal laws we might    have admitted it rigorously legal tho not friendly but his condemnation of vessels taken on the high seas by his privateers  carried involuntarily into his ports is justifiable by no law is piracy and this is the wrong we complain of against him supposing that you may be still at clermont from whence your letter is dated i avail myself of this circumstance to request your presenting my friendly respects to chancellor livingston i salute you with esteem  respect thomas jefferson oct    0  washington doctor james brown to doctor james brown washington oct    0  dear sir —you will wonder that your letter of june   should not be acknoledged till this date i never received it till sep    and coming soon after to this place the accumulation of business i found here has prevented my taking it up till now that you ever participated in any plan for a division of the union i never for one moment believed i knew your americanism too well but as the enterprise against mexico was of a very different character i had supposed what i heard on that subject to be possible you disavow it that is enough for me and i forever dismiss the idea i wish it were possible to extend my belief of innocence to a very different description of men in n o but i think there is sufficient evidence of there being there a set of foreign adventurers  native malcontents who would concur in any enterprise to separate that country from this i did wish to see these people    get what they deserved and under the maxim of the law itself that inter arma silent leges that in an encampment expecting daily attack from a powerful enemy selfpreservation is paramount to all law i expected that instead of invoking the forms of the law to cover traitors all good citizens would have concurred in securing them should we have ever gained our revolution if we had bound our hands by manacles of the law not only in the beginning but in any part of the revolutionary conflict there are extreme cases where the laws become inadequate even to their own preservation and where the universal resource is a dictator or martial law was n o in that situation altho we knew here that the force destined against it was suppressed on the ohio yet we supposed this unknown at n o at the time that burrs accomplices were calling in the aid of the law to enable them to perpetrate its suppression and that it was reasonable according to the state of information there to act on the expectation of a daily attack of this you are the best judge burr is in london and is giving out to his friends that that government offers him   millions of dollars the moment he can raise an ensign of rebellion as big as a handkerchief some of his partisans will believe this because they wish it but those who know him best will not believe it the more because he says it for myself even in his most flattering periods of the conspiracy i never entertained one moments fear my long  intimate knowledge of my countrymen satisfied  satisfies    me that let there ever be occasion to display the banners of the law  the world will see how few  pitiful are those who shall array themselves in opposition i as little fear foreign invasion i have indeed thought it a duty to be prepared to meet even the most powerful that of a bonaparte for instance by the only means competent that of a classification of the militia  placing the junior classes at the public disposal but the lesson he receives in spain extirpates all apprehensions from my mind if in a peninsula the neck of which is adjacent to him and at his command where he can march any army without the possibility of interception or obstruction from any foreign power he finds it necessary to begin with an army of  00000 men to subdue a nation of   millions brutalized by ignorance and enervated by long peace and should find constant reinforcements of thousands after thousands necessary to effect at last a conquest as doubtful as deprecated what numbers would be necessary against   millions of free americans spread over such an extent of country as would wear him down by mere marching by want of food autumnal diseases c how would they be brought and how reinforced across an ocean of  000 miles in possession of a bitter enemy whose peace like the repose of a dog is never more than momentary and for what for nothing but hard blows if the orleanese creoles would but contemplate these truths they would cling to the american union soul  body as their first affection and we should be as safe there as we are everywhere else i have    no doubt of their attachment to us in preference of the english i salute you with sincere friendship  respect thomas jefferson oct    0  washington william charles cole claiborne to the governor of louisiana william charles cole claiborne j mss washington oct    0  sir —i send the enclosed letter under the benefit of your cover  open because i wish you to know its contents i thought the person to whom it is addressed a very good man when here—he is certainly a very learned and able one i thought him peculiarly qualified to be useful with you but in the present state of my information i can say no more than i have to him when you shall have read the letter be so good as to stick a wafer in it  not let it be delivered till it is dry that he may not know that any one but himself sees it the spanish paper you enclosed me is an atrocious one i see it has been republished in havanna the truth is that the patriots of spain have no warmer friends than the administration of the u s but it is our duty to say nothing  to do nothing for or against either if they succeed we shall be well satisfied to see cuba  mexico remain in their present dependence but very unwilling to see them in that of either france or england politically or commercially we consider their interests  ours as the same and that the object of both must be to exclude all european influence from this hemisphere    we wish to avoid the necessity of going to war till our revenue shall be entirely liberated from debt then it will suffice for war without creating new debt or taxes these are sentiments which i would wish you to express to any proper characters of either of these two countries and particularly that we have nothing more at heart than their friendship i salute you with great esteem  respect thomas jefferson november     0  eighth annual message   november     0  to the senate and house of representatives of the united states— it would have been a source fellow citizens of much gratification if our last communications from    europe had enabled me to inform you that the belligerent nations whose disregard of neutral rights has been so destructive to our commerce had become awakened to the duty and true policy of    revoking their unrighteous edicts that no means might be omitted to produce this salutary effect i lost no time in availing myself of the act authorizing a suspension in whole or in part of the several    embargo laws our ministers at london and paris were instructed to explain to the respective governments there our disposition to exercise the authority in such manner as would withdraw the  0 pretext on which the aggressions were originally founded and open a way for a renewal of that commercial intercourse which it was alleged on all sides had been reluctantly obstructed as each of    those governments had pledged its readiness to concur in renouncing a measure which reached its adversary through the incontestable rights of neutrals only and as the measure had been assumed by    each as a retaliation for an asserted acquiescence in the aggressions of the other it was reasonably expected that the occasion would have been seized by both for evincing the sincerity of their profession    and for restoring to the commerce of the united states its legitimate freedom the instructions to our ministers with respect to the different belligerents were necessarily modified with reference to their different circumstances and to the condition annexed by law to the executive power of suspension requiring a degree of security to our commerce which would not result from a repeal of the decrees of france instead of a pledge therefore of a suspension of the embargo as to her in case of such a repeal it was presumed that a sufficient inducement might be found in other considerations and particularly in the change produced by a compliance with our just demands by one belligerent and a refusal by the other in the relations between the other and the united states to great britain whose power on the ocean is so ascendant it was deemed not inconsistent with that condition to state explicitly that on her rescinding her orders in relation to the united states their trade would be opened with her and remain shut to her enemy in case of his failure to rescind his decrees also from france no answer has been received nor any indication that the requisite change in her decrees is contemplated the favorable reception of the proposition to great britain was the less to be doubted as her orders of council had not only been referred for their vindication to an acquiesence on the part of the united states no longer to be pretended but as the arrangement proposed while it resisted the illegal decrees of france involved moreover substantially the precise advantages professedly aimed    at by the british orders the arrangement has nevertheless been rejected this candid and liberal experiment having thus failed and no other event having occurred on which a suspension of the embargo by the executive was authorized it necessarily remains in the extent originally given to it we have the satisfaction however to reflect that in return for the privations by the measure and which our fellow citizens in general have borne with patriotism it has had the important effects of saving our mariners and our vast mercantile property as well as of affording time for prosecuting the defensive and provisional measures called for by the occasion it has demonstrated to foreign nations the moderation and firmness which govern our councils and to our citizens the necessity of uniting in support of the laws and the rights of their country and has thus long frustrated those usurpations and spoliations which if resisted involve war if submitted to sacrificed a vital principle of our national independence under a continuance of the belligerent measures which in defiance of laws which consecrate the rights of neutrals overspread the ocean with danger it will rest with the wisdom of congress to decide on the course best adapted to such a state of things and bringing with them as they do from every part of the union the sentiments of our constituents my confidence is strengthened that in forming this decision they will with an unerring regard to the essential rights and interests of the nation weigh    and compare the painful alternatives out of which a choice is to be made nor should i do justice to the virtues which on other occasions have marked the character of our fellow citizens if i did not cherish an equal confidence that the alternative chosen whatever it may be will be maintained with all the fortitude and patriotism which the crisis ought to inspire the documents containing the correspondences on the subject of the foreign edicts against our commerce with the instructions given to our ministers at london and paris are now laid before you the communications made to congress at their last session explained the posture in which the close of the discussion relating to the attack by a british ship of war on the frigate chesapeake left a subject on which the nation had manifested so honorable a sensibility every view of what had passed authorized a belief that immediate steps would be taken by the british government for redressing a wrong which the more it was investigated appeared the more clearly to require what had not been provided for in the special mission it is found that no steps have been taken for the purpose on the contrary it will be seen in the documents laid before you that the inadmissible preliminary which obstructed the adjustment is still adhered to and moreover that it is now brought into connection with the distinct and irrelative case of the orders in council the instructions which had been given to our ministers at london with a view to facilitate if necessary the reparation claimed by the    united states are included in the documents communicated our relations with the other powers of europe have undergone no material changes since your last session the important negotiations with spain which had been alternately suspended and resumed necessarily experience a pause under the extraordinary and interesting crisis which distinguished her internal situation with the barbary powers we continue in harmony with the exception of an unjustifiable proceeding of the dey of algiers toward our consul to that regency its character and circumstances are now laid before you and will enable you to decide how far it may either now or hereafter call for any measures not within the limits of the executive authority with our indian neighbors the public peace has been steadily maintained some instances of individual wrong have as at other times taken place but in nowise implicating the will of the nation beyond the mississippi the iowas the sacs and the alabamas have delivered up for trial and punishment individuals from among themselves accused of murdering citizens of the united states on this side of the mississippi the creeks are exerting themselves to arrest offenders of the same kind and the choctaws have manifested their readiness and desire for amicable and just arrangements respecting depredations committed by disorderly persons of their tribe and generally from a conviction that we consider them as part of ourselves and cherish with sincerity their rights and interests the attachment    of the indian tribes is gaining strength daily—is extending from the nearer to the more remote and will amply requite us for the justice and friendship practised towards them husbandry and household manufacture are advancing among them more rapidly with the southern than the northern tribes from circumstances of soil and climate and one of the two great divisions of the cherokee nation have now under consideration to solicit the citizenship of the united states and to be identified with us in laws and government in such progressive manner as we shall think best in consequence of the appropriations of the last session of congress for the security of our seaport towns and harbors such works of defence have been erected as seemed to be called for by the situation of the several places their relative importance and the scale of expense indicated by the amount of the appropriation these works will chiefly be finished in the course of the present season except at new york and new orleans where most was to be done and although a great proportion of the last appropriation has been expended on the former place yet some further views will be submitted by congress for rendering its security entirely adequate against naval enterprise a view of what has been done at the several places and of what is proposed to be done shall be communicated as soon as the several reports are received of the gunboats authorized by the act of december last it has been thought necessary to build only one hundred and three in the present year these    with those before possessed are sufficient for the harbors and waters exposed and the residue will require little time for their construction when it is deemed necessary under the act of the last session for raising an additional military force so many officers were immediately appointed as were necessary for carrying on the business of recruiting and in proportion as it advanced others have been added we have reason to believe their success has been satisfactory although such returns have not yet been received as enable me to present to you a statement of the numbers engaged i have not thought it necessary in the course of the last season to call for any general detachments of militia or volunteers under the law passed for that purpose for the ensuing season however they will require to be in readiness should their services be wanted some small and special detachments have been necessary to maintain the laws of embargo on that portion of our northern frontier which offered peculiar facilities for evasion but these were replaced as soon as it could be done by bodies of new recruits by the aid of these and of the armed vessels called into actual service in other quarters the spirit of disobedience and abuse which manifested itself early and with sensible effect while we were unprepared to meet it has been considerably repressed considering the extraordinary character of the times in which we live our attention should unremittingly be fixed on the safety of our country for a people who are free and who mean to remain    so a wellorganized and armed militia is their best security it is therefore incumbent on us at every meeting to revise the condition of the militia and to ask ourselves if it is prepared to repel a powerful enemy at every point of our territories exposed to invasion some of the states have paid a laudable attention to this object but every degree of neglect is to be found among others congress alone have power to produce a uniform state of preparation in this great organ of defence the interests which they so deeply feel in their own and their countrys security will present this as among the most important objects of their deliberation under the acts of march   th and april   d respecting arms the difficulty of procuring them from abroad during the present situation and dispositions of europe induced us to direct our whole efforts to the means of internal supply the public factories have therefore been enlarged additional machineries erected and in proportion as artificers can be found or formed their effect already more than doubled may be increased so as to keep pace with the yearly increase of the militia the annual sums appropriated by the latter act have been directed to the encouragement of private factories of arms and contracts have been entered into with individual undertakers to nearly the amount of the first years appropriation the suspension of our foreign commerce produced by the injustice of the belligerent powers and the consequent losses and sacrifices of our citizens are subjects of just concern the situation into  0 which we have thus been forced has impelled us to apply a portion of our industry and capital to internal manufactures and improvements the extent of this conversion is daily increasing and little doubt remains that the establishments formed and forming will—under the auspices of cheaper materials and subsistence the freedom of labor from taxation with us and of protecting duties and prohibitions—become permanent the commerce with the indians too within our own boundaries is likely to receive abundant aliment from the same internal source and will secure to them peace and the progress of civilization undisturbed by practices hostile to both the accounts of the receipts and expenditures during the year ending on the  0th day of september last being not yet made up a correct statement will hereafter be transmitted from the treasury in the meantime it is ascertained that the receipts have amounted to near eighteen millions of dollars which with the eight millions and a half in the treasury at the beginning of the year have enabled us after meeting the current demands and interest incurred to pay two millions three hundred thousand dollars of the principal of our funded debt and left us in the treasury on that day near fourteen millions of dollars of these five millions three hundred and fifty thousand dollars will be necessary to pay what will be due on the first day of january next which will complete the reimbursement of the eight per cent stock these payments with those made in the six years and a half preceding will have extinguished    thirtythree millions five hundred and eighty thousand dollars of the principal of the funded debt being the whole which could be paid or purchased within the limits of the law and our contracts and the amount of principal thus discharged will have liberated the revenue from about two millions of dollars of interest and added that sum annually to the disposable surplus the probable accumulation of the surpluses of revenue beyond what can be applied to the payment of the public debt whenever the freedom and safety of our commerce shall be restored merits the consideration of congress shall it lie unproductive in the public vaults shall the revenue be reduced or shall it rather be appropriated to the improvements of roads canals rivers education and other great foundations of prosperity and union under the powers which congress may already possess or such amendment of the constitution as may be approved by the states while uncertain of the course of things the time may be advantageously employed in obtaining the powers necessary for a system of improvement should that be thought best availing myself of this the last occasion which will occur of addressing the two houses of the legislature at their meeting i cannot omit the expression of my sincere gratitude for the repeated proofs of confidence manifested to me by themselves and their predecessors since my call to the administration and the many indulgences experienced at their hands the same grateful acknowledgments are due to my fellow citizens generally whose support has been my    great encouragement under all embarrassments in the transaction of their business i cannot have escaped error it is incident to our imperfect nature but i may say with truth my errors have been of the understanding not of intention and that the advancement of their rights and interests has been the constant motive for every measure on these considerations i solicit their indulgence looking forward with anxiety to their future destinies i trust that in their steady character unshaken by difficulties in their love of liberty obedience to law and support of the public authorities i see a sure guaranty of the permanence of our republic and retiring from the charge of their affairs i carry with me the consolation of a firm persuasion that heaven has in store for our beloved country long ages to come of prosperity and happiness thomas jefferson nov    0  washington abraham bishop to abraham bishop j mss washington nov    0  sir —not knowing whether colo humphreys would be at present at or in the neighborhood of new

the best fine cloth made in the u s is i am told at the manufacture of colo humphreys in your neighborhood could i get the favor of you to procure me there as much of his best as would make me a coat i should prefer a deep blue but if not to be had then    a black some person coming on in the stage can perhaps be found who would do me the favor of taking charge of it the amount shall be remitted to you the moment you shall be so kind as to notify it to me or paid to any member of the legislature here whom yourself or colonel humphreys agent shall indicate having so little acquaintance in or near new haven i hope you will pardon the liberty i take in proposing this trouble to you towards which the general motive will perhaps avail something i salute you with esteem  respect  thomas jefferson    0  washington lieutenant governor levi lincoln to lieutenant governor levi lincoln j mss washington nov    0  dear sir —i enclose you a petition from nantucket  refer it for your decision our opinion    here is that that place has been so deeply concerned in smuggling that if it wants it is because it has illegally sent away what it ought to have retained for its own consumption be so good as to bear in mind that i have asked the favor of you to see that your state encounters no real want while at the same time where applications are made merely to cover fraud no facilities towards that be furnished i presume there can be no want in massachusetts as yet as i am informed that governor sullivans permits are openly bought  sold here  in alexandria  at other markets the congressional campaign is just opening three alternatives alone are to be chosen from   embargo   war   submission and tribute  wonderful to tell the last will not want advocates the real question however will lie between the two first on which there is considerable division as yet the first seems most to prevail but opinions are by no means yet settled down perhaps the advocates of the  d may to a formal declaration of war prefer general letters of mark  reprisal because on a repeal of their edicts by the belligerent a revocation of the letters of mark restores peace without the delay difficulties  ceremonies of a treaty on this occasion i think it is fair to leave to those who are to act on them the decisions they prefer being to be myself but    a spectator i should not feel justified in directing measures which those who are to execute them would disapprove our situation is truly difficult we have been pressed by the belligerents to the very wall  all further retreat impracticable i salute you with sincere friendship thomas jefferson nov    0  washington william a burwell to william a burwell j mss washington nov    0  my dear sir —your friendly intimations to me as to matters respecting myself never need an apology i know them always to proceed from the kindest motives  am thankful for them i have had too many proofs of the interest you take in what concerns me to have a doubt of this but the story from richmond is one of those unfounded falsehoods which assail me regularly in whatever direction i move mr jefferson had instructions in december or january last to sell my tobo then delivered him whenever he could get   dollars you know the slight expectation entertained in the summer that gr britain would revoke her decrees  you now know the ground of that expectation but from the moment of the return of the st michael which was about the beginning of october it was known publicly that this vessel brought the most unfavorable accounts notwithstanding this from pretended london letters  lies of the federalists themselves a new hope was excited among the speculators who had given        d for tobo at    richmond some weeks before mine was sold at length the price originally limited for mine was offered to mr jefferson who thereupon sold receiving onehalf in cash the other payable in  0 days since the transaction the bitter spirits of the place have tacked to it a story that mr coles had written  his letter was shewn saying the embargo would be taken off in the first place i never heard of any letter written by mr coles till i saw it mentioned in a n y paper after my tobo was sold  the first payment remitted me in the next place mr coles letter did not say one word about the embargo it only stated to his brother that he had heard mr madison say the night before that wheat was at   sterling in england  therefore expecting that that would in some way affect prices here he strongly dissuaded him from selling his wheat he accordingly declined selling  went home this letter discouraging the sale of wheat was by that perversion so habitual with these people made to be an encouragement to the sale of my tobo mr coles has fully stated this in the richmond papers and i pray you to speak with him on the subject as he knows that his letter was totally unknown to me  in fact had no more connection with the sale of my tobo nor could when candidly stated have no more effect on its price than on the price of louisiana your suggestion of relinquishing the contract has not i think been well weighed the consequence would inevitably be that instead of giving me credit for a liberal act the federalists would consider it as a plea of guilty and give to the story a new form of    tenfold malignity  difficulty to refute conscious of having cheated the purchasers he has slunk out of a transaction which he knew could not be supported  claims merit for his meanness as if it were a liberality as sure as we live this turn or a worse one if they could find a worse would be given it and the inference of guilt would be rendered more plausible no my dear friend it has been a fair  honorable transaction and my reputation is pledged to maintain it as such and long experience has convinced me that this is not to be done by shuffling the question from one ground to another but by taking  holding to the original ground of truth were i to buy off every federal lie by a sacrifice of   or   thousand d a very few such purchases would make me as bankrupt in reputation as in fortune to buy off one lie is to give a premium for the invention of others from the moment i was proposed for my present office the volumes of calumny  falsehood issued to the public rendered impracticable every idea of going into the work of finding  proving i determined therefore to go straight forward in what was right and to rest my character with my countrymen not on depositions  affidavits but on what they should themselves witness the course of my life i have had no reason to be dissatisfied with the confidence reposed in the public on the contrary great encouragement to persevere in it to the end the federalists very evidently instead of lying me down have lied themselves down and so near the end of my career it would not be wise in me to give them a new credit by paying a respect to a new    falsehood which i had never done to former ones many of these would have required only a simple denial but i saw that even that would have led to the infallible inference that whatever i had not denied was to be presumed true i have therefore never done even this but to such of my friends as happen to converse on these subjects and i have never believed that my character could hang upon every twopenny lie of our common enemies the story in question is now an old one of about a month yet it had made so little impression on me that i had never thought of it in our conversations or i should have mentioned it to you and i cannot help believing that on reconsideration you will think that the course i propose is consonant with a system from which it would not be advisable to depart at this late day still the interest you have felt on the subject is an additional proof of your friendship and meets my sincere acknolegements to which permit me to add the assurances of my affectionate attachment  respect thomas jefferson november      0  washington thomas jefferson randolph to thomas jefferson randolph  j mss washington november      0  my dear jefferson —i have just received the enclosed letter under cover from mr bankhead which i presume is from anne and will inform you she is well mr bankhead has consented to go  pursue his studies at monticello and live with us till his pursuits or circumstances may require a separate    establishment your situation thrown at such a distance from us  alone cannot but give us all great anxieties for you as much has been secured for you by your particular position and the acquaintance to which you have been recommended as could be done towards shielding you from the dangers which surround you but thrown on a wide world among entire strangers without a friend or guardian to advise so young too and with so little experience of mankind your dangers are great  still your safety must rest on yourself a determination never to do what is wrong prudence and good humor will go far towards securing to you the estimation of the world when i recollect that at    years of age the whole care  direction of myself was thrown on myself entirely without a relation or friend qualified to advise or guide me and recollect the various sorts of bad company with which i associated from time to time i am astonished i did not turn off with some of them  become as worthless to society as they were i had the good fortune to become acquainted very early with some characters of very high standing and to feel the incessant wish that i could ever become what they were under temptations  difficulties i would ask myself what would dr small mr wythe peyton randolph do in this situation what course in it will insure me their approbation i am certain that this mode of deciding on my conduct tended more to its correctness than any reasoning powers i possessed knowing the even  dignified line they pursued i could never doubt for a moment which of two courses would be  0 in character for them whereas seeking the same object through a process of moral reasoning  with the jaundiced eye of youth i should often have erred from the circumstances of my position i was often thrown into the society of horse racers card players fox hunters scientific  professional men and of dignified men and many a time have i asked myself in the enthusiastic moment of the death of a fox the victory of a favorite horse the issue of a question eloquently argued at the bar or in the great council of the nation well which of these kinds of reputation should i prefer that of a horse jockey a fox hunter an orator or the honest advocate of my countrys rights be assured my dear jefferson that these little returns into ourselves this selfcatechising habit is not trifling nor useless but leads to the prudent selection  steady pursuit of what is right i have mentioned good humor as one of the preservatives of our peace  tranquillity it is among the most effectual and its effect is so well imitated and aided artificially by politeness that this also becomes an acquisition of first rate value in truth politeness is artificial good humor it covers the natural want of it  ends by rendering habitual a substitute nearly equivalent to the real virtue it is the practice of sacrificing to those whom we meet in society all the little conveniences  preferences which will gratify them  deprive us of nothing worth a moments consideration it is the giving a pleasing  flattering turn to our expressions which will conciliate others and make them pleased with us    as well as themselves how cheap a price for the good will of another when this is in return for a rude thing said by another it brings him to his senses it mortifies  corrects him in the most salutary way and places him at the feet of your good nature in the eyes of the company but in stating prudential rules for our government in society i must not omit the important one of never entering into dispute or argument with another i never saw an instance of one of two disputants convincing the other by argument i have seen many on their getting warm becoming rude  shooting one another conviction is the effect of our own dispassionate reasoning either in solitude or weighing within ourselves dispassionately what we hear from others standing uncommitted in argument ourselves it was one of the rules which above all others made doctor franklin the most amiable of men in society never to contradict anybody if he was urged to announce an opinion he did it rather by asking questions as if for information or by suggesting doubts when i hear another express an opinion which is not mine i say to myself he has a right to his opinion as i to mine why should i question it his error does me no injury and shall i become a don quixote to bring all men by force of argument to one opinion if a fact be misstated it is probable he is gratified by a belief of it  i have no right to deprive him of the gratification if he wants information he will ask it  then i will give it in measured terms but if he still believes his own story  shows a desire to dispute the fact with me i hear    him  say nothing it is his affair not mine if he prefers error there are two classes of disputants most frequently to be met with among us the first is of young students just entered the threshold of science with a first view of its outlines not yet filled up with the details  modifications which a further progress would bring to their knoledge the other consists of the illtempered  rude men in society who have taken up a passion for politics good humor  politeness never introduce into mixed society a question on which they foresee there will be a difference of opinion from both of those classes of disputants my dear jefferson keep aloof as you would from the infected subjects of yellow fever or pestilence consider yourself when with them as among the patients of bedlam needing medical more than moral counsel be a listener only keep within yourself and endeavor to establish with yourself the habit of silence especially on politics in the fevered state of our country no good can ever result from any attempt to set one of these fiery zealots to rights either in fact or principle they are determined as to the facts they will believe and the opinions on which they will act get by them therefore as you would by an angry bull it is not for a man of sense to dispute the road with such an animal you will be more exposed than others to have these animals shaking their horns at you because of the relation in which you stand with me full of political venom and willing to see me  to hate me as a chief in the antagonist party your presence will be to them what the vomit grass is to    the sick dog a nostrum for producing ejaculation look upon them exactly with that eye and pity them as objects to whom you can administer only occasional ease my character is not within their power it is in the hands of my fellow citizens at large and will be consigned to honor or infamy by the verdict of the republican mass of our country according to what themselves will have seen not what their enemies and mine shall have said never therefore consider these puppies in politics as requiring any notice from you  always show that you are not afraid to leave my character to the umpirage of public opinion look steadily to the pursuits which have carried you to philadelphia be very select in the society you attach yourself to avoid taverns drinkers smokers idlers  dissipated persons generally for it is with such that broils  contentions arise and you will find your path more easy and tranquil the limits of my paper warn me that it is time for me to close with my affectionate adieu p s present me affectionately to mr ogilvie  in doing the same to mr peale tell him i am writing with his polygraph  shall send him mine the first moment i have

happiness i learn with sincere pleasure that you have health  activity enough to have performed the journey to  from lancaster without inconvenience it has added another proof that you are not wearied with welldoing altho i have enjoyed as uniform health through life as reason could desire i have no expectation that even if spared to your age i shall at that period be able to take such a journey i am already sensible of decay in the power of walking and find my memory not so faithful as it used to be this may be partly owing to the incessant current of new matter flowing constantly through it but i ascribe to years their share in it also that you may be continued among us to the period of your own wishes  that it may be filled with continued health  happiness is the sincere prayer of your affectionate friend thomas jefferson january      0  washington doctor william eustis to doctor william eustis j mss washington january      0  sir —i have the pleasure to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of december the   th and of    the resolutions of the republican citizens of boston of the   th of that month these are worthy of the ancient character of the sons of massachusetts and of the spirit of concord with her sister states which and which alone carried us successfully through the revolutionary war and finally placed us under that national government which constitutes the safety of every part by uniting for its protection the powers of the whole the moment for exerting these united powers to repel the injuries of the belligerents of europe seems likely to be pressed upon us they have interdicted our commerce with nearly the whole world they have declared it shall be carried on with such places in such articles and in such measure only as they shall dictate thus prostrating all the principles of right which have hitherto protected it after exhausting the cup of forbearance and conciliation to its dregs we found it necessary on behalf of that commerce to take time to call it home into a state of safety to put the towns and harbors which carry it on into a condition of defence and to make further preparation for enforcing the redress of its wrongs and restoring it to its rightful freedom this required a certain measure of time which although not admitting specific limitation must from its avowed objects have been obvious to all and the progress actually made towards the accomplishment of these objects proves it now to be near its term while thus endeavoring to secure and preparing to vindicate that commerce the absurd opinion has been propagated that this temporary and necessary arrangement was to be a    permanent system and was intended for its destruction the sentiments expressed in the paper you were so kind as to enclose to me show that those who have concurred in them have judged with more candor the intentions of their government and are sufficiently aware of the tendency of the excitements and misrepresentations which have been practised on this occasion and such i am persuaded will be the disposition of the citizens of massachusetts at large whenever truth can reach them associated with her sister states in a common government the fundamental principle of which is that the will of the majority is to prevail sensible that in the present difficulty that will has been governed by no local interests or jealousies that to save permanent rights temporary sacrifices were necessary that these have fallen as impartially on all as in a situation so peculiar they could be made to do she will see in the existing measures a legitimate and honest exercise of the will and wisdom of the whole and her citizens faithful to themselves and their associates will not to avoid a transient pressure yield to the seductions of enemies to their independence foreign or domestic and take a course equally subversive of their wellbeing as of that of their brethren the approbation expressed by the republican citizens of the town of boston of the course pursued by the national government is truly consoling to its members and encouraged by the declaration of the continuance of their confidence and by the assurance of their support they will continue to pursue the line of their high duties according to the best of    their understandings and with undeviating regard to the good of the whole permit me to avail myself of this occasion of tendering you personally the assurances of my great esteem and respect  thomas jefferson january      0  circular letter from the secretary of war to the governors  january      0  sir —the pressure of the embargo though sensibly felt by every description of our fellow citizens has yet been cheerfully borne by most of them under the conviction that it was a temporary evil and a necessary one to save us from greater and more    permanent evils—the loss of property and surrender of rights but it would have been more cheerfully borne but for the knowledge that while honest men were religiously observing it the unprincipled along our seacoast and frontiers were fraudulently evading it and that in some parts they had even dared to break through it openly by an armed force too powerful to be opposed by the collector and his assistants to put an end to this scandalous insubordination to the laws the legislature has authorized the president to empower proper persons to employ militia for preventing or suppressing armed or riotous assemblages of persons resisting the customhouse officers in the exercise of their duties or opposing or violating the embargo laws he sincerely hopes that during the short time which these restrictions are expected to continue no other instances will take place of a crime of so deep a die but it is made his duty to take the measures necessary to meet it he therefore requests you as commanding officer of the militia of your state to appoint some officer of the militia of known respect for the laws in or near to each port of entry within your state with orders when applied to by the collector of the district to assemble immediately a sufficient force of his militia and to employ them efficaciously to maintain the authority of the laws respecting the embargo and that you notify to each collector the officer to whom by your appointment he is so to apply for aid when necessary he has referred this appointment to your excellency because your knowledge of characters    or means of obtaining it will enable you to select one who can be most confided in to exercise so serious a power with all the discretion the forbearance the kindness even which the enforcement of the law will possibly admit—ever to bear in mind that the life of a citizen is never to be endangered but as the last melancholy effort for the maintenance of order and obedience to the laws thomas jefferson january      0  washington thomas leiper to thomas leiper j mss washington january      0  dear sir —your letter of the   th was duly received and before that towers book which you had been so kind as to send me had come to hand for which i pray you to receive my thanks you judge rightly that here i have no time to read a cursory view of the book shows me that the author is a man of much learning in his line i have heard of some other late writer the name i forget who has undertaken to prove contrary events from the same sources and particularly that england is not to be put down and that this is the favorite author in that country as to myself my religious reading has long been confined to the moral branch of religion which is the same in all religions while in that branch which consists of dogmas all differ all have a different set the former instructs us how to live well and worthily in society the latter are made to interest our minds in the support of the teachers who inculcate them hence for one sermon on a moral subject you hear ten on the dogmas of  0 the sect however religion is not the subject for you and me neither of us know the religious opinions of the other that is a matter between our maker and ourselves we understand each other better in politics to which therefore i will proceed the house of representatives passed last night a bill for the meeting of congress on the   d of may this substantially decides the course they mean to pursue that is to let the embargo continue till then when it will cease and letters of marque and reprisal be issued against such nations as shall not then have repealed their obnoxious edicts the great majority seem to have made up their minds on this while there is considerable diversity of opinion on the details of preparation to wit naval force volunteers army nonintercourse c i write freely to you because i know that in stating facts you will not quote names you know that every syllable uttered in my name becomes a text for the federalists to torment the public mind on by their paraphrases and perversions i have lately inculcated the encouragement of manufactures to the extent of our own consumption at least in all articles of which we raise the raw material on this the federal papers and meetings have sounded the alarm of chinese policy destruction of commerce c that is to say the iron which we make must not be wrought here into ploughs axes hoes c in order that the shipowner may have the profit of carrying it to europe and bringing it back in a manufactured form as if after manufacturing our own raw materials for our own use there would not    be a surplus produce sufficient to employ a due proportion of navigation in carrying it to market and exchanging it for those articles of which we have not the raw material yet this absurd hue and cry has contributed much to federalize new england their doctrine goes to the sacrificing agriculture and manufactures to commerce to the calling all our people from the interior country to the seashore to turn merchants and to convert this great agricultural country into a city of amsterdam but i trust the good sense of our country will see that its greatest prosperity depends on a due balance between agriculture manufactures and commerce and not in this protuberant navigation which has kept us in hot water from the commencement of our government and is now engaging us in war that this may be avoided if it can be done without a surrender of rights is my sincere prayer accept the assurances of my constant esteem and respect thomas jefferson january    0  washington abraham venable to abraham venable j mss washington january    0  dear sir —in a letter to my friend  relation mr jefferson i explained to him the unexpected difficulties into which i was likely to fall on my winding up my affairs here with a request to endeavor to procure me the aid of the bank at richmond you have been so kind as to interpose and to procure for me the sum needed on private loan which is infinitely more eligible for myself it is the more so inasmuch    as your friendly undertaking to be my indorser contrary to a necessary rule you had established will by remaining unknown not expose you to other solicitations of the like kind i return you my dear sir my sincere thanks for this friendly relief and shall ever retain a lively sense of it  the greater as i should never have thought myself entitled to ask such a favor of you in addition to the resources for repaiment mentioned in the letter to mr jefferson i have directed my agents in bedford  albermarle to offer in each place a tract of land for sale worth each from   to   thousand d a crop of tobo which will be in his hands the next month will make a first impression on the amount and with another a twelve month hence will discharge  000 d of the sum for the balance i must depend on the sale of some of those lands of which one tract alone is certain an offer having been made to me for that lands are of difficult sale for this reason i have asked the indulgence of a twelve month certain the note sent me is for   months but i presume will be renewable otherwise i should be forced at its expiration to have recourse to the bank repeating again my extreme obligation to you i salute you with great esteem  respect     thomas jefferson january      0  washington james monroe to james monroe j mss washington january      0  dear sir —your favor of the   th was received in due time and the answer has been delayed as well by a pressure of business as by the expectation of your absence from richmond    the idea of sending a special mission to france or england is not entertained at all here after so little attention to us from the former and so insulting an answer from canning such a mark of respect as an extraordinary mission would be a degradation against which all minds revolt here the idea was hazarded in the house of representatives a few days ago by a member and an approbation expressed by another but rejected indignantly by    every other person who spoke and very generally in conversation by all others and i am satisfied such a proposition would get no vote in the senate the course the legislature means to pursue may be inferred from the act now passed for a meeting in may and a proposition before them for repealing the embargo in june and then resuming and maintaining by force our right of navigation there will be considerable opposition to this last proposition not only from the federalists old and new who oppose everything but from sound members of the majority yet it is believed it will obtain a good majority and that it is the only proposition which can be devised that could obtain a majority of any kind final propositions will therefore be soon despatched to both the belligerents through the resident ministers so that their answers will be received before the meeting in may and will decide what is to be done this last trial for peace is not thought desperate if as is expected bonaparte should be successful in spain however every virtuous and liberal sentiment revolts at it it may induce both powers to be more accommodating with us england will see here the only asylum for her commerce and manufactures worth more to her than her orders of council and bonaparte having spain at his feet will look immediately to the spanish colonies and think our neutrality cheaply purchased by a repeal of the illegal parts of his decrees with perhaps the floridas thrown into the bargain should a change in the aspect of affairs in europe produce this disposition in both powers our peace and prosperity may be    revived and long continue otherwise we must again take the tented field as we did in      under more inauspicious circumstances there never has been a situation of the world before in which such endeavors as we have made would not have secured our peace it is probable there never will be such another if we go to war now i fear we may renounce forever the hope of seeing an end of our national debt if we can keep at peace eight years longer our income liberated from debt will be adequate to any war without new taxes or loans and our position and increasing strength put us hors dinsulte from any nation i am now so near the moment of retiring that i take no part in affairs beyond the expression of an opinion i think it fair that my successor should now originate those measures of which he will be charged with the execution and responsibility and that it is my duty to clothe them with the forms of authority five weeks more will relieve me from a drudgery to which i am no longer equal and restore me to a scene of tranquillity amidst my family and friends more congenial to my age and natural inclinations in that situation it will always be a pleasure to me to see you and to repeat to you the assurances of my constant friendship and respect thomas jefferson february     0  washington thomas mann randolph to thomas mann randolph j mss washington february     0  dear sir —i thought congress had taken their ground firmly for continuing their embargo till june    and then war but a sudden and unacountable revolution of opinion took place the last week chiefly among the new england and new york members and in a kind of panic they voted the  th of march for removing the embargo and by such a majority as gave all reason to believe they would not agree either to war or nonintercourse this too was after we had become satisfied that the essex junto had found their expectation desperate of inducing the people there to either separation or forcible opposition the majority of congress however has now rallied to the removing the embargo on the  th of march nonintercourse with france and great britain trade everywhere else and continuing war preparations the further details are not yet settled but i believe it is perfectly certain that the embargo will be taken off the  th of march present my warmest affections to my dearest martha and the young ones and accept the assurances of them to yourself thomas jefferson february      0  washington benjamin stoddert to benjamin stoddert j mss washington february      0  sir —your favor of january   th had been duly received and i was waiting in the hope i might find a moment of less pressure in which i might answer it somewhat in detail when that of the   th inst came to hand finding that instead of any relaxation of business it crowds more on me as i approach my departure i can only indulge myself in a very brief reply as to the rights of the united states as a neutral power our opinions are very different mine    being that when two nations go to war it does not abridge the rights of neutral nations but in the two articles of blockade and contraband of war but on this subject we have both probably read and thought so much as to have made up our minds and it is not likely that either can make a convert of the other with respect to the interests of the united states in this exuberant commerce which is now bringing war on us we concur perfectly it brings us into collision with other powers in every sea and will force us into every war of the european powers the converting this great agricultural country into a city of amsterdam—a mere headquarters for carrying on the commerce of all nations with one another is too absurd yet this is the real object of the drawback system—it enriches a few individuals but lessens the stock of native productions by withdrawing from them all the hands thus employed it is essentially interesting to us to have shipping and seamen enough to carry our surplus produce to market but beyond that i do not think we are bound to give it encouragement by drawbacks or other premiums i wish you may be right in supposing that the trading states would now be willing to give up the drawbacks and to denationalize all ships taking foreign articles on board for any other destination than the united states on being secured by discriminating duties or otherwise in the exclusive carryage of the produce of the united states i should doubt it were such a proposition to come from them i presume it would meet with little difficulty otherwise i suppose it must wait    till peace when the right of drawback will be less valued than the exclusive carryage of our own produce no apology was necessary for the letters you were so kind as to write me on this subject i have always received with thankfulness the ideas of judicious persons on subjects interesting to the public in the present case i thought i should better fulfil your objects by communicating your letters to my successor to whose views i have thought it my duty to give the lead ever since his designation as to all matters which he would have to execute nothing will probably be done on this subject in the few days between this and my retirement and in that situation i shall certainly divorce myself from all part in political affairs to get rid of them is the principal object of my retirement and the first thing necessary to the happiness which you justly observe it is in vain to look for in any other situation i pray you to accept my salutations and assurances of respect thomas jefferson february      0  washington henri gregoire to henri gregoire j mss washington february      0  sir —i have received the favor of your letter of august   th and with it the volume you were so kind as to send me on the literature of negroes be assured that no person living wishes more sincerely than i do to see a complete refutation of the doubts i have myself entertained and expressed on the grade of understanding allotted to them by nature and to find that in this respect they are on a  00 par with ourselves my doubts were the result of personal observation on the limited sphere of my own state where the opportunities for the development of their genius were not favorable and those of exercising it still less so i expressed them therefore with great hesitation but whatever be their degree of talent it is no measure of their rights because sir isaac newton was superior to others in understanding he was not therefore lord of the person or property of others on this subject they are gaining daily in the opinions of nations and hopeful advances are making towards their reestablishment on an equal footing with the other colors of the human family i pray you therefore to accept my thanks for the many instances you have enabled me to observe of respectable intelligence in that race of men which cannot fail to have effect in hastening the day of their relief and to be assured of the sentiments of high and just esteem and consideration which i tender to yourself with all sincerity thomas jefferson february      0  washington thomas mann randolph to thomas mann randolph j mss washington february      0  my dear sir —by yesterdays mail i learn that it would be the desire of many of the good citizens of our country to meet me on the road on my return home as a manifestation of their good will but it is quite impossible for me to ascertain the day on which i shall leave this the accumulated business at the close of a session will prevent my making any  0  preparation for my departure till after the  th of march after that the arrangement of papers and business to be delivered over to my successor the winding up of my own affairs and clearing out from this place will employ me for several days i cannot conjecture even how many so as to render the commencement and consequently the termination of my journey altogether uncertain but it is a sufficient happiness to me to know that my fellowcitizens of the country generally entertain for me the kind sentiments which have prompted this proposition without giving to so many the trouble of leaving their homes to meet a single individual i shall have opportunities of taking them individually by the hand at our courthouse and other public places and of exchanging assurances of mutual esteem certainly it is the greatest consolation to me to know that in returning to the bosom of my native country i shall be again in the midst of their kind affections and i can say with truth that my return to them will make me happier than i have been since i left them nothing will be wanting on my part to merit the continuance of their good will the house of representatives passed yesterday by a vote of    to  0 the bill from the senate repealing the embargo the  th of march except against great britain and france and their dependencies establishing a nonintercourse with them and having struck out the clause for letters of marque and reprisal which it is thought the senate will still endeavor to reinstate i send you a paper containing the last spanish news yours affectionately  0  thomas jefferson march   0  circular letter j mss march   0  the friendship which has long subsisted between the president of the united states and myself gave me reason to expect on my retirement from office that i might often receive applications to interpose with him on behalf of persons desiring appointments such an abuse of his dispositions towards me would necessarily lead to the loss of them and to the transforming me from the character of a friend to that of an unreasonable  troublesome solicitor it therefore became necessary for me to lay down as a law for my future conduct never to interpose in any case either with him or the heads of departments from whom it must go to him in any application whatever for office to this rule i must scrupulously adhere for were i to depart from it in a single instance i could no longer plead it with truth to my friends in excuse for my not complying with their requests i hope therefore that the declining it in the present as in every other case will be ascribed to its true cause the obligation of this general law  not to any disinclination existing in this particular case  still less to an unwillingness to be useful to my friends on all occasions not forbidden by a special impropriety thomas jefferson march     0  washington william short to william short j mss washington march     0  dear sir —it is with much concern i inform you that the senate has negatived your appointment  0  we thought it best to keep back the nomination to the close of the session that the mission might remain secret as long as possible which you know was our purpose from the beginning it was then sent in with an explanation of its object and motives we took for granted if any hesitation should arise that the senate would take time and that our friends in that body would make inquiries of us and give us the opportunity of explaining and removing objections but to our great surprise and with an unexampled precipitancy they rejected it at once this reception of the last of my official communications to them could not be unfelt nor were the causes of it spoken out by them under this uncertainty mr madison on his entering into office proposed another person john q adams he also was negatived and they adjourned sine die our subsequent information was that on your nomination your long absence from this country and their idea that you do not intend to return to it had very sensible weight but that all other motives were superseded by an unwillingness to extend our diplomatic connections and a desire even to recall the foreign ministers we already have all were sensible of the great virtues the high character the powerful influence and valuable friendship of the emperor but riveted to the system of unentanglement with europe they declined the proposition on this subject you will receive the official explanations from mr smith the secretary of state i pray you to place me rectus in curiâ in this business with the emperor and to assure him that i carry into  0  my retirement the highest veneration for his virtues and fondly cherish the belief that his dispositions and power are destined by heaven to better in some degree at least the condition of oppressed man i have nothing new to inform you as to your private friends or acquaintances our embargo has worked hard it has in fact federalized three of the new england states connecticut you know was so before we have substituted for it a nonintercourse with france and england and their dependencies and a trade to all other places it is probable the belligerents will take our vessels under their edicts in which case we shall probably declare war against them i write this in the midst of packing and preparing for my departure of visits of leave and interruptions of every kind i must therefore conclude with my affectionate adieu to you and assurances of my constant attachment and respect thomas jefferson april     0  to the inhabitants of albemarle county in virginia april     0  returning to the scenes of my birth and early life to the society of those with whom i was raised and who have been ever dear to me i receive fellow citizens and neighbors with inexpressible pleasure the cordial welcome you are so good as to give me long absent on duties which the history of a wonderful era made incumbent on those called to them the  0  pomp the turmoil the bustle and splendor of office have drawn but deeper sighs for the tranquil and irresponsible occupations of private life for the enjoyment of an affectionate intercourse with you my neighbors and friends and the endearments of family love which nature has given us all as the sweetener of every hour for these i gladly lay down the distressing burthen of power and seek with my fellow citizens repose and safety under the watchful cares the labors and perplexities of younger and abler minds the anxieties you express to administer to my happiness do of themselves confer that happiness and the measure will be complete if my endeavors to fulfil my duties in the several public stations to which i have been called have obtained for me the approbation of my country the part which i have acted on the theatre of public life has been before them and to their sentence i submit it but the testimony of my native country of the individuals who have known me in private life to my conduct in its various duties and relations is the more grateful as proceeding from eye witnesses and observers from triers of the vicinage of you then my neighbors i may ask in the face of the world whose ox have i taken or whom have i defrauded whom have i oppressed or of whose hand have i received a bribe to blind mine eyes therewith on your verdict i rest with conscious security your wishes for my happiness are received with just sensibility and i offer sincere prayers for your own welfare and prosperity  0  thomas jefferson april      0  monticello james madison to james madison j mss monticello april      0  dear sir —i have to acknowledge your favor of the  th and to thank you for the political information it contained reading the newspapers but little and that little but as the romance of the day a word of truth now and then comes like the drop of water on the tongue of dives if the british ministry are changing their policy towards us it is because their nation or rather the city of london which is the nation to them is shaken as usual by the late reverses in spain i have for some time been persuaded that the government of england was systematically decided to claim a dominion of the sea and to levy contributions on all nations by their licenses to navigate in order to maintain that dominion to which their own resources are inadequate the mobs of their cities are unprincipled enough to support this policy in prosperous times but change with the tide of fortune and the ministers to keep their places change with them i wish mr oakley may not embarrass you with his conditions of revoking the orders of council enough of the nonimportation law should be reserved  st to pinch them into a relinquishment of impressments and  d to support those manufacturing establishments which their orders and our interests forced us to make i suppose the conquest of spain will soon force a delicate question on you as to the floridas and cuba which will offer themselves to you napoleon will certainly give his consent without difficulty to our  0  receiving the floridas and with some difficulty possibly cuba and though he will disregard the obligation whenever he thinks he can break it with success yet it has a great effect on the opinion of our people and the world to have the moral right on our side of his agreement as well as that of the people of those countries mr hackleys affair is really unfortunate he has been driven into this arrangement by his distresses which are great he is a perfectly honest man as is well known here where he was born but unaccustomed to political subjects he has not seen it in that view but a respect for the innocence of his views cannot authorize the sanction of government to such an example thomas jefferson may    0  monticello wilson cary nicholas to wilson cary nicholas j mss monticello may    0  dear sir —i am sorry to hear of your attack of rheumatism both on your own account  that of the public  i think you will have to go on as soon as you are able i believe that immediately on the pacification with england a vessel was dispatched to france for the ultimatum of that government as i presume turreau was earnest in giving assurances that napoleon would revoke his decrees considering great britain as having retraced her steps but as a contrary answer is possible i suppose congress will await the return of the vessel if she brings a determination to continue taking our vessels on the high  0  seas the question of war on our part cannot but be brought on because on his part it is all the war he can wage and we may as well receive the offers of the floridas  cuba which will probably be made to us by their inhabitants should the republican party think we might as well make war on our part also they will for once probably have the concurrence of the federalists this question is too important to admit of your absence and the importance of giving good support to the new admn is an additional reason for your going as to the merits of the result of our measures against england mr madison is justly entitled to his full share of all the measures of my administration our principles were the same and we never differed sensibly in the application of them i am glad therefore that my enemies  hope that my friends will do him justice as to this  all our other measures we shall be happy to see you here on your passage being affectionately  respectfully yours thomas jefferson june      0  monticello wilson cary nicholas to wilson cary nicholas j mss monticello june      0  dear sir —i did not know till mr patterson called on us a few days ago that you had passed on to washington i had recently observed in the debates of congress a matter introduced on which i wished to give explanations more fully in conversation which i will now do by abridgement in writing mr randolph has proposed an inquiry into certain prosecutions at common law in connecticut for  0  libels on the government and not only himself but others have stated them with such affected caution and such hints at the same time as to leave on every mind the impression that they had been instituted either by my direction or with my acquiescence at least this has not been denied by my friends because probably the fact is unknown to them i shall state it for their satisfaction and leave it to be disposed of as they think best i had observed in a newspaper some years ago i do not recollect the time exactly some dark hints of a prosecution in connecticut but so obscurely hinted that i paid little attention to it some considerable time after it was again mentioned so that i understood that some prosecution was going on in the federal court there for calumnies uttered from the pulpit against me by a clergyman i immediately wrote to mr granger who i think was in connecticut at the time stating that i had laid it down as a law to myself to take no notice of the thousand calumnies issued against me but to trust my character to my own conduct and the good sense and candor of my fellow citizens that i had found no reason to be dissatisfied with that course and i was unwilling it should be broke through by others as to any matter concerning me and i therefore requested him to desire the district attorney to dismiss the prosecution some time after this i heard of subpœnas being served on general lee david m randolph and others as witnesses to attend the trial i then for the first time conjectured the subject of the libel i immediately wrote to mr granger   0 to require an immediate dismission of the prosecution the answer of mr huntington the district attorney was that these subpœnas had been issued by the defendant without his knowledge that it had been his intention to dismiss all the prosecutions at the first meeting of the court and to accompany it with an avowal of his opinion that they could not be maintained because the federal court had no jurisdiction over libels this was accordingly done i did not till then know that there were other prosecutions of the same nature nor do i now know what were their subjects but all went off together and i afterwards saw in the hands of mr granger a letter written by the clergyman disavowing any personal ill will towards me and solemnly declaring he had never uttered the words charged i think mr granger either showed me or said there were affidavits of at least half a dozen respectable men who were present at the sermon and swore no such expressions were uttered and as many equally respectable who swore the contrary but the clergyman expressed his gratification at the dismission of the prosecution i write all this from memory and after too long an interval of time to be certain of the exactness of all the details but i am sure there is no variation material and mr granger correcting small lapses of memory can confirm everything substantial certain it is that the prosecution had been instituted and had made considerable progress without my knowledge that they were disapproved by me as soon as known and directed to be discontinued the attorney did it on the same     ground on which i had acted myself in the cases of duane callendar and others to wit that the sedition law was unconstitutional and null and that my obligation to execute what was law involved that of not suffering rights secured by valid laws to be prostrated by what was no law i always understood that these prosecutions had been invited if not instituted by judge edwards and the marshal being republican had summoned a grand jury partly or wholly republican but that mr huntington declared from the beginning against the jurisdiction of the court and had determined to enter nolle prosequis before he received my directions i trouble you with another subject the law making my letters post free goes to those to me only not those from me the bill had got to its passage before this was observed and first i believe by mr dana and the house under too much pressure of business near the close of the session to bring in another bill as the privilege of freedom was given to the letters from as well as to both my predecessors i suppose no reason exists for making a distinction and in so extensive a correspondence as i am subject to and still considerably on public matters it would be a sensible convenience to myself as well as those who have occasion to receive letters from me it happens too as i was told at the time for i have never looked into it myself that it was done by two distinct acts on both the former occasions mr eppes i think mentioned this to me i know from the post master general that mr adams franks all his letters i state this matter to you as being my     representative which must apologize for the trouble of it we have been seasonable since you left us yesterday evening and this morning we have had refreshing showers which will close and confirm the business of planting affectionately yours thomas jefferson june    0  monticello james madison to james madison j mss monticello june    0  dear sir —i inclose you three letters from detained seamen which came to hand by the last post your favor of the   th was received at the same time the intelligence by the pacific gives me great anxiety when i consider the tenor of the new order of council  the official exposition of it by the lords of trade to the london american merchants in the inclosed paper and compare it with the engagement of erskine under instructions given two months before i am at a loss from which we have most to fear the folly or the faithlessness of the cannings  castlereaghs of the british ministry is it possible that to get themselves out of a former hobble they should have involved themselves in another so much more difficult and yet if they mean to adhere to the new order their instructions to erskine to enter into engagements in direct opposition to it would be such a wanton abandonment of all pretensions to common honesty as one would suppose no men could deliberately intend et cui bono merely to catch a partial supply by a temporary relaxation of our measures it seems impossible to believe either alternative  yet the one     or the other must be true i presume it will produce some caution  hesitation in the proceedings of congress my joy on our supposed settlement is extremely damped by the occurrence of a trick so strange whatever solution may be given of it and i fear a return of our difficulties  it will be with increased force if they do recur i sincerely wish a happy issue from them for your own sake as well as for that of us all i am very happy in being enabled to relieve you from the disagreeable situation into which my improvidence had drawn your kind friendship i felt severely the impropriety of dragging your name into the bank as i had often been mortified with my own being there but a too late attention to the state of my affairs at washington had rendered it unavoidable mr barnes is now enabled to discharge my note at the bank as well as a balance due to himself and the separate account between you  myself may await your own entire convenience without in the least incommoding me and i pray you to be assured of the sensibility with which i have experienced your kind accommodation to my difficulties for the last three days we have had fine  plentiful showers of rain  were willing they should cease as appearances promised last night but it commenced raining in the night  now continues with the wind at northeast this may become dangerous to the wheat which at best can only be a middling crop that of tobacco cannot become great if the observation of the planters is correct that there never was a great crop of tobacco which was not patched     before the last of may this year not a plant was in the ground till june but the rains have been so favorable since that the whole crop is now standing  growing i salute you with sincere affection  respect thomas jefferson july      0  monticello james madison to james madison j mss monticello july      0  dear sir —your two letters of the  th and  th were received by the last mail i now enclose you the rough draught of the letter to the emperor of russia i think there must be an exact fac simile of it in the office from which mr shorts must have been copied because that the one now enclosed has never been out of my hands appears by there being no fold in the paper till now and it is evidently a polygraphical copy i send for your perusal letters of w short and of warden because though private they contain some things and views perhaps not in the public letters bonapartes successes have been what we expected although warden appears to have supposed the contrary possible it is fortunate for bonaparte that he has not caught his brother emperor that he has left an ostensible head to the government who may sell it to him to secure a mess of pottage for himself had the government devolved on the people as it did in spain they would resist his conquest as those of spain do i expect within a week or ten days to visit bedford my absence will be of about a fortnight i know too well the pressure of business which will be on you     at montpelier to count with certainty on the pleasure of seeing mrs madison and yourself here yet my wishes do not permit me to omit the expression of them in any event i shall certainly intrude a flying visit on you during your stay in orange with my respectful devoirs to mrs madison i salute you with constant friendship and respect thomas jefferson september     0  monticello john w campbell to john w campbell j mss monticello september     0  sir —your letter of july   th came to hand some time since but i have not sooner been able to acknowledge it in answer to your proposition for publishing a complete edition of my different writings i must observe that no writings of mine other than those merely official have been published except the notes on virginia and a small pamphlet under the title of a summary view of the rights of british america the notes on virginia i have always intended to revise and enlarge and have from time to time laid by materials for that purpose it will be long yet before other occupations will permit me to digest them and observations and inquiries are still to be made which will be more correct in proportion to the length of time they are continued it is not unlikely that this may be through my life i could not therefore at present offer anything new for that work the summary view was not written for publication it was a draught i had prepared for a petition to the king which i meant to propose in my place as a     member of the convention of      being stopped on the road by sickness i sent it on to the speaker who laid it on the table for the perusal of the members it was thought too strong for the times and to become the act of the convention but was printed by subscription of the members with a short preface written by one of them if it had any merit it was that of first taking our true ground and that which was afterwards assumed and maintained i do not mention the parliamentary manual published for the use of the senate of the united states because it was a mere compilation into which nothing entered of my own but the arrangement and a few observations necessary to explain that and some of the cases i do not know whether your view extends to official papers of mine which have been published many of these would be like old newspapers materials for future historians but no longer interesting to the readers of the day they would consist of reports correspondences messages answers to addresses a few of my reports while secretary of state might perhaps be read by some as essays on abstract subjects such as the report on measures weights and coins on the mint on the fisheries on commerce on the use of distilled seawater c the correspondences with the british and french ministers hammond and genet were published by congress the messages to congress which might have been interesting at the moment would scarcely be read a second time and answers to addresses are hardly read a first time     so that on a review of these various materials i see nothing encouraging a printer to a republication of them they would probably be bought by those only who are in the habit of preserving state papers and who are not many i say nothing of numerous draughts of reports resolutions declarations c drawn as a member of congress or of the legislature of virginia such as the declaration of independence report on the money mint of the united states the act of religious freedom c c these having become the acts of public bodies there can be no personal claim to them and they would no more find readers now than the journals and statute books in which they are deposited i have presented this general view of the subjects which might have been within the scope of your contemplation that they might be correctly estimated before any final decision they belong mostly to a class of papers not calculated for popular reading and not likely to offer profit or even indemnification to the republisher submitting it to your consideration i tender you my salutations and respects thomas jefferson october     0  monticello don valentine de foronda to don valentine de foronda j mss monticello october     0  dear sir —your favor of august the   th came to hand in the succeeding month and i have now to thank you for the pamphlet it contained i have read it with pleasure and find the constitution     proposed would probably be as free as is consistent with hereditary institutions it has one feature which i like much that which provides that when the three coordinate branches differ in their construction of the constitution the opinion of two branches shall overrule the third our constitution has not sufficiently solved this difficulty among the multitude of characters with which public office leads us to official intercourse we cannot fail to observe many whose personal worth marks them as objects of particular esteem whom we would wish to select for our society in private life i avail myself gladly of the present occasion of assuring you that i was peculiarly impressed with your merit and talents and that i have ever entertained for them a particular respect to those whose views are single and direct it is a great comfort to have to do business with frank and honorable minds and here give me leave to make an avowal for which in my present retirement there can be no motive but a regard for truth your predecessor soured on a question of etiquette against the administration of this country wished to impute wrong to them in all their actions even where he did not believe it himself in this spirit he wished it to be believed that we were in unjustifiable cooperation in mirandas expedition i solemnly and on my personal truth and honor declare to you that this was entirely without foundation and that there was neither cooperation nor connivance on our part he informed us he was about to attempt the liberation of his native country from bondage and intimated a     hope of our aid or connivance at least he was at once informed that although we had great cause of complaint against spain and even of war yet whenever we should think proper to act as her enemy it should be openly and above board and that our hostility should never be exercised by such petty means we had no suspicion that he expected to engage men here but merely to purchase military stores against this there was no law nor consequently any authority for us to interpose obstacles on the other hand we deemed it improper to betray his voluntary communication to the agents of spain although his measures were many days in preparation at new york we never had the least intimation or suspicion of his engaging men in his enterprise until he was gone and i presume the secrecy of his proceeding kept them equally unknown to the marquis yrujo at philadelphia and the spanish consul at new york since neither of them gave us any information of the enlistment of men until it was too late for any measures taken at washington to prevent their departure the officer in the customs who participated in this transaction with miranda we immediately removed and should have had him and others fully punished had it not been for the protection given them by private citizens at new york in opposition to the government who by their impudent falsehoods and calumnies were able to overbear the minds of the jurors be assured sir that no motive could induce me at this time to make this declaration so gratuitously were it not founded in sacred truth and i will add further that   0 i never did or countenanced in public life a single act inconsistent with the strictest good faith having never believed there was one code of morality for a public and another for a private man i receive with great pleasure the testimonies of personal esteem which breathes through your letter and i pray you to accept those equally sincere with which i now salute you thomas jefferson october     0  monticello joel barlow to joel barlow j mss monticello october     0  dear sir —it is long since i ought to have acknowledged the receipt of your most excellent oration on the  th of july i was doubting what you could say equal to your own reputation on so hackneyed a subject but you have really risen out of it with lustre and pointed to others a field of great expansion a day or two after i received your letter to bishop gregoire a copy of his diatribe to you came to hand from france i had not before heard of it he must have been eagleeyed in quest of offence to have discovered ground for it among the rubbish massed together in the print he animadverts on you have done right in giving him a sugary answer but he did not deserve it for notwithstanding a compliment to you now and then he constantly returns to the identification of your sentiments with the extravagances of the revolutionary zealots i believe him a very good man with imagination enough to declaim eloquently but     without judgment to decide he wrote to me also on the doubts i had expressed five or six and twenty years ago in the notes of virginia as to the grade of understanding of the negroes and he sent me his book on the literature of the negroes his credulity has made him gather up every story he could find of men of color without distinguishing whether black or of what degree of mixture however slight the mention or light the authority on which they are quoted the whole do not amount in point of evidence to what we know ourselves of banneker we know he had spherical trigonometry enough to make almanacs but not without the suspicion of aid from ellicot who was his neighbor and friend and never missed an opportunity of puffing him i have a long letter from banneker which shows him to have had a mind of very common stature indeed as to bishop gregoire i wrote him as you have done a very soft answer it was impossible for doubt to have been more tenderly or hesitatingly expressed than that was in the notes of virginia and nothing was or is farther from my intentions than to enlist myself as the champion of a fixed opinion where i have only expressed a doubt st domingo will in time throw light on the question i intended ere this to have sent you the papers i had promised you but i have taken up marshalls fifth volume and mean to read it carefully to correct what is wrong in it and commit to writing such facts and annotations as the reading of that work will bring into my recollection and which has not yet been put on paper in this i shall be much     aided by my memorandums and letters and will send you both the old and the new  but i go on very slowly in truth during the pleasant season i am always out of doors employed not passing more time at my writing table than will despatch my     current business but when the weather becomes cold i shall go out but little i hope therefore to get through this volume during the ensuing winter but should you want the papers sooner they shall be sent at a moments warning the ride from     washington to monticello in the stage or in a gig is so easy that i had hoped you would have taken a flight here during the season of good roads whenever mrs barlow is well enough to join you in such a visit it must be taken more at ease it will give us real pleasure whenever it may take place i pray you to present me to her respectfully and i salute you affectionately thomas jefferson october      0  monticello albert gallatin to albert gallatin j mss monticello october      0  dear sir —i do not know whether the request of monsieur moussier explained in the enclosed letter is grantable or not but my partialities in favor of whatever may promote either the useful or liberal arts induce me to place it under your consideration to do in it whatever is right neither more nor less i would then ask you to favor me with three lines in such form as i may forward him by way of answer i have reflected much and painfully on the change of dispositions which has taken place among the members of the cabinet since the new arrangement as you stated to me in the moment of our separation it would be indeed a great public calamity were it to fix you in the purpose which you seemed to think possible i consider the fortunes of our republic as depending in an eminent degree on the extinguishment of the public debt before we engage in any war because that done we shall have revenue enough to improve our country in peace and     defend it in war without recurring either to new taxes or loans but if the debt should once more be swelled to a formidable size its entire discharge will be despaired of and we shall be committed to the english career of debt corruption and rottenness closing with revolution the discharge of the debt therefore is vital to the destinies of our government and it hangs on mr madison and yourself alone we shall never see another president and secretary of the treasury making all other objects subordinate to this were either of you to be lost to the public that great hope is lost i had always cherished the idea that you would fix on that object the measure of your fame and of the gratitude which our country will owe you nor can i yield up this prospect to the secondary considerations which assail your tranquility for sure i am they never can produce any other serious effect your value is too justly estimated by our fellow citizens at large as well as their functionaries to admit any remissness in their support of you my opinion always was that none of us ever occupied stronger ground in the esteem of congress than yourself and i am satisfied there is no one who does not feel your aid to be still as important for the future as it has been for the past you have nothing therefore to apprehend in the dispositions of congress and still less of the president who above all men is the most interested and affectionately disposed to support you i hope then you will abandon entirely the idea you expressed to me and that you will consider the eight years to come     as essential to your political career i should certainly consider any earlier day of your retirement as the most inauspicious day our new government has ever seen in addition to the common interest in this question i feel particularly for myself the considerations of gratitude which i personally owe you for your valuable aid during my administration of public affairs a just sense of the large portion of the public approbation which was earned by your labors and belongs to you and the sincere friendship and attachment which grew out of our joint exertions to promote the common good and of which i pray you now to accept the most cordial and respectful assurances thomas jefferson november  0   0  monticello james madison to james madison j mss monticello november  0   0  dear sir —i received last night yours of the   th and rode this morning to col monroes i found him preparing to set out tomorrow morning for london from whence he will not return till christmas i had an hour or twos frank conversation with him the catastrophe of poor lewis served to lead us to the point intended i reminded him that in the letter i wrote to him while in europe proposing the government of orleans i also suggested that of louisiana if fears for health should be opposed to the other i said something on the importance of the post its advantages c—expressed my regret at the curtain which seemed to be drawn between him and his best friends and my     wish to see his talents and integrity engaged in the service of his country again and that his going into any post would be a signal of reconciliation on which the body of republicans who lamented his absence from the public service would again rally to him these are the general heads of what i said to him in the course of our conversation the sum of his answers was that to accept of that office was incompatible with the respect he owed himself that he never would act in any office where he should be subordinate to any body but the president himself or which did not place his responsibility substantially with the president and the nation that at your accession to the chair he would have accepted a place in the cabinet and would have exerted his endeavors most faithfully in support of your fame and measures that he is not unready to serve the public and especially in the case of any difficult crisis in our affairs that he is satisfied that such is the deadly hatred of both france and england and such their self reproach and dread at the spectacle of such a government as ours that they will spare nothing to destroy it that nothing but a firm union among the whole body of republicans can save it and therefore that no schism should be indulged on any ground that in his present situation he is sincere in his anxieties for the success of the administration and in his support of it as far as the limited sphere of his action or influence extends that his influence to this end had been used with those with whom the world had ascribed to him an interest he did not possess until whatever it was it     was lost he particularly named j randolph who he said had plans of his own on which he took no advice and that he was now pursuing what he believed his properest occupation devoting his whole time and faculties to the liberation of his pecuniary embarrassments which three years of close attention he hoped would effect in order to know more exactly what were the kinds of employ he would accept i adverted to the information of the papers which came yesterday that gen hampton was dead but observed that the military life in our present state offered nothing which could operate on the principle of patriotism he said he would sooner be shot than take a command under wilkinson in this sketch i have given truly the substance of his ideas but not always his own words on the whole i conclude he would accept a place in the cabinet or a military command dependent on the executive alone and i rather suppose a diplomatic mission because it would fall within the scope of his views and not because he said so for no allusion was made to anything of that kind in our conversation everything from him breathed the purest patriotism involving however a close attention to his own honor and grade he expressed himself with the utmost devotion to the interests of our own country and i am satisfied he will pursue them with honor and zeal in any character in which he shall be willing to act i have thus gone far beyond the single view of your letter that you may under any circumstances form a just estimate of what he would be disposed to     do god bless you and carry you safely through all your difficulties thomas jefferson january       0 monticello john wayles eppes to john wayles eppes j mss monticello january       0 dear sir —yours of the  0th came safely to hand and i now enclose you a letter from francis he continues in excellent health and employs his time well he has written to his mamma and grandmamma i observe that the h of r are sensible of the ill effects of the long speeches in their house on their proceedings but they have a worse effect in the disgust they excite among the people and the disposition they are producing to transfer their confidence from the legislature to the executive branch which would soon sap our constitution these speeches therefore are less and less read and if continued will cease to be read at all the models for that oratory which is to produce the greatest effect by securing the attention of hearers and readers are to be found in livy tacitus sallust and most assuredly not in cicero i doubt if there is a man in the world who can now read one of his orations through but as a piece of taskwork i observe the house is endeavoring to remedy the eternal protraction of debate by setting up all night or by the use of the previous question both will subject them to the most serious inconvenience the latter may be turned upon themselves by a trick of their adversaries i have thought that such a rule as the following would be more effectual and less inconvenient   0 resolved that at viii oclock in the evening whenever the house shall be in session at that hour it shall be the duty of the speaker to declare that hour arrived whereupon all debate shall cease if there be then before the house a main question for the reading or passing of a bill resolution or order such main question shall immediately be put by the speaker and decided by yeas and nays if the question before the house be secondary as for amendment commitment postponement adjournment of the debate or question laying on the table reading papers or a previous question such secondary or any other which may delay the main question shall stand ipso facto discharged and the main question shall then be before the house and shall be immediately put and decided by yeas and nays but a motion for adjournment of the house may once and once only take place of the main question and if decided in the negative the main question shall then be put as before should any question of order arise it shall be decided by the speaker instanter and without debate or appeal and questions of privilege arising shall be postponed till the main question be decided messages from the president or senate may be received but not acted on till after the decision of the main question but this rule shall be suspended during the three last days of the session of congress no doubt this on investigation will be found to need amendment but i think the principle of it better adapted to meet the evil than any other which     has occurred to me you can consider and decide upon it however and make what use of it you please only keeping the source of it to yourself ever affectionately yours thomas jefferson january       0 monticello joel barlow to joel barlow j mss monticello january       0 dear sir —yours of the   th is received and i am disconsolate on learning my mistake as to your having a dynamometer my object being to bring a plough to be made here to the same standard of comparison by which guillaumes has been proved nothing less would be satisfactory than an instrument made by the same standard i must import one therefore but how in the present state of nonintercourse is the difficulty i do not know dr mason personally but by character well he is the most redhot federalist famous or rather infamous for the lying and slandering which he vomited from the pulpit in the political harangues with which he polluted the place i was honored with much of it he is a man who can prove everything if you will take his word for proof such evidence of hamiltons being a republican he may bring but mr adams edmund randolph and myself could repeat an explicit declaration of hamiltons against which dr masons proofs would weigh nothing i am sorry to learn that your rural occupations impede so much the progress of your much to be desired work you owe to republicanism and indeed to the future hopes of man a faithful record     of the march of this government which may encourage the oppressed to go and do so likewise your talents your principles and your means of access to public and private sources of information with the leisure which is at your command point you out as the person who is to do this act of justice to those who believe in the improvability of the condition of man and who have acted on that behalf in opposition to those who consider man as a beast of burthen made to be rode by him who has genius enough to get a bridle into his mouth the dissensions between two members of the cabinet are to be lamented but why should these force mr gallatin to withdraw they cannot be greater than between hamilton and myself and yet we served together four years in that way we had indeed no personal dissensions each of us perhaps thought well of the other as a man but as politicians it was impossible for two men to be of more opposite principles the method of separate consultation practised sometimes in the cabinet prevents disagreeable collisions you ask my opinion of maine i think him a most excellent man sober industrious intelligent and conscientious but in the difficulty of changing a nursery establishment i suspect you will find an insurmountable obstacle to his removal present me respectfully to mrs barlow and be assured of my constant and affectionate esteem p s the day before yesterday the mercury was at  ½° with us a very uncommon degree of cold here it gave us the first ice for the ice house     thomas jefferson january       0 monticello j garland jefferson to j garland jefferson j mss monticello january       0 dear sir —your favor of december   th was long coming to hand i am much concerned to learn that any disagreeable impression was made on your mind by the circumstances which are the subject of your letter permit me first to explain the principles which i had laid down for my own observance in a government like ours it is the duty of the chief magistrate in order to enable himself to do all the good which his station requires to endeavor by all honorable means to unite in himself the confidence of the whole people this alone in any case where the energy of the nation is required can produce a union of the powers of the whole and point them in a single direction as if all constituted but one body and one mind and this alone can render a weaker nation unconquerable by a stronger one towards acquiring the confidence of the people the very first measure is to satisfy them of his disinterestedness and that he is directing their affairs with a single eye to their good and not to build up fortunes for himself and family and especially that the officers appointed to transact their business are appointed because they are the fittest men not because they are his relations so prone are they to suspicion that where a president appoints a relation of his own however worthy they will believe that favor and not merit was the motive i therefore laid it down as a law of conduct for myself never to give an appointment to a relation had i felt any hesitation in adopting this rule examples were not wanting to     admonish me what to do and what to avoid still the expression of your willingness to act in any office for which you were qualified could not be imputed to you as blame it would not readily occur that a person qualified for office ought to be rejected merely because he was related to the president and the then more recent examples favored the other opinion in this light i considered the case as presenting itself to your mind and that the application might be perfectly justifiable on your part while for reasons occurring to none perhaps but the person in my situation the public interest might render it unadvisable of this however be assured that i consider the proposition as innocent on your part and that it never lessened my esteem for you or the interest i felt in your welfare my stay in amelia was too short only twentyfour hours to expect the pleasure of seeing you there it would be a happiness to me any where but especially here from whence i am rarely absent i am leading a life of considerable activity as a farmer reading little and writing less something pursued with ardor is necessary to guard us from the tediumvitœ and the active pursuits lessen most our sense of the infirmities of age that to the health of youth you may add an old age of vigor is the sincere prayer of yours affectionately thomas jefferson february  0    0 monticello cæsar a rodney to cæsar a rodney j mss monticello february  0    0 my dear sir —i have to thank you for your favor of the   st ultimo which is just now received     it has been peculiarly unfortunate for us personally that the portion in the history of mankind at which we were called to take a share in the direction of their affairs was such an one as history has never before presented at any other period the evenhanded justice we have observed towards all nations the efforts we have made to merit their esteem by every act which candor or liberality could exercise would have preserved our peace and secured the unqualified confidence of all other nations in our faith and probity but the hurricane which is now blasting the world physical and moral has prostrated all the mounds of reason as well as right all those calculations which at any other period would have been deemed honorable of the existence of a moral sense in man individually or associated of the connection which the laws of nature have established between his duties and his interests of a regard for honest fame and the esteem of our fellow men have been a matter of reproach on us as evidences of imbecility as if it could be a folly for an honest man to suppose that others could be honest also when it is their interest to be so and when is this state of things to end the death of bonaparte would to be sure remove the first and chiefest apostle of the desolation of men and morals and might withdraw the scourge of the land but what is to restore order and safety on the ocean the death of george iii not at all he is only stupid and his ministers however weak and profligate in morals are ephemeral but his nation is permanent and it is that which is the tyrant of the     ocean the principle that force is right is become the principle of the nation itself they would not permit an honest minister were accident to bring such an one into power to relax their system of lawless piracy these were the difficulties when i was with you i know they are not lessened and i pity you it is a blessing however that our people are reasonable that they are kept so well informed of the state of things as to judge for themselves to see the true sources of their difficulties and to maintain their confidence undiminished in the wisdom and integrity of their functionaries macte virtute therefore continue to go straight forward pursuing always that which is right as the only clue which can lead us out of the labyrinth let nothing be spared of either reason or passion to preserve the public confidence entire as the only rock of our safety in times of peace the people look most to their representatives but in war to the executive solely it is visible that their confidence is even now veering in that direction that they are looking to the executive to give the proper direction to their affairs with a confidence as auspicious as it is well founded i avail myself of this the first occasion of writing to you to express all the depth of my affection for you the sense i entertain of your faithful cooperation in my late labors and the debt i owe for the valuable aid i received from you though separated from my fellow laborers in place and pursuit my affections are with you all and i offer daily prayers that ye love one another as i love you god bless you     thomas jefferson march      0 monticello doctor walter jones to doctor walter jones j mss monticello march      0 dear sir —i received duly your favor of the   th ultimo and i salute you with all ancient and recent recollections of friendship i have learned with real sorrow that circumstances have arisen among our executive counsellors which have rendered foes those who once were friends to themselves it will be a source of infinite pain and vexation and therefore chiefly i lament it for i have a sincere esteem for both parties to the president it will be really inconvenient but to the nation i do not know that it can do serious injury unless we were to believe the newspapers which pretend that mr gallatin will go out that indeed would be a day of mourning for the united states but i hope that the position of both gentlemen may be made so easy as to give no cause for either to withdraw the ordinary business of every day is done by consultation between the president and the head of the department alone to which it belongs for measures of importance or difficulty a consultation is held with the heads of departments either assembled or by taking their opinions separately in conversation or in writing the latter is most strictly in the spirit of the constitution because the president on weighing the advice of all is left free to make up an opinion for himself in this way they are not brought together and it is not necessarily known to any what opinion the others have given this was general washingtons practice for the first two or three years of his administration     till the affairs of france and england threatened to embroil us and rendered consideration and discussion desirable in these discussions hamilton and myself were daily pitted in the cabinet like two cocks we were then but four in number and according to the majority which of course was three to one the president decided the pain was for hamilton and myself but the public experienced no inconvenience i practised this last method because the harmony was so cordial among us all that we never failed by a contribution of mutual views on the subject to form an opinion acceptable to the whole i think there never was one instance to the contrary in any case of consequence yet this does in fact transform the executive into a directory and i hold the other method to be more constitutional it is better calculated too to prevent collision and irritation and to cure it or at least suppress its effects when it has already taken place it is the obvious and sufficient remedy in the present case and will doubtless be resorted to our difficulties are indeed great if we consider ourselves alone but when viewed in comparison to those of europe they are the joys of paradise in the eternal revolution of ages the destinies have placed our portion of existence amidst such scenes of tumult and outrage as no other period within our knowledge had presented every government but one on the continent of europe demolished a conqueror roaming over the earth with havoc and destruction a pirate spreading misery and ruin over the face of the ocean indeed my friend ours is a     bed of roses and the system of government which shall keep us afloat amidst the wreck of the world will be immortalized in history we have to be sure our petty squabbles and heart burnings and we have something of the blue devils at times as to these raw heads and bloody bones who are eating up other nations but happily for us the mammoth cannot swim nor the leviathan move on dry land and if we will keep out of their way they cannot get at us if indeed we choose to place ourselves within the scope of their tether a gripe of the paw or flounce of the tail may be our fortune our business certainly was to be still but a part of our nation chose to declare against this in such a way as to control the wisdom of the government i yielded with others to avoid a greater evil but from that moment i have seen no system which could keep us entirely aloof from these agents of destruction if there be any i am certain that you my friends now charged with the care of us all will see and pursue it i give myself therefore no trouble with thinking or puzzling about it being confident in my watchmen i sleep soundly god bless you all and send you a safe deliverance thomas jefferson may     0 monticello james madison to james madison j mss monticello may     0 dear sir —i inclose you the extract of a letter from govr tyler which will explain itself and i do it on the same principle on which i have sometimes done the same thing before that whenever you are called on to select you may have under consideration   0 all those who may properly be thought of  the grounds of their pretensions from what i can learn griffin cannot stand it long and really the state has suffered long enough by having such a cypher in so important an office and infinitely the more from the want of any counterpoint to the rancorous hatred which marshal bears to the government of his country  from the cunning  sophistry within which he is able to enshroud himself it will be difficult to find a character of firmness enough to preserve his independence on the same bench with marshall tyler i am certain would do it he is an able  well read lawyer about    years of age he was popular as a judge  is remarkably so as a governor for his incorruptible integrity which no circumstances have ever been able to turn from its course indeed i think there is scarcely a person in the state so solidly popular or who would be so much approved for that place a milk  water character in that office would be seen as a calamity tyler having been the former state judge of that court too and removed to make way for so wretched a fool as griffin has a kind of right of reclamation with the advantage of repeated elections by the legislature as admiralty judge circuit judge  governor but of all these things you will judge fairly between him  his competitors you have seen in the papers that livingston has served a writ on me stating damages at  00000 d the ground is not yet explained but it is understood to be the batture i have engaged wirt hay  wickham as counsel i shall soon look into my     papers to make a state of the case to enable them to plead and as much of our proceedings was never committed to writing and my memory cannot be trusted it is probable i shall have to appeal to that of my associates in the proceedings i believe that what i did was in harmony with the opinion of all the members of the administration verbally expressed altho not in writing i have been delighted to see the effect of monroes late visit to washington on his mind there appears to be the most perfect reconciliation  cordiality established towards yourself i think him now inclined to rejoin us with zeal the only embarrassment will be from his late friends but i think he has firmness of mind enough to act independently as to them the next session of our legislature will shew we are suffering under a most severe drought of now   weeks continuance late sown wheat is yellow but the oats suffer especially in speaking of livingstons suit i omitted to observe that it is a little doubted that his knolege of marshalls character has induced him to bring this action his twistifications in the case of marbury in that of burr  the late yazoo case shew how dexterously he can reconcile law to his personal biasses and nobody seems to doubt that he is ready prepared to decide that livingstons right to the batture is unquestionable and that i am bound to pay for it with my private fortune ever affectionately yours      thomas jefferson july     0 monticello henry dearborn to henry dearborn  monticello july     0 dear general  friend —your favor of may    was duly received and i join in congratulations with you on the resurrection of republican principles in massachusetts  n hampshire and the hope that the professors of these principles will not again easily be driven off their ground the federalists during their short lived ascendancy have nevertheless by     forcing us from the embargo inflicted a wound on our interests which can never be cured  on our affections which will require time to cicatrise i ascribe all this to one pseudorepublican story he came on in place of crownenshield i believe and staid only a few days long enough however to get complete hold of bacon who giving in to his representations became panick struck  communicated his panick to his colleagues  they to a majority of the sound members of congress they     believed in the alternative of repeal or civil war and produced the fatal measure of repeal this is the immediate parent of all our present evils and has reduced us to a low standing in the eyes of the world i should think that even the federalists themselves must now be made by their feelings sensible of their error the wealth which the embargo brought home safely has now been thrown back into the laps of our enemies and our navigation completely crushed and by the unwise  unpatriotic conduct of those engaged in it should the orders prove genuine which are said to have been given against our fisheries they too are gone and if not true as yet they will be true on the first breeze of success which england shall feel for it has now been some years that i am perfectly satisfied her intentions have been to claim the ocean as her conquest  prohibit any vessel from navigating it but on such a tribute as may enable her to keep up such a standing navy as will maintain her dominion over it she has hauled in or let herself out been bold or hesitating according to occurrences but has in no situation done anything which might amount to an acknowledged relinquishment of her intentions i have ever been anxious to avoid a war with england unless forced by a situation more losing than war itself but i did believe we could coerce her to justice by peaceable means and the embargo evaded as it was proved it would have coerced her had it been honestly executed the proof she exhibited on that occasion that she can exercise     such an influence in this country as to controul the will of its government  three fourths of its people and oblige the three fourths to submit to one fourth is to me the most mortifying circumstance which has occurred since the establishment of our government the only prospect i see of lessening that influence is in her own conduct  not from any thing in our power radically hostile to our navigation and commerce and fearing its rivalry she will compleatly crush it and force us to resort to agriculture not aware that we shall resort to manufactures also  render her conquest over our navigation  commerce useless at least if not injurious to herself in the end and perhaps salutary to us as removing out of our way the chief causes  provocations to war—but these are views which concern the present and future generations among neither of which i count myself you may live to see the change in our pursuits  chiefly in those of your own state which england will effect i am not certain that the change on massachusetts by driving her to agriculture manufactures  emigration will lessen her happiness—but once more to be done with politics—how does mrs dearborne do—how do you both like your situation—do you amuse yourself with a garden a farm or what—that your pursuits whatever they be may make you both easy healthy  happy is the prayer of your sincere friend     thomas jefferson september  0    0 monticello john b colvin to john b colvin j mss monticello september  0    0 sir —your favor of the   th has been duly received and i have to thank you for the many obliging things respecting myself which are said in it if i have left in the breasts of my fellow citizens a sentiment of satisfaction with my conduct in the transaction of their business it will soften the pillow of my repose through the residue of life the question you propose whether circumstances do not sometimes occur which make it a duty in officers of high trust to assume authorities beyond the law is easy of solution in principle but sometimes embarrassing in practice a strict observance of the written laws is doubtless one of the high duties of a good citizen but it is not the highest the laws of necessity of selfpreservation of saving our country when in danger are of higher obligation to lose our country by a scrupulous adherence to written law would be to lose the law itself with life liberty property and all those who are enjoying them with us thus absurdly sacrificing the end to the means when in the battle of germantown general washingtons army was annoyed from chews house he did not hesitate to plant his cannon against it although the property of a citizen when he besieged yorktown he leveled the suburbs feeling that the laws of property must be postponed to the safety of the nation while the army was before york the governor of virginia took horses carriages provisions and even men by force to enable that army to stay together till it     could master the public enemy and he was justified a ship at sea in distress for provisions meets another having abundance yet refusing a supply the law of selfpreservation authorizes the distressed to take a supply by force in all these cases the unwritten laws of necessity of selfpreservation and of the public safety control the written laws of meum and tuum further to exemplify the principle i will state an hypothetical case suppose it had been made known to the executive of the union in the autumn of   0  that we might have the floridas for a reasonable sum that that sum had not indeed been so appropriated by law but that congress were to meet within three weeks and might appropriate it on the first or second day of their session ought he for so great an advantage to his country to have risked himself by transcending the law and making the purchase the public advantage offered in this supposed case was indeed immense but a reverence for law and the probability that the advantage might still be legally accomplished by a delay of only three weeks were powerful reasons against hazarding the act but suppose it foreseen that a john randolph would find means to protract the proceeding on it by congress until the ensuing spring by which time new circumstances would change the mind of the other party ought the executive in that case and with that foreknowledge to have secured the good to his country and to have trusted to their justice for the transgression of the law i think he ought and that the act would have been approved     after the affair of the chesapeake we thought war a very possible result our magazines were illy provided with some necessary articles nor had any appropriations been made for their purchase we ventured however to provide them and to place our country in safety and stating the case to congress they sanctioned the act to proceed to the conspiracy of burr and particularly to general wilkinsons situation in new orleans in judging this case we are bound to consider the state of the information correct and incorrect which he then possessed he expected burr and his band from above a british fleet from below and he knew there was a formidable conspiracy within the city under these circumstances was he justifiable  st in seizing notorious conspirators on this there can be but two opinions one of the guilty and their accomplices the other that of all honest men  d in sending them to the seat of government when the written law gave them a right to trial in the territory the danger of their rescue of their continuing their machinations the tardiness and weakness of the law apathy of the judges active patronage of the whole tribe of lawyers unknown disposition of the juries an hourly expectation of the enemy salvation of the city and of the union itself which would have been convulsed to its centre had that conspiracy succeeded all these constituted a law of necessity and selfpreservation and rendered the salus populi supreme over the written law the officer who is called to act on this superior ground does indeed     risk himself on the justice of the controlling powers of the constitution and his station makes it his duty to incur that risk but those controlling powers and his fellow citizens generally are bound to judge according to the circumstances under which he acted they are not to transfer the information of this place or moment to the time and place of his action but to put themselves into his situation we knew here that there never was danger of a british fleet from below and that burrs band was crushed before it reached the mississippi but general wilkinsons information was very different and he could act on no other from these examples and principles you may see what i think on the question proposed they do not go to the case of persons charged with petty duties where consequences are trifling and time allowed for a legal course nor to authorize them to take such cases out of the written law in these the example of overleaping the law is of greater evil than a strict adherence to its imperfect provisions it is incumbent on those only who accept of great charges to risk themselves on great occasions when the safety of the nation or some of its very high interests are at stake an officer is bound to obey orders yet he would be a bad one who should do it in cases for which they were not intended and which involved the most important consequences the line of discrimination between cases may be difficult but the good officer is bound to draw it at his own peril and throw himself on the justice of his country and the rectitude of his motives   0 i have indulged freer views on this question on your assurances that they are for your own eye only and that they will not get into the hands of newswriters i met their scurrilities without concern while in pursuit of the great interests with which i was charged but in my present retirement no duty forbids my wish for quiet accept the assurances of my esteem and respect thomas jefferson oct     0 monticello james madison to james madison j mss monticello oct     0 dear sir —tho late i congratulate you on the revocation of the french decrees  congress still more for without something new from the belligerents i know not what ground they could have taken for their next move britain will revoke her orders of council but continue their effect by new paper blockades doing in detail what the orders did in the lump the exclusive right to the sea by conquest is the principle she has acted on in petto tho she dares not yet avow it this was to depend on the events of the war i rejoice however that one power has got out of our way  left us a clear field with the other another circumstance of congratulation is the death of cushing the nation ten years ago declared its will for a change in the principles of the administration of their affairs they then changed the two branches depending on their will and have steadily maintained the reformation in those branches     the third not depending on them has so long bid defiance to their will erecting themselves into a political body to correct what they deem the errors of the nation the death of cushing gives an opportunity of closing the reformation by a successor of unquestionable republican principles our friend lincoln has of course presented himself to your recollection i know you think lightly of him as a lawyer and i do not consider him as a correct common lawyer yet as much so as any one which ever came or ever can come from one of the eastern states their system of jurisprudence made up from the jewish law a little dash of common law  a great mass of original notions of their own is a thing sui generis and one educated in that system can never so far eradicate early impressions as to imbibe thoroughly the principles of another system it is so in the case of other systems of which ld mansfield is a splendid example lincolns firm republicanism and known integrity will give compleat confidence to the public in the long desired reformation of their judiciary were he out of the way i should think granger prominent for the place his abilities are great i have entire confidence in his integrity tho i am sensible that j r has been able to lessen the confidence of many in him but that i believe he would soon reconcile to him if placed in a situation to shew himself to the public as he is and not as an enemy has represented him as the choice must be of a new englander to exercise his functions for new england men i confess i know of none but these two characters morton is really a     republican but inferior to both the others in every point of view blake calls himself republican but never was one at heart his treachery to us under the embargo should put him by forever story  bacon are exactly the men who deserted us on that measure  carried off the majority the former unquestionably a tory  both are too young i say nothing of professing federalists granger  morton have both been interested in yazooism the former however has long been clear of it i have said thus much because i know you must wish to learn the sentiments of others to hear all and then do what on the whole you perceive to be best      does mr lee go back to bordeaux if he does i have not a wish to the contrary if he does not permit me to place my friend  kinsman g j  on the list of candidates no appointment can fall on an honester man and his talents tho not of the first     order are fully adequate to the station his judgment is very sound  his prudence consummate ever affectionately yours thomas jefferson november       0 monticello william duane to william duane j mss monticello november       0 dear sir —your third packet is received before the second had been returned it is now enclosed     and the other shall go by the next post i find as before nothing to correct but those errors of the copyist which you would have corrected yourself before committed to the press if it were practicable to send me the original sheets with the translated perhaps my equal familiarity with both     languages might enable me sometimes to be of some advantage but i presume that might be difficult and of little use scarcely perhaps of any i thank you for the copy of williams i have barely dipped into it a little enough however to see he is far short of the luminous work you are printing indeed i think that the most valuable work of the present age i received from williams some years ago his book on the claims of authors i found him to be a man of sound and true principles but not knowing how to go at them and not able to trace or develop them for others i believe with you that the crisis of england is come what will be its issue it is vain to prophesy so many thousand contingencies may turn up to affect its direction were i to hazard a guess it would be that they will become a military despotism their recollections of the portion of liberty they have enjoyed will render force necessary to retain them under pure monarchy their pressure upon us has been so severe and so unprincipled that we cannot deprecate their fate though we might wish to see their naval power kept up to the level of that of the other principal powers separately taken but may it not take a very different turn her paper credit annihilated the precious metals must become her circulating medium the taxes which can be levied on her people in these will be trifling in comparison with what they could pay in paper money her navy then will be unpaid unclothed unfed will such a body of men suffer themselves to be dismissed and to starve will they not mutiny revolt embody themselves under a     popular admiral take possession of western and bermuda islands and act on the algerine system if they should not be able to act on this broad scale they will become individual pirates and the modern carthage will end as the old one has done i am sorry for her people who are individually as respectable as those of other nations—it is her government which is so corrupt and which has destroyed the nation—it was certainly the most corrupt and unprincipled government on earth i should be glad to see their farmers and mechanics come here but i hope their nobles priests and merchants will be kept at home to be moralized by the discipline of the new government the young stripling whom you describe is probably as george nicholas used to say in the plenitude of puppyism such coxcombs do not serve even as straws to show which way the wind blows alexander is unquestionably a man of an excellent heart and of very respectable strength of mind and he is the only sovereign who cordially loves us bonaparte hates our government because it is a living libel on his the english hate us because they think our prosperity filched from theirs of alexanders sense of the merits of our form of government of its wholesome operation on the condition of the people and of the interest he takes in the success of our experiment we possess the most unquestionable proofs and to him we shall be indebted if the rights of neutrals to be settled whenever peace is made shall be extended beyond the present belligerents that is to say european neutrals as george and     napoleon of mutual consent and common hatred against us would concur in excluding us i thought it a salutary measure to engage the powerful patronage of alexander at conferences for peace at a time when bonaparte was courting him and although circumstances have lessened its weight yet it is prudent for us to cherish his good dispositions as those alone which will be exerted in our favor when that occasion shall occur he like ourselves sees and feels the atrociousness of both the belligerents i salute you with great esteem and respect thomas jefferson nov     0 monticello judge john tyler to judge john tyler j mss monticello nov     0 dear sir —your favor of the   th gave me the first information that the lectures of my late master and friend  exist in ms knowing how little sensible he was of the eminence of his own mind i had apprehended if he had ever committed to writing more than their skeleton that possibly he might have destroyed them as i expect he has done a very great number of instructive arguments delivered at the bar and often written at full length i do not however conceive myself entitled to claim them under the bequest of his library i presume they go with his other papers to his executor but this must be immaterial as no one could have a wish to withhold them from the public if in such a form as would render them useful to them  honorable to himself this i am sure they must be if tolerably entire     his mind was too accurate his reasoning powers too strong to have committed anything to paper materially incorrect it is unfortunate that there should be lacunae in them but you are mistaken my dear sir in supposing i could supply them it is now    years since i left the bar and have ceased to think on subjects of law  the constant occupation of my mind by other concerns has obliterated from it all but the strongest traces of the science others i am sure can be found equal to it and none more so than judge roane it is not my time or trouble which i wish to spare on this occasion they are due in any extent to the memory of one who was my second father my incompetence is the real obstacle and in any other circumstance connected with the publication in which i can be useful to his fame and the public instruction i shall be most ready to do my duty how this may be i must leave to be pointed out by you than whom no one better knew the powers  purity of his mind or feels warmer zeal to render them useful after his death accept the assurances of my constant friendship  respect thomas jefferson jan      monticello john wayles eppes to john wayles eppes j mss monticello jan      dear sir —your two letters of dec    reached this place just after i had left it for bedford this has occasioned the delay of the answer i now inclose you the paper you requested on the boundaries of louisiana it is a bad polygraph copy however   0 it is legible there is nothing secret in the paper and therefore may be freely used as you please except that i would not have it printed but with the advice of the president—with his sanction if it be thought material to satisfy the public opinion on the solidity of a right the assertion of which may lead to war it may be printed but the paper i send you wants a very material appendix this was a chronological table of all the facts relating to the discovery  history of louisiana which i compiled from all the authors i possess or could obtain who have written on louisiana with a reference to the authority for every fact this is not now among my papers and i have no conception what has become of it unless it remains in the office of state i sent both papers to that office from which copies were taken and sent to our ministers at paris  madrid  perhaps given in by them to those governments copies were also retained for the use of the office and perhaps only the original of the principal paper may have been returned to me i write by this post to mr graham to examine  if he has not the original of the chronological table to lend me his copy from which i will send you one with respect to the boundaries they are as well ascertained as those of any unsettled country whatever as well as the boundaries of several of these states about which disputes still exist  as the boundaries of many of the unsettled northern countries of europe i wish you would authorise the president to take possession of east florida immediately the seizing west florida will be a signal to england to take pensacola  st     augustine and be assured it will be done as soon as the order can return after they hear of our taking baton rouge and we shall never get it from them but by a war which may be prevented by anticipation—there never was a case where the adage was more true in for a penny in for a pound and no more offence will be taken by france  spain at our seizure of both than of one the english will take east florida pretendedly for spain we should take it with a declaration   that it is a reprisal for indemnities spain has acknoleged due to us   to keep it from falling into hands in which it would essentially endanger our safety   that in our hands it will still be held as a subject of negociation the leading republican members should come to an understanding close the doors and determine not to separate till the vote is carried and all the secrecy you can enjoin should be aimed at until the measure is executed the militia of georgia will do it in a fortnight i proposed to francis as you desired his staying here he asked me if i had written to you to ask permission for his stay i told him i had  that you left it to himself he said at once he would stay i have put him into his latin grammar rather to learn him to exercise his memory in getting by heart than from an expectation that he may otherwise profit by it as yet i observe he gets very readily  perfectly i inclose you a letter from him accept assurances of my constant affection     thomas jefferson january         monticello thomas law to thomas law j mss monticello january         dear sir —an absence from home of some length has prevented my sooner acknowledging the receipt of your letter covering the printed pamphlet which the same absence has as yet prevented me from taking up but which i know i shall read with great pleasure your favor of december the   d is also received mr wagners malignity like that of the rest of his tribe of brother printers who deal out calumnies for federal readers gives me no pain when a printer cooks up a falsehood it is as easy to put it into the mouth of a mr fox as of a smaller man and safer into that of a dead than a living one your sincere attachment to this country as well as to your native one was never doubted by me and in that persuasion i felt myself free to express to you my genuine sentiments with respect to england no man was more sensible than myself of the just value of the friendship of that country there are between us so many of those circumstances which naturally produce and cement kind dispositions that if they could have forgiven our resistance to their usurpations our connections might have been durable and have insured duration to both our governments i wished therefore a cordial friendship with them and i spared no occasion of manifesting this in our correspondence and intercourse with them not disguising however my desire of friendship with their enemy also during the administration of mr addington i thought i     discovered some friendly symptoms on the part of that government at least we received some marks of respect from the administration and some of regret at the wrongs we were suffering from their country so also during the short interval of mr foxs power but every other administration since our revolution has been equally wanton in their injuries and insults and have manifested equal hatred and aversion instead too of cultivating the government itself whose principles are those of the great mass of the nation they have adopted the miserable policy of teazing and embarrassing it by allying themselves with a faction here not a tenth of the people noisy and unprincipled and which never can come into power while republicanism is the spirit of the nation and that must continue to be so until such a condensation of population shall have taken place as will require centuries whereas the good will of the government itself would give them and immediately every benefit which reason or justice would permit it to give with respect to myself i saw great reason to believe their ministers were weak enough to credit the newspaper trash about a supposed personal enmity in myself towards england this wretched party imputation was beneath the notice of wise men england never did me a personal injury other than in open war and for numerous individuals there i have great esteem and friendship and i must have had a mind far below the duties of my station to have felt either national partialities or antipathies in conducting the affairs confided to me my affections     were first for my own country and then generally for all mankind and nothing but minds placing themselves above the passions in the functionaries of this country could have preserved us from the war to which their provocations have been constantly urging us the war interests in england include a numerous and wealthy part of their population and their influence is deemed worth courting by ministers wishing to keep their places continually endangered by a powerful opposition they find it convenient to humor the popular passions at the expense of the public good the shipping interest commercial interest and their janizaries of the navy all fattening on war will not be neglected by ministers of ordinary minds their tenure of office is so infirm that they dare not follow the dictates of wisdom justice and the wellcalculated interests of their country this vice in the english constitution renders a dependence on that government very unsafe the feelings of their king too fundamentally adverse to us have added another motive for unfriendliness in his ministers this obstacle to friendship however seems likely to be soon removed and i verily believe the successor will come in with fairer and wiser dispositions towards us perhaps on that event their conduct may be changed but what england is to become on the crush of her internal structure now seeming to be begun i cannot foresee her monied interest created by her paper system and now constituting a baseless mass of wealth equal to that of the owners of the soil must disappear with that system and the     medium for paying great taxes thus failing her navy must be without support that it shall be supported by permitting her to claim dominion of the ocean and to levy tribute on every flag traversing that as lately attempted and not yet relinquished every nation must contest even ad internecionem and yet that retiring from this enormity she should continue able to take a fair share in the necessary equilibrium of power on that element would be the desire of every nation i feel happy in withdrawing my mind from these anxieties and resigning myself for the remnant of life to the care and guardianship of others good wishes are all an old man has to offer to his country or friends mine attend yourself with sincere assurances of esteem and respect which however i should be better pleased to tender you in person should your rambles ever lead you into the vicinage of monticello thomas jefferson january         monticello doctor benjamin rush to doctor benjamin rush j mss monticello january         dear sir —i had been considering for some days whether it was not time by a letter to bring myself to your recollection when i received your welcome favor of the  d instant i had before heard of the heartrending calamity you mention and had sincerely sympathized with your afflictions but i had not made it the subject of a letter because i knew that condolences were but renewals of grief yet i thought and still think this is one of the cases     wherein we should not sorrow even as others who have no hope i have myself known so many cases of recovery from confirmed insanity as to reckon it ever among the recoverable diseases one of them was that of a near relative and namesake of mine who after many years of madness of the first degree became entirely sane and amused himself to a good old age in keeping school was an excellent teacher and much valued citizen you ask if i have read hartley i have not my present course of life admits less reading than i wish from breakfast or noon at latest to dinner i am mostly on horseback attending to my farm or other concerns which i find healthful to my body mind and affairs and the few hours i can pass in my cabinet are devoured by correspondences not those of my intimate friends with whom i delight to interchange sentiments but with others who writing to me on concerns of their own in which i have had an agency or from motives of mere respect and approbation are entitled to be answered with respect and a return of good will my hope is that this obstacle to the delights of retirement will wear away with the oblivion which follows that and that i may at length be indulged in those studious pursuits from which nothing but revolutionary duties would ever have called me i shall receive your proposed publication and read it with the pleasure which everything gives me from your pen although much of a sceptic in the practice of medicine i read with pleasure its ingenious theories     i receive with sensibility your observations on the discontinuance of friendly correspondence between mr adams and myself and the concern you take in its restoration this discontinuance has not proceeded from me nor from the want of sincere desire and of effort on my part to renew our intercourse you know the perfect coincidence of principle and of action in the early part of the revolution which produced a high degree of mutual respect and esteem between mr adams and myself certainly no man was ever truer than he was in that day to those principles of rational republicanism which after the necessity of throwing off our monarchy dictated all our efforts in the establishment of a new government and although he swerved afterwards towards the principles of the english constitution our friendship did not abate on that account while he was vice president and i secretary of state i received a letter from president washington then at mount vernon desiring me to call together the heads of departments and to invite mr adams to join us which bythebye was the only instance of that being done in order to determine on some measure which required despatch and he desired me to act on it as decided without again recurring to him i invited them to dine with me and after dinner sitting at our wine having settled our question other conversation came on in which a collision of opinion arose between mr adams and colonel hamilton on the merits of the british constitution mr adams giving it as his opinion that if some of its defects and abuses were corrected     it would be the most perfect constitution of government ever devised by man hamilton on the contrary asserted that with its existing vices it was the most perfect model of government that could be formed and that the correction of its vices would render it an impracticable government and this you may be assured was the real line of difference between the political principles of these two gentlemen another incident took place on the same occasion which will further delineate mr hamiltons political principles the room being hung around with a collection of the portraits of remarkable men among them were those of bacon newton and locke hamilton asked me who they were i told him they were my trinity of the three greatest men the world had ever produced naming them he paused for some time the greatest man said he that ever lived was julius cæsar mr adams was honest as a politician as well as a man hamilton honest as a man but as a politician believing in the necessity of either force or corruption to govern men you remember the machinery which the federalists played off about that time to beat down the friends to the real principles of our constitution to silence by terror every expression in their favor to bring us into war with france and alliance with england and finally to homologize our constitution with that of england mr adams you know was overwhelmed with feverish addresses dictated by the fear and often by the pen of the bloody buoy and was seduced by them into some open indications of his new principles of government and in fact was so     elated as to mix with his kindness a little superciliousness towards me even mrs adams with all her good sense and prudence was sensibly flushed and you recollect the short suspension of our intercourse and the circumstance which gave rise to it which you were so good as to bring to an early explanation and have set to rights to the cordial satisfaction of us all the nation at length passed condemnation on the political principles of the federalists by refusing to continue mr adams in the presidency on the day on which we learned in philadelphia the vote of the city of new york which it was well known would decide the vote of the state and that again the vote of the union i called on mr adams on some official business he was very sensibly affected and accosted me with these words well i understand that you are to beat me in this contest and i will only say that i will be as faithful a subject as any you will have mr adams said i this is no personal contest between you and me two systems of principles on the subject of government divide our fellow citizens into two parties with one of these you concur and i with the other as we have been longer on the public stage than most of those now living our names happen to be more generally known one of these parties therefore has put your name at its head the other mine were we both to die today tomorrow two other names would be in the place of ours without any change in the motion of the machinery its motion is from its principle not from you or myself i believe you are right said he that we are but   0 passive instruments and should not suffer this matter to affect our personal dispositions but he did not long retain this just view of the subject i have always believed that the thousand calumnies which the federalists in bitterness of heart and mortification at their ejection daily invented against me were carried to him by their busy intriguers and made some impression when the election between burr and myself was kept in suspense by the federalists and they were mediating to place the president of the senate at the head of the government i called on mr adams with a view to have this desperate measure prevented by his negative he grew warm in an instant and said with a vehemence he had not used towards me before sir the event of the election is within your own power you have only to say you will do justice to the public creditors maintain the navy and not disturb those holding offices and the government will instantly be put into your hands we know it is the wish of the people it should be so mr adams said i i know not what part of my conduct in either public or private life can have authorized a doubt of my fidelity to the public engagements i say however i will not come into the government by capitulation i will not enter on it but in perfect freedom to follow the dictates of my own judgment i had before given the same answer to the same intimation from gouverneur morris then said he things must take their course i turned the conversation to something else and soon took my leave it was the first time in our lives we had ever parted with     anything like dissatisfaction and then followed those scenes of midnight appointment which have been condemned by all men the last day of his political power the last hours and even beyond the midnight were employed in filling all offices and especially permanent ones with the bitterest federalists and providing for me the alternative either to execute the government by my enemies whose study it would be to thwart and defeat all my measures or to incur the odium of such numerous removals from office as might bear me down a little time and reflection effaced in my mind this temporary dissatisfaction with mr adams and restored me to that just estimate of his virtues and passions which a long acquaintance had enabled me to fix and my first wish became that of making his retirement easy by any means in my power for it was understood he was not rich i suggested to some republican members of the delegation from his state the giving him either directly or indirectly an office the most lucrative in that state and then offered to be resigned if they thought he would not deem it affrontive they were of opinion he would take great offence at the offer and moreover that the body of republicans would consider such a step in the outset as arguing very ill of the course i meant to pursue i dropped the idea therefore but did not cease to wish for some opportunity of renewing our friendly understanding two or three years after having had the misfortune to lose a daughter between whom and mrs adams there had been a considerable attachment she made     it the occasion of writing me a letter in which with the tenderest expressions of concern at this event she carefully avoided a single one of friendship towards myself and even concluded it with the wishes of her who once took pleasure in subscribing herself your friend abigail adams unpromising as was the complexion of this letter i determined to make an effort towards removing the cloud from between us this brought on a correspondence which i now enclose for your perusal after which be so good as to return it to me as i have never communicated it to any mortal breathing before i send it to you to convince you i have not been wanting either in the desire or the endeavor to remove this misunderstanding indeed i thought it highly disgraceful to us both as indicating minds not sufficiently elevated to prevent a public competition from affecting our personal friendship i soon found from the correspondence that conciliation was desperate and yielding to an intimation in her last letter i ceased from further explanation i have the same good opinion of mr adams which i ever had i know him to be an honest man an able one with his pen and he was a powerful advocate on the floor of congress he has been alienated from me by belief in the lying suggestions contrived for electioneering purposes that i perhaps mixed in the activity and intrigues of the occasion my most intimate friends can testify that i was perfectly passive they would sometimes indeed tell me what was going on but no man ever heard me take part in such conversations and none ever     misrepresented mr adams in my presence without my asserting his just character with very confidential persons i have doubtless disapproved of the principles and practices of his administration this was unavoidable but never with those with whom it could do him any injury decency would have required this conduct from me if disposition had not and i am satisfied mr adams conduct was equally honorable towards me but i think it part of his character to suspect foul play in those of whom he is jealous and not easily to relinquish his suspicions i have gone my dear friend into these details that you might know everything which had passed between us might be fully possessed of the state of facts and dispositions and judge for yourself whether they admit a revival of that friendly intercourse for which you are so kindly solicitous i shall certainly not be wanting in anything on my part which may second your efforts which will be the easier with me inasmuch as i do not entertain a sentiment of mr adams the expression of which could give him reasonable offence and i submit the whole to yourself with the assurance that whatever be the issue my friendship and respect for yourself will remain unaltered and unalterable      thomas jefferson jan  0    monticello marquis de lafayette to the marquis de lafayette j mss monticello jan  0    i have to acknolege my dear friend the receipt of many of your letters within the last twelvemonth and altho i have not answered them specifically to yourself yet i have not been inattentive or inactive as to their contents on leaving the government two years ago i knew i could not serve you so effectually as by committing the whole care of your orleans affairs to the president the weight of his agency merged all other interferences  no one could     have more zeal the arrival of your letters therefore to me was used as occasions for refreshing his memory on your situation and always produced answers which shewed he had it ever in view till at length he informed me he had been able to have the grants brought forward for his signature which they had received  were forwarded by a confidential person your letters after this i considered as effectively answered by the fact of the grants being expedited  by that time in your hands your last of sep  0 recd nov    accordingly informed me of mr parishs arrival on the continent with them     notwithstanding the discouragements from hope  co i have such reliance on the genius  resources of our friend parker in these matters as not to despair of means being found of making this property a present relief as well as future provision i should consider money lent on its hypothecation as on the solidest bottom of any loan existing of which of the dominant powers of europe is the good faith as trustworthy in what spot of europe is the money of a lender more secure than in this peaceable industrious  thriving country had mr goldsmidts omnium been all bottomed on the grounds around n orleans he would not have needed the resource of the pistol on the subject of your location adjacent to the city of n o i am not able to say any thing now in fact i have considered your affairs as so securely placed in the hands of m duplantier there and of the president here that my interferences were better suspended as it might have disturbed  could not aid their operations i did not omit however on a late visit to govr claiborne to me at this place to strengthen as far as in my power his good dispositions to give any aid his situation would afford to mr duplantier i trust then that for my failure to write for some time past other motives will be perceived than inattention to your happiness and prosperity old men do not easily contract new friendships but neither do they forget old ones yours  mine commenced in times too awful has continued thro times too trying  changeful to be forgotten at the moment when our chief solace is in our recollections you will be more     sensible of this as you advance more towards my years my situation too so far in the interior country prevents my knowing of the opportunities of writing you remember your camps at the raccoonford  mechunck  that i am still farther inland for some time past there has been no opportunities but by public vessels and the first we hear of them is generally that they sailed on such a day from such a port one sailed lately from hampton which i learned only by the newspapers after she was gone and i am now writing without knowing when or whence the letter can be forwarded to these unfavorable circumstances for correspondence must be added the total change of the habits of my life i am now on horseback among my farms from an early breakfast to a late dinner with little regard to weather i find it gives health to body mind  affairs i go to my writing table with great reluctance  only for those calls which cannot be put off to tomorrow i am always happy to hear of the welfare of your family  especially of your own i hope you enjoy habitually good health  spirits in the present state of the european world your comforts must all flow from what is immediately around you there can be none in casting your eye over scenes of murder rapine devastation pyracy demoralization of national societies  degradation of the instruments of all this evil if there be a god  he is just his day will come he will never abandon the whole race of man to be eaten up by the leviathans and mammoths of a day i enjoy good health  am happy in contemplating     the peace prosperity liberty  safety of my country

of a great grandfather god bless you  send you many  happy days yours ever and affectionately thomas jefferson january         monticello john lynch to john lynch j mss monticello january         sir —you have asked my opinion on the proposition of mrs mifflin to take measures for procuring on the coast of africa an establishment to which the people of color of these states might from time to time be colonized under the auspices of different governments having long ago made up my mind on this subject i have no hesitation in saying that i have ever thought it the most desirable measure which could be adopted for gradually drawing off this part of our population most advantageously for themselves as well as for us going from a country possessing all the useful arts they might be the means of transplanting them among the inhabitants of africa and would thus carry back to the country of their origin the seeds of civilization which might render their sojournment and sufferings here a blessing in the end to that country i received in the first year of my coming into the administration of the general government a letter from the governor of virginia colonel monroe     consulting me at the request of the legislature of the state on the means of procuring some such asylum to which these people might be occasionally sent i proposed to him the establishment of sierra leone to which a private company in england had already colonized a number of negroes and particularly the fugitives from these states during the revolutionary war and at the same time suggested if this could not be obtained some of the portuguese possessions in south america as next most desirable the subsequent legislature approving these ideas i wrote the ensuing year   0  to mr king our minister in london to endeavor to negotiate with the sierra leone company a reception of such of these people as might be colonized thither he opened a correspondence with mr wedderburne and mr thornton secretaries of the company on the subject and in   0  i received through mr king the result which was that the colony was going on but in a languishing condition that the funds of the company were likely to fail as they received no returns of profit to keep them up that they were therefore in treaty with their government to take the establishment off their hands but that in no event should they be willing to receive more of these people from the united states as it was exactly that portion of their settlers which had gone from hence which by their idleness and turbulence had kept the settlement in constant danger of dissolution which could not have been prevented but for the aid of the maroon negroes from the west indies who were more industrious and orderly than the others   0 and supported the authority of the government and its laws i think i learned afterwards that the british government had taken the colony into its own hands and i believe it still exists the effort which i made with portugal to obtain an establishment for them within their claims in south america proved also abortive you inquire further whether i would use my endeavors to procure for such an establishment security against violence from other powers and particularly from france certainly i shall be willing to do anything i can to give it effect and safety but i am but a private individual and could only use endeavors with private individuals whereas the national government can address themselves at once to those of europe to obtain the desired security and will unquestionably be ready to exert its influence with those nations for an object so benevolent in itself and so important to a great portion of its constituents indeed nothing is more to be wished than that the united states would themselves undertake to make such an establishment on the coast of africa exclusive of motives of humanity the commercial advantages to be derived from it might repay all its expenses but for this the national mind is not yet prepared it may perhaps be doubted whether many of these people would voluntarily consent to such an exchange of situation and very certain that few of those advanced to a certain age in habits of slavery would be capable of selfgovernment this should not however discourage the experiment nor the early trial of it and the proposition should be     made with all the prudent cautions and attentions requisite to reconcile it to the interests the safety and the prejudices of all parties thomas jefferson january         monticello a c v c destutt de tracy to a c v c destutt de tracy j mss monticello january         sir —the length of time your favor of june the   th   0  was on its way to me and my absence from home the greater part of the autumn delayed very much the pleasure which awaited me of reading the packet which accompanied it i cannot express to you the satisfaction which i received from its perusal i had with the world deemed montesquieus work of much merit but saw in it with every thinking man so much of paradox of false principle and misapplied fact as to render its value equivocal on the whole williams and others had nibbled only at its errors a radical correction of them therefore was a great desideratum this want is now supplied and with a depth of thought precision of idea of language and of logic which will force conviction into every mind i declare to you sir in the spirit of truth and sincerity that i consider it the most precious gift the present age has received but what would it have been had the author or would the author take up the whole scheme of montesquieus work and following the correct analysis he has here developed fill up all its parts according to his sound views of them montesquieus celebrity would be but a small portion of that which would immortalize the author and     with whom with the rational and highminded spirits of the present and all future ages with those whose approbation is both incitement and reward to virtue and ambition is then the hope desperate to what object can the occupation of his future life be devoted so usefully to the world so splendidly to himself but i must leave to others who have higher claims on his attention to press these considerations my situation far in the interior of the country was not favorable to the object of getting this work translated and printed philadelphia is the least distant of the great towns of our states where there exists any enterprise in this way and it was not till the spring following the receipt of your letter that i obtained an arrangement for its execution the translation is just now completed the sheets came to me by post from time to time for revisal but not being accompanied by the original i could not judge of verbal accuracies i think however it is substantially correct without being an adequate representation of the excellences of the original as indeed no translation can be i found it impossible to give it the appearance of an original composition in our language i therefore think it best to divert inquiries after the author towards a quarter where he will not be found and with this view propose to prefix the prefatory epistle now enclosed as soon as a copy of the work can be had i will send it to you by duplicate the secret of the author will be faithfully preserved during his and my joint lives and those into whose hands my papers will fall at     my death will be equally worthy of confidence when the death of the author or his living consent shall permit the world to know their benefactor both his and my papers will furnish the evidence in the meantime the many important truths the work so solidly establishes will i hope make it the political rudiment of the young and manual of our older citizens one of its doctrines indeed the preference of a plural over a singular executive will probably not be assented to here when our present government was first established we had many doubts on this question and many leanings towards a supreme executive council it happened that at that time the experiment of such an one was commenced in france while the single executive was under trial here we watched the motions and effects of these two rival plans with an interest and anxiety proportioned to the importance of a choice between them the experiment in france failed after a short course and not from any circumstance peculiar to the times or nation but from those internal jealousies and dissensions in the directory which will ever arise among men equal in power without a principal to decide and control their differences we had tried a similar experiment in      by establishing a committee of the states composed of a member from every state then thirteen to exercise the executive functions during the recess of congress they fell immediately into schisms and dissensions which became at length so inveterate as to render all cooperation among them impracticable they dissolved     themselves abandoning the helm of government and it continued without a head until congress met the ensuing winter this was then imputed to the temper of two or three individuals but the wise ascribed it to the nature of man the failure of the french directory and from the same cause seems to have authorized a belief that the form of a plurality however promising in theory is impracticable with men constituted with the ordinary passions while the tranquil and steady tenor of our single executive during a course of twentytwo years of the most tempestuous times the history of the world has ever presented gives a rational hope that this important problem is at length solved aided by the counsels of a cabinet of heads of departments originally four but now five with whom the president consults either singly or altogether he has the benefit of their wisdom and information brings their views to one centre and produces an unity of action and direction in all the branches of the government the excellence of this construction of the executive power has already manifested itself here under very opposite circumstances during the administration of our first president his cabinet of four members was equally divided by as marked an opposition of principle as monarchism and republicanism could bring into conflict had that cabinet been a directory like positive and negative quantities in algebra the opposing wills would have balanced each other and produced a state of absolute inaction but the president heard with calmness the opinions and reasons of each decided the course to be pursued and     kept the government steadily in it unaffected by the agitation the public knew well the dissensions of the cabinet but never had an uneasy thought on their account because they knew also they had provided a regulating power which would keep the machine in steady movement i speak with an intimate knowledge of these scenes quorum pars fui as i may of others of a character entirely opposite the third administration which was of eight years presented an example of harmony in a cabinet of six persons to which perhaps history has furnished no parallel there never arose during the whole time an instance of an unpleasant thought or word between the members we sometimes met under differences of opinion but scarcely ever failed by conversing and reasoning so to modify each others ideas as to produce an unanimous result yet able and amicable as these members were i am not certain this would have been the case had each possessed equal and independent powers illdefined limits of their respective departments jealousies trifling at first but nourished and strengthened by repetition of occasions intrigues without doors of designing persons to build an importance to themselves on the divisions of others might from small beginnings have produced persevering oppositions but the power of decision in the president left no object for internal dissension and external intrigue was stifled in embryo by the knowledge which incendiaries possessed that no division they could foment would change the course of the executive power i am not conscious that my participations     in executive authority have produced any bias in favor of the single executive because the parts i have acted have been in the subordinate as well as superior stations and because if i know myself what i have felt and what i have wished i know that i have never been so well pleased as when i could shift power from my own on the shoulders of others nor have i ever been able to conceive how any rational being could propose happiness to himself from the exercise of power over others i am still however sensible of the solidity of your principle that to insure the safety of the public liberty its depository should be subject to be changed with the greatest ease possible and without suspending or disturbing for a moment the movements of the machine of government you apprehend that a single executive with eminence of talent and destitution of principle equal to the object might by usurpation render his powers hereditary yet i think history furnishes as many examples of a single usurper arising out of a government by a plurality as of temporary trusts of power in a single hand rendered permanent by usurpation i do not believe therefore that this danger is lessened in the hands of a plural executive perhaps it is greatly increased by the state of inefficiency to which they are liable from feuds and divisions among themselves the conservative body you propose might be so constituted as while it would be an admirable sedative in a variety of smaller cases might also be a valuable sentinel and check on the liberticide views of an ambitious individual i am friendly to this     idea but the true barriers of our liberty in this country are our state governments and the wisest conservative power ever contrived by man is that of which our revolution and present government found us possessed seventeen distinct states amalgamated into one as to their foreign concerns but single and independent as to their internal administration regularly organized with legislature and governor resting on the choice of the people and enlightened by a free press can never be so fascinated by the arts of one man as to submit voluntarily to his usurpation nor can they be constrained to it by any force he can possess while that may paralyze the single state in which it happens to be encamped sixteen others spread over a country of two thousand miles diameter rise up on every side ready organized for deliberation by a constitutional legislature and for action by their governor constitutionally the commander of the militia of the state that is to say of every man in it able to bear arms and that militia too regularly formed into regiments and battalions into infantry cavalry and artillery trained under officers general and subordinate legally appointed always in readiness and to whom they are already in habits of obedience the republican government of france was lost without a struggle because the party of un et indivisible had prevailed no provincial organizations existed to which the people might rally under authority of the laws the seats of the directory were virtually vacant and a small force sufficed to turn the legislature out of their chamber and to salute its leader chief of the     nation but with us sixteen out of seventeen states rising in mass under regular organization and legal commanders united in object and action by their congress or if that be in duresse by a special convention present such obstacles to an usurper as forever to stifle ambition in the first conception of that object dangers of another kind might more reasonably be apprehended from this perfect and distinct organization civil and military of the states to wit that certain states from local and occasional discontents might attempt to secede from the union this is certainly possible and would be befriended by this regular organization but it is not probable that local discontents can spread to such an extent as to be able to face the sound parts of so extensive an union and if ever they should reach the majority they would then become the regular government acquire the ascendency in congress and be able to redress their own grievances by laws peaceably and constitutionally passed and even the states in which local discontents might engender a commencement of fermentation would be paralyzed and selfchecked by that very division into parties into which we have fallen into which all states must fall wherein men are at liberty to think speak and act freely according to the diversities of their individual conformations and which are perhaps essential to preserve the purity of the government by the censorship which these parties habitually exercise over each other you will read i am sure with indulgence the     explanations of the grounds on which i have ventured to form an opinion differing from yours they prove my respect for your judgment and diffidence in my own which have forbidden me to retain without examination an opinion questioned by you permit me now to render my portion of the general debt of gratitude by acknowledgements in advance for the singular benefaction which is the subject of this letter to tender my wishes for the continuance of a life so usefully employed and to add the assurances of my perfect esteem and respect thomas jefferson march         monticello william duane to william duane j mss monticello march         dear sir —i learn with sincere concern from yours of the   th received by our last mail the difficulties into which you are brought by the retirement of particular friends from the accommodations they had been in the habit of yielding you that one of those you name should have separated from the censor of john randolph is consonant with the change of disposition which took place in him at washington that the other far above that bias should have done so was not expected i have ever looked to mr lieper as one of the truest republicans of our country whose mind unaffected by personal incidents pursues its course with a steadiness of which we have rare examples looking about for a motive i have supposed it was to be found in the late arraignments of mr gallatin in   0 your papers however he might differ from you on that subject as i do myself the indulgences in difference of opinion which we all owe to one another and every one needs for himself would i thought in a mind like his have prevented such a manifestation of it i believe mr gallatin to be of a pure integrity and as zealously devoted to the liberties and interests of our country as its most affectionate native citizen of this his courage in congress in the days of terror gave proofs which nothing can obliterate from the recollection of those who were witnesses of it these are probably the opinions of mr lieper as i believe they are of every man intimately acquainted with mr gallatin an intercourse almost daily of eight years with him has given me opportunities of knowing his character more thoroughly than perhaps any other man living and i have ascribed the erroneous estimate you have formed of it to the want of that intimate knowledge of him which i possessed every one certainly must form his judgment on the evidence accessible to himself and i have no more doubt of the integrity of your convictions than i have of my own they are drawn from different materials and different sources of information more or less perfect according to our opportunities the zeal the disinterestedness and the abilities with which you have supported the great principles of our revolution the persecutions you have suffered and the firmness and independence with which you have suffered them constitute too strong a claim on the good wishes of every friend of elective government to be effaced by     a solitary case of difference in opinion thus i think and thus i believed my muchesteemed friend lieper would have thought and i am the more concerned he does not as it is so much more in his power to be useful to you than in mine his residence and his standing at the great seat of the monied institutions command a credit with them which no inhabitant of the country and of agricultural pursuits only can have the two or three banks in our uncommercial state are too distant to have any relations with the farmers of albemarle we are persuaded you have not overrated the dispositions of this state to support yourself and your paper they have felt its services too often to be indifferent in the hour of trial they are well aware that the days of danger are not yet over and i am sensible that if there were any means of bringing into concert the good will of the friends of the aurora scattered over this state they would not deceive your expectations one month sooner might have found such an opportunity in the assemblage of our legislature in richmond but that is now dispersed not to meet again under a twelvemonth we here are but one of a hundred counties and on consultation with friends of the neighborhood it is their opinion that if we can find an endorser resident in richmond for that is indispensable ten or twelve persons of this county would readily engage as you suggest for their  00 each and some of them for more it is believed that the republicans in that city can and will do a great deal more and perhaps their central position may enable them to communicate     with other counties we have written to a distinguished friend to the cause of liberty there to take the lead in the business as far as concerns that place and for our own we are taking measures for obtaining the aid of the bank of the same place in all this i am nearly a cypher forty years of almost constant absence from the state have made me a stranger in it have left me a solitary tree from around which the axe of time has felled all the companions of its youth and growth i have however engaged some active and zealous friends to do what i could not their personal acquaintance and influence with those now in active life can give effect to their efforts but our support can be but partial and far short both in time and measure of your difficulties they will be little more than evidences of our friendship the truth is that farmers as we all are have no command of money our necessaries are all supplied either from our farms or a neighboring store our produce at the end of the year is delivered to the merchant and thus the business of the year is done by barter without the intervention of scarcely a dollar and thus also we live with a plenty of everything except money to raise that negociations and time are requisite i sincerely wish that greater and prompter effects could have flowed from our good will on my part no endeavors or sacrifices shall be withheld but we are bound down by the laws of our situation i do not know whether i am able at present to form a just idea of the situation of our country if i am it is such as during the bellum omnium in     omnia of europe will require the union of all its friends to resist its enemies within and without if we schismatize on either men or measures if we do not act in phalanx as when we rescued it from the satellites of monarchism i will not say our party the term is false and degrading but our nation will be undone for the republicans are the nation their opponents are but a faction weak in numbers but powerful and profuse in the command of money and backed by a nation powerful also and profuse in the use of the same means and the more profuse in both cases as the money they thus employ is not their own but their creditors to be paid off by a bankruptcy which whether it pays a dollar or a shilling in the pound is of little concern with them the last hope of human liberty in this world rests on us we ought for so dear a state to sacrifice every attachment and every enmity leave the president free to choose his own coadjutors to pursue his own measures and support him and them even if we think we are wiser than they honester than they are or possessing more enlarged information of the state of things if we move in mass be it ever so circuitously we shall attain our object but if we break into squads every one pursuing the path he thinks most direct we become an easy conquest to those who can now barely hold us in check i repeat again that we ought not to schismatize on either men or measures principles alone can justify that if we find our government in all its branches rushing headlong like our predecessors into the arms of monarchy if we find them violating our     dearest rights the trial by jury the freedom of the press the freedom of opinion civil or religious or opening on our peace of mind or personal safety the sluices of terrorism if we see them raising standing armies when the absence of all other danger points to these as the sole objects on which they are to be employed then indeed let us withdraw and call the nation to its tents but while our functionaries are wise and honest and vigilant let us move compactly under their guidance and we have nothing to fear things may here and there go a little wrong it is not in their power to prevent it but all will be right in the end though not perhaps by the shortest means you know my dear sir that this union of republicans has been the constant theme of my exhortations that i have ever refused to know any subdivisions among them to take part in any personal differences and therefore you will not give to the present observations any other than general application i may sometimes differ in opinion from some of my friends from those whose views are as pure and sound as my own i censure none but do homage to every ones right of opinion if i have indulged my pen therefore a little further than the occasion called for you will ascribe it to a sermonizing habit to the anxieties of age perhaps to its garrulity or to any other motive rather than the want of the esteem and confidence of which i pray you to accept sincere assurances p s absorbed in a subject more nearly interesting i had forgotten our book on the heresies of     montesquieu i sincerely hope the removal of all embarrassment will enable you to go on with it or so to dispose of it as that our country may have the benefit of the corrections it will administer to public opinion      thomas jefferson april         monticello dupont de nemours to dupont de nemours j mss monticello april         dear sir —i have to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of january  0 and september       0 and with the latter your observations on the subject of taxes they bear the stamps of logic and     eloquence which mark everything coming from you and place the doctrines of the economists in their strongest points of view my present retirement and unmeddling disposition make of this une question     viseuse pour moi but after reading the observations with great pleasure i forwarded them to the president and mr gallatin in whose hands they may be useful yet i do not believe the change of our system of taxation will be forced on us so early     as you expect if war be avoided it is true we are going greatly into manufactures but the mass of them are household manufactures of the coarse articles worn by the laborers and farmers of the family these i verily believe we shall succeed in  00 making to the whole extent of our necessities but the attempts at fine goods will probably be abortive they are undertaken by company establishments and chiefly in the towns will have little success and short continuance in a country where the charms of  0  agriculture attract every being who can engage in it our revenue will be less than it would be were we to continue to import instead of manufacturing our coarse goods but the increase of population and production will keep pace with that of manufactures  0  and maintain the quantum of exports at the present level at least and the imports need be equivalent to them and consequently the revenue on them be undiminished i keep up my hopes that if war be avoided mr madison will be able to complete the payment of the national debt within his term after which onethird of the present revenue would support the government your information that a commencement of excise had been again made is entirely unfounded i hope the death blow to that most vexatious and unproductive of all taxes was given at the commencement of my administration and believe its revival would give the death blow to any administration whatever in most of the middle and southern states some land tax is now paid into  0  the state treasury and for this purpose the lands have been classed and valued and the tax assessed according to that valuation in these an excise is most odious in the eastern states land taxes are odious excises less unpopular we are all the more reconciled to the tax on importations because it falls exclusively on the rich and with the equal partition of intestates estates constitute the best agrarian law in fact the poor man in this country who uses nothing but what is made within his own farm or family or within the united states pays not a farthing of tax to the general government but on his salt and should we go into that manufacture as we ought to do we will pay not one cent our  0  revenues once liberated by the discharge of the public debt and its surplus applied to canals roads schools c and the farmer will see his government supported his children educated and the face of his country made a paradise by the contributions of the rich alone without his being called on to spare a cent from his earnings the path we are now pursuing leads directly to this end which we cannot fail to attain unless our administration should fall into unwise hands another great field of political experiment is opening in our neighborhood in spanish america i fear the degrading ignorance into which their priests and kings have sunk them has disqualified them from the maintenance or even knowledge of their rights and that much blood may be shed for little improvement in their condition should their new rulers honestly lay their shoulders to remove the great obstacles of ignorance and press the remedies of education and information they will still be in jeopardy until another generation comes into place and what may happen in the interval cannot be predicted nor shall you or i live to see it in these cases i console myself with the reflection that those who will come after us will be as wise as we are and as able to take care of themselves as we have been i hope you continue to preserve your health and that you may long continue to do so in happiness is the prayer of yours affectionately  0  thomas jefferson april         monticello joel barlow to joel barlow j mss monticello april         dear sir —i felicitate you sincerely on your destination to paris because i believe it will contribute both to your happiness and the public good yet it is not unmixed with regret what is to become of our past revolutionary history of the antidotes of truth to the misrepresentations of marshall this example proves the wisdom of the maxim never to put off to tomorrow what can be done today but putting aside vain regrets i shall be happy to hear from you in your new situation i cannot offer you in exchange the minutiæ of the cabinet the workings in congress or underworkings of those around them general views are all which we at a distance can have but general views are sometimes better taken at a distance than nearer the working of the whole machine is sometimes better seen elsewhere than at its centre in return you can give me the true state of things in europe what is its real public mind at present its disposition towards the existing authority its secret purposes and future prospects seasoned with the literary news i do not propose this as an equal barter because it is really asking you to give a dollar for a shilling i must leave the difference to be made up from other motives i have been long waiting for a safe opportunity to write to some friends and correspondents in france i troubled mr warden with some letters and he kindly offered to take all i could get ready before his departure but his departure seems not yet definitely settled and should he not go with you  0  what is in your hands will be less liable to violation than in his i therefore take the liberty of asking your care of the letters now enclosed and their delivery through confidential hands most of them are of a complexion not proper for the eye of the police and might do injury to those to whom they are addressed wishing to yourself and mrs barlow a happy voyage and that the execution of the duties of your mission may be attended with all agreeable circumstances i salute you with assurance of my perfect esteem and respect thomas jefferson may        monticello james monroe to james monroe j mss monticello may        dear sir —your favor on your departure from richmond came to hand in due time although i may not have been among the first i am certainly with the sincerest who congratulate you on your entrance into the national councils your value there has never been unduly estimated by those whom personal feelings did not misguide the late misunderstandings at washington have been a subject of real concern to me i know that the dissolutions of personal friendship are among the most painful occurrences in human life i have sincere esteem for all who have been affected by them having passed with them eight years of great harmony and affection these incidents are rendered more distressing in our country than elsewhere because our printers ravin on the agonies of their victims as wolves do  0  on the blood of the lamb but the printers and the public are very different personages the former may lead the latter a little out of their track while the deviation is insensible but the moment they usurp their direction and that of their government they will be reduced to their true places the two last congresses have been the theme of the most licentious reprobation for printers thirsting after war some against france and some against england but the people wish for peace with both they feel no incumbency on them to become the reformers of the other hemisphere and to inculcate with fire and sword a return to moral order when indeed peace shall become more losing than war they may owe to their interests what these quixotes are clamoring for on false estimates of honor the public are unmoved by these clamors as the reelection of their legislators shows and they are firm to their executive on the subject of the more recent clamors we are suffering here both in the gathered and the growing crop the lowness of the river and great quantity of produce brought to milton this year render it almost impossible to get our crops to market this is the case of mine as well yours and the hessian fly appears alarmingly in our growing crops everything is in distress for the want of rain present me respectfully to mrs monroe and accept yourself assurances of my constant and affectionate esteem  0  thomas jefferson june      monticello cornelia jefferson randolph to cornelia jefferson randolph  monticello june      my dear cornelia —i have lately received a copy of miss edgeworths moral tales which seeming better suited to your years than to mine i inclose you the first volume the other two shall follow as soon as your mamma has read them they are to make a part of your library i have not looked into them preferring to receive their character from you after you shall have read them your family of silkworms is reduced to a single individual that is now spinning his broach to encourage virginia and mary to take care of it i tell them that as soon as they can get wedding gowns from this spinner they shall be married i propose the same to you that in order to hasten its work you may hasten home for we all wish much to see you and to express in person rather than by letter the assurance of our affectionate love p s the girls desire me to add a postscript to inform you that mrs higginbotham has just given them new dolls thomas jefferson july  d      monticello james madison to james madison j mss monticello july  d      dear sir —i have seen with very great concern the late address of mr smith to the public he has been very illadvised both personally and publicly as far as i can judge from what i hear the impression made is entirely unfavorable to him every  0  mans own understanding readily answers all the facts and insinuations one only excepted and for that they look for explanations without any doubt that they will be satisfactory what is irvings case i have answered the inquiries of several on this head telling them at the same time what was really the truth that the failure of my memory enabled me to give them rather conjectures than recollections for in truth i have but indistinct recollections of the case i know that what was done was on a joint consultation between us and i have no fear that what we did will not have been correct and cautious what i retain of the case on being reminded of some particulars will reinstate the whole firmly in my remembrance and enable me to state them to inquirers with correctness which is the more important from the part i bore in them i must therefore ask the favor of you to give me a short outline of the facts which may correct as well as supply my own recollections but who is to give an explanation to the public not yourself certainly the chief magistrate cannot enter the arena of the newspapers at least the occasion should be of a much higher order i imagine there is some pen at washington competent to it perhaps the best form would be that of some one personating the friend of irving some one apparently from the north nothing labored is requisite a short and simple statement of the case will i am sure satisfy the public we are in the midst of a soso harvest probably onethird short of the last we had a very fine rain on saturday last ever affectionately yours   0 thomas jefferson aug      monticello archibald stuart to archibald stuart  monticello aug      dear sir —i ask the favor of you to purchase for me as much fresh timothy seed as the inclosed bill will pay for pack  forward and that you will have the goodness to direct it to be lodged at mr leitchs store in charlottesville by the waggoner who brings it you see how bold your indulgencies make me in intruding on your kindness i do not know that the government means to make known what has passed between them  foster before the meeting of congress but in the meantime individuals who are in the way think they have a right to fish it out and in this way the sum of it has become known great britain has certainly come forward and declared to our government by an official paper that the conduct of france towards her during this war has obliged her to take possession of the ocean and to determine that no commerce shall be carried on with the nations connected with france that however she is disposed to relax in this determination so far as to permit the commerce which may be carried on thro the british ports i have for   or   years been confident that knowing her own resources were not adequate to the maintenance of her present navy she meant with it to claim the conquest of the ocean and to permit no nation to navigate it but on paiment of a tribute for the maintenance of the fleet necessary to secure that     dominion a thousand circumstances brought together left me without a doubt that that policy directed all her conduct altho not avowed this is the first time she has thrown off the mask the answer  conduct of the government have been what they ought to have been  congress is called a little earlier to be ready to act on the receipt of the reply for which time has been given god bless you from yours affectionately  thomas jefferson august         poplar forest benjamin rush to benjamin rush j mss poplar forest august         dear sir —i write to you from a place ninety miles from monticello near the new london of this state which i visit three or four times a year and stay from a fortnight to a month at a time i have fixed myself comfortably keep some books here     bring others occasionally am in the solitude of a hermit and quite at leisure to attend to my absent friends i note this to show that i am not in a situation to examine the dates of our letters whether i have overgone the annual period of asking how you do i know that within that time i have received one or more letters from you accompanied by a volume of your introductory lectures for which accept my thanks i have read them with pleasure and edification for i acknowledge facts in medicine as far as they go distrusting only their extension by theory having to conduct my grandson through his course of mathematics i have resumed that study with great avidity it was ever my favorite one we have no theories there no uncertainties remain on the mind all is demonstration and satisfaction i have forgotten much and recover it with more difficulty than when in the vigor of my mind i originally acquired it it is wonderful to me that old men should not be sensible that their minds keep pace with their bodies in the progress of decay our old revolutionary friend clinton for example who was a hero but never a man of mind is wonderfully jealous on this head he tells eternally the stories of his younger days to prove his memory as if memory and reason were the same faculty nothing betrays imbecility so much as the being insensible of it had not a conviction of the danger to which an unlimited occupation of the executive chair would expose the republican constitution of our government made it conscientiously a duty to retire when i did the fear of becoming a dotard and of being     insensible of it would of itself have resisted all solicitations to remain i have had a long attack of rheumatism without fever and without pain while i keep myself still a total prostration of the muscles of the back hips and thighs deprived me of the power of walking and leaves it still in a very impaired state a pain when i walk seems to have fixed itself in the hip and to threaten permanence i take moderate rides without much fatigue but my journey to this place in a hardgoing gig gave me great sufferings which i expect will be renewed on my return as soon as i am able the loss of the power of taking exercise would be a sore affliction to me it has been the delight of my retirement to be in constant bodily activity looking after my affairs it was never damped as the pleasures of reading are by the question of cui bono for what object i hope your health of body continues firm your works show that of your mind the habits of exercise which your calling has given to both will tend long to preserve them the sedentary character of my public occupations sapped a constitution naturally sound and vigorous and draws it to an earlier close but it will still last quite as long as i wish it there is a fulness of time when men should go and not occupy too long the ground to which others have a right to advance we must continue while here to exchange occasionally our mutual good wishes i find friendship to be like wine raw when new ripened with age the true old mans milk and restorative cordial god bless you and preserve you through a long and healthy old age     thomas jefferson september         monticello clement caine to clement caine j mss monticello september         sir —your favor of april  d was not received till the   d of june last with the volume accompanying it for which be pleased to accept my thanks i have read it with great satisfaction and received from it information the more acceptable as coming from a source which could be relied on the retort on european censors of their own practices on the liberties of man the inculcation on the master of the moral duties which he owes to the slave in return for the benefit of his service that is to say of food clothing care in sickness and maintenance under age and disability so as to make him in fact as comfortable and more secure than the laboring man in most parts of the world and the idea suggested of substituting free whites in all household occupations and manual arts thus lessening the call for the other kind of labor while it would increase the public security give great merit to the work and will i have no doubt produce wholesome impressions the habitual violation of the equal rights of the colonist by the dominant for i will not call them the mother countries of europe the invariable sacrifice of their higher interests to the minor advantages of any individual trade or calling at home are as immoral in principle as the continuance of them is unwise in practice after the lessons they have received what in short is the whole system of europe towards america but an atrocious and insulting tyranny one hemisphere of the earth separated from the other by wide seas on both sides having a different     system of interests flowing from different climates different soils different productions different modes of existence and its own local relations and duties is made subservient to all the petty interests of the other to their laws their regulations their passions and wars and interdicted from social intercourse from the interchange of mutual duties and comforts with their neighbors enjoined on all men by the laws of nature happily these abuses of human rights are drawing to a close on both our continents and are not likely to survive the present mad contest of the lions and tigers of the other nor does it seem certain that the insular colonies will not soon have to take care of themselves and to enter into the general system of independence and free intercourse with their neighboring and natural friends the acknowledged depreciation of the paper circulation of england with the known laws of its rapid progression to bankruptcy will leave that nation shortly without revenue and without the means of supporting the naval power necessary to maintain dominion over the rights and interests of different nations the intention too which they now formally avow of taking possession of the ocean as their exclusive domain and of suffering no commerce on it but through their ports makes it the interest of all mankind to contribute their efforts to bring such usurpations to an end we have hitherto been able to avoid professed war and to continue to our industry a more salutary direction but the determination to take all our vessels bound to any other than her ports amounting to all the war she can make for we fear     no invasion it would be folly in us to let that war be all on one side only and to make no effort towards indemnification and retaliation by reprisal that a contest thus forced on us by a nation a thousand leagues from us both should place your country and mine in relations of hostility who have not a single motive or interest but of mutual friendship and interchange of comforts shows the monstrous character of the system under which we live but however in the event of war greedy individuals on both sides availing themselves of its laws may commit depredations on each other i trust that our quiet inhabitants conscious that no cause exists but for neighborly good will and the furtherance of common interests will feel only those brotherly affections which nature has ordained to be those of our situation a letter of thanks for a good book has thus run away from its subject into fields of speculation into which discretion perhaps should have forbidden me to enter and for which an apology is due i trust that the reflections i hazard will be considered as no more than what they really are those of a private individual withdrawn from the councils of his country uncommunicating with them and responsible alone for any errors of fact or opinion expressed as the reveries in short of an old man who looking beyond the present day looks into times not his own and as evidences of confidence in the liberal mind of the person to whom they are so freely addressed permit me however to add to them my best wishes for his personal happiness and assurances of the highest consideration and respect     thomas jefferson january         monticello james monroe to james monroe j mss monticello january         dear sir —i thank you for your letter of the  th it is a proof of your friendship and of the sincere interest you take in whatever concerns me of this i have never had a moments doubt and have ever valued it as a precious treasure the question indeed whether i knew or approved of general wilkinsons endeavors to prevent the restoration of the right of deposit at new orleans could never require a second of time to answer but it requires some time for the mind to recover from the astonishment excited by the boldness of the suggestion indeed it is with difficulty i can believe he has really made such an appeal and the rather as the expression in your letter is that you have casually heard it without stating the degree of reliance which you have in the source of information i think his understanding is above an expedient so momentary and so finally overwhelming were dearborne and myself dead it might find credit with some but the world at large even then would weigh for themselves the dilemma whether it was more probable that in the situation i then was clothed with the confidence and power of my country i should descend to so unmeaning an act of treason or that he in the wreck now threatening him should wildly lay hold of any plank they would weigh his motives and views against those of dearborne and myself the tenor of his life against that of ours his spanish mysteries against my open cherishment of the western interests and living as we are and ready to     purge ourselves by any ordeal they must now weigh in addition our testimony against his all this makes me believe he will never seek this refuge i have ever and carefully restrained myself from the expression of any opinion respecting general wilkinson except in the case of burrs conspiracy wherein after he had got over his first agitations we believed his decision firm and his conduct zealous for the defeat of the conspiracy and although injudicious yet meriting from sound intentions the support of the nation as to the rest of his life i have left it to his friends and his enemies to whom it furnishes matter enough for disputation i classed myself with neither and least of all in this time of his distresses should i be disposed to add to their pressure i hope therefore he has not been so imprudent as to write our names in the pannel of his witnesses accept the assurances of my constant affections thomas jefferson january         monticello john adams to john adams   j mss monticello january         dear sir —i thank you before hand for they are not yet arrived for the specimens of homespun you     have been so kind as to forward me by post i doubt not their excellence knowing how far you are advanced in these things in your quarter here we do little in the fine way but in coarse and middling goods a great deal every family in the country is a manufactory within itself and is very generally able to make within itself all the stouter and middling stuffs for its own clothing and household use we consider a sheep for every person in the family as sufficient to clothe it in addition to the cotton hemp and flax which we raise ourselves for fine stuff we shall depend on your northern manufactories of these that is to say of company establishments we have none we use little machinery the spinning jenny and loom with the flying shuttle can be managed in a family but nothing more complicated the economy and thriftiness resulting from our household manufactures are such that they will never again be laid aside and nothing more salutary for us has ever happened than the british obstructions to our demands for their manufactures restore free intercourse when they will their commerce with us will have totally changed its form and the articles we shall in future want from them will not exceed their own consumption of our produce a letter from you calls up recollections very dear to my mind it carries me back to the times when   0 beset with difficulties and dangers we were fellowlaborers in the same cause struggling for what is most valuable to man his right of selfgovernment laboring always at the same oar with some wave ever ahead threatening to overwhelm us and yet passing harmless under our bark we knew not how we rode through the storm with heart and hand and made a happy port still we did not expect to be without rubs and difficulties and we have had them first the detention of the western posts then the coalition of pilnitz outlawing our commerce with france and the british enforcement of the outlawry in your day french depredations in mine english and the berlin and milan decrees now the english orders of council and the piracies they authorize when these shall be over it will be the impressment of our seamen or somethnig else and so we have gone on and so we shall go on puzzled and prospering beyond example in the history of man and i do believe we shall continue to grow to multiply and prosper until we exhibit an association powerful wise and happy beyond what has yet been seen by men as for france and england with all their preëminence in science the one is a den of robbers and the other of pirates and if science produces no better fruits than tyranny murder rapine and destitution of national morality i would rather wish our country to be ignorant honest and estimable as our neighboring savages are but whither is senile garrulity leading me into politics of which i have taken final leave i think little of them and say less i have given up newspapers in     exchange for tacitus and thucydides for newton and euclid and i find myself much the happier sometimes indeed i look back to former occurrences in remembrance of our old friends and fellowlaborers who have fallen before us of the signers of the declaration of independence i see now living not more than half a dozen on your side of the potomac and on this side myself alone you and i have been wonderfully spared and myself with remarkable health and a considerable activity of body and mind i am on horseback three or four hours of every day visit three or four times a year a possession i have ninety miles distant performing the winter journey on horseback i walk little however a single mile being too much for me and i live in the midst of my grandchildren one of whom has lately promoted me to be a great grandfather i have heard with pleasure that you also retain good health and a greater power of exercise in walking than i do but i would rather have heard this from yourself and that writing a letter like mine full of egotisms and of details of your health your habits occupations and enjoyments i should have the pleasure of knowing that in the race of life you do not keep in its physical decline the same distance ahead of me which you have done in political honors and achievements no circumstances have lessened the interest i feel in these particulars respecting yourself none have suspended for one moment my sincere esteem for you and i now salute you with unchanged affection and respect     thomas jefferson january         monticello james barbour to the governor of virginia james barbour j mss monticello january         dear sir —your favor of the   th has been duly received and i sincerely congratulate you or rather my country on the just testimony of confidence which it has lately manifested to you in your hands i know that its affairs will be ably and honestly administered in answer to your inquiry whether in the early times of our government where the council was divided the practice was for the governor to give the deciding vote i must observe that correctly speaking the governor not being a counsellor his vote could make no part of an advice of council that would be to place an advice on their journals which they did not give and could not give because of their equal division but he did what was equivalent in effect while i was in the administration no doubt was ever suggested that where the council divided in opinion could give no advice the governor was free and bound to act on his own opinion and his own responsibility had this been a change of the practice of my predecessor mr henry the first governor it would have produced some discussion which it never did hence i conclude it was the opinion and practice from the first institution of the government during arnolds and cornwallis invasion the council dispersed to their several homes to take care of their families before their separation i obtained from them a capitulary of standing advices for my government in such cases as ordinarily     occur such as the appointment of militia officers justices inspectors c on the recommendations of the courts but in the numerous and extraordinary occurrences of an invasion which could not be foreseen i had to act on my own judgment and my own responsibility the vote of general approbation at the session of the succeeding winter manifested the opinion of the legislature that my proceedings had been correct general nelson my successor staid mostly i think with the army and i do not believe his council followed the camp although my memory does not enable me to affirm the fact some petitions against him for impressment of property without authority of law brought his proceedings before the next legislature the questions necessarily involved were whether necessity without express law could justify the impressment and if it could whether he could order it without the advice of council the approbation of the legislature amounted to a decision of both questions i remember this case the more especially because i was then a member of the legislature and was one of those who supported the governors proceedings and i think there was no division of the house on the question i believe the doubt was first suggested in governor harrisons time by some member of the council on an equal division harrison in his dry way observed that instead of one governor and eight counsellors there would then be eight governors and one counsellor and continued as i understood the practice of his predecessors indeed it is difficult to suppose it could be the intention of those     who framed the constitution that when the council should be divided the government should stand still and the more difficult as to a constitution formed during a war and for the purpose of carrying on that war that so high an officer as their governor should be created and salaried merely to act as the clerk and authenticator of the votes of the council no doubt it was intended that the advice of the council should control the governor but the action of the controlling power being withdrawn his would be left free to proceed on its own responsibility where from division absence sickness or other obstacle no advice could be given they could not mean that their governor the person of their peculiar choice and confidence should stand by an inactive spectator and let their government tumble to pieces for want of a will to direct it in executive cases where promptitude and decision are all important an adherence to the letter of a law against its probable intentions for every law must intend that itself shall be executed would be fraught with incalculable danger judges may await further legislative explanations but a delay of executive action might produce irretrievable ruin the state is invaded militia to be called out an army marched arms and provisions to be issued from the public magazines the legislature to be convened and the council is divided can it be believed to have been the intention of the framers of the constitution that the constitution itself and their constituents with it should be destroyed for want of a will to direct the resources they had provided for its preservation     before such possible consequences all verbal scruples must vanish construction must be made secundum arbitrium boni viri and the constitution be rendered a practicable thing that exposition of it must be vicious which would leave the nation under the most dangerous emergencies without a directing will the cautious maxims of the bench to seek the will of the legislator and his words only are proper and safer for judicial government they act ever on an individual case only the evil of which is partial and gives time for correction but an instant of delay in executive proceedings may be fatal to the whole nation they must not therefore be laced up in the rules of the judiciary department they must seek the intention of the legislator in all the circumstances which may indicate it in the history of the day in the public discussions in the general opinion and understanding in reason and in practice the three great departments having distinct functions to perform must have distinct rules adapted to them each must act under its own rules those of no one having any obligation on either of the others when the opinion first began that a governor could not act when his council could not or would not advise i am uninformed probably not till after the war for had it prevailed then no militia could have been opposed to cornwallis nor necessaries furnished to the opposing army of lafayette these sir are my recollections and thoughts on the subject of your inquiry to which i will only add the assurances of my great esteem and respect     thomas jefferson feb       monticello james madison to james madison j mss monticello feb       dear sir —yours of the   th has been duly received i have much doubted whether in case of a war congress would find it practicable to do their part of the business that a body containing  00 lawyers in it should direct the measures of a war is i fear impossible and that thus that member of our constitution which is its bulwark will prove to be an impracticable one from its cacoethes loquendi it may be doubted how far it has the power but i am sure it has not the resolution to reduce the right of talking to practicable limits thomas jefferson apr       monticello william wirt to william wirt j mss monticello apr       dear sir —mr livingstons suit having gone off on the plea to the jurisdiction its foundation remains of course unexplained to the public i have therefore concluded to make it public thro the ordinary channel of the press an earlier expectation of the pamphlets and the desire to send one has delayed from post to post my sooner acknowledging your kind aid in this case and praying your acceptance of the remuneration i now inclose for the trouble i gave you in reading so much stuff on the subject and your exertions in the defence the debt of gratitude however is of a different nature  is sincerely felt considering the infinite trouble     which the question of right to the batture  the immense volume of evidence to be taken at new orleans would have given to my counsel and myself i am well satisfied to be relieved from it altho i had a strong desire that the public should have been satisfied by a trial on the merits  the abler discussion of them by my counsel a love of peace and tranquility strengthened by age and a lassitude of business renders it extremely disquieting to me to be harrassed by vexatious lawsuits by persons who have no earthly claim on me in cases where i have been merely acting for others in nov last i was served with a subpœna in chancery at the suit of the executors of mrs randolph mother to mr e r in which mr norborne nicholas  perhaps a dozen others are also named defendants the object of this i cannot devine i never had any matter of business with mrs randolph nor ever saw a farthing of hers i once indeed transacted a single affair of hers as a friend at her earnest sollicitation to relieve her from pressing distress and under a regular power of attorney how this can have subjected me to pass the remainder of my life in a court of chancery is as incomprehensible as it is discouraging to the indulgence of our feelings in the services asked from us by our friends i have taken measures to get a copy of the bill and if a substantive defence is required from me i shall ask the favor of your attention to it as i have done in the same case of mr hay the enclosed paper written for you a year or two ago has laid by me with a view still to add something     to it but on reflection i send it as it is  the additional matter contemplated respected mr henrys ravenous avarice the only passion paramount     to his love of popularity the facts i have heard on that subject are not within my own knolege  ought not to be hazarded but on better testimony than i possess and if they are true you have been   0 in a much better situation than i was to have information of them i salute you with great  affectionate esteem and respect p s altho the pamphlets have been some weeks     at fredsbg and expected by every stage i am still disappointed in receiving them i detain my letter therefore no longer but will inclose one on its arrival     thomas jefferson april         monticello james madison to james madison j mss monticello april         dear sir —the enclosed papers will explain themselves their coming to me is the only thing not sufficiently explained     your favor of the  d came duly to hand although something of the kind had been apprehended the embargo found the farmers and planters only getting their produce to market and selling as fast     as they could get it there i think it caught them in this part of the state with onethird of their flour or wheat and threequarters of their tobacco undisposed of if we may suppose the rest of the middle     country in the same situation and that the upper and lower country may be judged by that as a mean these will perhaps be the proportions of produce remaining in the hands of the producers supposing the objects of the government were merely to keep our vessels and men out of harms way and that there is no idea that the want of our flour will starve great britain the sale of the remaining produce will be rather desirable and what would be desired even in war and even to our enemies for i am favorable to the opinion which has been urged by others sometimes acted on and now partly so by france and great britain that commerce under certain restrictions and licenses may be indulged between enemies mutually advantageous to the individuals and not to their injury as belligerents the capitulation of amelia island if confirmed might favor this object and at any rate get off our produce now on hand i think a people would go through a war with much less impatience if they could dispose of their produce and that unless a vent can be provided for them they will soon become querulous and clamor for peace they appear at present to receive embargo with perfect acquiescence and without a murmur seeing the necessity of taking care of our vessels and seamen yet they would be glad to dispose of their produce in any way not endangering them as by letting it go from a neutral place in british vessels in this way we lose the carriage only but better that than both carriage and cargo the rising of the price of flour since the first panic is passed away indicates some prospects in the     merchants of disposing of it our wheat had greatly suffered by the winter but is as remarkably recovered by the favorable weather of the spring ever affectionately yours thomas jefferson april  0      monticello john adams to john adams j mss monticello april  0      dear sir —i have it now in my power to send you a piece of homespun in return for that i received from you not of the fine texture or delicate character of yours or to drop our metaphor not filled as that was with that display of imagination which constitutes excellence in belles lettres but a mere sober dry and formal piece of logic ornari res ipsa negat yet you may have enough left of your old taste for law reading to cast an eye over some of the questions it discusses at any rate accept it as the offering of esteem and friendship you wish to know something of the richmond and wabash prophets of nimrod hews i never heard before christopher macpherson i have known for twenty years he is a man of color brought up as a bookkeeper by a merchant his master and afterwards enfranchized he had understanding enough to post up his ledger from his journal but not enough to bear up against hypochondriac affections and the gloomy forebodings they inspire he became crazy foggy his head always in the clouds and rhapsodizing what neither himself nor any one else could understand i think he told me he had visited you personally while you were in the administration and     wrote you letters which you have probably forgotten in the mass of the correspondences of that crazy class of whose complaints and terrors and mysticisms the several presidents have been the regular depositories macpherson was too honest to be molested by anybody and too inoffensive to be a subject for the madhouse although i believe we are told in the old book that every man that is mad and maketh himself a prophet thou shouldst put him in prison and in the stocks the wabash prophet is a very different character more rogue than fool if to be a rogue is not the greatest of all follies he arose to notice while i was in the administration and became of course a proper subject of inquiry for me the inquiry was made with diligence his declared object was the reformation of his red brethren and their return to their pristine manner of living he pretended to be in constant communication with the great spirit that he was instructed by him to make known to the indians that they were created by him distinct from the whites of different natures for different purposes and placed under different circumstances adapted to their nature and destinies that they must return from all the ways of the whites to the habits and opinions of their forefathers they must not eat the flesh of hogs of bullocks of sheep c the deer and buffalo having been created for their food they must not make bread of wheat but of indian corn they must not wear linen nor woollen but dress like their fathers in the skins and furs of animals they must not drink ardent spirits and     i do not remember whether he extended his inhibitions to the gun and gunpowder in favor of the bow and arrow i concluded from all this that he was a visionary enveloped in the clouds of their antiquities and vainly endeavoring to lead back his brethren to the fancied beatitudes of their golden age i thought there was little danger of his making many proselytes from the habits and comfort they had learned from the whites to the hardships and privations of savagism and no great harm if he did we let him go on therefore unmolested but his followers increased till the english thought him worth corruption and found him corruptible i suppose his views were then changed but his proceedings in consequence of them were after i left the administration and are therefore unknown to me nor have i ever been informed what were the particular acts on his part which produced an actual commencement of hostilities on ours i have no doubt however that his subsequent proceedings are but a chapter apart like that of henry and lord liverpool in the book of the kings of england of this mission of henry your son had got wind in the time of the embargo and communicated it to me but he had learned nothing of the particular agent although of his workings the information he had obtained appears now to have been correct he stated a particular which henry has not distinctly brought forward which was that the eastern states were not to be required to make a formal act of separation from the union and to take a part in the war against it a measure deemed much too strong     for their people but to declare themselves in a state of neutrality in consideration of which they were to have peace and free commerce the lure most likely to insure popular acquiescence having no indications of henry as the intermediate in this negotiation of the essex junto suspicions fell on pickering and his nephew williams in london if he was wronged in this the ground of the suspicion is to be found in his known practices and avowed opinions as that of his accomplices in the sameness of sentiment and of language with henry and subsequently by the fluttering of the wounded pigeons this letter with what it encloses has given you enough i presume of law and the prophets i will only add to it therefore the homage of my respects to mrs adams and to yourself the assurances of affectionate esteem and respect thomas jefferson april         monticello james maury to james maury j mss monticello april         my dear and ancient friend and classmate —often has my heart smote me for delaying acknowledgments to you receiving as i do such frequent proofs of your kind recollection in the transmission of papers to me but instead of acting on the good old maxim of not putting off to tomorrow what we can do today we are too apt to reverse it and not to do today what we can put off to tomorrow but this duty can be no longer put off today we are at peace tomorrow war the curtain of separation is drawing between us and probably will not   0 be withdrawn till one if not both of us will be at rest with our fathers let me now then while i may renew to you the declarations of my warm attachment which in no period of life has ever been weakened and seems to become stronger as the remaining objects of our youthful affections are fewer our two countries are to be at war but not you and i and why should our two countries be at war when by peace we can be so much more useful to one another surely the world will acquit our government from having sought it never before has there been an instance of a nations bearing so much as we have borne two items alone in our catalogue of wrongs will forever acquit us of being the aggressors the impressment of our seamen and the excluding us from the ocean the first foundations of the social compact would be broken up were we definitively to refuse to its members the protection of their persons and property while in their lawful pursuits i think the war will not be short because the object of england long obvious is to claim the ocean as her domain and to exact transit duties from every vessel traversing it this is the sum of her orders of council which were only a step in this bold experiment never meant to be retracted if it could be permanently maintained and this object must continue her in war with all the world to this i see no termination until her exaggerated efforts so much beyond her natural strength and resources shall have exhausted her to bankruptcy the approach of this crisis is i think visible in the departure of her precious metals and     depreciation of her paper medium we who have gone through that operation know its symptoms its course and consequences in england they will be more serious than elsewhere because half the wealth of her people is now in that medium the private revenue of her moneyholders or rather of her paperholders being i believe greater than that of her landholders such a proportion of property imaginary and baseless as it is cannot be reduced to vapor but with great explosion she will rise out of its ruins however because her lands her houses her arts will remain and the greater part of her men and these will give her again that place among nations which is proportioned to her natural means and which we all wish her to hold we believe that the just standing of all nations is the health and security of all we consider the overwhelming power of england on the ocean and of france on the land as destructive of the prosperity and happiness of the world and wish both to be reduced only to the necessity of observing moral duties we believe no more in bonapartes fighting merely for the liberty of the seas than in great britains fighting for the liberties of mankind the object of both is the same to draw to themselves the power the wealth and the resources of other nations we resist the enterprises of england first because they first come vitally home to us and our feelings repel the logic of bearing the lash of george the iii for fear of that of bonaparte at some future day when the wrongs of france shall reach us with equal effect we shall resist them also but one at a time is enough and     having offered a choice to the champions england first takes up the gauntlet the english newspapers suppose me the personal enemy of their nation i am not so i am an enemy to its injuries as i am to those of france if i could permit myself to have national partialities and if the conduct of england would have permitted them to be directed towards her they would have been so i thought that in the administration of mr addington i discovered some dispositions toward justice and even friendship and respect for us and began to pave the way for cherishing these dispositions and improving them into ties of mutual good will but we had then a federal minister there whose dispositions to believe himself and to inspire others with a belief in our sincerity his subsequent conduct has brought into doubt and poor merry the english minister here had learned nothing of diplomacy but its suspicions without head enough to distinguish when they were misplaced mr addington and mr fox passed away too soon to avail the two countries of their dispositions had i been personally hostile to england and biased in favor of either the character or views of her great antagonist the affair of the chesapeake put war into my hand i had only to open it and let havoc loose but if ever i was gratified with the possession of power and of the confidence of those who had entrusted me with it it was on that occasion when i was enabled to use both for the prevention of war towards which the torrent of passion here was directed almost irresistibly and when not another person     in the united states less supported by authority and favor could have resisted it and now that a definitive adherence to her impressments and orders of council renders war no longer avoidable my earnest prayer is that our government may enter into no compact of common cause with the other belligerent but keep us free to make a separate peace whenever england will separately give us peace and future security but lord liverpool is our witness that this can never be but by her removal from our neighborhood i have thus for a moment taken a range into the field of politics to possess you with the view we take of things here but in the scenes which are to ensue i am to be but a spectator i have withdrawn myself from all political intermeddlings to indulge the evening of my life with what have been the passions of every portion of it books science my farms my family and friends to these every hour of the day is now devoted i retain a good activity of mind not quite as much of body but uninterrupted health still the hand of age is upon me all my old friends are nearly gone of those in my neighborhood mr divers and mr lindsay alone remain if you could make it a partie quarrée it would be a comfort indeed we would beguile our lingering hours with talking over our youthful exploits our hunts on peters mountain with a long train of et cetera in addition and feel by recollection at least a momentary flash of youth reviewing the course of a long and sufficiently successful life i find in no portion of it happier moments than     those were i think the old hulk in which you are is near her wreck and that like a prudent rat you should escape in time however here there and everywhere in peace or in war you will have my sincere affections and prayers for your life health and happiness thomas jefferson may         monticello john jacob astor to john jacob astor j mss monticello may         sir —your letter of march   th lingered much on the road and a long journey before i could answer it has delayed its acknowledgment till now i am sorry your enterprise for establishing a factory on the columbia river and a commerce through the line of that river and the missouri should meet with the difficulties stated in your letter i remember well having invited your proposition on that subject and encouraged it with the assurance of every facility and protection which the government could properly afford i considered as a great public acquisition the commencement of a settlement on that point of the western coast of america and looked forward with gratification to the time when its descendants should have spread themselves through the whole length of that coast covering it with free and independent americans unconnected with us but by the ties of blood and interest and employing like us the rights of selfgovernment i hope the obstacles you state are not insurmountable that they will not endanger or even delay the accomplishment of so great a public purpose in the present state of     affairs between great britain and us the government is justly jealous of contraventions of those commercial restrictions which have been deemed necessary to exclude the use of british manufactures in these states and to promote the establishment of similar ones among ourselves the interests too of the revenue require particular watchfulness but in the nonimportation of british manufactures and the revenue raised on foreign goods the legislature could only have in view the consumption of our own citizens and the revenue to be levied on that we certainly did not mean to interfere with the consumption of nations foreign to us as the indians of the columbia and missouri are or to assume a right of levying an impost on that consumption and if the words of the laws take in their supplies in either view it was probably unintentional and because their case not being under the contemplation of the legislature has been inadvertently embraced by it the question with them would be not what manufactures these nations should use or what taxes they should pay us on them but whether we should give a transit for them through our country we have a right to say we will not let the british exercise that transit but it is our interest as well as a neighborly duty to allow it when exercised by our own citizens only to guard against any surreptitious introduction of british influence among those nations we may justifiably require that no englishman be permitted to go with the trading parties and necessary precautions should also be taken to prevent this covering the contravention of our own laws and     views but these once securely guarded our interest would permit the transit free of duty and i do presume that if the subject were fully presented to the legislature they would provide that the laws intended to guard our own concerns only should not assume the regulation of those of foreign and independent nations still less that they should stand in the way of so interesting an object as that of planting the germ of an american population on the shores of the pacific from meddling however with these subjects it is my duty as well as my inclination to abstain they are in hands perfectly qualified to direct them and who knowing better the present state of things are better able to decide what is right and whatever they decide on a full view of the case i shall implicitly confide has been rightly decided accept my best wishes for your success and the assurances of my great esteem and respect thomas jefferson may         monticello james madison to james madison j mss monticello may         dear sir —the difference between a communication  solicitation is too obvious to need suggestion while the latter adds to embarrassments the former only enlarges the field of choice the inclosed letters are merely communications of stewart i know nothing price who recommends him is i believe a good man not otherwise known to me than as a partner of b morgan of n o and as having several times communicated to me useful information while     i was in the government timothy matlack i have known well since the first congress to which he was an assistant secretary he has been always a good whig  being an active one has been abused by his opponents but i have ever thought him an honest man i think he must be known to yourself flour depressed under the first panic of the

county what little ground had been destined for it is mostly put into corn crops of wheat are become very promising altho deluged with rain of which  0 inches fell in  0 days and closed with a very

thomas jefferson may  0      monticello james madison to james madison j mss monticello may  0      dear sir —another communication is enclosed and the letter of the applicant is the only information i have of his qualifications i barely remember such a person as the secretary of mr adams and messenger to the senate while i was of that body     it enlarges the sphere of choice by adding to it a strong federalist the triangular war must be the idea of the anglomen and malcontents in other words the federalists and quids yet it would reconcile neither it would only change the topic of abuse with the former and not cure the mental disease of the latter it would prevent our eastern capitalists and seamen from employment in privateering take away the only chance of conciliating them and keep them at home idle to swell the discontents it would completely disarm us of the most powerful weapon we can employ against great britain by shutting every port to our prizes and yet would not add a single vessel to their number it would shut every market to our agricultural productions and engender impatience and discontent with that class which in fact composes the nation it would insulate us in general negotiations for peace making all the parties our opposers and very indifferent about peace with us if they have it with the rest of the world and would exhibit a solecism worthy of don quixotte only that of a choice to fight two enemies at a time rather than to take them by succession and the only motive for all this is a sublimated impartiality at which the world will laugh and our own people will turn upon us in mass as soon as it is explained to them as it will be by the very persons who are now laying that snare these are the hasty views of one who rarely thinks on these subjects your own will be better and i pray to them every success and to yourself every felicity     thomas jefferson june        monticello james madison to james madison j mss monticello june        dear sir —i have taken the liberty of drawing the attention of the secretary at war to a small depot of military stores at new london and leave the letter open for your perusal be so good as to seal it before delivery i really thought that general dearborne had removed them to lynchburg undoubtedly a safer and more convenient deposit our county is the only one i have heard of which has required a draught this proceeded from a mistake of the colonel who thought he could not receive individual offers but that the whole quota     must present themselves at once every one however manifests the utmost alacrity of the     there having been but ten absentees at the first muster called a further proof is that captain carrs company of volunteer cavalry being specifically called for by the governor though consisting of but    when called on has got up to  0 by new engagements since their call was known the only inquiry they make is whether they are to go to canada or florida not a man as far as i have learned entertains any of those doubts which puzzle the lawyers of congress and astonish common sense whether it is lawful for them to pursue a retreating enemy across the boundary line of the union i hope barlows correspondence has satisfied all our quixottes who thought we should undertake nothing less than to fight all europe at once i enclose you a letter from dr bruff a mighty good and very ingenious man his method of manufacturing   0 bullets and shot has the merit of increasing their specific gravity greatly being made by composition and rendering them as much heavier and better than the common leaden bullet as that is than an iron one it is a pity he should not have the benefit of furnishing the public when it would be equally to their benefit also god bless you thomas jefferson june         monticello john adams to john adams j mss monticello june         dear sir —by our post preceding that which brought your letter of may   st i had received one from mr malcolm on the same subject with yours and by the return of the post had stated to the president my recollections of him but both your letters were probably too late as the appointment had been already made if we may credit the newspapers you ask if there is any book that pretends to give any account of the traditions of the indians or how one can acquire an idea of them some scanty accounts of their traditions but fuller of their customs and characters are given us by most of the early travellers among them these you know were mostly french lafitau among them and adair an englishman have written on this subject the former two volumes the latter one all in  to but unluckily lafitau had in his head a preconceived theory on the mythology manners institutions and government of the ancient nations of europe asia and africa and seems to have entered on those of     america only to fit them into the same frame and to draw from them a confirmation of his general theory he keeps up a perpetual parallel in all those articles between the indians of america and the ancients of the other quarters of the globe he selects therefore all the facts and adopts all the falsehoods which favor his theory and very gravely retails such absurdities as zeal for a theory could alone swallow he was a man of much classical and scriptural reading and has rendered his book not unentertaining he resided five years among the northern indians as a missionary but collects his matter much more from the writings of others than from his own observation adair too had his kink he believed all the indians of america to be descended from the jews the same laws usages rites and ceremonies the same sacrifices priests prophets fasts and festivals almost the same religion and that they all spoke hebrew for although he writes particularly of the southern indians only the catawbas creeks cherokees chickasaws and chocktaws with whom alone he was personally acquainted yet he generalizes whatever he found among them and brings himself to believe that the hundred languages of america differing fundamentally every one from every other as much as greek from gothic yet have all one common prototype he was a trader a man of learning a selftaught hebraist a strong religionist and of as sound a mind as don quixotte in whatever did not touch his religious chivalry his book contains a great deal of real instruction on its subject     only requiring the reader to be constantly on his guard against the wonderful obliquities of his theory the scope of your inquiry would scarcely i suppose take in the three folio volumes of latin of de bry in these facts and fable are mingled together without regard to any favorite system they are less suspicious therefore in their complexion more original and authentic than those of lafitau and adair this is a work of great curiosity extremely rare so as never to be bought in europe but on the breaking up and selling some ancient library on one of these occasions a bookseller procured me a copy which unless you have one is probably the only one in america you ask further if the indians have any order of priesthood among them like the druids bards or minstrels of the celtic nations adair alone determined to see what he wished to see in every object metamorphoses their conjurers into an order of priests and describes their sorceries as if they were the great religious ceremonies of the nation lafitau called them by their proper names jongleurs devins sortileges de bry præstigiatores adair himself sometimes magi archimagi cunning men seers rain makers and the modern indian interpreters call them conjurers and witches they are persons pretending to have communications with the devil and other evil spirits to foretell future events bring down rain find stolen goods raise the dead destroy some and heal others by enchantment lay spells c and adair without departing from his parallel of the jews and indians might have found their counterpart     much more aptly among the soothsayers sorcerers and wizards of the jews their gannes and gambres their simon magus witch of endor and the young damsel whose sorceries disturbed paul so much instead of placing them in a line with their highpriest their chief priests and their magnificent hierarchy generally in the solemn ceremonies of the indians the persons who direct or officiate are their chiefs elders and warriors in civil ceremonies or in those of war it is the head of the cabin in their private or particular feasts or ceremonies and sometimes the matrons as in their corn feasts and even here adair might have kept up his parallel with ennobling his conjurers for the ancient patriarchs the noahs the abrahams isaacs and jacobs and even after the consecration of aaron the samuels and elijahs and we may say further every one for himself offered sacrifices on the altars the true line of distinction seems to be that solemn ceremonies whether public or private addressed to the great spirit are conducted by the worthies of the nation men or matrons while conjurers are resorted to only for the invocation of evil spirits the present state of the several indian tribes without any public order of priests is proof sufficient that they never had such an order their steady habits permit no innovations not even those which the progress of science offers to increase the comforts enlarge the understanding and improve the morality of mankind indeed so little idea have they of a regular order of priests that they mistake ours for their conjurers and call them by that name     so much in answer to your inquiries concerning indians a people with whom in the early part of my life i was very familiar and acquired impressions of attachment and commiseration for them which have never been obliterated before the revolution they were in the habit of coming often and in great numbers to the seat of government where i was very much with them i knew much the great outassetè the warrior and orator of the cherokees he was always the guest of my father on his journeys to and from williamsburg i was in his camp when he made his great farewell oration to his people the evening before his departure for england the moon was in full splendor and to her he seemed to address himself in his prayers for his own safety on the voyage and that of his people during his absence his sounding voice distinct articulation animated action and the solemn silence of his people at their several fires filled me with awe and veneration although i did not understand a word he uttered that nation consisting now of about  000 warriors and the creeks of about  000 are far advanced in civilization they have good cabins enclosed fields large herds of cattle and hogs spin and weave their own clothes of cotton have smiths and other of the most necessary tradesmen write and read are on the increase in numbers and a branch of cherokees is now instituting a regular representative government some other tribes are advancing in the same line on those who have made any progress english seductions will have no effect but the backward will yield and be thrown further back those will     relapse into barbarism and misery lose numbers by war and want and we shall be obliged to drive them with the beasts of the forest into the stony mountains they will be conquered however in canada the possession of that country secures our women and children forever from the tomahawk and scalping knife by removing those who excite them and for this possession orders i presume are issued by this time taking for granted that the doors of congress will reopen with a declaration of war that this may end in indemnity for the past security for the future and complete emancipation from anglomany gallomany and all the manias of demoralized europe and that you may live in health and happiness to see all this is the sincere prayer of yours affectionately thomas jefferson june         monticello elbridge gerry to elbridge gerry j mss monticello june         dear sir —it has given me great pleasure to receive a letter from you it seems as if our ancient friends dying off the whole mass of the affections of the heart survives undiminished to the few who remain i think our acquaintance commenced in      both then just of age we happened to take lodgings in the same house in new york our next meeting was in the congress of      and at various times afterwards in the exercise of that and other public functions until your mission to europe since we have ceased to meet we have still thought and acted together et idem velle atque idem nolle     ea demum amicitia est of this harmony of principle the papers you enclosed me are proof sufficient i do not condole with you on your release from your government the vote of your opponents is the most honorable mark by which the soundness of your conduct could be stamped i claim the same honorable testimonial there was but a single act of my whole administration of which that party approved that was the proclamation on the attack of the chesapeake and when i found that they approved of it i confess i began strongly to apprehend i had done wrong and to exclaim with the psalmist lord what have i done that the wicked should praise me what then does this english faction with you mean their newspapers say rebellion and that they will not remain united with us unless we will permit them to govern the majority if this be their purpose their antirepublican spirit it ought to be met at once but a government like ours should be slow in believing this should put forth its whole might when necessary to suppress it and promptly return to the paths of reconciliation the extent of our country secures it i hope from the vindictive passions of the petty incorporations of greece i rather suspect that the principal office of the other seventeen states will be to moderate and restrain the local excitement of our friends with you when they with the aid of their brethren of the other states if they need it shall have brought the rebellious to their feet they count on british aid but what can that avail them by land they would     separate from their friends who alone furnish employment for their navigation to unite with their only rival for that employment when interdicted the harbors of their quondam brethren they will go i suppose to ask a share in the carrying trade of their rivals and a dispensation with their navigation act they think they will be happier in an association under the rulers of ireland the east and west indies than in an independent government where they are obliged to put up with their proportional share only in the direction of its affairs but i trust that such perverseness will not be that of the honest and wellmeaning mass of the federalists of massachusetts and that when the questions of separation and rebellion shall be nakedly proposed to them the gores and the pickerings will find their levees crowded with silk stocking gentry but no yeomanry an army of officers without soldiers i hope then all will still end well the anglomen will consent to make peace with their bread and butter and you and i shall sink to rest without having been actors or spectators in another civil war how many children have you you beat me i expect in that count but i you in that of our grandchildren we have not timed these things well together or we might have begun a realliance between massachusetts and the old dominion faithful companions in the war of independence peculiarly tallied in interests by each wanting exactly what the other has to spare and estranged to each other in latter times only by the practices of a third nation the common enemy of both let us live only to see     this reunion and i will say with old simeon lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace for mine eyes have seen thy salvation in that peace may you long remain my friend and depart only in the fulness of years all passed in health and prosperity god bless you p s june    i did not condole with you on the reprobation of your opponents because it proved your orthodoxy yesterdays post brought me the resolution of the republicans of congress to propose you as vice president on this i sincerely congratulate you it is a stamp of double proof it is a notification to the factionaries that their nay is the yea of truth and its best test we shall be almost within striking distance of each other who knows but you may fill up some short recess of congress with a visit to monticello where a numerous family will hail you with a hearty country welcome thomas jefferson june         monticello general thaddeus kosciusko to general thaddeus kosciusko j mss monticello june         nous voila donc mon cher ami en guerre avec langleterre this was declared on the   th instant thirty years after the signature of our peace in      within these thirty years what a vast course of growth and prosperity we have had it is not ten years since great britain began a series of insults and injuries which would have been met with war in the threshold by any european power this course has been unremittingly followed up by     increasing wrongs with glimmerings indeed of peaceable redress just sufficient to keep us quiet till she has had the impudence at length to extinguish even these glimmerings by open avowal this would not have been borne so long but that france has kept pace with england in iniquity of principle although not in the power of inflicting wrongs on us the difficulty of selecting a foe between them has spared us many years of war and enabled us to enter into it with less debt more strength and preparation our present enemy will have the sea to herself while we shall be equally predominant at land and shall strip her of all her possessions on this continent she may burn new york indeed by her ships and congreve rockets in which case we must burn the city of london by hired incendiaries of which her starving manufacturers will furnish abundance a people in such desperation as to demand of their government aut parcem aut furcam either bread or the gallows will not reject the same alternative when offered by a foreign hand hunger will make them brave every risk for bread the partisans of england here have endeavored much to goad us into the folly of choosing the ocean instead of the land for the theatre of war that would be to meet their strength with our own weakness instead of their weakness with our strength i hope we shall confine ourselves to the conquest of their possessions and defence of our harbors leaving the war on the ocean to our privateers these will immediately swarm in every sea and do more injury to british commerce than the regular fleets of all europe would   0 do the government of france may discontinue their license trade our privateers will furnish them much more abundantly with colonial produce and whatever the license trade has given them some have apprehended we should be overwhelmed by the new improvements of war which have not yet reached us but the british possess them very imperfectly and what are these improvements chiefly in the management of artillery of which our country admits little use we have nothing to fear from their armies and shall put nothing in prize to their fleets upon the whole i have known no war entered into under more favorable auspices our manufacturers are now very nearly on a footing with those of england she has not a single improvement which we do not possess and many of them better adapted by ourselves to our ordinary use we have reduced the large and expensive machinery for most things to the compass of a private family and every family of any size is now getting machines on a small scale for their household purposes quoting myself as an example and i am much behind many others in this business my household manufactures are just getting into operation on the scale of a carding machine costing  0 only which may be worked by a girl of twelve years old a spinning machine which may be made for  0 carrying   spindles for wool to be worked by a girl also another which can be made for    carrying    spindles for cotton and a loom with a flying shuttle weaving its twenty yards a day i need  000 yards of linen cotton and woollen yearly to     clothe my family which this machinery costing   0 only and worked by two women and two girls will more than furnish for fine goods there are numerous establishments at work in the large cities and many more daily growing up and of merinos we have some thousands and these multiplying fast we consider a sheep for every person as sufficient for their woollen clothing and this state and all to the north have fully that and those to the south and west will soon be up to it in other articles we are equally advanced so that nothing is more certain than that come peace when it will we shall never again go to england for a shilling where we have gone for a dollars worth instead of applying to her manufacturers there they must starve or come here to be employed i give you these details of peaceable operations because they are within my present sphere those of war are in better hands who know how to keep their own secrets because too although a soldier yourself i am sure you contemplate the peaceable employment of man in the improvement of his condition with more pleasure than his murders rapine and devastations mr barnes some time ago forwarded you a bill of exchange for   00 francs of which the enclosed is a duplicate apprehending that a war with england would subject the remittances to you to more casualties i proposed to mr morson of bordeaux to become the intermediate for making remittances to you which he readily acceded to on liberal ideas arising from his personal esteem for you and his desire to be useful to you if you approve of this     medium i am in hopes it will shield you from the effect of the accidents to which the increased dangers of the seas may give birth it would give me great pleasure to hear from you oftener i feel great interest in your health and happiness i know your feelings on the present state of the world and hope they will be cheered by the successful course of our war and the addition of canada to our confederacy the infamous intrigues of great britain to destroy our government of which henrys is but one sample and with the indians to tomahawk our women and children prove that the cession of canada their fulcrum for these machiavelian levers must be a sine qua non at a treaty of peace god bless you and give you to see all these things and many and long years of health and happiness thomas jefferson june         monticello james madison to the president of the united states j mss monticello june         dear sir —i duly received your favor of the   d covering the declaration of war it is entirely popular here the only opinion being that it should have been issued the moment the season admitted the militia to enter canada to continue the war popular two things are necessary mainly   to stop indian barbarities the conquest of canada will do this   to furnish markets for our produce say indeed for our flour for tobacco is already given up and seemingly without reluctance the great profits of the wheat crop have allured every one to it and never was such a crop on the ground as that     which we generally begin to cut this day it would be mortifying to the farmer to see such an one rot in his barn it would soon sicken him to war nor can this be a matter of wonder or of blame on him ours is the only country on earth where war is an instantaneous and total suspension of all the objects of his industry and support for carrying our produce to foreign markets our own ships neutral ships and even enemy ships under neutral flag which i would wink at will probably suffice but the coasting trade is of double importance because both seller and buyer are disappointed and both are our own citizens you will remember that in this trade our greatest distress in the last war was produced by our own pilot boats taken by the british and kept as tenders to their larger vessels these being the swiftest vessels on the ocean they took them and selected the swiftest from the whole mass filled with men they scoured everything along shore and completely cut up that coasting business which might otherwise have been carried on within the range of vessels of force and draught why should not we then line our coast with vessels of pilotboat construction filled with men armed with cannonades and only so much larger as to assure the mastery of the pilot boat the british cannot counterwork us by building similar ones because the fact is however unaccountable that our builders alone understand that construction it is on our own pilot boats the british will depend which our larger vessels may thus retake these however are the ideas of a landsman only mr hamiltons judgment will test their soundness     our militia are much afraid of being called to norfolk at this season they all declare a preference of a march to canada i trust however that governor barbour will attend to circumstances and so apportion the service among the counties that those acclimated by birth or residence may perform the summer tour and the winter service be allotted to the upper counties i trouble you with a letter for general kosciusko it covers a bill of exchange from mr barnes for him and is therefore of great importance to him hoping you will have the goodness so far to befriend the general as to give it your safest conveyance i commit it to you with the assurance of my sincere affections thomas jefferson august        monticello william duane to william duane j mss monticello august        dear sir —your favor of the   th ult came duly to hand and i have to thank you for the military manuals you were so kind as to send me this is the sort of book most needed in our country where even the elements of tactics are unknown the young have never seen service and the old are past it and of those among them who are not superannuated themselves their science is become so i see as you do the difficulties and defects we have to encounter in war and should expect disasters if we had an enemy on land capable of inflicting them but the weakness of our enemy there will make our first errors innocent and the seeds of genius which     nature sows with even hand through every age and country and which need only soil and season to germinate will develop themselves among our military men some of them will become prominent and seconded by the native energy of our citizens will soon i hope to our force add the benefits of skill the acquisition of canada this year as far as the neighborhood of quebec will be a mere matter of marching and will give us experience for the attack of halifax the next and the final expulsion of england from the american continent halifax once taken every cockboat of hers must return to england for repairs their fleet will annihilate our public force on the water but our privateers will eat out the vitals of their commerce perhaps they will burn new york or boston if they do we must burn the city of london not by expensive fleets or congreve rockets but by employing an hundred or two jackthepainters whom nakedness famine desperation and hardened vice will abundantly furnish from among themselves we have a rumor now afloat that the orders of council are repealed the thing is impossible after castlereaghs late declaration in parliament and the reconstruction of a percival ministry i consider this last circumstance fortunate for us the repeal of the orders of council would only add recruits to our minority and enable them the more to embarrass our march to thorough redress of our past wrongs and permanent security for the future this we shall attain if no internal obstacles are raised up the exclusion of their commerce from     the united states and the closing of the baltic against it which the present campaign in europe will effect will accomplish the catastrophe already so far advanced on them i think your anticipations of the effects of this are entirely probable their arts their science and what they have left of virtue will come over to us and although their vices will come also these i think will soon be diluted and evaporated in a country of plain honesty experience will soon teach the newcomers how much more plentiful and pleasant is the subsistence gained by wholesome labor and fair dealing than a precarious and hazardous dependence on the enterprises of vice and violence still i agree with you that these immigrations will give strength to english partialities to eradicate which is one of the most consoling expectations from the war but probably the old hive will be broken up by a revolution and a regeneration of its principles render intercourse with it no longer contaminating a republic there like ours and a reduction of their naval power within the limits of their annual facilities of payment might render their existence even interesting to us it is the construction of their government and its principles and means of corruption which makes its continuance inconsistent with the safety of other nations a change in its form might make it an honest one and justify a confidence in its faith and friendship that regeneration however will take a longer time than i have to live i shall leave it to be enjoyed among you and make my exit with a bow to it as the most flagitious of governments i     leave among men i sincerely wish you may live to see the prodigy of its renovation enjoying in the meantime health and prosperity thomas jefferson october        monticello william duane to william duane j mss monticello october        dear sir —your favor of september the  0th has been duly received and i cannot but be gratified by the assurance it expresses that my aid in the councils of our government would increase the public confidence in them because it admits an inference that they have approved of the course pursued when i heretofore bore a part in those councils i profess too so much of the roman principle as to deem it honorable for the general of yesterday to act as a corporal today if his services can be useful to his country holding that to be false pride which postpones the public good to any private or personal considerations but i am past service the hand of age is upon me the decay of bodily faculties apprizes me that those of the mind cannot be unimpaired had i not still better proofs every year counts by increased debility and departing faculties keep the score the last year it was the sight this it is the hearing the next something else will be going until all is gone of all this i was sensible before i left washington and probably my fellow laborers saw it before i did the decay of memory was obvious it is now become distressing but the mind too is weakened when i was young mathematics was the passion of my life the same     passion has returned upon me but with unequal powers processes which i then read off with the facility of common discourse now cost me labor and time and slow investigation when i offered this therefore as one of the reasons deciding my retirement from office it was offered in sincerity and a consciousness of its truth and i think it a great blessing that i retain understanding enough to be sensible how much of it i have lost and to avoid exposing myself as a spectacle for the pity of my friends that i have surmounted the difficult point of knowing when to retire as a compensation for faculties departed nature gives me good health and a perfect resignation to the laws of decay which she has prescribed to all the forms and combinations of matter the detestable treason of hull has indeed excited a deep anxiety in all breasts the depression was in the first moment gloomy and portentous but it has been succeeded by a revived animation and a determination to meet the occurrence with increased efforts and i have so much confidence in the vigorous minds and bodies of our countrymen as to be fearless as to the final issue the treachery of hull like that of arnold cannot be matter of blame on our government his character as an officer of skill and bravery was established on the trials of the last war and no previous act of his life had led to doubt his fidelity whether the head of the war department is equal to his charge i am not qualified to decide i knew him only as a pleasant gentlemanly man in society and the indecision of     his character rather added to the amenity of his conversation but when translated from the colloquial circle to the great stage of national concerns and the direction of the extensive operations of war whether he has been able to seize at one glance the long line of defenceless border presented by our enemy the masses of strength which we hold on different points of it the facility this gave us of attacking him on the same day on all his points from the extremity of the lakes to the neighborhood of quebec and the perfect indifference with which this last place impregnable as it is might be left in the hands of the enemy to fall of itself whether i say he could see and prepare vigorously for all this or merely wrapped himself in the cloak of cold defence i am uninformed i clearly think with you on the competence of monroe to embrace great views of action the decision of his character his enterprise firmness industry and unceasing vigilance would i believe secure as i am sure they would merit the public confidence and give us all the success which our means can accomplish if our operations have suffered or languished from any want of energy in the present head which directs them i have so much confidence in the wisdom and conscientious integrity of mr madison as to be satisfied that however torturing to his feelings he will fulfil his duty to the public and to his own reputation by making the necessary change perhaps he may be preparing it while we are talking about it for of all these things i am uninformed i fear that hulls surrender has been more than the mere loss of a year to us   0 besides bringing on us the whole mass of savage nations whom fear and not affection has kept in quiet there is danger that in giving time to an enemy who can send reinforcements of regulars faster than we can raise them they may strengthen canada and halifax beyond the assailment of our lax and divided powers perhaps however the patriotic efforts from kentucky and ohio by recalling the british force to its upper posts may yet give time to dearborne to strike a blow below effectual possession of the river from montreal to the chaudiere which is practicable would give us the upper country at our leisure and close forever the scenes of the tomahawk and scalping knife but these things are for others to plan and achieve the only succor from the old must lie in their prayers these i offer up with sincere devotion and in my concern for the great public i do not overlook my friends but supplicate for them as i do for yourself a long course of freedom happiness and prosperity thomas jefferson nov      monticello james madison to james madison j mss monticello nov      dear sir —i inclose you a letter from colo gibson secretary under governor harrison i suppose he has addressed it to me on the footing of a very old acquaintance he is a very honest man very old in public service  much esteemed by all who know him all this i believe however is known to yourself  possibly he may be personally known to you     the seeing whether our untried generals will stand proof is a very dear operation two of them have cost us a great many men we can tell by his plumage whether a cock is dunghill or game but with us cowardice  courage wear the same plume hull will of course be shot for cowardice  treachery and will not van renslaer be broke for cowardice and incapacity to advance such a body of men across a river without securing boats to bring them off in case of disaster has cost us  00 men and to have taken no part himself in such an action  against such a general would be nothing but cowardice these are the reflections of a solitary reader of his own letter dearborne  harrison have both courage  understanding  having no longer a brock to encounter i hope we shall hear something good from them if we could but get canada to trois rivieres in our hands we should have a set off against spoliations to be treated of  in the mean time separate the indians from them and set the friendly to attack the hostile part with our aid ever affectionately yours thomas jefferson jan         monticello james ronaldson to james ronaldson j mss monticello jan         dear sir —your favor of november  d arrived a little before i set out on a journey on which i was absent between five and six weeks i have still therefore to return you my thanks for the seeds accompanying it which shall be duly taken care of and a communication made to others of such as shall     prove valuable i have been long endeavoring to procure the cork tree from europe but without success a plant which i brought with me from paris died after languishing some time and of several parcels of acorns received from a correspondent at marseilles not one has ever vegetated i shall continue my endeavors although disheartened by the nonchalance of our southern fellow citizens with whom alone they can thrive it is now twentyfive years since i sent them two shipments about  00 plants of the olive tree of aix the finest olives in the world if any of them still exist it is merely as a curiosity in their gardens not a single orchard of them has been planted i sent them also the celebrated species of sainfoin  from malta which yields good crops without a drop of rain through the season it was lost the upland rice which i procured fresh from africa and sent them has been preserved and spread in the upper parts of georgia and i believe in kentucky but we must acknowledge their services in furnishing us an abundance of cotton a substitute for silk flax and hemp the ease with which it is spun will occasion it to supplant the two last and its cleanliness the first household manufacture is taking deep root with us i have a carding machine two spinning machines and looms with the flying shuttle in full operation for clothing my own family and i verily believe that by the next winter this state will not need a yard of imported coarse or middling clothing i think we have already a sheep for every inhabitant which will suffice for     clothing and onethird more which a single year will add will furnish blanketing with respect to marine hospitals which are one of the subjects of your letter i presume you know that such establishments have been made by the general government in the several states that a portion of seamans wages is drawn for their support and the government furnishes what is deficient mr gallatin is attentive to them and they will grow with our growth you doubt whether we ought to permit the exportation of grain to our enemies but great britain with her own agricultural support and those she can command by her access into every sea cannot be starved by withholding our supplies and if she is to be fed at all events why may we not have the benefit of it as well as others i would not indeed feed her armies landed on our territory because the difficulty of inland subsistence is what will prevent their ever penetrating far into the country and will confine them to the sea coast but this would be my only exception and as to feeding her armies in the peninsular she is fighting our battles there as bonaparte is on the baltic he is shutting out her manufactures from that sea and so far assisting us in her reduction to extremity but if she does not keep him out of the peninsular if he gets full command of that instead of the greatest and surest of all our markets as that has uniformly been we shall be excluded from it or so much shackled by his tyranny and ignorant caprices that it will become for us what france now is besides if we could by starving the english armies oblige them to withdraw     from the peninsular it would be to send them here and i think we had better feed them there for pay than feed and fight them here for nothing a truth too not to be lost sight of is that no country can pay war taxes if you suppress all their resources to keep the war popular we must keep open the markets as long as good prices can be had the people will support the war cheerfully if you should have an opportunity of conveying to mr heriot my thanks for his book you will oblige me by doing it accept the assurance of my great esteem and respect thomas jefferson january         monticello john melish to john melish j mss monticello january         dear sir —i received duly your favor of december the   th and with it the copies of your map and travels for which be pleased to accept my thanks the book i have read with extreme satisfaction and information as to the western states particularly it has greatly edified me for of the actual condition of that interesting portion of our country i had not an adequate idea i feel myself now as familiar with it as with the condition of the maritime states i had no conception that manufactures had made such progress there and particularly of the number of carding and spinning machines dispersed through the whole country we are but beginning here to have them in our private families small spinning jennies of from half a dozen to twenty spindles will soon however make their way into the humblest     cottages as well as the richest houses and nothing is more certain than that the coarse and middling clothing for our families will forever hereafter continue to be made within ourselves i have hitherto myself depended entirely on foreign manufactures but i have now thirtyfive spindles agoing a hand carding machine and looms with the flying shuttle for the supply of my own farms which will never be relinquished in my time the continuance of the war will fix the habit generally and out of the evils of impressment and of the orders of council a great blessing for us will grow i have not formerly been an advocate for great manufactories i doubted whether our labor employed in agriculture and aided by the spontaneous energies of the earth would not procure us more than we could make ourselves of other necessaries but other considerations entering into the question have settled my doubts the candor with which you have viewed the manners and condition of our citizens is so unlike the narrow prejudices of the french and english travellers preceding you who considering each the manners and habits of their own people as the only orthodox have viewed everything differing from that test as boorish and barbarous that your work will be read here extensively and operate great good amidst this mass of approbation which is given to every other part of the work there is a single sentiment which i cannot help wishing to bring to what i think the correct one and on a point so interesting i value your opinion too highly not to ambition     its concurrence with my own stating in volume one page sixtythree the principle of difference between the two great political parties here you conclude it to be whether the controlling power shall be vested in this or that set of men that each party endeavors to get into the administration of the government and exclude the other from power is true and may be stated as a motive of action but this is only secondary the primary motive being a real and radical difference of political principle i sincerely wish our differences were but personally who should govern and that the principles of our constitution were those of both parties unfortunately it is otherwise and the question of preference between monarchy and republicanism which has so long divided mankind elsewhere threatens a permanent division here among that section of our citizens called federalists there are three shades of opinion distinguishing between the leaders and people who compose it the leaders consider the english constitution as a model of perfection some with a correction of its vices others with all its corruptions and abuses this last was alexander hamiltons opinion which others as well as myself have often heard him declare and that a correction of what are called its vices would render the english an impracticable government this government they wished to have established here and only accepted and held fast at first to the present constitution as a steppingstone to the final establishment of their favorite model this party has therefore always clung to england as     their prototype and great auxiliary in promoting and effecting this change a weighty minority however of these leaders considering the voluntary conversion of our government into a monarchy as too distant if not desperate wish to break off from our union its eastern fragment as being in truth the hotbed of american monarchism with a view to a commencement of their favorite government from whence the other states may gangrene by degrees and the whole be thus brought finally to the desired point for massachusetts the prime mover in this enterprise is the last state in the union to mean a final separation as being of all the most dependent on the others not raising bread for the sustenance of her own inhabitants not having a stick of timber for the construction of vessels her principal occupation nor an article to export in them where would she be excluded from the ports of the other states and thrown into dependence on england her direct and natural but now insidious rival at the head of this minority is what is called the essex junto of massachusetts but the majority of these leaders do not aim at separation in this they adhere to the known principle of general hamilton never under any views to break the union anglomany monarchy and separation then are the principles of the essex federalists anglomany and monarchy those of the hamiltonians and anglomany alone that of the portion among the people who call themselves federalists these last are as good republicans as the brethren whom they oppose and differ from them only in their devotion to england and     hatred of france which they have imbibed from their leaders the moment that these leaders should avowedly propose a separation of the union or the establishment of regal government their popular adherents would quit them to a man and join the republican standard and the partisans of this change even in massachusetts would thus find themselves an army of officers without a soldier the party called republican is steadily for the support of the present constitution they obtained at its commencement all the amendments to it they desired these reconciled them to it perfectly and if they have any ulterior view it is only perhaps to popularize it further by shortening the senatorial term and devising a process for the responsibility of judges more practical than that of impeachment they esteem the people of england and france equally and equally detest the governing powers of both this i verily believe after an intimacy of forty years with the public councils and characters is a true statement of the grounds on which they are at present divided and that it is not merely an ambition for power an honest man can feel no pleasure in the exercise of power over his fellow citizens and considering as the only offices of power those conferred by the people directly that is to say the executive and legislative functions of the general and state governments the common refusal of these and multiplied resignations are proofs sufficient that power is not alluring to pure minds and is not with them the primary principle of contest this is my     belief of it it is that on which i have acted and had it been a mere contest who should be permitted to administer the government according to its genuine republican principles there has never been a moment of my life in which i should have relinquished for it the enjoyments of my family my farm my friends and books you expected to discover the difference of our party principles in general washingtons valedictory and my inaugural address not at all general washington did not harbor one principle of federalism he was neither an angloman a monarchist nor a separatist he sincerely wished the people to have as much selfgovernment as they were competent to exercise themselves the only point on which he and i ever differed in opinion was that i had more confidence than he had in the natural integrity and discretion of the people and in the safety and extent to which they might trust themselves with a control over their government he has asseverated to me a thousand times his determination that the existing government should have a fair trial and that in support of it he would spend the last drop of his blood he did this the more repeatedly because he knew general hamiltons political bias and my apprehensions from it it is a mere calumny therefore in the monarchists to associate general washington with their principles but that may have happened in this case which has been often seen in ordinary cases that by oft repeating an untruth men come to believe it themselves it is a mere artifice in this party to bolster themselves up on the   0 revered name of that first of our worthies if i have dwelt longer on this subject than was necessary it proves the estimation in which i hold your ultimate opinions and my desire of placing the subject truly before them in so doing i am certain i risk no use of the communication which may draw me into contention before the public tranquillity is the summum bonum of a septagenaire to return to the merits of your work i consider it as so lively a picture of the real state of our country that if i can possibly obtain opportunities of conveyance i propose to send a copy to a friend in france and another to one in italy who i know will translate and circulate it as an antidote to the misrepresentations of former travellers but whatever effect my profession of political faith may have on your general opinion a part of my object will be obtained if it satisfies you as to the principles of my own action and of the high respect and consideration with which i tender you my salutations thomas jefferson feb       monticello william p gardner to william p gardner j mss monticello feb       sir —your favor of the   th has been duly received together with the papers it covered and particularly mr barralets sketch of the ornaments proposed to accompany the publication of the declaration of independance contemplated by mr murray and yourself i am too little versed in the art of design to be able to offer any suggestions to the     artist as far as i am a judge the composition appears to be judicious and well imagined were i to hazard a suggestion it should be that mr hancock as president of congress should occupy the middle and principal place no man better merited than mr john adams to hold a most conspicuous place in the design he was the pillar of its support on the floor of congress its ablest advocate and defender against the multifarious assaults it encountered for many excellent persons opposed it on doubts whether we were provided sufficiently with the means of supporting it whether the minds of our constituents were yet prepared to receive it c who after it was decided united zealously in the measures it called for i must ask permission to become a subscriber for a copy when published which if rolled on a wooden roller  sent by mail will come safely accept the assurances of my respect  best wishes thomas jefferson feb       monticello james madison to james madison j mss monticello feb       dear sir —on the occasion of your separation from mr robert smith i recollect your mentioning in one of your letters to me that among the circumstances which afflicted you was the impression it might make on his connections in this quarter for whom you entertained so much friendship  esteem it was soon discernible that on one of them whom i had the most frequent opportunities of seeing no     other impression was made than that which every man of understanding felt of which i think i informed you at the time and there has never been one moment of remission on his part in his zealous attachment to yourself and your administration of mr nicholass feelings i have not had as good occasions of judging for myself i see him seldom at his own house only and in the midst of his family before whom of course neither he nor i should think of introducing the subject indulgence to the feelings of their families would necessarily in their presence impose reserve on both of these gentlemen i have lately however thro a channel which can leave no doubt on the subject ascertained that on mr nicholas also no impression unfavorable to you was made by that transaction and that his friendship for you has never felt a moments abatement indeed we might have been sure of this from his integrity his good sense and his sound judgment of men and things very serious and urgent letters too written by him to both general smith and giles on the course pursued by them are proofs of the undeviating character of his own knowing your value of him and that which we both set on the attachment to republican government of a family so estimable so able and so strong in its connections i have believed it would be pleasing to you to be assured of these facts i am led to the communication too by another motive the opportunity which i think i see of cementing these dispositions by a measure which will at the same time be useful to the public he has a son robert carter nicholas whom     i cannot praise more than by saying he is exactly the father over again the same strong observation sound judgment prudence and honesty of purpose impressed by more education and reading he has been brought up to the bar but on the insults to his country he felt the animation they were calculated to inspire more especially in young  ardent minds and he obtained a captaincy in one of the regiments lately authorized there can be few such men in our army and it is highly interesting to us all that these few should be approached on all fair occasions as much as possible towards the higher grades of the army he is one of those who in relation as well as in action will gratify our national feelings there being more regiments now to be raised i have supposed he might be advanced a grade say to a majority in one of these i wish his age and experience had been such as to justify more such a measure while promoting the good of the service would have a cordial effect on the mind of the father and the more so in proportion as it is unsollicited and unexpected it would remove all scruples  anxieties on both sides by manifesting to him the state of your mind  strengthening your conviction of his dispositions towards you i will take the liberty of suggesting this transfer to genl armstrong also whose particular acquaintance will raise more favorable presumptions as to the son and facilitate the measure should it meet with your own approbation another general it seems has given proof of his military qualifications by the loss of another thousand     of men for there cannot be a surprise but thro the fault of the commanders and especially by an enemy who has given us heretofore so many of these lessons perhaps we ought to expect such trials after deperdition of all military science consequent on so long a peace and i am happy to observe the public mind not discouraged and that it does not associate its government with these unfortunate agents these experiments will at least have the good effect of bringing forward those whom nature has qualified for military trust and whenever we have good commanders we shall have good souldiers and good successes god bless you and give you that success which wisdom  integrity ought to ensure to you thomas jefferson feb       monticello john armstrong to john armstrong j mss monticello feb       dear general —another general it seems has lost us another thousand men by suffering them to be surprised and this too by an enemy who by so many similar lessons had taught us that surprise is his habitual resource our only hope is that these misfortunes will at length elicit by trial the characters qualified by nature from those unqualified to be entrusted with the destinies of their fellow citizens the unfortunate obstinacy of the senate in preferring the greatest blockhead to the greatest military genius if one day longer in commission renders it doubly important to sift well the candidates for command in new corps  to marshal them     at first towards the head in proportion to their qualifications these reflections have induced me to bring to your notice a young gentleman of my neighborhood now a captain in one of the regiments lately established in his own region i know you will not be permitted to advance him altho there is not i believe a service on earth where seniority is permitted to give a right to advance beyond the grade of captain we are doomed however to sacrifice the lives of our citizens by thousands to this blind principle for fear the peculiar interest  responsibility of our executive should not be sufficient to guard his selection of officers against favoritism be it so we must submit but when you have new corps to raise you are free to prefer merit and our mechanical law of promotion when once men have been set in their places makes it most interesting indeed to place them originally according to their capacities it is not for me even to ask whether in the raw regiments now to be raised it would not be advisable to draw from the former the few officers who may already have discovered military talent and to bring them forward in the new corps to those higher grades to which in the old the blocks in their way do not permit you to advance them whether the short trial you have had of them does not furnish better ground of selection than the commonplace recommendations of new men i confine myself therefore to the individual before alluded to you intimately knew his father wilson c nicholas your colleague in senate and our faithful fellowlaborer in the days of trial you knew his good     sense his sound judgment his rectitude and his zeal for republican government the son robert carter nicholas the captain whom i before mentioned is not behind the father in these good qualifications with the advantage of a higher degree of education when improved by experience he will be one of those who will faithfully and understandingly render account of the talent which shall be delivered to him would it not therefore be advisable to advance such a subject while it is in your power a grade in one of the new regiments i suggest this from no motive of personal favor to him he does not even know the judgment i have formed of him  still less that i have thought of placing him under your view i am urged to it by the desire of contributing what i can to your information  to guide your selection of military agents if i knew others personally of like merit i should draw your notice to them also because without information talent  fatuity must stand alike before you under the mark of the same uniform i write on this subject to the president also and resign myself with contentedness to the perfect conviction that whatever you do will be right and in the same spirit i assure you of my constant friendship  respect thomas jefferson may         monticello james madison to james madison j mss monticello may         dear sir —the enclosed letter from whit was unquestionably intended for you the subject the     address both of title and place prove it and the mistake of the name only shows the writer to be a very uninquisitive statesman dr waterhouses letter too was intended for your eye and although the immediate object fails by previous appointment yet he seems to entertain further wishes i enclose too the newspapers he refers to as some of their matter may have escaped your notice and the traitorous designs fostered in massachusetts and explained in them call for attention we have never seen so unpromising a crop of wheat as that now growing the winter killed an unusual proportion of it and the fly is destroying the remainder we may estimate the latter loss at onethird at present and fast increasing from the effect of the extraordinary drought with such a prospect before us the blockade is acting severely on our past labors it caught nearly the whole wheat of the middle and upper country in the hands of the farmers and millers whose interior situation had prevented their getting it to an earlier market from this neighborhood very little had been sold when we cast our eyes on the map and see the extent of country from new york to north carolina inclusive whose product is raised on the waters of the chesapeake for albemarle sound is by the canal of norfolk become a water of the chesapeake and consider its productiveness in comparison with the rest of the atlantic states probably a full half and that all this can be shut up by two or three ships of the line lying at the mouth of the bay we see that an injury so vast to ourselves and so cheap to our     enemy must forever be resorted to by them and constantly maintained to defend all the shores of those waters in detail is impossible but is there not a single point where they may be all defended by means to which the magnitude of the object gives a title i mean at the mouth of the chesapeake not by ships of the line or frigates for i know that with our present enemy we cannot contend in that way but would not a sufficient number of gunboats of small draught stationed in lynhaven river render it unsafe for ships of war either to ascend the chesapeake or to lie at its mouth i am not unaware of the effect of the ridicule cast on this instrument of defence by those who wished for engines of offence but resort is had to ridicule only when reason is against us i know too the prejudices of the gentlemen of the navy and that these are very natural no one has been more gratified than myself by the brilliant achievements of our little navy they have deeply wounded the pride of our enemy and been balm to ours humiliated on the land where our real strength was felt to lie but divesting ourselves of the enthusiasm these brave actions have justly excited it is impossible not to see that all these vessels must be taken and added to the already overwhelming force of our enemy that even while we keep them they contribute nothing to our defence and that so far as we are to be defended by anything on the water it must be by such vessels as can assail under advantageous circumstances and under adverse ones withdraw from the reach of the enemy this in shoally waters is the humble the ridiculed     but the formidable gunboats i acknowledge that in the case which produces these reflections the station of lynhaven river would not be safe against land attacks on the boats and that a retreat for them is necessary in this event with a view to this there was a survey made by colonel tatham which was lodged either in the war or navy office showing the depth and length of a canal which would give them a retreat from lynhaven river into the eastern branch of elizabeth river i think the distance is not over six or eight miles perhaps not so much through a country entirely flat and little above the level of the sea a cut of ten yards wide and four yards deep requiring the removal of forty cubic yards of earth for every yard in length of the canal at twenty cents the cubic yard would cost about   000 a mile but even doubling this to cover all errors of estimate although in a country offering the cheapest kind of labor it would be nothing compared with the extent and productions of the country it is to protect it would for so great a country bear no proportion to what has been expended and justly expended by the union to defend the single spot of new york while such a channel of retreat secures effectually the safety of the gunboats it insures also their aid for the defence of norfolk if attacked from the sea and the norfolk canal gives them a further passage into albemarle sound if necessary for their safety or in aid of the flotilla of that sound or to receive the aid of that flotilla either at norfolk or in lynhaven river for such a flotilla there also will doubtless   0 be thought necessary that being the only outlet now as during the last war for the waters of the chesapeake colonel monroe i think is personally intimate with the face of all that country and no one i am certain is more able or more disposed than the present secretary of the navy to place himself above the navy prejudices and do justice to the aptitude of these humble and economical vessels to the shallow waters of the south on the bold northern shores they would be of less account and the larger vessels will of course be more employed there were they stationed with us they would rather attract danger than ward it off the only service they can render us would be to come in a body when the occasion offers of overwhelming a weaker force of the enemy occupying our bay to oblige them to keep their force in a body leaving the mass of our coast open although it is probable there may not be an idea here which has not been maturely weighed by yourself and with a much broader view of the whole field yet i have frankly hazarded them because possibly some of the facts or ideas may have escaped in the multiplicity of the objects engaging your notice and because in every event they will cost you but the trouble of reading the importance of keeping open a water which covers wholly or considerably five of the most productive states containing threefifths of the population of the atlantic portion of our union and of preserving their resources for the support of the war as far as the state of war and the means of the confederacy will admit     and especially if it can be done for less than is contributed by the union for more than one single city will justify our anxieties to have it effected and should my views of the subject be even wrong i am sure they will find their apology with you in the purity of the motives of personal and public regard which induce a suggestion of them in all cases i am satisfied you are doing what is for the best as far as the means put into your hands will enable you and this thought quiets me under every occurrence and under every occurrence i am sincerely affectionately and respectfully yours thomas jefferson may       monticello richard rush to richard rush j mss monticello may       dear sir —no one has taken a more sincere part than myself in the affliction which has lately befallen your family by the loss of your inestimable and ever to be lamented father his virtues rendered him dear to all who knew him and his benevolence led him to do all men every good in his power much he was able to do and much therefore will be missed my acquaintance with him began in      it soon became intimate and from that time a warm friendship has been maintained by a correspondence of unreserved confidence in the course of this each has deposited in the bosom of the other communications which were never intended to go further in the sacred fidelity of each to the other these were known to be safe and above all things that they would be     kept from the public eye there may have been other letters of this character written by me to him but two alone occur to me at present about which i have any anxiety these were of apr      0   jan         the first of these was on the subject of religion a subject on which i have ever been most scrupulously reserved i have considered it as a matter between every man and his maker in which no other  far less the public had a right to intermeddle to your father alone i committed some views on this subject in the first of the letters above mentioned led to it by previous conversations and a promise on my part to digest  communicate them in writing the letter of jan         respected a mutual friend between whom  myself a suspension of correspondence had taken place this was restored by his kind intervention the correspondence resumed and a friendship revived which had been much valued on both sides another letter of dec      explains this occurrence i very much wish that these letters should remain unseen and unknown and if it would be too much to ask their return i would earnestly entreat of you so to dispose of them as that they might never be seen if possible but by yourself with whom i know their contents would be safe i have too many enemies disposed to make a lacerating use of them not to feel anxieties inspired by a love of tranquility now become the summum bonum of life in your occasional visits to philadelphia perhaps you can lay your hand on them which might be preferable to the drawing a marked attention to them by letter i submit all this to     your honorable  candid mind and praying you to tender to your much esteemed mother my sincere condolances  respects accept for yourself the assurance of my great esteem  consideration thomas jefferson june         monticello john adams to john adams j mss monticello june         dear sir —i wrote you a letter on the   th of may which probably would reach you about the  d instant and on the  th i received yours of the   th of may of lindsays memoirs i had never before heard and scarcely indeed of himself it could not therefore but be unexpected that two letters of mine should have anything to do with his life the name of his editor was new to me and certainly presents itself for the first time under unfavorable circumstances religion i suppose is the scope of his book and that a writer on that subject should usher himself to the world in the very act of the grossest abuse of confidence by publishing private letters which passed between two friends with no views to their ever being made public is an instance of inconsistency as well as of infidelity of which i would rather be the victim than the author by your kind quotation of the dates of my two letters i have been enabled to turn to them they had completely vanished from my memory the last is on the subject of religion and by its publication will gratify the priesthood with new occasion of repeating their comminations against me they     wish it to be believed that he can have no religion who advocates its freedom this was not the doctrine of priestley and i honored him for the example of liberality he set to his order the first letter is political it recalls to our recollection the gloomy transactions of the times the doctrines they witnessed and the sensibilities they excited it was a confidential communication of reflections on these from one friend to another deposited in his bosom and never meant to trouble the public mind whether the character of the times is justly portrayed or not posterity will decide but on one feature of them they can never decide the sensations excited in free yet firm minds by the terrorism of the day none can conceive who did not witness them and they were felt by one party only this letter exhibits their side of the medal the federalists no doubt have presented the other in their private correspondences as well as open action if these correspondences should ever be laid open to the public eye they will probably be found not models of comity towards their adversaries the readers of my letter should be cautioned not to confine its view to this country alone england and its alarmists were equally under consideration still less must they consider it as looking personally towards you you happen indeed to be quoted because you happened to express more pithily than had been done by themselves one of the mottos of the party this was in your answer to the address of the young men of philadelphia see selection of patriotic addresses page     one of the questions you know on     which our parties took different sides was on the improvability of the human mind in science in ethics in government c those who advocated reformation of institutions pari passu with the progress of science maintained that no definite limits could be assigned to that progress the enemies of reform on the other hand denied improvement and advocated steady adherence to the principles practices and institutions of our fathers which they represented as the consummation of wisdom and acme of excellence beyond which the human mind could never advance although in the passage of your answer alluded to you expressly disclaim the wish to influence the freedom of inquiry you predict that that will produce nothing more worthy of transmission to posterity than the principles institutions and systems of education received from their ancestors i do not consider this as your deliberate opinion you possess yourself too much science not to see how much is still ahead of you unexplained and unexplored your own consciousness must place you as far before our ancestors as in the rear of our posterity i consider it as an expression lent to the prejudices of your friends and although i happened to cite it from you the whole letter shows i had them only in view in truth my dear sir we were far from considering you as the author of all the measures we blamed they were placed under the protection of your name but we were satisfied they wanted much of your approbation we ascribed them to their real authors the pickerings the wolcotts the tracys the sedgwicks et id genus omne     with whom we supposed you in a state of duresse i well remember a conversation with you in the morning of the day on which you nominated to the senate a substitute for pickering in which you expressed a just impatience under the legacy of secretaries which general washington had left you and whom you seemed therefore to consider as under public protection many other incidents showed how differently you would have acted with less impassioned advisers and subsequent events have proved that your minds were not together you would do me great injustice therefore by taking to yourself what was intended for men who were then your secret as they are now your open enemies should you write on the subject as you propose i am sure we shall see you place yourself farther from them than from us as to myself i shall take no part in any discussions i leave others to judge of what i have done and to give me exactly that place which they shall think i have occupied marshall has written libels on one side others i suppose will be written on the other side and the world will sift both and separate the truth as well as they can i should see with reluctance the passions of that day rekindled in this while so many of the actors are living and all are too near the scene not to participate in sympathies with them about facts you and i cannot differ because truth is our mutual guide and if any opinions you may express should be different from mine i shall receive them with the liberality and indulgence which i ask for my own and still     cherish with warmth the sentiments of affectionate respect of which i can with so much truth tender you the assurance thomas jefferson june         monticello john wayles eppes to john wayles eppes j mss monticello june         dear sir —this letter will be on politics only for although i do not often permit myself to think on that subject it sometimes obtrudes itself and suggests ideas which i am tempted to pursue some of these relating to the business of finance i will hazard to you as being at the head of that committee but intended for yourself individually or such as you trust but certainly not for a mixed committee it is a wise rule and should be fundamental in a government disposed to cherish its credit and at the same time to restrain the use of it within the limits of its faculties never to borrow a dollar without laying a tax in the same instant for paying the interest annually and the principal within a given term and to consider that tax as pledged to the creditors on the public faith on such a pledge as this sacredly observed a government may always command on a reasonable interest all the lendable money of their citizens while the necessity of an equivalent tax is a salutary warning to them and their constituents against oppressions bankruptcy and its inevitable consequence revolution but the term of redemption must be moderate and at any rate within the limits of their rightful powers but what limits it will be asked does this prescribe to     their powers what is to hinder them from creating a perpetual debt the laws of nature i answer the earth belongs to the living not to the dead the will and the power of man expire with his life by natures law some societies give it an artificial continuance for the encouragement of industry some refuse it as our aboriginal neighbors whom we call barbarians the generations of men may be considered as bodies or corporations each generation has the usufruct of the earth during the period of its continuance when it ceases to exist the usufruct passes on to the succeeding generation free and unincumbered and so on successively from one generation to another forever we may consider each generation as a distinct nation with a right by the will of its majority to bind themselves but none to bind the succeeding generation more than the inhabitants of another country or the case may be likened to the ordinary one of a tenant for life who may hypothecate the land for his debts during the continuance of his usufruct but at his death the reversioner who is also for life only receives it exonerated from all burthen the period of a generation or the term of its life is determined by the laws of mortality which varying a little only in different climates offer a general average to be found by observation i turn for instance to buffons tables of twentythree thousand nine hundred and ninetyfour deaths and the ages at which they happened and i find that of the numbers of all ages living at one moment half will be dead in twentyfour years and eight months but leaving out minors who     have not the power of selfgovernment of the adults of twentyone years of age living at one moment a majority of whom act for the society one half will be dead in eighteen years and eight months at nineteen years then from the date of a contract the majority of the contractors are dead and their contract with them let this general theory be applied to a particular case suppose the annual births of the state of new york to be twentythree thousand nine hundred and ninetyfour the whole number of its inhabitants according to buffon will be six hundred and seventeen thousand seven hundred and three of all ages of these there would constantly be two hundred and sixtynine thousand two hundred and eightysix minors and three hundred and fortyeight thousand four hundred and seventeen adults of which last one hundred and seventyfour thousand two hundred and nine will be a majority suppose that majority on the first day of the year      had borrowed a sum of money equal to the feesimple value of the state and to have consumed it in eating drinking and making merry in their day or if you please in quarrelling and fighting with their unoffending neighbors within eighteen years and eight months one half of the adult citizens were dead till then being the majority they might rightfully levy the interest of their debt annually on themselves and their fellowrevellers or fellowchampions but at that period say at this moment a new majority have come into place in their own right and not under the rights the conditions or laws of their predecessors are they bound to  00 acknowledge the debt to consider the preceding generation as having had a right to eat up the whole soil of their country in the course of a life to alienate it from them for it would be an alienation to the creditors and would they think themselves either legally or morally bound to give up their country and emigrate to another for subsistence every one will say no that the soil is the gift of god to the living as much as it had been to the deceased generation and that the laws of nature impose no obligation on them to pay this debt and although like some other natural rights this has not yet entered into any declaration of rights it is no less a law and ought to be acted on by honest governments it is at the same time a salutary curb on the spirit of war and indebtment which since the modern theory of the perpetuation of debt has drenched the earth with blood and crushed its inhabitants under burthens ever accumulating had this principle been declared in the british bill of rights england would have been placed under the happy disability of waging eternal war and of contracting her thousand millions of public debt in seeking then for an ultimate term for the redemption of our debts let us rally to this principle and provide for their payment within the term of nineteen years at the farthest our government has not as yet begun to act on the rule of loans and taxation going hand in hand had any loan taken place in my time i should have strongly urged a redeeming tax for the loan which has been made since the last session of congress we should now set the example of  0  appropriating some particular tax sufficient to pay the interest annually and the principal within a fixed term less than nineteen years and i hope yourself and your committee will render the immortal service of introducing this practice not that it is expected that congress should formally declare such a principle they wisely enough avoid deciding on abstract questions but they may be induced to keep themselves within its limits i am sorry to see our loans begin at so exorbitant an interest and yet even at that you will soon be at the bottom of the loanbag we are an agricultural nation such an one employs its sparings in the purchase or improvement of land or stocks the lendable money among them is chiefly that of orphans and wards in the hands of executors and guardians and that which the farmer lays by till he has enough for the purchase in view in such a nation there is one and one only resource for loans sufficient to carry them through the expense of a war and that will always be sufficient and in the power of an honest government punctual in the preservation of its faith the fund i mean is the mass of circulating coin every one knows that although not literally it is nearly true that every paper dollar emitted banishes a silver one from the circulation a nation therefore making its purchases and payments with bills fitted for circulation thrusts an equal sum of coin out of circulation this is equivalent to borrowing that sum and yet the vendor receiving payment in a medium as effectual as coin for his purchases or payments has no  0  claim to interest and so the nation may continue to issue its bills as far as its wants require and the limits of the circulation will admit those limits are understood to extend with us at present to two hundred millions of dollars a greater sum than would be necessary for any war but this the only resource which the government could command with certainty the states have unfortunately fooled away nay corruptly alienated to swindlers and shavers under the cover of private banks say too as an additional evil that the disposal funds of individuals to this great amount have thus been withdrawn from improvement and useful enterprise and employed in the useless usurious and demoralizing practices of bank directors and their accomplices in the war of      our state availed itself of this fund by issuing a paper money bottomed on a specific tax for its redemption and to insure its credit bearing an interest of five per cent within a very short time not a bill of this emission was to be found in circulation it was locked up in the chests of executors guardians widows farmers c we then issued bills bottomed on a redeeming tax but bearing no interest these were readily received and never depreciated a single farthing in the revolutionary war the old congress and the states issued bills without interest and without tax they occupied the channels of circulation very freely till those channels were overflowed by an excess beyond all the calls of circulation but although we have so improvidently suffered the field of circulating medium to be filched from us by private individuals  0  yet i think we may recover it in part and even in the whole if the states will cooperate with us if treasury bills are emitted on a tax appropriated for their redemption in fifteen years and to insure preference in the first moments of competition bearing an interest of six per cent there is no one who would not take them in preference to the bank paper now afloat on a principle of patriotism as well as interest and they would be withdrawn from circulation into private hoards to a considerable amount their credit once established others might be emitted bottomed also on a tax but not bearing interest and if ever their credit faltered open public loans on which these bills alone should be received as specie these operating as a sinking fund would reduce the quantity in circulation so as to maintain that in an equilibrium with specie it is not easy to estimate the obstacles which in the beginning we should encounter in ousting the banks from their possession of the circulation but a steady and judicious alternation of emissions and loans would reduce them in time but while this is going on another measure should be pressed to recover ultimately our right to the circulation the states should be applied to to transfer the right of issuing circulating paper to congress exclusively in perpetuum if possible but during the war at least with a saving of charter rights i believe that every state west and south of connecticut river except delaware would immediately do it and the others would follow in time congress would of course begin by obliging unchartered banks to wind up their affairs  0  within a short time and the others as their charters expired forbidding the subsequent circulation of their paper this they would supply with their own bottomed every emission on an adequate tax and bearing or not bearing interest as the state of the public pulse should indicate even in the noncomplying states these bills would make their way and supplant the unfunded paper of their banks by their solidity by the universality of their currency and by their receivability for customs and taxes it would be in their power too to curtail those banks to the amount of their actual specie by gathering up their paper and running it constantly on them the national paper might thus take place even in the noncomplying states in this way i am not without a hope that this great this sole resource for loans in an agricultural country might yet be recovered for the use of the nation during war and if obtained in perpetuum it would always be sufficient to carry us through any war provided that in the interval between war and war all the outstanding paper should be called in coin be permitted to flow in again and to hold the field of circulation until another war should require its yielding place again to the national medium but it will be asked are we to have no banks are merchants and others to be deprived of the resource of short accommodations found so convenient i answer let us have banks but let them be such as are alone to be found in any country on earth except great britain there is not a bank of discount on the continent of europe at least  0  there was not one when i was there which offers anything but cash in exchange for discounted bills no one has a natural right to the trade of a money lender but he who has the money to lend let those then among us who have a monied capital and who prefer employing it in loans rather than otherwise set up banks and give cash or national bills for the notes they discount perhaps to encourage them a larger interest than is legal in the other cases might be allowed them on the condition of their lending for short periods only it is from great britain we copy the idea of giving paper in exchange for discounted bills and while we have derived from that country some good principles of government and legislation we unfortunately run into the most servile imitation of all her practices ruinous as they prove to her and with the gulph yawning before us into which these very practices are precipitating her the unlimited emission of bank paper has banished all her specie and is now by a depreciation acknowledged by her own statesmen carrying her rapidly to bankruptcy as it did france as it did us and will do us again and every country permitting paper to be circulated other than that by public authority rigorously limited to the just measure for circulation private fortunes in the present state of our circulation are at the mercy of those selfcreated money lenders and are prostrated by the floods of nominal money with which their avarice deluges us he who lent his money to the public or to an individual before the institution of the united states bank twenty years ago when  0  wheat was well sold at a dollar the bushel and receives now his nominal sum when it sells at two dollars is cheated of half his fortune and by whom by the banks which since that have thrown into circulation ten dollars of their nominal money where was one at that time reflect if you please on these ideas and use them or not as they appear to merit they comfort me in the belief that they point out a resource ample enough without overwhelming war taxes for the expense of the war and possibly still recoverable and that they hold up to all future time a resource within ourselves ever at the command of government and competent to any wars into which we may be forced nor is it a slight object to equalize taxes through peace and war  ever affectionately yours  0  thomas jefferson august         monticello john wilson to john wilson j mss monticello august         sir —your letter of the  d has been duly received that of mr eppes had before come to hand covering your ms on the reformation of the orthography  0  of the plural of nouns ending in y and ey and on orthoepy a change has been long desired in english orthography such as might render it an easy and true index of the pronunciation of words the  0  want of conformity between the combinations of letters and the sounds they should represent increases to foreigners the difficulty of acquiring the language occasions great loss of time to children in learning   0 to read and renders correct spelling rare but in those who read much in england a variety of plans and propositions have been made for the reformation of their orthography passing over these two of our     countrymen dr franklin and dr thornton have also engaged in the enterprise the former proposing an addition of two or three new characters only the latter a reformation of the whole alphabet nearly     but these attempts in england as well as here have been without effect about the middle of the last century an attempt was made to banish the letter d from the words bridge judge hedge knowledge c     others of that termination and to write them as we write age cage sacrilege privilege but with little success the attempt was also made which you mention in your second part to drop the letter u in     words of latin derivation ending in our and to write honor candor rigor c instead of honour candour rigour but the u having been picked up in the passage of these words from the latin through the     french to us is still preserved by those who consider it as a memorial of our title to the words other partial attempts have been made by individual writers but with as little success pluralizing     nouns in y and ey by adding s only as you propose would certainly simplify the spelling and be analogous to the general idiom of the language it would be a step gained in the progress of general     reformation if it could prevail but my opinion being requested i must give it candidly that judging of the future by the past i expect no better fortune to this than similar preceding propositions have     experienced it is very difficult to persuade the great body of mankind to give up what they have once learned and are now masters of for something to be learnt anew time alone insensibly wears down old     habits and produces small changes at long intervals and to this process we must all accommodate ourselves and be content to follow those who will not follow us our anglosaxon ancestors had twenty ways   0 of spelling the word many ten centuries have dropped all of them and substituted that which we now use i now return your ms without being able with the gentlemen whose letters are cited to     encourage hope as to its effect i am bound however to acknowledge that this is a subject to which i have not paid much attention and that my doubts therefore should weigh nothing against their more favorable expectations that these may be fulfilled     and mine prove unfounded i sincerely wish because i am a friend to the reformation generally of whatever can be made better and because it could not fail of gratifying you to be instrumental in this work accept the assurance of my respect     thomas jefferson august         monticello john adams to john adams j mss monticello august         dear sir —since my letter of june the   th i am in your debt for many all of which i have read     with infinite delight they open a wide field for reflection and offer subjects enough to occupy the mind and the pen indefinitely i must follow the good example you have set and when i have not     time to take up every subject take up a single one your approbation of my outline to dr priestley is a great gratification to me and i very much suspect that if thinking men would have the courage     to think for themselves and to speak what they think it would be found they do not differ in religious opinions as much as is supposed i remember to have heard dr priestley say that if all england     would candidly examine themselves and confess they would find that unitarianism was really the religion of all and i observe a bill is now depending in parliament for the relief of antitrinitarians     it is too late in the day for men of sincerity to pretend they believe in the platonic mysticisms that three are one and one is three and yet that the one is not three and the three are not one to     divide mankind by a single letter into ομοeditor illegible greek wordσιανς and ὁμοιeditor illegible greek wordσιανς but this constitutes the craft the power and the profit of the priests sweep away their gossamer fabrics of factitious religion and they   0 would catch no more flies we should all then like the quakers live without an order of priests moralize for ourselves follow the oracle of conscience and say nothing about what no man can understand nor     therefore believe for i suppose belief to be the assent of the mind to an intelligible proposition it is with great pleasure i can inform you that priestley finished the comparative view of the     doctrines of the philosophers of antiquity and of jesus before his death and that it was printed soon after and with still greater pleasure that i can have a copy of his work forwarded from philadelphia by a correspondent there and presented for your acceptance by the same mail which carries you this or very soon after the branch of the work which the title announces is executed with learning and candor as was everything priestley wrote but perhaps a little hastily for he felt himself pressed by the hand of death the abbé batteux had in fact laid the foundation of this part in his causes premieres with which he has given us the originals of ocellus and timæus who first committed the doctrines of pythagoras to writing and enfield to whom the doctor refers had done it more copiously but he has omitted the important branch which in your letter of august the  th you say you have never seen executed a comparison of the morality of the old testament with that of the new and yet no two things were ever more unlike i ought not to have asked him to give it he dared not he would have been eaten alive by his intolerant     brethren the cannibal priests and yet this was really the most interesting branch of the work very soon after my letter to doctor priestley the subject being still in my mind i had leisure during an abstraction from business for a day or two while on the road to think a little more on it and to sketch more fully than i had done to him a syllabus of the matter which i thought should enter into the work i wrote it to doctor rush and there ended all my labor on the subject himself and doctor priestley being the only two depositories of my secret the fate of my letter to priestley after his death was a warning to me on that of doctor rush and at my request his family were so kind as to quiet me by returning my original letter and syllabus by this you will be sensible how much interest i take in keeping myself clear of religious disputes before the public and especially of seeing my syllabus disembowelled by the aruspices of the modern paganism yet i enclose it to you with entire confidence free to be perused by yourself and mrs adams but by no one else and to be returned to me you are right in supposing in one of yours that i had not read much of priestleys predestination his nosoul system or his controversy with horsley but i have read his corruptions of christianity and early opinions of jesus over and over again and i rest on them and on middletons writings especially his letters from rome and to waterland as the basis of my own faith these writings have never been answered nor can be answered by quoting     historical proofs as they have done for these facts therefore i cling to their learning so much superior to my own i now fly off in a tangent to another subject marshall in the first volume of his history chapter   p   0 ascribes the petition to the king of        journ cong    to the pen of richard henry lee i think myself certain it was not written by him as well from what i recollect to have heard as from the internal evidence of style his was loose vague frothy rhetorical he was a poorer writer than his brother arthur and arthurs standing may be seen in his monitors letters to insure the sale of which they took the precaution of tacking to them a new edition of the farmers letters like mezentius who mortua jungebat corpora vivis you were of the committee and can tell me who wrote this petition and who wrote the address to the inhabitants of the colonies ib    of the papers of july      i recollect well that mr dickinson drew the petition to the king ib     i think robert r livingston drew the address to the inhabitants of great britain ib     am i right in this and who drew the address to the people of ireland ib   0 on these questions i ask of your memory to help mine ever and affectionately yours thomas jefferson sep       monticello josiah meigs to josiah meigs j mss monticello sep       dear sir —i thank you for the information contained in your letter of aug    i confess that when     i heard of the atrocities committed by the english troops at hampton i did not believe them but subsequent evidence has placed them beyond doubt to this has been added information from another quarter which proves the violation of women to be their habitual practice in war mr hamilton a son of alexander hamilton of course a federalist and angloman and who was with the british army in spain declares it is their constant practice and that at the taking badajoz he was himself eyewitness to it in the streets  that the officers did not attempt to restrain it the information contained in your letter proves it is not merely a recent practice this is a trait of barbarism in addition to their encouragement of the savage cruelties  their brutal treatment of prisoners of war which i had not attached to their character i am happy to hear that yourself  family enjoy good health  tender you the assurance of my great esteem  respect thomas jefferson september  0      monticello james martin to james martin j mss monticello september  0      sir —your letter of august  0th enabled me to turn to mine of february   d      and your former one of february   d  0  and to recall to my memory the oration at jamaica which was the subject of them i see with pleasure a continuance of the same sound principles in the address to mr quincy your quotation from the former paper alludes as i presume to the term of office to our senate a term     like that of the judges too long for my approbation i am for responsibilities at short periods seeing neither reason nor safety in making public functionaries independent of the nation for life or even for long terms of years on this principle i prefer the presidential term of four years to that of seven years which i myself had at first suggested annexing to it however ineligibility forever after and i wish it were now annexed to the  d quadrennial election of president the conduct of massachusetts which is the subject of your address to mr quincy is serious as embarassing the operations of the war and jeopardizing its issue and still more so as an example of contumacy against the constitution one method of proving their purpose would be to call a convention of their state and to require them to declare themselves members of the union and obedient to its determinations or not members and let them go put this question solemnly to their people and their answer cannot be doubtful one half of them are republicans and would cling to the union from principle of the other half the dispassionate part would consider  st that they do not raise bread sufficient for their own subsistence and must look to europe for the deficiency if excluded from our ports which vital interests would force us to do  d that they are navigating people without a stick of timber for the hull of a ship nor a pound of anything to export in it which would be admitted at any market  d that they are also a manufacturing people and left by the exclusive system of     europe without a market but ours  th that as the rivals of england in manufactures in commerce in navigation and fisheries they would meet her competition in every point  th that england would feel no scruples in making the abandonment and ruin of such a rival the price of a treaty with the producing states whose interest too it would be to nourish a navigation beyond the atlantic rather than a hostile one at our own door and  th that in case of war with the union which occurrences between coterminous nations frequently produce it would be a contest of one against fifteen the remaining portion of the federal moiety of the state would i believe brave all these obstacles because they are monarchists in principle bearing deadly hatred to their republican fellowcitizens impatient under the ascendency of republican principles devoted in their attachment to england and preferring to be placed under her despotism if they cannot hold the helm of government here i see in their separation no evil but the example and i believe that the effect of that would be corrected by an early and humiliating return to the union after losing much of the population of their country insufficient in its own resources to feed her numerous inhabitants and inferior in all its allurements to the more inviting soils climates and governments of the other states whether a dispassionate discussion before the public of the advantages and disadvantages of separation to both parties would be the best medicine for this dialytic fever or to consider it as sacrilege ever to touch the question may be doubted i am     myself generally disposed to indulge and to follow reason and believe that in no case would it be safer than in the present their refractory course however will not be unpunished by the indignation of their costates their loss of influence with them the censures of history and the stain on the character of their state with my thanks for the paper enclosed accept the assurance of my esteem and respect thomas jefferson october        monticello doctor george logan to doctor george logan j mss monticello october        dear sir —i have duly received your favor of september   th and i perceive in it the same spirit of peace which i know you have ever breathed and to preserve which you have made many personal sacrifices that your efforts did much towards preventing declared war with france i am satisfied of those with england i am not equally informed i have ever cherished the same spirit with all nations from a consciousness that peace prosperity liberty and morals have an intimate connection during the eight years of my administration there was not a year that england did not give us such cause as would have provoked a war from any european government but i always hoped that time and friendly remonstrances would bring her to a sounder view of her own interests and convince her that these would be promoted by a return to justice and friendship towards us continued impressments of our seamen by her naval commanders whose     interest it was to mistake them for theirs her innovations on the law of nations to cover real piracies could illy be borne and perhaps would not have been borne had not contraventions of the same law by france fewer in number but equally illegal rendered it difficult to single the object of war england at length singled herself and took up the gauntlet when the unlawful decrees of france being revoked as to us she by the proclamation of her prince regent protested to the world that she would never revoke hers until those of france should be removed as to all nations her minister too about the same time in an official conversation with our chargé rejected our substitute for her practice of impressment proposed no other and declared explicitly that no admissible one for this abuse could be proposed negotiation being thus cut short no alternative remained but war or the abandonment of the persons and property of our citizens on the ocean the last one i presume no american would have preferred war was therefore declared and justly declared but accompanied with immediate offers of peace on simply doing us justice these offers were made through russel through admiral warren through the government of canada and the mediation proposed by her best friend alexander and the greatest enemy of bonaparte was accepted without hesitation an entire confidence in the abilities and integrity of those now administering the government has kept me from the inclination as well as the occasion of intermeddling in the public affairs even as a private citizen may   0 justifiably do yet if you can suggest any conditions which we ought to accept and which have not been repeatedly offered and rejected i would not hesitate to become the channel of their communication to the administration the revocation of the orders of council and discontinuance of impressment appear to me indispensable and i think a thousand ships taken unjustifiably in time of peace and thousands of our citizens impressed warrant expectations of indemnification such a western frontier perhaps given to canada as may put it out of their power hereafter to employ the tomahawk and scalpingknife of the indians on our women and children or what would be nearly equivalent the exclusive right to the lakes the modification however of this indemnification must be effected by the events of the war no man on earth has stronger detestation than myself of the unprincipled tyrant who is deluging the continent of europe with blood no one was more gratified by his disasters of the last campaign nor wished more sincerely success to the efforts of the virtuous alexander but the desire of seeing england forced to just terms of peace with us makes me equally solicitous for her entire exclusion from intercourse with the rest of the world until by this peaceable engine of constraint she can be made to renounce her views of dominion over the ocean of permitting no other nation to navigate it but with her license and on tribute to her and her aggressions on the persons of our citizens who may choose to exercise their right of passing over that element should the continental armistice issue in closing     europe against her she may become willing to accede to just terms with us which i should certainly be disposed to meet whatever consequences it might produce on our intercourse with the continental nations my principle is to do whatever is right and leave consequences to him who has the disposal of them i repeat therefore that if you can suggest what may lead to a just peace i will willingly communicate it to the proper functionaries in the meantime its object will be best promoted by a vigorous and unanimous prosecution of the war i am happy in this occasion of renewing the interchange of sentiments between us which has formerly been a source of much satisfaction to me and with the homage of my affectionate attachment and respect to mrs logan i pray you to accept the assurance of my continued friendship and esteem for yourself thomas jefferson october         monticello john adams to john adams j mss monticello october         dear sir —according to the reservation between us of taking up one of the subjects of our correspondence at a time i turn to your letters of august the   th and september the  d the passage you quote from theognis i think has an ethical rather than a political object the whole piece is a moral exhortation παραινεσις and this passage particularly seems to be a reproof to man who while with his domestic animals he is curious to improve the race by employing always the finest     male pays no attention to the improvement of his own race but intermarries with the vicious the ugly or the old for considerations of wealth or ambition it is in conformity with the principle adopted afterwards by the pythagoreans and expressed by ocellus in another form περι δε τῆς ἐϰ τῶν αλληλων ανθρωπων γενεσεως c—ουχ ηδονης ενεϰα η μιξις which as literally as intelligibility will admit may be thus translated concerning the interprocreation of men how and of whom it shall be in a perfect manner and according to the laws of modesty and sanctity conjointly this is what i think right first to lay it down that we do not commix for the sake of pleasure but of the procreation of children for the powers the organs and desires for coition have not been given by god to man for the sake of pleasure but for the procreation of the race for as it were incongruous for a mortal born to partake of divine life the immortality of the race being taken away god fulfilled the purpose by making the generations uninterrupted and continuous this therefore we are especially to lay down as a principle that coition is not for the sake of pleasure but nature not trusting to this moral and abstract motive seems to have provided more securely for the perpetuation of the species by making it the effect of the oestrum implanted in the constitution of both sexes and not only has the commerce of love been indulged on this unhallowed impulse but made subservient also to wealth and ambition by marriage without regard to the beauty the healthiness the understanding or virtue of the subject from which we are to breed the     selecting the best male for a harem of well chosen females also which theognis seems to recommend from the example of our sheep and asses would doubtless improve the human as it does the brute animal and produce a race of veritable αριστοι for experience proves that the moral and physical qualities of man whether good or evil are transmissible in a certain degree from father to son but i suspect that the equal rights of men will rise up against this privileged solomon and his harem and oblige us to continue acquiescence under the αμαυρωσις γενεος αστων which theognis complains of and to content ourselves with the accidental aristoi produced by the fortuitous concourse of breeders for i agree with you that there is a natural aristocracy among men the grounds of this are virtue and talents formerly bodily powers gave place among the aristoi but since the invention of gunpowder has armed the weak as well as the strong with missile death bodily strength like beauty good humor politeness and other accomplishments has become but an auxiliary ground for distinction there is also an artificial aristocracy founded on wealth and birth without either virtue or talents for with these it would belong to the first class the natural aristocracy i consider as the most precious gift of nature for the instruction the trusts and government of society and indeed it would have been inconsistent in creation to have formed man for the social state and not to have provided virtue and wisdom enough to manage the concerns of the society may we not even say that that form of     government is the best which provides the most effectually for a pure selection of these natural aristoi into the offices of government the artificial aristocracy is a mischievous ingredient in government and provision should be made to prevent its ascendency on the question what is the best provision you and i differ but we differ as rational friends using the free exercise of our own reason and mutually indulging its errors you think it best to put the pseudoaristoi into a separate chamber of legislation where they may be hindered from doing mischief by their coordinate branches and where also they may be a protection to wealth against the agrarian and plundering enterprises of the majority of the people i think that to give them power in order to prevent them from doing mischief is arming them for it and increasing instead of remedying the evil for if the coordinate branches can arrest their action so may they that of the coordinates mischief may be done negatively as well as positively of this a cabal in the senate of the united states has furnished many proofs nor do i believe them necessary to protect the wealthy because enough of these will find their way into every branch of the legislation to protect themselves from fifteen to twenty legislatures of our own in action for thirty years past have proved that no fears of an equalization of property are to be apprehended from them i think the best remedy is exactly that provided by all our constitutions to leave to the citizens the free election and separation of the aristoi from the pseudoaristoi of the wheat from the chaff in general they     will elect the really good and wise in some instances wealth may corrupt and birth blind them but not in sufficient degree to endanger the society it is probable that our difference of opinion may in some measure be produced by a difference of character in those among whom we live from what i have seen of massachusetts and connecticut myself and still more from what i have heard and the character given of the former by yourself who know them so much better there seems to be in those two states a traditionary reverence for certain families which has rendered the offices of the government nearly hereditary in those families i presume that from an early period of your history members of those families happening to possess virtue and talents have honestly exercised them for the good of the people and by their services have endeared their names to them in coupling connecticut with you i mean it politically only not morally for having made the bible the common law of their land they seemed to have modeled their morality on the story of jacob and laban but although this hereditary succession to office with you may in some degree be founded in real family merit yet in a much higher degree it has proceeded from your strict alliance of church and state these families are canonised in the eyes of the people on common principles you tickle me and i will tickle you in virginia we have nothing of this our clergy before the revolution having been secured against rivalship by fixed salaries did not give themselves the trouble of acquiring influence over the people of wealth there     were great accumulations in particular families handed down from generation to generation under the english law of entails but the only object of ambition for the wealthy was a seat in the kings council all their court then was paid to the crown and its creatures and they philipised in all collisions between the king and the people hence they were unpopular and that unpopularity continues attached to their names a randolph a carter or a burwell must have great personal superiority over a common competitor to be elected by the people even at this day at the first session of our legislature after the declaration of independence we passed a law abolishing entails and this was followed by one abolishing the privilege of primogeniture and dividing the lands of intestates equally among all their children or other representatives these laws drawn by myself laid the ax to the foot of pseudoaristocracy and had another which i prepared been adopted by the legislature our work would have been complete it was a bill for the more general diffusion of learning this proposed to divide every county into wards of five or six miles square like your townships to establish in each ward a free school for reading writing and common arithmetic to provide for the annual selection of the best subjects from these schools who might receive at the public expense a higher degree of education at a district school and from these district schools to select a certain number of the most promising subjects to be completed at an university where all the useful sciences should be taught worth and     genius would thus have been sought out from every condition of life and completely prepared by education for defeating the competition of wealth and birth for public trusts my proposition had for a further object to impart to these wards those portions of selfgovernment for which they are best qualified by confiding to them the care of their poor their roads police elections the nomination of jurors administration of justice in small cases elementary exercises of militia in short to have made them little republics with a warden at the head of each for all those concerns which being under their eye they would better manage than the larger republics of the county or state a general call of ward meetings by their wardens on the same day through the state would at any time produce the genuine sense of the people on any required point and would enable the state to act in mass as your people have so often done and with so much effect by their town meetings the law for religious freedom which made a part of this system having put down the aristocracy of the clergy and restored to the citizen the freedom of the mind and those of entails and descents nurturing an equality of condition among them this on education would have raised the mass of the people to the high ground of moral respectability necessary to their own safety and to orderly government and would have completed the great object of qualifying them to select the veritable aristoi for the trusts of government to the exclusion of the pseudalists and the same theognis who has furnished the epigraphs of your two     letters assures us that ουδεμιαν πω κυρν αγαθοι πολιν ωλεσαν ανδρες although this law has not yet been acted on but in a small and inefficient degree it is still considered as before the legislature with other bills of the revised code not yet taken up and i have great hope that some patriotic spirit will at a favorable moment call it up and make it the keystone of the arch of our government with respect to aristocracy we should further consider that before the establishment of the american states nothing was known to history but the man of the old world crowded within limits either small or overcharged and steeped in the vices which that situation generates a government adapted to such men would be one thing but a very different one that for the man of these states here every one may have land to labor for himself if he chooses or preferring the exercise of any other industry may exact for it such compensation as not only to afford a comfortable subsistence but wherewith to provide for a cessation from labor in old age every one by his property or by his satisfactory situation is interested in the support of law and order and such men may safely and advantageously reserve to themselves a wholesome control over their public affairs and a degree of freedom which in the hands of the canaille of the cities of europe would be instantly perverted to the demolition and destruction of everything public and private the history of the last twentyfive years of france and of the last forty years in america nay of its last two hundred years proves the truth of both parts of this observation     but even in europe a change has sensibly taken place in the mind of man science had liberated the ideas of those who read and reflect and the american example had kindled feelings of right in the people an insurrection has consequently begun of science talents and courage against rank and birth which have fallen into contempt it has failed in its first effort because the mobs of the cities the instrument used for its accomplishment debased by ignorance poverty and vice could not be restrained to rational action but the world will recover from the panic of this first catastrophe science is progressive and talents and enterprise on the alert resort may be had to the people of the country a more governable power from their principles and subordination and rank and birth and tinselaristocracy will finally shrink into insignificance even there this however we have no right to meddle with it suffices for us if the moral and physical condition of our own citizens qualifies them to select the able and good for the direction of their government with a recurrence of elections at such short periods as will enable them to displace an unfaithful servant before the mischief he meditates may be irremediable i have thus stated my opinion on a point on which we differ not with a view to controversy for we are both too old to change opinions which are the result of a long life of inquiry and reflection but on the suggestions of a former letter of yours that we ought not to die before we have explained ourselves to each other we acted in perfect harmony   0 through a long and perilous contest for our liberty and independence a constitution has been acquired which though neither of us thinks perfect yet both consider as competent to render our fellow citizens the happiest and the securest on whom the sun has ever shone if we do not think exactly alike as to its imperfections it matters little to our country which after devoting to it long lives of disinterested labor we have delivered over to our successors in life who will be able to take care of it and of themselves of the pamphlet on aristocracy which has been sent to you or who may be its author i have heard nothing but through your letter if the person you suspect it may be known from the quaint mystical and hyperbolical ideas involved in affected newfangled and pedantic terms which stamp his writings whatever it be i hope your quiet is not to be affected at this day by the rudeness or intemperance of scribblers but that you may continue in tranquillity to live and to rejoice in the prosperity of our country until it shall be your own wish to take your seat among the aristoi who have gone before you ever and affectionately yours thomas jefferson december        baron von humboldt to baron von humboldt j mss december        my dear friend and baron —i have to acknowledge your two letters of december  0 and         by mr correa and am first to thank you for     making me acquainted with that most excellent character he was so kind as to visit me at monticello and i found him one of the most learned and amiable of men it was a subject of deep regret to separate from so much worth in the moment of its becoming known to us the livraison of your astronomical observations and the  th and  th on the subject of new spain with the corresponding atlasses are duly received as had been the preceding cahiers for these treasures of a learning so interesting to us accept my sincere thanks i think it most fortunate that your travels in those countries were so timed as to make them known to the world in the moment they were about to become actors on its stage that they will throw off their european dependence i have no doubt but in what kind of government their revolution will end i am not so certain history i believe furnishes no example of a priestridden people maintaining a free civil government this marks the lowest grade of ignorance of which their civil as well as religious leaders will always avail themselves for their own purposes the vicinity of new spain to the united states and their consequent intercourse may furnish schools for the higher and example for the lower classes of their citizens and mexico where we learn from you that men of science are not wanting may revolutionize itself under better auspices than the southern provinces these last i fear must end in military despotisms the different casts of their inhabitants their mutual hatreds and jealousies their profound ignorance and bigotry will be     played off by cunning leaders and each be made the instrument of enslaving others but of all this you can best judge for in truth we have little knowledge of them to be depended on but through you but in whatever governments they end they will be american governments no longer to be involved in the neverceasing broils of europe the european nations constitute a separate division of the globe their localities make them part of a distinct system they have a set of interests of their own in which it is our business never to engage ourselves america has a hemisphere to itself it must have its separate system of interests which must not be subordinated to those of europe the insulated state in which nature has placed the american continent should so far avail it that no spark of war kindled in the other quarters of the globe should be wafted across the wide oceans which separate us from them and it will be so in fifty years more the united states alone will contain fifty millions of inhabitants and fifty years are soon gone over the peace of      is within that period i was then twenty years old and of course remember well all the transactions of the war preceding it and you will live to see the epoch now equally ahead of us and the numbers which will then be spread over the other parts of the american hemisphere catching long before that the principles of our portion of it and concurring with us in the maintenance of the same system you see how readily we run into ages beyond the grave and even those of us to whom that grave is already opening its quiet bosom i am anticipating events of     which you will be the bearer to me in the elysian fields fifty years hence you know my friend the benevolent plan we were pursuing here for the happiness of the aboriginal inhabitants in our vicinities we spared nothing to keep them at peace with one another to teach them agriculture and the rudiments of the most necessary arts and to encourage industry by establishing among them separate property in this way they would have been enabled to subsist and multiply on a moderate scale of landed possession they would have mixed their blood with ours and been amalgamated and identified with us within no distant period of time on the commencement of our present war we pressed on them the observance of peace and neutrality but the interested and unprincipled policy of england has defeated all our labors for the salvation of these unfortunate people they have seduced the greater part of the tribes within our neighborhood to take up the hatchet against us and the cruel massacres they have committed on the women and children of our frontiers taken by surprise will oblige us now to pursue them to extermination or drive them to new seats beyond our reach already we have driven their patrons and seducers into montreal and the opening season will force them to their last refuge the walls of quebec we have cut off all possibility of intercourse and of mutual aid and may pursue at our leisure whatever plan we find necessary to secure ourselves against the future effects of their savage and ruthless warfare the confirmed brutalization if not the     extermination of this race in our america is therefore to form an additional chapter in the english history of the same colored man in asia and of the brethren of their own color in ireland and wherever else anglomercantile cupidity can find a twopenny interest in deluging the earth with human blood but let us turn from the loathsome contemplation of the degrading effects of commercial avarice that their arrowsmith should have stolen your map of mexico was in the piratical spirit of his country but i should be sincerely sorry if our pike has made an ungenerous use of your candid communications here and the more so as he died in the arms of victory gained over the enemies of his country whatever he did was on a principle of enlarging knowledge and not for filthy shillings and pence of which he made none from that work if what he has borrowed has any effect it will be to excite an appeal in his readers from his defective information to the copious volumes of it with which you have enriched the world i am sorry he omitted even to acknowledge the source of his information it has been an oversight and not at all in the spirit of his generous nature let me solicit your forgiveness then of a deceased hero of an honest and zealous patriot who lived and died for his country you will find it inconceivable that lewiss journey to the pacific should not yet have appeared nor is it in my power to tell you the reason the measures taken by his surviving companion clarke for the publication have not answered our wishes in point of despatch i think however from what i have     heard that the mere journal will be out within a few weeks in two volumes  vo these i will take care to send you with the tobacco seed you desired if it be possible for them to escape the thousand ships of our enemies spread over the ocean the botanical and zoological discoveries of lewis will probably experience greater delay and become known to the world through other channels before that volume will be ready the atlas i believe waits on the leisure of the engraver although i do not know whether you are now at paris or ranging the regions of asia to acquire more knowledge for the use of men i cannot deny myself the gratification of an endeavor to recall myself to your recollection and of assuring you of my constant attachment and of renewing to you the just tribute of my affectionate esteem and high respect and consideration thomas jefferson nov      monticello thomas law to thomas law j mss monticello nov      dear sir —your favor of oct   came duly to hand and in it the memorial which i now return i like well your idea of issuing treasury notes bearing interest because i am persuaded they would soon be withdrawn from circulation and locked up in vaults  private hoards it would put it in the power of every man to lend his  00 or  000 d tho not able to go forward on the great scale and be the most advantageous way of obtaining a loan the other idea of creating a national bank i do not concur in     because it seems now decided that congress has not that power altho i sincerely wish they had it exclusively and because i think there is already a vast redundancy rather than a scarcity of paper medium the rapid rise in the nominal price of land and labor while war  blockade should produce a fall proves the progressive state of the depreciation of our medium ever with great esteem and respect thomas jefferson nov  0    marquis de lafayette to the marquis de lafayette j mss nov  0    my dear friend —the last letters i received from you are of apr    may  0 july   of the preceding year they gave me information of your health always welcome to the feelings of antient and constant friendship i hope this continues  will continue until you tire of that and life together the shepard dogs mentioned in yours of may  0 arrived safely have been carefully multiplied and are spreading in this and the neighboring states where the increase of our sheep is greatly attended to of these we have already enough to clothe all our inhabitants and the merino race is wonderfully extended  improved in size our manufactures of fine cloths are equal to the best english and those of cotton by their abundance and superior quality will compleatly exclude the english from the market our progress in manufactures is far beyond the calculations of the most sanguine every private house is getting spinning machines i have four in     operation in my own family for our own use and carding machines are growing up in every neighborhood insomuch that were peace restored tomorrow we should not return to the importation from england of either coarse or midling fabrics of any material nor even of the finer woolen cloths putting honor  right out of the question therefore this revolution in our domestic economy was well worth a war you have heard how inauspiciously our war began by land the treachery of hull who furnished with an army which might have taken upper canada with little resistance sold it to an enemy of one fourth his strength was the cause of all our subsequent misfortunes a second army was by surprise submitted to massacre by the indians under the eye and countenance of british officers to whom they had surrendered on capitulation other losses followed these from cowardice from foolhardiness and from sheer imbecillity in the commanders in every instance the men militia as well as regulars displayed an intrepidity which shewed it only wanted capable direction these misfortunes however instead of disheartening only sunk deeper into our hearts the necessity of exertion as in old times was the effect of the retreat across the delaware this has happily been crowned with success everything above the eastern end of l ontario is already in our possession and i might venture to say to the walls of quebec because on the  0th inst genl wilkinson was entering the lake st francis on his passage down to montreal where he would land within   or   days and     not meet a resistance which gives us any apprehensions between that place and quebec there is neither post nor armed man kingston was wisely left to fall of itself the st laurence to the walls of quebec being ours whenever the season will open it to us this last place will never be worth the blood it would cost cut off from subsistence by the loss of the upper country it must be evacuated by its inhabitants our quarters for this winter will probably be in montreal of the glories of our little navy you will of course have heard those on the ocean are no otherwise of value than as they have proved the british can be beaten there by an equal force they correct the idea of their invincibility and by this moral effect destroy one half their physical force on that element but perrys victory on l erie had the most important effects and is truly the parent of all the subsequent successes nor do i know that the naval history of the world furnishes an example of a more splendid action i join you sincerely my friend in wishes for the emancipation of south america that they will be liberated from foreign subjection i have little doubt but the result of my enquiries does not authorize me to hope they are capable of maintaining a free government their people are immersed in the darkest ignorance and brutalised by bigotry  superstition their priests make of them what they please and tho they may have some capable leaders yet nothing but intelligence in the people themselves can keep these faithful to their charge their efforts i fear     therefore will end in establishing military despotisms in the several provinces among these there can be no confederacy a republic of kings is impossible but their future wars and quarrels among themselves will oblige them to bring the people into action  into the exertion of their understandings light will at length beam in on their minds and the standing example we shall hold up serving as an excitement as well as a model for their direction may in the long run qualify them for self government this is the most i am able to hope for them for i lay it down as one of the impossibilities of nature that ignorance should maintain itself free against cunning where any government has been once admitted i thank you for making mr correa known to me i found him deserving every thing which his and my friends had said of him and only lamented that our possession of him was to be so short lived i will certainly send you another copy of the book you desire if it can possibly escape the perils of the sea i say nothing about your affairs here because being in the best hands i can say nothing important i am happy you have been able to turn the just retribution of our country to some account in easing your mind from some of its concerns on our part it was a just attention to sacrifices you had made to make us what we are i only lament it was not what it should have been i write to mde de tessé m de tracy c and conclude with the assurance of my affectionate and unalterable friendship and respect   0 ps monticello dec    i have kept my letter open that i might state with certainty the issue of the expedition against montreal our just expectations have been disappointed by another failure of a general commanding a large portion of the army ashore and refusing to meet the main body according to orders at the entrance of l st francis the expedition was of necessity abandoned at that point at which it was known to have arrived at the date of my letter and the commencement of severe weather forced the army into winter quarters near that place in the presidents message at the meeting of congress you will see a succinct  correct history of the transactions of the year thomas jefferson december        madam de tessé to madam de tessé j mss december        while at war my dear madam and friend with the leviathan of the ocean there is little hope of a letter escaping his thousand ships yet i cannot permit myself longer to withhold the acknowledgment of your letter of june    of the last year with which came the memoirs of the margrave of bareuth i am much indebted to you for this singular morsel of history which has given us a certain view of kings queens and princes disrobed of their formalities it is a peep into the state of the egyptian god apis it would not be easy to find grosser manners coarser vices or more meanness in the poorest huts of our peasantry the princess shows herself the legitimate sister of frederic cynical selfish and without a     heart notwithstanding your wars with england i presume you get the publications of that country the memoirs of mrs clarke and of her darling prince and the book emphatically so called because it is the biblia sacra deorum et dearum subcœlestium the prince regent his princess and the minor deities of his sphere form a worthy sequel to the memoirs of bareuth instead of the vulgarity and penury of the court of berlin giving us the vulgarity and profusion of that of london and the gross stupidity and profligacy of the latter in lieu of the genius and misanthropism of the former the whole might be published as a supplement to m de buffon under the title of the natural history of kings and princes or as a separate work and called medicine for monarchists the intercepted letters a later english publication of great wit and humor has put them to their proper use by holding them up as butts for the ridicule and contempt of mankind yet by such worthless beings is a great nation to be governed and even made to deify their old king because he is only a fool and a maniac and to forgive and forget his having lost to them a great and flourishing empire added nine hundred millions sterling to their debt for which the fee simple of the whole island would not sell if offered farm by farm at public auction and increased their annual taxes from eight to seventy millions sterling more than the whole rentroll of the island what must be the dreary prospect from the son when such a father is deplored as a national loss but let us drop these odious beings and pass to those of an higher order     the plants of the field i am afraid i have given you a great deal more trouble than i intended by my inquiries for the maronnier or castanea saliva of which i wished to possess my own country without knowing how rare its culture was even in yours the two plants which your researches have placed in your own garden it will be all but impossible to remove hither the war renders their safe passage across the atlantic extremely precarious and if landed anywhere but in the chesapeake the risk of the additional voyage along the coast to virginia is still greater under these circumstances it is better they should retain their present station and compensate to you the trouble they have cost you i learn with great pleasure the success of your new gardens at auenay no occupation can be more delightful or useful they will have the merit of inducing you to forget those of chaville with the botanical riches which you mention to have been derived to england from new holland we are as yet unacquainted lewiss journey across our continent to the pacific has added a number of new plants to our former stock some of them are curious some ornamental some useful and some may by culture be made acceptable to our tables i have growing which i destine for you a very handsome little shrub of the size of a currant bush its beauty consists in a great produce of berries of the size of currants and literally as white as snow which remain on the bush through the winter after its leaves have fallen and make it an object as singular as it is beautiful we call it the snowberry bush no     botanical name being yet given to it but i do not know why we might not call it chionicoccos or kallicoccos all lewiss plants are growing in the garden of mr mcmahon a gardener of philadelphia to whom i consigned them and from whom i shall have great pleasure when peace is restored in ordering for you any of these or of our other indigenous plants the port of philadelphia has great intercourse with bordeaux and nantes and some little perhaps with havre i was mortified not long since by receiving a letter from a merchant in bordeaux apologizing for having suffered a box of plants addressed by me to you to get accidentally covered in his warehouse by other objects and to remain three years undiscovered when every thing in it was found to be rotten i have learned occasionally that others rotted in the warehouses of the english pirates we are now settling that account with them we have taken their upper canada and shall add the lower to it when the season will admit and hope to remove them fully and finally from our continent and what they will feel more for they value their colonies only for the bales of cloth they take from them we have established manufactures not only sufficient to supersede our demand from them but to rivalize them in foreign markets but for the course of our war i will refer you to m de la fayette to whom i state it more particularly our friend mr short is well he makes philadelphia his winter quarters and new york or the country those of the summer in his fortune he is perfectly independent and at ease and does not     trouble himself with the party politics of our country will you permit me to place here for m de tessé the testimony of my high esteem and respect and accept for yourself an assurance of the warm recollections i retain of your many civilities and courtesies to me and the homage of my constant and affectionate attachment and respect thomas jefferson dec         monticello philip mazzei to philip mazzei j mss monticello dec         the last letter i have received from you my dear  antient friend was of the   th of feb      that letter i answered two days after its receipt to wit july        since which i have not heard from you such an interval excites anxieties to learn that you continue in health my health remains good a diminution of strength being the principal indication of advancing years since our last letters we have been forced by england into the war which has been so long raging her orders of council which excluded us from the ocean but on license and tribute to her and took from us near  000 vessels in a time of what she called peace her impressment of between   and  000 of our seamen the proclamation of her prince regent that they never would repeal the orders of council as to us until france should have repealed her illegal decrees as to all the world and the declaration of her minister to ours that no admissible precaution against the impressment of our seamen     by her officers other than their discretion could be devised obliged us at length to declare war about the time of our declaration she was forced by the distresses of her manufactures and commerce to issue a palinodial proclamation repealing her orders this was unknown to us at the time of our declaration but the war being commenced is now continued for the  d cause the impressment of our seamen our  st campaign of      was unsuccessful through the treachery of the general who came first into contact with the enemy and betrayed to them his army fort and the country around it this was the parent of all the subsequent misfortunes of the campaign altho immediately produced by the cowardice carelessness or incompetence of other commanders all new and untried men all our officers of high grade in the revolutionary war during  0 years of peace having either died or become superannuated scott died lately and starke the only surviving one i recollect is past service on the part of the enemy all their successes after the first which their money achieved were obtained by the immense body of savages they engaged and who under british direction carried on the war in their usual way massacring prisoners in cold blood  after capitulation  tomahawking  scalping women and children on our frontiers in our  d campaign altho we have not done all to which our force was adequate we have done much we have taken possession of all upper canada except the single post of kingston at its lower extremity on the ocean where our force consists     only of a few frigates  smaller vessels in   or   engagements of vessel to vessel of equal force or very nearly so we have captured their vessel in every instance but one three of their frigates have been taken by us  one only of ours by them in a remarkable action on lake erie between about   or  0 vessels of a side large and small from ships down to gunboats the greater number of guns and men being on their side we took their whole squadron not a vessel or a man escaping on this state of things our  d campaign will open the presidents message at the meeting of the present session of congress will give you a more detailed account of our proceedings knowing your affection for this country  your anxieties for its welfare i have thought this summary view of our war and its events would be acceptable in the meantime the war has turned most of our commercial capital to manufactures the rapidity of their growth is unexampled we have already probably a million of spindles engaged in spinning cotton  wool which will clothe sufficiently our   millions of people  they are multiplying daily we are getting the spinning machines into all our farm houses i have near  00 spindles in operation for clothing our own family the merino sheep are spreading over the continent and thrive well we make as good broad cloth now in our large manufacturies as the best english and come peace when it may we shall return to them only for the finest  most exquisite manufactures indeed i consider the most fatal consequence of this war to england to be the transfer it has occasioned of     her art in manufacturing into other countries from this and her impending bankruptcy future history will have to trace her decline and fall as a great power exertions beyond her strength and expences beyond her means as in the case of private individuals have given her a shortlived blaze which must sink her the sooner to her original level now as to the remains of your affairs here i have the happiness to inform you that i have at length been able to make sale of your house and lot in richmond for      dollars    cents clear of expenses of sale bearing an interest of   per cent from the   th of july last the close blockade of our ports by the enemy a recent embargo by ourselves and the consequent suspension of our commerce and intercourse with all nations would have rendered the remittance of the price impracticable had i supposed it your wish but the higher interest it bears with us and a belief that your views are not entirely withdrawn from this country would have alone prevented my displacing it until your special orders in the meantime the same obstructions to our commerce render it a convenience to retain it for a while in my own hands it shall be placed on landed security so as to be entirely safe and if you desire it the interest shall be remitted to you annually and regularly being of   0 dollars a year the principal sum being so considerable a proportionable time must probably be allowed say of one and two years when its remittance is called for since the execution of the deed to the purchaser in which edmund randolph joined me he has died having long been     in a state which rendered it rather desirable for himself and his friends our friend t lomax had paid this debt to nature a year or two before i recollect no other death interesting to you which has happened since the date of my last letter derieux and his wife are living they move often from place to place to seek relief from their distresses i believe they have  0 or    children he is now barkeeper to a tavern in richmond and she keeping a little school in petersburg he solicited me to mention him to you and that any crumbs from your property here would help him to subsist let me hear from you as soon as you can being anxious to know that you are well and tendering to your family any services i can ever render them with the assurances of my attachment and respect accept for yourself those of my constant and affectionate friendship thomas jefferson january        monticello thomas leiper to thomas leiper j mss monticello january        dear sir —i had hoped when i retired from the business of the world that i should have been permitted to pass the evening of life in tranquillity undisturbed by the peltings and passions of which the public papers are the vehicles i see however that i have been dragged into the newspapers by the infidelity of one with whom i was formerly intimate but who has abandoned the american principles out of which that intimacy grew and become the bigoted partisan of england and malcontent of his own     government in a letter which he wrote to me he earnestly besought me to avail our country of the good understanding which existed between the executive and myself by recommending an offer of such terms to our enemy as might produce a peace towards which he was confident that enemy was disposed in my answer i stated the aggressions the insults and injuries which england had been heaping on us for years our long forbearance in the hope she might be led by time and reflection to a sounder view of her own interests and of their connection with justice to us the repeated propositions for accommodation made by us and rejected by her and at length her prince regents solemn proclamation to the world that he would never repeal the orders in council as to us until france should have revoked her illegal decrees as to all the world and her ministers declaration to ours that no admissable precaution against the impressment of our seamen could be proposed that the unavoidable declaration of war which followed these was accompanied by advances for peace on terms which no american could dispense with made through various channels and unnoticed and unanswered through any but that if he could suggest any other conditions which we ought to accept and which had not been repeatedly offered and rejected i was ready to be the channel of their conveyance to the government and to show him that neither that attachment to bonaparte nor french influence which they allege eternally without believing it themselves affected my mind i threw in the two little sentences of the   0 printed extract enclosed in your friendly favor of the  th ultimo and exactly these two little sentences from a letter of two or three pages he has thought proper to publish naked alone and with my name although other parts of the letter would have shown that i wished such limits only to the successes of bonaparte as should not prevent his completely closing europe against british manufactures and commerce and thereby reducing her to just terms of peace with us thus am i situated i receive letters from all quarters some from known friends some from those who write like friends on various subjects what am i to do am i to button myself up in jesuitical reserve rudely declining any answer or answering in terms so unmeaning as only to prove my distrust must i withdraw myself from all interchange of sentiment with the world i cannot do this it is at war with my habits and temper i cannot act as if all men were unfaithful because some are so nor believe that all will betray me because some do i had rather be the victim of occasional infidelities than relinquish my general confidence in the honesty of man so far as to the breach of confidence which has brought me into the newspapers with a view to embroil me with my friends by a supposed separation in opinion and principle from them but it is impossible that there can be any difference of opinion among us on the two propositions contained in these two little sentences when explained as they were explained in the context from which they were insulated that bonaparte is an unprincipled tyrant     who is deluging the continent of europe with blood there is not a human being not even the wife of his bosom who does not see nor can there i think be a doubt as to the line we ought to wish drawn between his successes and those of alexander surely none of us wish to see bonaparte conquer russia and lay thus at his feet the whole continent of europe this done england would be but a breakfast and although i am free from the visionary fears which the votaries of england have affected to entertain because i believe he cannot effect the conquest of europe yet put all europe into his hands and he might spare such a force to be sent in british ships as i would as leave not have to encounter when i see how much trouble a handful of british soldiers in canada has given us no it cannot be to our interest that all europe should be reduced to a single monarchy the true line of interest for us is that bonaparte should be able to effect the complete exclusion of england from the whole continent of europe in order as the same letter said by this peaceable engine of constraint to make her renounce her views of dominion over the ocean of permitting no other nation to navigate it but with her license and on tribute to her and her aggressions on the persons of our citizens who may choose to exercise their right of passing over that element and this would be effected by bonapartes succeeding so far as to close the baltic against her this success i wished him the last year this i wish him this year but were he again advanced to moscow i should again wish him such disasters as would prevent his     reaching petersburg and were the consequences even to be the longer continuance of our war i would rather meet them than see the whole force of europe wielded by a single hand i have gone into this explanation my friend because i know you will not carry my letter to the newspapers and because i am willing to trust to your discretion the explaining me to our honest fellow laborers and the bringing them to pause and reflect if any of them have not sufficiently reflected on the extent of the success we ought to wish to bonaparte with a view to our own interests only and even were we not men to whom nothing human should be indifferent but is our particular interest to make us insensible to all sentiments of morality is it then become criminal the moral wish that the torrents of blood this man is shedding in europe the sufferings of so many human beings good as ourselves on whose necks he is trampling the burnings of ancient cities devastations of great countries the destruction of law and order and demoralization of the world should be arrested even if it should place our peace a little further distant no you and i cannot differ in wishing that russia and sweden and denmark and germany and spain and portugal and italy and even england may retain their independence and if we differ in our opinions about towers and his four beasts and ten kingdoms we differ as friends indulging mutual errors and doing justice to mutual sincerity and honesty in this spirit of sincere confidence and affection i pray god to bless you here and hereafter     thomas jefferson january        monticello doctor walter jones to doctor walter jones j mss monticello january        dear sir —your favor of november the   th reached this place december the   st having been near a month on the way how this could happen i know not as we have two mails a week both from fredericksburg and richmond it found me just returned from a long journey and absence during which so much business had accumulated commanding the first attentions that another week has been added to the delay i deplore with you the putrid state into which our newspapers have passed and the malignity the vulgarity and mendacious spirit of those who write for them and i enclose you a recent sample the production of a new england judge as a proof of the abyss of degradation into which we are fallen these ordures are rapidly depraving the public taste and lessening its relish for sound food as vehicles of information and a curb on our functionaries they have rendered themselves useless by forfeiting all title to belief that this has in a great degree been produced by the violence and malignity of party spirit i agree with you and i have read with great pleasure the paper you enclosed me on that subject which i now return it is at the same time a perfect model of the style of discussion which candor and decency should observe of the tone which renders difference of opinion even amiable and a succinct correct and dispassionate history of the origin and progress of party among us it might be incorporated as it stands and without changing a word into     the history of the present epoch and would give to posterity a fairer view of the times than they will probably derive from other sources in reading it with great satisfaction there was but a single passage where i wished a little more development of a very sound and catholic idea a single intercalation to rest it solidly on true bottom it is near the end of the first page where you make a statement of genuine republican maxims saying that the people ought to possess as much political power as can possibly exist with the order and security of society instead of this i would say that the people being the only safe depository of power should exercise in person every function which their qualifications enable them to exercise consistently with the order and security of society that we now find them equal to the election of those who shall be invested with their executive and legislative powers and to act themselves in the judiciary as judges in questions of fact that the range of their powers ought to be enlarged c this gives both the reason and exemplification of the maxim you express that they ought to possess as much political power c i see nothing to correct either in your facts or principles you say that in taking general washington on your shoulders to bear him harmless through the federal coalition you encounter a perilous topic i do not think so you have given the genuine history of the course of his mind through the trying scenes in which it was engaged and of the seductions by which it was deceived but not depraved i     think i knew general washington intimately and thoroughly and were i called on to delineate his character it should be in terms like these his mind was great and powerful without being of the very first order his penetration strong though not so acute as that of a newton bacon or locke and as far as he saw no judgment was ever sounder it was slow in operation being little aided by invention or imagination but sure in conclusion hence the common remark of his officers of the advantage he derived from councils of war where hearing all suggestions he selected whatever was best and certainly no general ever planned his battles more judiciously but if deranged during the course of the action if any member of his plan was dislocated by sudden circumstances he was slow in readjustment the consequence was that he often failed in the field and rarely against an enemy in station as at boston and york he was incapable of fear meeting personal dangers with the calmest unconcern perhaps the strongest feature in his character was prudence never acting until every circumstance every consideration was maturely weighed refraining if he saw a doubt but when once decided going through with his purpose whatever obstacles opposed his integrity was most pure his justice the most inflexible i have ever known no motives of interest or consanguinity of friendship or hatred being able to bias his decision he was indeed in every sense of the words a wise a good and a great man his temper was naturally high toned but reflection and resolution had     obtained a firm and habitual ascendency over it if ever however it broke its bonds he was most tremendous in his wrath in his expenses he was honorable but exact liberal in contributions to whatever promised utility but frowning and unyielding on all visionary projects and all unworthy calls on his charity his heart was not warm in its affections but he exactly calculated every mans value and gave him a solid esteem proportioned to it his person you know was fine his stature exactly what one would wish his deportment easy erect and noble the best horseman of his age and the most graceful figure that could be seen on horseback although in the circle of his friends where he might be unreserved with safety he took a free share in conversation his colloquial talents were not above mediocrity possessing neither copiousness of ideas nor fluency of words in public when called on for a sudden opinion he was unready short and embarrassed yet he wrote readily rather diffusely in an easy and correct style this he had acquired by conversation with the world for his education was merely reading writing and common arithmetic to which he added surveying at a later day his time was employed in action chiefly reading little and that only in agriculture and english history his correspondence became necessarily extensive and with journalizing his agricultural proceedings occupied most of his leisure hours within doors on the whole his character was in its mass perfect in nothing bad in few points indifferent and it may truly be said that never did nature and fortune     combine more perfectly to make a man great and to place him in the same constellation with whatever worthies have merited from man an everlasting remembrance for his was the singular destiny and merit of leading the armies of his country successfully through an arduous war for the establishment of its independence of conducting its councils through the birth of a government new in its forms and principles until it had settled down into a quiet and orderly train and of scrupulously obeying the laws through the whole of his career civil and military of which the history of the world furnishes no other example how then can it be perilous for you to take such a man on your shoulders i am satisfied the great body of republicans think of him as i do we were indeed dissatisfied with him on his ratification of the british treaty but this was short lived we knew his honesty the wiles with which he was encompassed and that age had already begun to relax the firmness of his purposes and i am convinced he is more deeply seated in the love and gratitude of the republicans than in the pharisaical homage of the federal monarchists for he was no monarchist from preference of his judgment the soundness of that gave him correct views of the rights of man and his severe justice devoted him to them he has often declared to me that he considered our new constitution as an experiment on the practicability of republican government and with what dose of liberty man could be trusted for his own good that he was determined the experiment should have a fair     trial and would lose the last drop of his blood in support of it and these declarations he repeated to me the oftener and more pointedly because he knew my suspicions of colonel hamiltons views and probably had heard from him the same declarations which i had to wit that the british constitution with its unequal representation corruption and other existing abuses was the most perfect government which had ever been established on earth and that a reformation of those abuses would make it an impracticable government i do believe that general washington had not a firm confidence in the durability of our government he was naturally distrustful of men and inclined to gloomy apprehensions and i was ever persuaded that a belief that we must at length end in something like a british constitution had some weight in his adoption of the ceremonies of levees birthdays pompous meetings with congress and other forms of the same character calculated to prepare us gradually for a change which he believed possible and to let it come on with as little shock as might be to the public mind these are my opinions of general washington which i would vouch at the judgment seat of god having been formed on an acquaintance of thirty years i served with him in the virginia legislature from      to the revolutionary war and again a short time in congress until he left us to take command of the army during the war and after it we corresponded occasionally and in the four years of my continuance in the office of secretary of state our intercourse was daily confidential and cordial     after i retired from that office great and malignant pains were taken by our federal monarchists and not entirely without effect to make him view me as a theorist holding french principles of government which would lead infallibly to licentiousness and anarchy and to this he listened the more easily from my known disapprobation of the british treaty i never saw him afterwards or these malignant insinuations should have been dissipated before his just judgment as mists before the sun i felt on his death with my countrymen that verily a great man hath fallen this day in israel more time and recollection would enable me to add many other traits of his character but why add them to you who knew him well and i cannot justify to myself a longer detention of your paper vale proprieque tuum me esse tibi persuadeas thomas jefferson january         monticello joseph c cabell to joseph c cabell j mss monticello january         dear sir —your favor of the   d is received say had come to hand safely but i regretted having asked the return of him for i did not find in him one new idea upon the subject i had been contemplating nothing more than a succinct judicious digest of the tedious pages of smith you ask my opinion on the question whether the states can add any qualifications to those which the constitution has prescribed for their members of congress it is a question i had never before reflected   0 on yet had taken up an offhand opinion agreeing with your first that they could not that to add new qualifications to those of the constitution would be as much an alteration as to detract from them and so i think the house of representatives of congress decided in some case i believe that of a member from baltimore but your letter having induced me to look into the constitution and to consider the question a little i am again in your predicament of doubting the correctness of my first opinion had the constitution been silent nobody can doubt but that the right to prescribe all the qualifications and disqualifications of those they would send to represent them would have belonged to the state so also the constitution might have prescribed the whole and excluded all others it seems to have preferred the middle way it has exercised the power in part by declaring some disqualifications to wit those of not being twentyfive years of age of not having been a citizen seven years and of not being an inhabitant of the state at the time of election but it does not declare itself that the member shall not be a lunatic a pauper a convict of treason of murder of felony or other infamous crime or a nonresident of his district nor does it prohibit to the state the power of declaring these or any other disqualifications which its particular circumstances may call for and these may be different in different states of course then by the tenth amendment the power is reserved to the state if wherever the constitution assumes a single power out of many which belong to the same     subject we should consider it as assuming the whole it would vest the general government with a mass of powers never contemplated on the contrary the assumption of particular powers seems an exclusion of all not assumed this reasoning appears to me to be sound but on so recent a change of view caution requires us not to be too confident and that we admit this to be one of the doubtful questions on which honest men may differ with the purest motives and the more readily as we find we have differed from ourselves on it i have always thought where the line of demarcation between the powers of the general and the state governments was doubtfully or indistinctly drawn it would be prudent and praiseworthy in both parties never to approach it but under the most urgent necessity is the necessity now urgent to declare that no nonresident of his district shall be eligible as a member of congress it seems to me that in practice the partialities of the people are a sufficient security against such an election and that if in any instance they should ever choose a nonresident it must be one of such eminent merit and qualifications as would make it a good rather than an evil and that in any event the examples will be so rare as never to amount to a serious evil if the case then be neither clear nor urgent would it not be better to let it lie undisturbed perhaps its decision may never be called for but if it be indispensable to establish this disqualification now would it not look better to declare such others at the same time as may be proper i frankly confide to yourself     these opinions or rather noopinions of mine but would not wish to have them go any farther i want to be quiet and although some circumstances now and then excite me to notice them i feel safe and happier in leaving events to those whose turn it is to take care of them and in general to let it be understood that i meddle little or not at all with public affairs there are two subjects indeed which i shall claim a right to further as long as i breathe the public education and the subdivision of counties into wards i consider the continuance of republican government as absolutely hanging on these two hooks of the first you will i am sure be an advocate as having already reflected on it and of the last when you shall have reflected ever affectionately yours thomas jefferson feb       monticello james madison to james madison j mss monticello feb       dear sir —a letter from colo earle of s c induces me to apprehend that the government is called on to reimburse expences to which i am persuaded it is no wise liable either in justice or liberality i inclose you a copy of my answer to him as it may induce further enquiry  particularly of genl dearborn the tennessee senators of that day can also give some information we have not yet seen the scheme of the new loan but the continual creation of new banks cannot fail to facilitate it for already there is so much of their trash afloat that the great holders of it shew vast     anxiety to get rid of it they perceive that now as in the revolutionary war we are engaged in the old game of robins alive they are ravenous after lands and stick at no price in the neighborhood of richmond the seat of that sort of sensibility they offer twice as much now as they would give a year ago  00 millions in actual circulation and  00 millions more likely to be legitimated by the legislative sessions of this winter will give us about  0 times the wholesome circulation for   millions of people when the new emissions get out our legislatures will see what they otherwise cannot believe that it is possible to have too much money it will insure your loan for this year but what will you do for the next for i think it impossible but that the whole system must blow up before the year is out and thus a tax of   or  00 millions will be levied on our citizens who had found it a work of so much time and labour to pay off a debt of  0 millions which had redeemed them from bondage the new taxes are paid here with great cheerfulness those on stills and carriages will be wonderfully productive a general return to the cultivation of tobo is taking place because it will keep this proves that the public mind is made up to a continuance of the war ever affectionately yours thomas jefferson march        monticello gideon granger to gideon granger j mss monticello march        dear sir —your letter of february   d came to hand on the  th instant nothing is so painful to     me as appeals to my memory on the subject of past transactions from      to   0  my life was an unremitting course of public transactions so numerous so multifarious and so diversified by places and persons that like the figures of a magic lanthern their succession was with a rapidity that scarcely gave time for fixed impressions add to this the decay of memory consequent on advancing years and it will not be deemed wonderful that i should be a stranger as it were even to my own transactions of some indeed i retain recollections of the particular as well as general circumstances of others a strong impression of the general fact with an oblivion of particulars but of a great mass not a trace either of general or particular remains in my mind i have duly pondered the facts stated in your letter and for the refreshment of my memory have gone over the letters which passed between us while i was in the administration of the government have examined my private notes and such other papers as could assist me in the recovery of the facts and shall now state them seriatim from your letter and give the best account of them i am able to derive from the joint sources of memory and papers i have been denounced as a burrite but you know that in   00 i sent erving from boston to inform virginia of the danger resulting from his intrigues i well remember mr ervings visit to this state about that time and his suggestions of the designs meditated in the quarter you mention but as my duties on the occasion were to be merely passive he of course as i presume addressed his     communications more particularly to those who were free to use them i do not recollect his mentioning you but i find that in your letter to me of april      0  you state your agency on that occasion so that i have no reason to doubt the fact that in   0 –  on my advice you procured erastus granger to inform de witt clinton of the plan to elevate burr in new york here i do not recollect the particulars but i have a general recollection that colonel burrs conduct had already at that date rendered his designs suspicious that being for that reason laid aside by his constituents as vice president and aiming to become the governor of new york it was thought advisable that the persons of influence in that state should be put on their guard and mr clinton being eminent no one was more likely to receive intimations from us nor any one more likely to be confided in for their communication than yourself i have no doubt therefore of the fact and the less because in your letter to me of october     0  you remind me of it about the same period that is in the winter of   0 –  another train of facts took place which although not specifically stated in your letter i think it but justice to yourself that i should state i mean the intrigues which were in agitation and at the bottom of which we believed colonel burr to be to form a coalition of the five eastern states with new york and new jersey under the new appellation of the seven eastern states either to overawe the union by the combination of their power and their will or by threats of separating themselves     from it your intimacy with some of those in the secret gave you opportunities of searching into their proceedings of which you made me daily and confidential reports this intimacy to which i had such useful recourse at the time rendered you an object of suspicion with many as being yourself a partisan of colonel burr and engaged in the very combination which you were faithfully employed in defeating i never failed to justify you to all those who brought their suspicions to me and to assure them of my knowledge of your fidelity many were the individuals then members of the legislature who received these assurances from me and whose apprehensions were thereby quieted this first project of colonel burr having vanished in smoke he directed to the western country those views which are the subject of your next article that in   0  i communicated by the first mail after i had got knowledge of the fact the supposed plans of burr in his western expedition upon which communication your council was first called together to take measures in relation to that subject not exactly on that single communication on the   th and   th of september i had received letters from colonel george morgan and from a mr nicholson of new york suggesting in a general way the maneuvres of colonel burr similar information came to the secretary of state from a mr williams of new york the indications however were so vague that i only desired their increased attention to the subject and further communications of what they should discover your letter of october    conveying the     communications of general eaton to yourself and to mr ely gave a specific view of the objects of this new conspiracy and corroborating our previous information i called the cabinet together on the   d of october when specific measures were adopted for meeting the dangers threatened in the various points in which they might occur i say your letter of october    gave this information because its date with the circumstance of its being no longer on my files induces me to infer it was that particular letter which having being transferred to the bundle of the documents of that conspiracy delivered to the attorney general is no longer in my possession your mission of mr pease on the route to new orleans at the time of that conspiracy with powers to see that the mails were expedited and to dismiss at once every agent of the post office whose fidelity could be justly doubted and to substitute others on the spot was a necessary measure taken with my approbation and he executed the trusts to my satisfaction i do not know however that my subsequent appointment of him to the office of surveyor general was influenced as you suppose by those services my motives in that appointment were my personal knowledge of his mathematical qualifications and satisfactory informations of the other parts of his character with respect to the dismission of the prosecutions for sedition in connecticut it is well known to have been a tenet of the republican portion of our fellow citizens that the sedition law was contrary to the constitution and therefore void on this ground     i considered it as a nullity wherever i met it in the course of my duties and on this ground i directed nolle prosequis in all the prosecutions which had been instituted under it and as far as the public sentiment can be inferred from the occurrences of the day we may say that this opinion had the sanction of the nation the prosecutions therefore which were afterwards instituted in connecticut of which two were against printers two against preachers and one against a judge were too inconsistent with this principle to be permitted to go on we were bound to administer to others the same measure of law not which they had meted to us but we to ourselves and to extend to all equally the protection of the same constitutional principles these prosecutions too were chiefly for charges against myself and i had from the beginning laid it down as a rule to notice nothing of the kind i believed that the long course of services in which i had acted on the public stage and under the eye of my fellow citizens furnished better evidence to them of my character and principles than the angry invectives of adverse partisans in whose eyes the very acts most approved by the majority were subjects of the greatest demerit and censure these prosecutions against them therefore were to be dismissed as a matter of duty but i wished it to be done with all possible respect to the worthy citizens who had advised them and in such way as to spare their feelings which had been justly irritated by the intemperance of their adversaries as you were of that state and intimate with these characters the business was     confided to you and you executed it to my perfect satisfaction these i think are all the particular facts on which you have asked my testimony and i add with pleasure and under a sense of duty the declaration that the increase of rapidity in the movement of the mails which had been vainly attempted before were readily undertaken by you on your entrance into office and zealously and effectually carried into execution and that the affairs of the office were conducted by you with ability and diligence so long as i had opportunities of observing them with respect to the first article mentioned in your letter in which i am neither concerned nor consulted i will yet as a friend volunteer my advice i never knew anything of it nor would ever listen to such gossiping trash be assured my dear sir that the dragging such a subject before the public will excite universal reprobation and they will drown in their indignation all the solid justifications which they would otherwise have received and weighed with candor consult your own experience reflect on the similar cases which have happened within your own knowledge and see if ever there was a single one in which such a mode of recrimination procured favor to him who used it you may give pain where perhaps you wish it but be assured it will react on yourself with double though delayed effect and that it will be one of those incidents of your life on which you will never reflect with satisfaction be advised then erase it even from your memory and stand erect before the world on the   0 high ground of your own merits without stooping to what is unworthy either of your or their notice remember that we often repent of what we have said but never never of that which we have not you may have time enough hereafter to mend your hold if ever it can be mended by such matter as that take time then and do not commit your happiness and public estimation by too much precipitancy i am entirely uninformed of the state of things which you say exists and which will oblige you to make a solemn appeal to the nation in vindication of your character but whatever that be i feel it a duty to bear testimony to the truth and i have suggested with frankness other considerations occurring to myself because i wish you well and i add sincere assurances of my great respect and esteem thomas jefferson mar  0    monticello james madison to james madison j mss monticello mar  0    dear sir —your favor of feb   was duly received that which it gave me reason to expect from mr g  did not come till the  th inst he mentioned in it that a state of things existed which probably would oblige him to make a solemn appeal to the public and he asked my testimony to certain specific facts which he stated these related solely to charges against him as a burrite and to his agency in dismissing the prosecutions in connecticut under the sedition law the facts alleged as     disproving his burrism were   that he thro mr erving in   00 put virginia on her guard against the designs of burr   that in   0    at my request he communicated to de witt clinton burrs aspiring to the government of new york   that in   0  he gave us the first effectual notice of burrs western projects by which we were enabled to take specific measures to meet them   his mission of mr pease on the route to n orleans to expedite the mails and remove suspected agents of the post office these appeals to my very defective memory are very painful i have looked over my papers and answered his enquiries as exactly as i could under a sense not only of the general duty of bearing testimony to truth but of justice to him personally for his conduct towards me was ever friendly and faithful and i on several occasions used his services to the advantage of the public he said nothing on the subject of tayloes post office but i remember the substance altho not the minutiæ of that case he informed me that mr tayloe held a post office near mount airy and exercised it by his steward as a deputy to himself residing at washington merely for the purpose of carrying on his plantation correspondence free of postage i advised his immediate appointment of another as well on the ground of the abusive use of the office as to suppress the example of nonresidents holding local offices which would otherwise lead immediately to the most pernicious practises of sinecure of the baptist preacher and mr tayloes underbidding him i recollect nothing i remember that     mr granger soon after he came into office informed me of a device practised by the federalists in the eastern states to favor the circulation of their papers and defeat that of the republicans which was when ever a republican rider was employed to underbid to a price below what the business could be done for submitting to that loss for one year and the next to demand the full price the republican being thus removed from the competition by the disposal of his horses c i desired him whenever a bidder should offer below the real worth  there should be reason to suspect this fraud to reject him and i would take on myself the responsibility if i was consulted on the competition of tayloe and the baptist preacher and gave an opinion on it it must have been stated as a case of this class as to the compromise alledged of giving up the one case for the other no such idea was ever presented to me nor would mr g have ventured to present it and i am certain that not a word ever passed between doctr jones  myself on the subject the true remedy for putting those appointments into a wholesome state would be a law vesting them in the president but without the intervention of the senate that intervention would make the matter worse every senator would expect to dispose of all the post offices in his vicinage or perhaps in his state at present the president has some controul over those appointments by his authority over the postmaster himself and i should think it well to require him to lay all his appointments previously before the president for his approbation or rejection an     expression in mr gs letter gave me ground to advise him to confine his vindication to its important points whatever they might be and not to let his passions lead him into matter which would degrade himself alone in the public opinion and i have urged it in such terms as i trust will have effect our

unprincipled usurper without a virtue no statesman knowing nothing of commerce political economy or civil government and supplying ignorance by bold presumption i had supposed him a great man until     his entrance into the assembly des cinq cens eighteen brumaire an   from that date however i set him down as a great scoundrel only to the wonders of his rise and fall we may add that of a czar of muscovy dictating in paris laws and limits to all the successors of the cæsars and holding even the balance in which the fortunes of this new world are suspended i own that while i rejoice for the good of mankind in the deliverance of europe from the havoc which would never have ceased while bonaparte should have lived in power i see with anxiety the tyrant of the ocean remaining in vigor and even participating in the merit of crushing his brother tyrant while the world is thus turned up side down on which of its sides are we all the strong reasons indeed place us on the side of peace the interests of the continent their friendly dispositions and even the interests of england her passions alone are opposed to it peace would seem now to be an easy work the causes of the war being removed her orders of council will no doubt be taken care of by the allied powers and war ceasing her impressment of our seamen ceases of course but i fear there is foundation for the design intimated in the public papers of demanding a cession of our right in the fisheries what will massachusetts say to this i mean her majority which must be considered as speaking through the organs it has appointed itself as the index of its will she chose to sacrifice the liberties of our seafaring citizens in which we were all interested and with them her obligations to the costates rather than war with     england will she now sacrifice the fisheries to the same partialities this question is interesting to her alone for to the middle the southern and western states they are of no direct concern of no more than the culture of tobacco rice and cotton to massachusetts i am really at a loss to conjecture what our refractory sister will say on this occasion i know what as a citizen of the union i would say to her take this question ad referendum it concerns you alone if you would rather give up the fisheries than war with england we give them up if you had rather fight for them we will defend your interests to the last drop of our blood choosing rather to set a good example than follow a bad one and i hope she will determine to fight for them with this however you and i shall have nothing to do ours being truly the case wherein non tali auxilio nec defensoribus istis tempus eget quitting this subject therefore i will turn over a new leaf i am just returned from one of my long absences having been at my other home for five weeks past having more leisure there than here for reading i amused myself with reading seriously platos republic i am wrong however in calling it amusement for it was the heaviest taskwork i ever went through i had occasionally before taken up some of his other works but scarcely ever had patience to go through a whole dialogue while wading through the whimsies the puerilities and unintelligible jargon of this work i laid it down often to ask myself how it could have been that the world should have so long consented to give reputation to such nonsense as this     how the soidisant christian world indeed should have done it is a piece of historical curiosity but how could the roman good sense do it and particularly how could cicero bestow such eulogies on plato although cicero did not wield the dense logic of demosthenes yet he was able learned laborious practised in the business of the world and honest he could not be the dupe of mere style of which he was himself the first master in the world with the moderns i think it is rather a matter of fashion and authority education is chiefly in the hands of persons who from their profession have an interest in the reputation and the dreams of plato they give the tone while at school and few in their after years have occasion to revise their college opinions but fashion and authority apart and bringing plato to the test of reason take from him his sophisms futilities and incomprehensibilities and what remains in truth he is one of the race of genuine sophists who has escaped the oblivion of his brethren first by the elegance of his diction but chiefly by the adoption and incorporation of his whimsies into the body of artificial christianity his foggy mind is forever presenting the semblances of objects which half seen through a mist can be defined neither in form nor dimensions yet this which should have consigned him to early oblivion really procured him immortality of fame and reverence the christian priesthood finding the doctrines of christ levelled to every understanding and too plain to need explanation saw in the mysticism of plato materials with which they might build up     an artificial system which might from its indistinctness admit everlasting controversy give employment for their order and introduce it to profit power and preeminence the doctrines which flowed from the lips of jesus himself are within the comprehension of a child but thousands of volumes have not yet explained the platonisms engrafted on them and for this obvious reason that nonsense can never be explained their purposes however are answered plato is canonized and it is now deemed as impious to question his merits as those of an apostle of jesus he is peculiarly appealed to as an advocate of the immortality of the soul and yet i will venture to say that were there no better arguments than his in proof of it not a man in the world would believe it it is fortunate for us that platonic republicanism has not obtained the same favor as platonic christianity or we should now have been all living men women and children pell mell together like beasts of the field or forest yet plato is a great philosopher said la fontaine but says fontenelle do you find his ideas very clear oh no he is of an obscurity impenetrable do you not find him full of contradictions certainly replied la fontaine he is but a sophist yet immediately after he exclaims again oh plato was a great philosopher socrates had reason indeed to complain of the misrepresentations of plato for in truth his dialogues are libels on socrates but why am i dosing you with these antediluvian topics because i am glad to have some one to     whom they are familiar and who will not receive them as if dropped from the moon our postrevolutionary youth are born under happier stars than you and i were they acquire all learning in their mothers womb and bring it into the world ready made the information of books is no longer necessary and all knowledge which is not innate is in contempt or neglect at least every folly must run its round and so i suppose must that of selflearning and selfsufficiency of rejecting the knowledge acquired in past ages and starting on the new ground of intuition when sobered by experience i hope our successors will turn their attention to the advantages of education i mean of education on the broad scale and not that of the petty academies as they call themselves which are starting up in every neighborhood and where one or two men possessing latin and sometimes greek a knowledge of the globes and the first six books of euclid imagine and communicate this as the sum of science they commit their pupils to the theatre of the world with just taste enough of learning to be alienated from industrious pursuits and not enough to do service in the ranks of science we have some exceptions indeed i presented one to you lately and we have some others but the terms i use are general truths i hope the necessity will at length be seen of establishing institutions here as in europe where every branch of science useful at this day may be taught in its highest degree have you ever turned your thoughts to the plan of such an institution i mean to a specification of the particular sciences of  00 real use in human affairs and how they might be so grouped as to require so many professors only as might bring them within the views of a just but enlightened economy i should be happy in a communication of your ideas on this problem either loose or digested but to avoid my being run away with by another subject and adding to the length and ennui of the present letter i will here present to mrs adams and yourself the assurance of my constant and sincere friendship and respect thomas jefferson august         monticello william wirt to william wirt j mss monticello august         dear sir —i have been laying under contribution my memory my private papers the printed records gazettes and pamphlets in my possession to answer the inquiries of your letter of july    and i will give you the result as correctly as i can i kept no copy of the paper i sent you on a former occasion on the same subject nor do i retain an exact recollection of its contents but if in that i stated the question on the loan office to have been in      i did it with too slight attention to the date although not to the fact i have examined the journals of the house of burgesses of    0– –  in my possession and find no trace of the proceeding in them by those of      i find that the famous address to the king and memorials to the houses of lords and commons on the proposal of the stamp act were of that date and i know that mr henry was not a member of the legislature when they were passed  0  i know also because i was present that robinson who died in may      was in the chair on the question of the loan office mr henry then must have come in between these two epochs and consequently in      of this year i have no journals to refresh my memory the first session was in may and his first remarkable exhibition there was on the motion for the establishment of an office for lending money on mortgages of real property i find in royles virginia gazette of the   th of that month this proposition for the loan office brought forward its advantages detailed and the plan explained and it seems to have been done by a borrowing member from the feeling with which the motives are expressed and to have been preparatory to the intended motion this was probably made immediately after that date and certainly before the  0th which was the date of mr henrys famous resolutions i had been intimate with mr henry since the winter of     – 0 and felt an interest in what concerned him and i can never forget a particular exclamation of his in the debate in which he electrified his hearers it had been urged that from certain unhappy circumstances of the colony men of substantial property had contracted debts which if exacted suddenly must ruin them and their families but with a little indulgence of time might be paid with ease what sir exclaimed mr henry in animadverting on this is it proposed then to reclaim the spendthrift from his dissipation and extravagance by filling his pockets with money these expressions are indelibly impressed on my  0  memory he laid open with so much energy the spirit of favoritism on which the proposition was founded and the abuses to which it would lead that it was crushed in its birth abortive motions are not always entered on the journals or rather they are rarely entered it is the modern introduction of yeas and nays which has given the means of placing a rejected motion on the journals and it is likely that the speaker who as treasurer was to be the loan officer and had the direction of the journals would choose to omit an entry of the motion in this case this accounts sufficiently for the absence of any trace of the motion in the journals there was no suspicion then as far at least as i know that robinson had used the public money in private loans to his friends and that the secret object of this scheme was to transfer those debtors to the public and thus clear his accounts i have diligently examined the names of the members on the journals of      to see if any were still living to whose memory we might recur on this subject but i find not a single one now remaining in life of the parsons cause i remember nothing remarkable i was at school with mr maury during the years      and      and often heard them inveigh against the iniquity of the act of      called the twopenny act in      when that cause was decided in hanover i was a lawstudent in williamsburg and remember only that it was a subject of much conversation and of great papercontroversy in which camm and colonel bland were the principal champions  0  the disputed election in which mr henry made himself remarkable must have been that of dandridge and littlepage in      of which however i recollect no particulars although i was still a student in williamsburg and paid attention to what was passing in the legislature i proceed now to the resolution of      the copies you enclose me and that inserted by judge marshall in his history and copied verbatim by burke are really embarrassing by their differences   that the four resolutions taken from the records of the house is the genuine copy of what they passed as amended by themselves cannot be doubted   that the copy which mr henry left sealed up is a true copy of these four resolutions as reported by the committee there is no reason to doubt   that judge marshalls version of three of these resolutions for he has omitted one altogether is from an unauthentic source is sufficiently proved by their great variation from the record in diction although equivalent in sentiment but what are we to say of mr henrys fifth and mr marshalls two last which we may call the sixth and seventh resolutions the fifth has clearly nothing to justify the debate and proceedings which one of them produced but the sixth is of that character and perfectly tallies with the idea impressed on my mind of that which was expunged judge marshall tells us that two were disagreed to by the house which may be true i do not indeed recollect it but i have no recollection to the contrary my hypothesis then is this that the two disagreed to were the fifth and seventh the  0  fifth because merely tautologous of the third and fourth and the seventh because leading to individual persecution for which no mind was then prepared and that the sixth was the one passed by the house by a majority of a single vote and expunged from the journals the next day i was standing at the door of communication between the house and lobby during the debates and vote and well remember that after the numbers on the division were told and declared from the chair peyton randolph then attorney general came out at the door where i was standing and exclaimed by god i would have given one hundred guineas for a single vote for one vote would have divided the house and robinson was in the chair who he knew would have negatived the resolution mr henry left town that evening or the next morning and colonel peter randolph then a member of the council came to the house of burgesses about  0 oclock of the forenoon and sat at the clerks table till the housebell rang thumbing over the volumes of journals to find a precedent of expunging a vote of the house which he said had taken place while he was a member or clerk of the house i do not recollect which i stood by him at the end of the table a considerable part of the time looking on as he turned over the leaves but i do not recollect whether he found the erasure in the meantime some of the timid members who had voted for the strongest resolution had become alarmed and as soon as the house met a motion was made and carried to expunge it from the journals and here i will observe that burkes  0  statement with his opponents is entirely erroneous i suppose the original journal was among those destroyed by the british or its obliterated face might be appealed to it is a pity this investigation was not made a few years sooner when some of the members of the day were still living i think inquiry should be made of judge marshall for the source from which he derived his copy of the resolutions this might throw light on the sixth and seventh which i verily believe and especially the sixth to be genuine in substance on the whole i suppose the four resolutions which are on the record were passed and retained by the house that the sixth is that which was passed by a single vote and expunged and the fifth and seventh the two which judge marshall says were disagreed to that mr henrys copy then should not have stated all this is the remaining difficulty this copy he probably sealed up long after the transaction for it was long afterwards that these resolutions instead of the address and memorials of the preceding year were looked back to as the commencement of legislative opposition his own judgment may at a later date have approved of the rejection of the sixth and seventh although not of the fifth and he may have left and sealed up a copy in his own handwriting as approved by his ultimate judgment this to be sure is conjecture and may rightfully be rejected by any one to whom a more plausible solution may occur and there i must leave it the address of      was drawn by peyton randolph who drew the memorial to the lords i do not recollect but  0  mr wythe drew that to the commons it was done with so much freedom that as he has told me himself his colleagues of the committee shrank from it as bearing the aspect of treason and smoothed its features to its present form he was indeed one of the very few for i can barely speak of them in the plural number of either character who from the commencement of the contest hung our connection with great britain on its true hook that of a common king his unassuming character however made him appear as a follower while his sound judgment kept him in a line with the freest spirit by these resolutions mr henry took the lead out of the hands of those who had heretofore guided the proceedings of the house that is to say of pendleton wythe bland randolph nicholas these were honest and able men had begun the opposition on the same grounds but with a moderation more adapted to their age and experience subsequent events favored the bolder spirits of henry the lees pages mason c with whom i went in all points sensible however of the importance of unanimity among our constituents although we often wished to have gone faster we slackened our pace that our less ardent colleagues might keep up with us and they on their part differing nothing from us in principle quickened their gait somewhat beyond that which their prudence might of itself have advised and thus consolidated the phalanx which breasted the power of britain by this harmony of the bold with the cautious we advanced with our constituents in undivided mass and with fewer examples of  0  separation than perhaps existed in any other part of the union i do not remember the topics of mr henrys argument but those of his opposers were that the same sentiments had been expressed in the address and memorials of the preceding session to which an answer was expected and not yet received i well remember the cry of treason the pause of mr henry at the name of george the iii and the presence of mind with which he closed his sentence and baffled the charge vociferated i do not think he took the position in the middle of the floor which you mention on the contrary i think i recollect him standing in the very place which he continued afterwards habitually to occupy in the house the censure of mr e randolph on mr henry in the case of philips was without foundation i remember the case and took my part in it philips was a mere robber who availing himself of the troubles of the times collected a banditti retired to the dismal swamps and from thence sallied forth plundering and maltreating the neighboring inhabitants and covering himself without authority under the name of a british subject mr henry then governor communicated the case to me we both thought the best proceeding would be by bill of attainder unless he delivered himself up for trial within a given time philips was afterwards taken and mr randolph being attorney general and apprehending he would plead that he was a british subject taken in arms in support of his lawful sovereign and as a prisoner of war entitled to the  0  protection of the law of nations he thought the safest proceeding would be to indict him at common law as a felon and robber against this i believe philips urged the same plea he was overruled and found guilty i recollect nothing of a doubt on the reeligibility of mr henry to the government when his term expired in      nor can i conceive on what ground such a doubt could have been entertained unless perhaps that his first election in june      having been before we were nationally declared independent some might suppose it should not be reckoned as one of the three constitutional elections of the projects for appointing a dictator there are said to have been two i know nothing of either but by hearsay the first was in williamsburg in december      the assembly had the month before appointed mr wythe mr pendleton george mason thomas l lee and myself to revise the whole body of laws and adapt them to our new form of government i left the house early in december to prepare to join the committee at fredericksburg the place of our first meeting what passed therefore in the house in december i know not and have not the journals of that session to look into the second proposition was in june      at the staunton session of the legislature no trace of this last motion is entered on the journals of that date which i have examined this is a further proof that the silence of the journals is no evidence against the fact of an abortive motion among the names of the members found on the journal of the staunton  0  session are john taylor of caroline general andrew moore and general edward stevens of culpeper now living it would be well to ask information from each of them that their errors of memory or of feeling may be corrected by collation you ask if i would have any objection to be quoted as to the fact of rescinding the last of mr henrys resolutions none at all as to that fact or its having been passed by a majority of one vote only the scene being as present to my mind as that in which i am now writing but i do not affirm although i believe it was the sixth resolution it is truly unfortunate that those engaged in public affairs so rarely make notes of transactions passing within their knowledge hence history becomes fable instead of fact the great outlines may be true but the incidents and coloring are according to the faith or fancy of the writer had judge marshall taken half your pains in sifting and scrutinizing facts he would not have given to the world as true history a false copy of a record under his eye burke again has copied him and being a second writer on the spot doubles the credit of the copy when writers are so indifferent as to the correctness of facts the verification of which lies at their elbow by what measure shall we estimate their relation of things distant or of those given to us through the obliquities of their own vision our records it is true in the case under contemplation were destroyed by the malice and vandalism of the british military perhaps of their government under whose orders they committed so much useless mischief   0 but printed copies remained as your examination has proved those which were apocryphal then ought not to have been hazarded without examination should you be able to ascertain the genuineness of the sixth and seventh resolutions i would ask a line of information to rectify or to confirm my own impressions respecting them ever affectionately yours  thomas jefferson aug       monticello john thompson mason to john thompson mason j mss monticello aug       dear sir —your letter of may   was handed me by dr wallace on the   th of june  i have added     to the delay of answering it by waiting the arrival of the specimens of mrs masons skill in manufactures which your letter mentd these after various accidents of delay immaterial to explain arrived yesterday and excite the admiration of us all they prove mrs mason is really a more dangerous adversary to our british foes than all our generals these attack the hostile armies only she the source of their subsistence what these do counts nothing because they take one day  lose another what she does counts double because what she takes from the enemy is added to us i hope too she will have more followers than our generals but few rivals i fear these specimens exceed any thing i saw during the revolutionary war altho our ladies of that day turned their whole efforts to these objects  with     great praise  success the endeavors which dr wallace informed you we were making in the same line are very humble indeed we have not as yet got beyond the cloathing of our laborers we hope indeed soon to begin finer fabrics and for higher uses but these will probably be confined to cotton  wool our spinning jennies working from    to  0 spindles     each produce an impatience of the single thread of the flaxwheel   oz of cotton for each spindle is a moderate days work and these the simplest of machines are made by our country joiners  kept in order by our overseers very different from the clockwork of arkwrights machines whose tooth  pinion work requires a clockmaker to make  keep     in repair i have lately also seen the improvement of the loom by janes the most beautiful machine i have ever seen wherein the hand which pulls the batten moves the shuttle the treadles the temples the web and cloth beams all at the same time so that a person with one hand  without feet or using only one hand may weave as well as with all their members i am endeavoring to procure this     improvement also these cares are certainly more pleasant than those of the state and were happiness the only legitimate object the public councils would be deserted that corvee once performed however the independent happiness of domestic life may rightfully be sought  enjoyed mrs randolph joins me in thanks and friendly respects to mrs mason and i add assurances of constant esteem  affection to yourself     thomas jefferson august   th    monticello edward coles to edward coles  monticello august   th    dear sir —your favour of july    was duly received and was read with peculiar pleasure the sentiments breathed through the whole do honor to both the head and heart of the writer mine on the subject of slavery of negroes have long since been in possession of the public and time has only served to give them stronger root the love of justice and the love of country plead equally the cause of these people and it is a moral reproach to us that they should have pleaded it so long in vain and should have produced not a single effort nay i fear not much serious willingness to relieve them  ourselves from our present condition of moral  political reprobation from those of the former generation who were in the fulness of age when i came into public life which was while our controversy with england was on paper only i soon saw that nothing was to be hoped nursed and educated in the daily habit of seeing the degraded condition both bodily and mental of those unfortunate beings not reflecting that that degradation was very much the work of themselves  their fathers few minds have yet doubted but that they were as legitimate subjects of property as their horses and cattle the quiet and monotonous course of colonial life has been disturbed by no alarm and little reflection on the value of liberty and when alarm was taken at an enterprize on their own it was not easy to carry them to the whole length of the principles which they invoked     for themselves in the first or second session of the legislature after i became a member i drew to this subject the attention of col bland one of the oldest ablest  most respected members and he undertook to move for certain moderate extensions of the protection of the laws to these people i seconded his motion and as a younger member was more spared in the debate but he was denounced as an enemy of his country  was treated with the grossest indecorum from an early stage of our revolution other  more distant duties were assigned to me so that from that time till my return from europe in      and i may say till i returned to reside at home in   0  i had little opportunity of knowing the progress of public sentiment here on this subject i had always hoped that the younger generation receiving their early impressions after the flame of liberty had been kindled in every breast  had become as it were the vital spirit of every american that the generous temperament of youth analogous to the motion of their blood and above the suggestions of avarice would have sympathized with oppression wherever found and proved their love of liberty beyond their own share of it but my intercourse with them since my return has not been sufficient to ascertain that they had made towards this point the progress i had hoped your solitary but welcome voice is the first which has brought this sound to my ear and i have considered the general silence which prevails on this subject as indicating an apathy unfavorable to every hope yet the hour of emancipation is advancing in the march of time it will     come and whether brought on by the generous energy of our own minds or by the bloody process of st domingo excited and conducted by the power of our present enemy if once stationed permanently within our country and offering asylum  arms to the oppressed is a leaf of our history not yet turned over as to the method by which this difficult work is to be effected if permitted to be done by ourselves i have seen no proposition so expedient on the whole as that of emancipation of those born after a given day and of their education and expatriation after a given age this would give time for a gradual extinction of that species of labour  substitution of another and lessen the severity of the shock which an operation so fundamental cannot fail to produce for men probably of any color but of this color we know brought from their infancy without necessity for thought or forecast are by their habits rendered as incapable as children of taking care of themselves and are extinguished promptly wherever industry is necessary for raising young in the mean time they are pests in society by their idleness and the depredations to which this leads them their amalgamation with the other color produces a degradation to which no lover of his country no lover of excellence in the human character can innocently consent i am sensible of the partialities with which you have looked towards me as the person who should undertake this salutary but arduous work but this my dear sir is like bidding old priam to buckle the armour of hector trementibus æquo humeris et inutile ferruncingi no i have overlived the     generation with which mutual labors  perils begat mutual confidence and influence this enterprise is for the young for those who can follow it up and bear it through to its consummation it shall have all my prayers  these are the only weapons of an old man but in the mean time are you right in abandoning this property and your country with it i think not my opinion has ever been that until more can be done for them we should endeavor with those whom fortune has thrown on our hands to feed and clothe them well protect them from all ill usage require such reasonable labor only as is performed voluntarily by freemen  be led by no repugnancies to abdicate them and our duties to them the laws do not permit us to turn them loose if that were for their good and to commute them for other property is to commit them to those whose usage of them we cannot control i hope then my dear sir you will reconcile yourself to your country and its unfortunate condition that you will not lessen its stock of sound disposition by withdrawing your portion from the mass that on the contrary you will come forward in the public councils become the missionary of this doctrine truly christian insinuate  inculcate it softly but steadily through the medium of writing and conversation associate others in your labors and when the phalanx is formed bring on and press the proposition perseveringly until its accomplishment it is an encouraging observation that no good measure was ever proposed which if duly pursued failed to prevail in the end we have proof of this in the   0 history of the endeavors in the english parliament to suppress that very trade which brought this evil on us and you will be supported by the religious precept be not weary in welldoing that your success may be as speedy  complete as it will be of honorable  immortal consolation to yourself i shall as fervently and sincerely pray as i assure you of my great friendship and respect thomas jefferson aug  0    monticello john minor to john minor j mss monticello aug  0    dear sir —i have at length found the paper of which you requested a copy it was written near  0 years ago for the use of a young friend whose course of reading was confided to me and it formed a basis for the studies of others subsequently placed under my direction but curtailed for each in proportion to his previous acquirements and future views i shall give it to you without change except as to the books recommended to be read later publications enabling me in some of the departments of science to substitute better for the less perfect publications which we then possessed in this the modern student has great advantage i proceed to the copy  so for the paper which i send you not for its merit for it betrays sufficiently its juvenile date     but because you have asked it your own experience in the more modern practice of the law will enable you to give it more conformity with the present course and i know you will receive it kindly with all its imperfections as an evidence of my great respect for your wishes and of the sentiments of esteem and friendship of which i tender you sincere assurances     thomas jefferson sep      monticello john wayles eppes to john wayles eppes j mss monticello sep      dear sir —i am sorry to learn by franciss letter that you are not yet recovered from your rheumatism and much wonder you do not go and pass a     summer at the warm springs from the examples i have seen i should entertain no doubt of a radical cure the transactions at washington and alexandria are indeed beyond expectation the circumjacent country is mostly disaffected but i should have thought the motions of the enemy long enough     known and their object probable enough to have called the well affected counties of virginia  maryland into place nobody who knows the president can doubt but that he has honestly done everything     he could to the best of his judgment and there is no sounder judgment than his i cannot account for what has happened but by giving credit to the rumors which circulate against armstrong who is presumptuous obstinate  injudicious i should hope the law would lay hold of sims c if it could lay hold of anything after the experiment on burr but congress itself can punish alexandria by repealing the law which made it a town by discontinuing it as a port of entry or clearance and perhaps by suppressing its banks but i expect all will go off with impunity if our government ever fails it will be from this weakness no government can be maintained     without the principle of fear as well as of duty good men will obey the last but bad ones the former only our county is a desert none are to be met in the roads but grayheads about  00 men are gone from it  chiefly volunteers but i fear they cannot be armed i think the truth must now be obvious that our people are too happy at home to enter into regular service and that we cannot be defended but by making every citizen a souldier as the greeks  romans who had no standing armies  that in doing this all must be marshalled classed by their ages  every service ascribed to its competent class ever affectionately yours     thomas jefferson september         monticello samuel h smith to samuel h smith j mss monticello september         dear sir —i learn from the newspapers that the vandalism of our enemy has triumphed at washington over science as well as the arts by the destruction of the public library with the noble edifice in which it was deposited of this transaction as of that of copenhagen the world will entertain but one sentiment they will see a nation suddenly withdrawn from a great war full armed and full handed taking advantage of another whom they had recently forced into it unarmed and unprepared to indulge themselves in acts of barbarism which do not belong to a civilized age when van ghent destroyed their shipping at chatham and de ruyter rode triumphantly up the thames he might in like manner by the acknowledgment of their own historians have forced all their ships up to london bridge and there have burnt them the tower and city had these examples been then set london when thus menaced was near a thousand years old washington is but in its teens i presume it will be among the early objects of congress to recommence their collection this will be difficult while the war continues and intercourse with europe is attended with so much risk you know my collection its condition and extent i have been fifty years making it and have spared no pains opportunity or expense to make it what it is while residing in paris i devoted every afternoon i was disengaged for a summer or two in examining all the principal bookstores turning over every book     with my own hand and putting by everything which related to america and indeed whatever was rare and valuable in every science besides this i had standing orders during the whole time i was in europe on its principal bookmarts particularly amsterdam frankfort madrid and london for such works relating to america as could not be found in paris so that in that department particularly such a collection was made as probably can never again be effected because it is hardly probable that the same opportunities the same time industry perseverance and expense with some knowledge of the bibliography of the subject would again happen to be in concurrence during the same period and after my return to america i was led to procure also whatever related to the duties of those in the high concerns of the nation so that the collection which i suppose is of between nine and ten thousand volumes while it includes what is chiefly valuable in science and literature generally extends more particularly to whatever belongs to the american statesman in the diplomatic and parliamentary branches it is particularly full it is long since i have been sensible it ought not to continue private property and had provided that at my death congress should have the refusal of it at their own price but the loss they have now incurred makes the present the proper moment for their accommodation without regard to the small remnant of time and the barren use of my enjoying it i ask of your friendship therefore to make for me the tender of it to the library committee of congress not knowing     myself of whom the committee consists i enclose you the catalogue which will enable them to judge of its contents nearly the whole are well bound abundance of them elegantly and of the choicest editions existing they may be valued by persons named by themselves and the payment made convenient to the public it may be for instance in such annual instalments as the law of congress has left at their disposal or in stock of any of their late loans or of any loan they may institute at this session so as to spare the present calls of our country and await its days of peace and prosperity they may enter nevertheless into immediate use of it as eighteen or twenty wagons would place it in washington in a single trip of a fortnight i should be willing indeed to retain a few of the books to amuse the time i have yet to pass which might be valued with the rest but not included in the sum of valuation until they should be restored at my death which i would carefully provide for so that the whole library as it stands in the catalogue at this moment should be theirs without any garbling those i should like to retain would be chiefly classical and mathematical some few in other branches and particularly one of the five encyclopedias in the catalogue but this if not acceptable would not be urged i must add that i have not revised the library since i came home to live so that it is probable some of the books may be missing except in the chapters of law and divinity which have been revised and stand exactly as in the catalogue the return of the catalogue will of course be needed whether the tender be accepted   0 or not i do not know that it contains any branch of science which congress would wish to exclude from their collection there is in fact no subject to which a member of congress may not have occasion to refer but such a wish would not correspond with my views of preventing its dismemberment my desire is either to place it in their hands entire or to preserve it so here i am engaged in making an alphabetical index of the authors names to be annexed to the catalogue which i will forward to you as soon as completed any agreement you shall be so good as to take the trouble of entering into with the committee i hereby confirm accept the assurance of my great esteem and respect thomas jefferson sep       monticello james monroe to james monroe j mss monticello sep       dear sir —the events which have lately taken place at washington  which truly disgrace our enemies much more than us have occupied you too much to admit intrusions by private  useless letters you seem indeed to have had your hands full with the duties of the field and the double duties of the cabinet the success of mcdonough has been happily timed to dispel the gloom of your present meeting and to open the present session of congress with hope and good humor to add however to our embarrassments it happens to be the moment when the general bankruptcy comes upon us which has been so long and so certainly impending the banks declare they will not pay their bills which is sufficiently understood to mean that they cannot altho     this truth has been long expected yet their own declaration was wanting to fix the moment of insolvency their paper is now offered doubtingly received by some merely from the total absence of all other medium of payment and absolutely rejected by others and in no case will a halfdisme of cash be given in change the annihilation of these institutions has come on us suddenly therefore which i had thought should be suppressed but gradatim only in order to prevent as much as possible the crush of private fortunes this catastrophe happening just as our legislature was about to meet a member of it requested my thoughts on the occasion these i have expressed in the inclosed letter and as it forms a sequel to those i had lent you before i send it for your perusal altho i am not willing they should be handed about promiscuously to friend and foe yet if the communication of them to particular and confidential characters can do any good i should leave that to your discretion and only ask their return as soon as that shall have been done having learnt by the public papers the loss of the library of congress i have sent my catalogue to s h smith with an offer of the whole collection as it stands to the library committee to be valued by persons named by themselves delivered immediately and paid for in such stock or otherwise  at such epoch as they may chuse after the days of peace  prosperity shall have returned you know the general condition of the books  can give them information should they ask any i salute you always with sincere affection  respect     thomas jefferson october         monticello james madison to james madison j mss monticello october         dear sir —i thank you for the information of your letter of the  0th it gives at length a fixed character to our prospects the war undertaken on both sides to settle the questions of impressment and the orders of council now that these are done away by events is declared by great britain to have changed its object and to have become a war of conquest to be waged until she conquers from us our fisheries the province of maine the lakes states and territories north of the ohio and the navigation of the mississippi in other words till she reduces us to unconditional submission on our part then we ought to propose as a counterchange of object the establishment of the meridian of the mouth of the sorel northwardly as the western boundary of all her possessions two measures will enable us to effect it and without these we cannot even defend ourselves   to organize the militia into classes assigning to each class the duties for which it is fitted which had it been done when proposed years ago would have prevented all our misfortunes abolishing by a declaratory law the doubts which abstract scruples in some and cowardice and treachery in others have conjured up about passing imaginary lines and limiting at the same time their services to the contiguous provinces of the enemy the  d is the ways and means you have seen my ideas on this subject and i shall add nothing but a rectification of what either i have ill expressed or you have misapprehended if i have used any expression     restraining the emissions of treasury notes to a sufficient medium as your letter seems to imply i have done it inadvertently and under the impression then possessing me that the war would be very short a sufficient medium would not on the principles of any writer exceed thirty millions of dollars and on those of some not ten millions our experience has proved it may be run up to two or three hundred millions without more than doubling what would be the prices of things under a sufficient medium or say a metallic one which would always keep itself at the sufficient point and if they rise to this term and the descent from it be gradual it would not produce sensible revolutions in private fortunes i shall be able to explain my views more definitely by the use of numbers suppose we require to carry on the war an annual loan of twenty millions then i propose that in the first year you shall lay a tax of two millions and emit twenty millions of treasury notes of a size proper for circulation and bearing no interest to the redemption of which the proceeds of that tax shall be inviolably pledged and applied by recalling annually their amount of the identical bills funded on them the second year lay another tax of two millions and emit twenty millions more the third year the same and so on until you have reached the maximum of taxes which ought to be imposed let me suppose this maximum to be one dollar a head or ten millions of dollars merely as an exemplification more familiar than would be the algebraical symbols x or y you would reach this in five years the sixth year then still emit twenty     millions of treasury notes and continue all the taxes two years longer the seventh year twenty millions more and continue the whole taxes another two years and so on observe that although you emit twenty millions of dollars a year you call in ten millions and consequently add but ten millions annually to the circulation it would be in thirty years then primâ facie that you would reach the present circulation of three hundred millions or the ultimate term to which we might adventure but observe also that in that time we shall have become thirty millions of people to whom three hundred millions of dollars would be no more than one hundred millions to us now which sum would probably not have raised prices more than fifty per cent on what may be deemed the standard or metallic prices this increased population and consumption while it would be increasing the proceeds of the redemption tax and lessening the balance annually thrown into circulation would also absorb without saturation more of the surplus medium and enable us to push the same process to a much higher term to one which we might safely call indefinite because extending so far beyond the limits either in time or expense of any supposable war all we should have to do would be when the war should be ended to leave the gradual extinction of these notes to the operation of the taxes pledged for their redemption not to suffer a dollar of paper to be emitted either by public or private authority but let the metallic medium flow back into the channels of circulation and occupy them until another war should oblige us     to recur for its support to the same resource and the same process on the circulating medium the citizens of a country like ours will never have unemployed capital too many enterprises are open offering high profits to permit them to lend their capitals on a regular and moderate interest they are too enterprising and sanguine themselves not to believe they can do better with it i never did believe you could have gone beyond a first or a second loan not from a want of confidence in the public faith which is perfectly sound but from a want of disposable funds in individuals the circulating fund is the only one we can ever command with certainty it is sufficient for all our wants and the impossibility of even defending the country without its aid as a borrowing fund renders it indispensable that the nation should take and keep it in their own hands as their exclusive resource i have trespassed on your time so far for explanation only i will do it no further than by adding the assurances of my affectionate and respectful attachment years emissions taxes  redemptions bal in circulation at end of year       0 millions   millions    millions

by classing our militia and assigning each class to the description of duties for which it is fit it is nonsense to talk of regulars they are not to be had among a people so easy and happy at home as ours we     might as well rely on calling down an army of angels from heaven i trust it is now seen that the refusal to class the militia when proposed years ago is the real source of all our misfortunes in this war the other great and indispensable object is to enter on such a system of finance as can be permanently pursued to any length of time whatever let us be allured by no projects of banks public or private or ephemeral expedients which enabling us to gasp and flounder a little longer only increase by protracting the agonies of death perceiving in a letter from the president that either i had ill expressed my ideas on a particular part of this subject in the letters i sent you or he had misapprehended them i wrote him yesterday an explanation and as you have thought the other letters worth a perusal and a communication to the secretary of the treasury i enclose you a copy of this lest i should be misunderstood by others also only be so good as to return me the whole when done with as i have no other copies since writing the letter now enclosed i have seen the report of the committee of finance proposing taxes to the amount of twenty millions this is a dashing proposition but if congress pass it i shall consider it sufficient evidence that their constituents generally can pay the tax no man has greater confidence than i have in the spirit of the people to a rational extent whatever they can they will but without either market or medium i know not how it is to be done all markets abroad and all at home are shut to us so that we have been     feeding our horses on wheat before the day of collection banknotes will be but as oak leaves and of specie there is not within all the united states onehalf of the proposed amount of the taxes i had thought myself as bold as was safe in contemplating as possible an annual taxation of ten millions as a fund for emissions of treasury notes and when further emissions should be necessary that it would be better to enlarge the time than the tax for redemption our position with respect to our enemy and our markets distinguishes us from all other nations inasmuch as a state of war with us annihilates in an instant all our surplus produce that on which we depended for many comforts of life this renders peculiarly expedient the throwing a part of the burdens of war on times of peace and commerce still however my hope is that others see resources which in my abstraction from the world are unseen by me that there will be both market and medium to meet these taxes and that there are circumstances which render it wiser to levy twenty millions at once on the people than to obtain the same sum on a tenth of the tax i enclose you a letter of colonel james lewis now of tennessee who wishes to be appointed indian agent and i do it lest he should have relied solely on this channel of communication you know him better than i do as he was long your agent i have always believed him an honest man and very goodhumored and accommodating of his other qualifications for the office you are the best judge believe me to be ever affectionately yours     thomas jefferson oct       monticello joseph milligan to joseph milligan j mss monticello oct       dear sir —your letters of sep     oct    have been duly received the packet of books will probably come on by the next stage by the present one i send to the care of mr gray of fredericksburg a packet of   vols which though made up of   different works i wish to have bound as one work in   vols to be labelled on the back the book of kings the  st   d vols will be composed of the memoirs of bareuth the binding to remain as it is only changing the label the memoirs of made la motte will make the  d   th vols pared down to the size of the first  bound uniform with them mrs clarkes will be the  th vol pared  bound as before and the book will make the  th which to be uniform in size with the rest must perhaps be left with its present rough edges pray do it immediately and return it by the stage that they may be replaced on the shelves should congress take my library the proposition for which is before them i mentioned to you the work on political economy by tracy which had been translated by genl duane but could not be printed by him i then wrote  offered it to mr ritchie from whom i had not received an answer when you were here and i consulted you as to the allowance which ought to be made by ritchie to duane ritchie declines printing it and i now inclose you a copy of my letter to him which i will pray you to consider as now addressed to yourself but to be returned to me as i have no other copy i shall be very glad if you will   0 undertake the printing it and i think it the best work ever written on the subject and that you might count on a great sale of it to the members of congress answer me as soon as you can if you please because i have not yet answered duanes letter the moment you say you will undertake it  specify the allowance for translating i will have the mss brought on i will correct the translation here and forward it to you sheet by sheet when congress return my catalogue i will send that also to you to be printed accept assurances of my esteem  respect thomas jefferson dec      monticello alexander dallas to alexander dallas j mss monticello dec      dear sir —i tender my sincere congratulations on the occasion of your counsel and services being engaged for the public and trust they will feel their benefit the department to which you are called is the most arduous now in our government and is that on which every other depends for its motion were our commerce open no degree of contribution would be felt but shut up as it is the call on the people for taxes is truly a call for bricks without straw in this state especially where we are feeding our horses with wheat as the cheapest forage  0 cents being its price thro the middle country on the adoption of the land tax of the last year an office of assessor was established in every district with power to determine what every land owner should pay by his own judgment  without appeal     this important power could not fail to interest us highly in the choice of the person vested with it on a consultation with most of the principal persons in our quarter there was but one opinion as to the fittest man in our district all agreed that in the hands of a mr peter minor they would be safe his ability his judgment  independence being a sufficient security i took the liberty therefore of writing to the president and to mr campbell recommending this appointment we were told soon after that it had been given to a mr armstead of a neighboring county this was given out by himself and mr garland formerly a member of congress whose protege armstead is the assumption of the land tax by the state prevented further interest in the case we now learn he had not the appointment and is now going on for it if there be a better man than minor we wish his appointment but as to mr armstead all agree he is the weakest  laziest man that could be found some believe him honest others very openly deny it of his character however i have nothing personally stating what i do from the information of others colo monroe i think knows minor personally  the president knows his family its standing  character he is nephew to genl minor of fredericksburg the collector being of this county albemarle the principle of distribution might be supposed to require the assessor from a different one this principle may weigh between candidates of equal merit but it cannot make the worse the better man nor remedy the evils of an incorrect agent the importance of this appointment     towards a just apportionment of the public burthens  one which will probably be permanent will i hope excuse my expressing to the government my own sense of it and that of the most respectable persons of our quarter with an assurance nevertheless of our entire confidence that whatever appointment the government shall make will be founded in the best motives and i avail myself of this occasion of assuring you of my great esteem  respect thomas jefferson january        monticello james monroe to james monroe j mss monticello january        dear sir —your letters of november the  0th and december the   st have been received with great pleasure a truth now and then projecting into the ocean of newspaper lies serves like headlands to correct our course indeed my scepticism as to everything i see in a newspaper makes me indifferent whether i ever see one the embarrassments at washington in august last i expected would be great in any state of things but they proved greater than expected i never doubted that the plans of the president were wise and sufficient their failure we all impute   to the insubordinate temper of armstrong and   to the indecision of winder however it ends well it mortifies ourselves and so may check perhaps the silly boasting spirit of our newspapers and it enlists the feelings of the world on our side and the advantage of public opinion is like that of the weathergauge in a naval action in europe the transient possession of our capital can     be no disgrace nearly every capital there was in possession of its enemy some often and long but diabolical as they paint that enemy he burnt neither public edifices nor private dwellings it was reserved for england to show that bonaparte in atrocity was an infant to their ministers and their generals they are taking his place in the eyes of europe and have turned into our channel all its good will this will be worth the million of dollars the repairs of their conflagration will cost us i hope that to preserve this weathergauge of public opinion and to counteract the slanders and falsehoods disseminated by the english papers the government will make it a standing instruction to their ministers at foreign courts to keep europe truly informed of occurrences here by publishing in their papers the naked truth always whether favorable or unfavorable for they will believe the good if we candidly tell them the bad also but you have two more serious causes of uneasiness the want of men and money for the former nothing more wise or efficient could have been imagined than what you proposed it would have filled our ranks with regulars and that too by throwing a just share of the burthen on the purses of those whose persons are exempt either by age or office and it would have rendered our militia like those of the greeks and romans a nation of warriors but the goby seems to have been given to your proposition and longer sufferance is necessary to force us to what is best we seem equally incorrigible to our financial course although a century of british     experience has proved to what a wonderful extent the funding on specific redeeming taxes enables a nation to anticipate in war the resources of peace and although the other nations of europe have tried and trodden every path of force or folly in fruitless quest of the same object yet we still expect to find in juggling tricks and banking dreams that money can be made out of nothing and in sufficient quantity to meet the expenses of a heavy war by sea and land it is said indeed that money cannot be borrowed from our merchants as from those of england but it can be borrowed from our people they will give you all the necessaries of war they produce if instead of the bankrupt trash they now are obliged to receive for want of any other you will give them a paper promise funded on a specific pledge and of a size for common circulation but you say the merchants will not take this paper what the people take the merchants must take or sell nothing all these doubts and fears prove only the extent of the dominion which the banking institutions have obtained over the minds of our citizens and especially of those inhabiting cities or other banking places and this dominion must be broken or it will break us but here as in the other case we must make up our minds to suffer yet longer before we can get right the misfortune is that in the meantime we shall plunge ourselves in unextinguishable debt and entail on our posterity an inheritance of eternal taxes which will bring our government and people into the condition of those of england a nation of pikes and gudgeons the latter bred merely as food     for the former but however these difficulties of men and money may be disposed of it is fortunate that neither of them will affect our war by sea privateers will find their own men and money let nothing be spared to encourage them they are the dagger which strikes at the heart of the enemy their commerce frigates and seventyfours are a sacrifice we must make heavy as it is to the prejudices of a part of our citizens they have indeed rendered a great moral service which has delighted me as much as any one in the united states but they have had no physical effect sensible to the enemy and now while we must fortify them in our harbors and keep armies to defend them our privateers are bearding and blockading the enemy in their own seaports encourage them to burn all their prizes and let the public pay for them they will cheat us enormously no matter they will make the merchants of england feel and squeal and cry out for peace i much regretted your acceptance of the war department not that i know a person who i think would better conduct it but conduct it ever so wisely it will be a sacrifice of yourself were an angel from heaven to undertake that office all our miscarriages would be ascribed to him raw troops no troops insubordinate militia want of arms want of money want of provisions all will be charged to want of management in you i speak from experience when i was governor of virginia without a regular in the state and scarcely a musket to put into the hands of the militia invaded by two armies     arnolds from the seaboard and cornwallis from the southward when we were driven from richmond and charlottesville and every member of my council fled from their homes it was not the total destitution of means but the mismanagement of them which in the querulous voice of the public caused all our misfortunes it ended indeed in the capture of the whole hostile force but not till means were brought us by general washingtons army and the french fleet and army and although the legislature who were personally intimate with both the means and measures acquitted me with justice and thanks yet general lee has put all those imputations among the romances of his historical novel for the amusement of credulous and uninquisitive readers not that i have seen the least disposition to censure you on the contrary your conduct on the attack of washington has met the praises of every one and your plan for regulars and militia their approbation but no campaign is as yet opened no generals have yet an interest in shifting their own incompetence on you no army agents their rogueries i sincerely pray you may never meet censure where you will deserve most praise and that your own happiness and prosperity may be the result of your patriotic services ever and affectionately yours thomas jefferson jan      monticello joseph c cabell to joseph c cabell j mss monticello jan      dear sir —your favor of dec    with the letter inclosed has been received knowing well that the     bankmania still possesses the great body of our countrymen it was not expected that any radical cure of that could be at once effected we must go further wrong probably to a ne plus ultra before we shall be forced into what is right something will be obtained however if we can excite in those who think doubt first reflexion next and conviction at last the constitution too presents difficulties here with which the general government is not embarrassed if your auditors notes are made payable to bearer and of sizes suitable for circulation they will find their way into circulation as well as into the hoards of the thrifty especially in important payments for land c which are to lie on hand some time waiting for employment a banknote is now received only as a robins alive on mr ritchies declining the publication of tracys work i proposed it to a mr milligan of georgetown who undertakes it i had therefore written to genl duane to forward it to him so that it will not be in my possession until it is published have you seen the review of montesquieu by an anonymous author the ablest work of the age it was translated and published by duane about   years ago in giving the most correct analysis of the principles of political association which has yet been offered he states in the branch of political economy particularly altho much is brief some of the soundest and most profound views we have ever had on those subjects i have lately received a letter from say he has in contemplation to remove to this country and to this neighborhood particularly     and asks from me answers to some enquiries he makes could the petition which the albemarle academy addressed to our legislature have succeeded at the late session a little aid additional to the objects of that would have enabled us to have here immediately the best seminary of the us i do not know to whom p carr president of the board of trustees committed the petition and papers but i have seen no trace of their having been offered thinking it possible you may not have seen them i send for your perusal the copies i retained for my own use they consist   of a letter to him sketching at the request of the trustees a plan for the institution   one to judge cooper in answer to some observations he had favored me with on the plan   a copy of the petition of the trustees   a copy of the act we wished from the legislature they are long but as we always counted on you as the main pillar of their support and we shall probably return to the charge at the next session the trouble of reading them will come upon you and as well now as then the lottery allowed by the former act the proceeds of our two glebes and our dividend of the literary fund with the reorganization of the institution are what was asked in that petition in addition to this if we could obtain a loan for   or   years only of   or  000 d i think i have it now in my power to obtain three of the ablest characters in the world to fill the higher professorships of what in the plan is called the iid or general grade of education three such characters as are not in a single university of europe and for those     of languages  mathematics a part of the same grade able professors doubtless could also be readily obtained with these characters i should not be afraid to say that the circle of the sciences composing that  d or general grade would be more profoundly taught here than in any institution in the us and might i go farther the  st or elementary grade of education is not developed in this plan an authority only being asked to its visitors for putting into motion a former proposition for that object for an explanation of this therefore i am obliged to add to these papers a letter i wrote some time since to mr adams in which i had occasion to give some account of what had been proposed here for culling from every condition of our people the natural aristocracy of talents  virtue and of preparing it by education at the public expence for the care of the public concerns this letter will present to you some measures still requisite to compleat  secure our republican edifice and which remain in charge for our younger statesmen on yourself mr rives mr gilmer when they shall enter the public councils i rest my hopes for this great accomplishment and doubtless you will have other able coadjutors not known to me colo randolph having gone to richmond before the rising of the legislature you will have had an opportunity of explaining to him personally the part of your letter respecting his petition for opening the milton falls which his departure prevented my communicating to him i had not heard him speak of it and had been glad as to myself by the act   0 recently passed to have saved our own rights in the defensive war with the rivanna company and should not have advised the renewing and carrying the war into the enemys country be so good as to return all the inclosed papers after perusal and to accept assurances of my great esteem  respect thomas jefferson february         monticello william h crawford to william h crawford minister to france j mss monticello february         dear sir —i have to thank you for your letter of june   th it presents those special views of the state of things in europe for which we look in vain into newspapers they tell us only of the downfall of bonaparte but nothing of the temper the views the secret workings of the high agents in these transactions although we neither expected nor wished any act of friendship from bonaparte and always detested him as a tyrant yet he gave employment to much of the force of the nation who was our common enemy so far his downfall was illy timed for us it gave to england an opportunity to turn fullhanded on us when we were unprepared no matter we can beat her on our own soil leaving the laws of the ocean to be settled by the maritime powers of europe who are equally oppressed and insulted by the usurpations of england on that element our particular and separate grievance is only the impressment of our citizens we must sacrifice the last dollar and drop of blood to rid us of that     badge of slavery and it must rest with england alone to say whether it is worth eternal war for eternal it must be if she holds to the wrong she will probably find that the six thousand citizens she took from us by impressment have already cost her ten thousand guineas a man and will cost her in addition the half of that annually during the continuance of the war besides the captures on the ocean and the loss of our commerce she might certainly find cheaper means of manning her fleet or if to be manned at this expense her fleet will break her down the first year of our warfare by land was disastrous detroit queenstown frenchtown and beaver dam witness that but the second was generally successful and the third entirely so both by sea and land for i set down the coup de main at washington as more disgraceful to england than to us the victories of the last year at chippewa niagara fort erie plattsburg and new orleans the capture of their two fleets on lakes erie and champlain and repeated triumphs of our frigates over hers whenever engaging with equal force show that we have officers now becoming prominent and capable of making them feel the superiority of our means in a war on our own soil our means are abundant both as to men and money wanting only skilful arrangement and experience alone brings skill as to men nothing wiser can be devised than what the secretary at war monroe proposed in his report at the commencement of congress it would have kept our regular army always of necessity full and by classing our militia according     to ages would have put them into a form ready for whatever service distant or at home should require them congress have not adopted it but their next experiment will lead to it our financial system is at least arranged the fatal possession of the whole circulating medium by our banks the excess of those institutions and their present discredit cause all our difficulties treasury notes of small as well as high denomination bottomed on a tax which would redeem them in ten years would place at our disposal the whole circulating medium of the united states a fund of credit sufficient to carry us through any probable length of war a small issue of such paper is now commencing it will immediately supersede the bank paper nobody receiving that now but for the purposes of the day and never in payments which are to lie by for any time in fact all the banks having declared they will not give cash in exchange for their own notes these circulate merely because there is no other medium of exchange as soon as the treasury notes get into circulation the others will cease to hold any competition with them i trust that another year will confirm this experiment and restore this fund to the public who ought never more to permit its being filched from them by private speculators and disorganizers of the circulation do they send you from washington the historical register of the united states it is published there annually and gives a succinct and judicious history of the events of the war not too long to be inserted in the european newspapers and would keep the     european public truly informed by correcting the lying statements of the british papers it gives too all the public documents of any value niles weekly register is also an excellent repository of facts and documents and has the advantage of coming out weekly whereas the other is yearly this will be handed you by mr ticknor a young gentleman of boston of high education and great promise after going through his studies here he goes to europe to finish them and to see what is to be seen there he brought me high recommendations from mr adams and others and from a stay of some days with me i was persuaded he merited them as he will whatever attentions you will be so good as to show him i pray you to accept the assurance of my great esteem and respect p s february   th on the day of the date of this letter the news of peace reached washington and this place two days after i am glad of it although no provision being made against the impressment of our seamen it is in fact but an armistice to be terminated by the first act of impressment committed on an american citizen it may be thought that useless blood was spilt at new orleans after the treaty of peace had been actually signed and ratified i think it had many valuable uses it proved the fidelity of the orleanese to the united states it proved that new orleans can be defended both by land and water that the western country will fly to its relief of which ourselves had doubted before that our militia are heroes when they have     heroes to lead them on and that when unembarrassed by field evolutions which they do not understand their skill in the firearm and deadly aim give them great advantages over regulars what nonsense for the manakin prince regent to talk of their conquest of the country east of the penobscot river then as in the revolutionary war their conquests were never more than of the spot on which their army stood never extended beyond the range of their cannon shot if england is now wise or just enough to settle peaceably the question of impressment the late treaty may become one of peace and of long peace we owe to their past follies and wrongs the incalculable advantage of being made independent of them for every material manufacture these have taken such root in our private families especially that nothing now can ever extirpate them thomas jefferson february         monticello marquis de lafayette to the marquis de lafayette j mss monticello february         my dear friend —your letter of august the   th has been received and read again and again with extraordinary pleasure it is the first glimpse which has been furnished me of the interior workings of the late unexpected but fortunate revolution of your country the newspapers told us only that the great beast was fallen but what part in this the patriots acted and what the egotists whether the former slept while the latter were awake to their own interests only the hireling scribblers of the english     press said little and knew less i see now the mortifying alternative under which the patriot there is placed of being either silent or disgraced by an association in opposition with the remains of bonapartism a full measure of liberty is not now perhaps to be expected by your nation nor am i confident they are prepared to preserve it more than a generation will be requisite under the administration of reasonable laws favoring the progress of knowledge in the general mass of the people and their habituation to an independent security of person and property before they will be capable of estimating the value of freedom and the necessity of a sacred adherence to the principles on which it rests for preservation instead of that liberty which takes root and growth in the progress of reason if recovered by mere force or accident it becomes with an unprepared people a tyranny still of the many the few or the one possibly you may remember at the date of the jue de paume how earnestly i urged yourself and the patriots of my acquaintance to enter then into a compact with the king securing freedom of religion freedom of the press trial by jury habeas corpus and a national legislature all of which it was known he would then yield to go home and let these work on the amelioration of the condition of the people until they should have rendered them capable of more when occasions would not fail to arise for communicating to them more this was as much as i then thought them able to bear soberly and usefully for themselves you thought otherwise and that the dose might     still be larger and i found you were right for subsequent events proved they were equal to the constitution of      unfortunately some of the most honest and enlightened of our patriotic friends but closet politicians merely unpractised in the knowledge of man thought more could still be obtained and borne they did not weigh the hazards of a transition from one form of government to another the value of what they had already rescued from those hazards and might hold in security if they pleased nor the imprudence of giving up the certainty of such a degree of liberty under a limited monarchy for the uncertainty of a little more under the form of a republic you differed from them you were for stopping there and for securing the constitution which the national assembly had obtained here too you were right and from this fatal error of the republicans from their separation from yourself and the constitutionalists in their councils flowed all the subsequent sufferings and crimes of the french nation the hazards of a second change fell upon them by the way the foreigner gained time to anarchise by gold the government he could not overthrow by arms to crush in their own councils the genuine republicans by the fraternal embraces of exaggerated and hired pretenders and to turn the machine of jacobinism from the change to the destruction of order and in the end the limited monarchy they had secured was exchanged for the unprincipled and bloody tyranny of robespierre and the equally unprincipled and maniac tyranny of bonaparte you are now rid of     him and i sincerely wish you may continue so but this may depend on the wisdom and moderation of the restored dynasty it is for them now to read a lesson in the fatal errors of the republicans to be contented with a certain portion of power secured by formal compact with the nation rather than grasping at more hazard all upon uncertainty and risk meeting the fate of their predecessor or a renewal of their own exile we are just informed too of an example which merits if true their most profound contemplation the gazettes say that ferdinand of spain is dethroned and his father reestablished on the basis of their new constitution this order of magistrates must therefore see that although the attempts at reformation have not succeeded in their whole length and some secession from the ultimate point has taken place yet that men have by no means fallen back to their former passiveness but on the contrary that a sense of their rights and a restlessness to obtain them remain deeply impressed on every mind and if not quieted by reasonable relaxations of power will break out like a volcano on the first occasion and overwhelm everything again in its way i always thought the present king an honest and moderate man and having no issue he is under a motive the less for yielding to personal considerations i cannot therefore but hope that the patriots in and out of your legislature acting in phalanx but temperately and wisely pressing unremittingly the principles omitted in the late capitulation of the king and watching the occasions which the course of events will create may     get those principles engrafted into it and sanctioned by the solemnity of a national act with us the affairs of war have taken the most favorable turn which was to be expected our thirty years of peace had taken off or superannuated all our revolutionary officers of experience and grade and our first draught in the lottery of untried characters had been most unfortunate the delivery of the fort and army of detroit by the traitor hull the disgrace at queenstown under van rensellaer the massacre at frenchtown under winchester and surrender of boerstler in an open field to onethird of his own numbers were the inauspicious beginnings of the first year of our warfare the second witnessed but the single miscarriage occasioned by the disagreement of wilkinson and hampton mentioned in my letter to you of november the  0th      while it gave us the capture of york by dearborne and pike the capture of fort george by dearborne also the capture of proctors army on the thames by harrison shelby and johnson and that of the whole british fleet on lake erie by perry the third year has been a continued series of victories towit of brown and scott at chippewa of the same at niagara of gaines over drummond at fort erie that of brown over drummond at the same place the capture of another fleet on lake champlain by mdonough the entire defeat of their army under prevost on the same day by mcomb and recently their defeats at new orleans by jackson coffee and carroll with the loss of four thousand men out of nine thousand and six hundred     with their two generals packingham and gibbs killed and a third keane wounded mortally as is said this series of successes has been tarnished only by the conflagration at washington a coup de main differing from that at richmond which you remember in the revolutionary war in the circumstance only that we had in that case but fortyeight hours notice that an enemy had arrived within our capes whereas at washington there was abundant previous notice the force designated by the president was double of what was necessary but failed as is the general opinion through the insubordination of armstrong who would never believe the attack intended until it was actually made and the sluggishness of winder before the occasion and his indecision during it still in the end the transaction has helped rather than hurt us by arousing the general indignation of our country and by marking to the world of europe the vandalism and brutal character of the english government it has merely served to immortalize their infamy and add further that through the whole period of the war we have beaten them singlehanded at sea and so thoroughly established our superiority over them with equal force that they retire from that kind of contest and never suffer their frigates to cruize singly the endymion would never have engaged the frigate president but knowing herself backed by three frigates and a razee who though somewhat slower sailers would get up before she could be taken the disclosure to the world of the fatal secret that they can be beaten at   0 sea with an equal force the evidence furnished by the military operations of the last year that experience is rearing us officers who when our means shall be fully under way will plant our standard on the walls of quebec and halifax their recent and signal disaster at new orleans and the evaporation of their hopes from the hartford convention will probably raise a clamor in the british nation which will force their ministry into peace i say force them because willingly they would never be at peace the british ministers find in a state of war rather than of peace by riding the various contractors and receiving douceurs on the vast expenditures of the war supplies that they recruit their broken fortunes or make new ones and therefore will not make peace as long as by any delusions they can keep the temper of the nation up to the war point they found some hopes on the state of our finances it is true that the excess of our banking institutions and their present discredit have shut us out from the best source of credit we could ever command with certainty but the foundations of credit still remain to us and need but skill which experience will soon produce to marshal them into an order which may carry us through any length of war but they have hoped more in their hartford convention their fears of republican france being now done away they are directed to republican america and they are playing the same game for disorganization here which they played in your country the marats the dantons and robespierres of massachusetts are in the same pay under the same orders and making     the same efforts to anarchise us that their prototypes in france did there i do not say that all who met at hartford were under the same motives of money nor were those of france some of them are outs and wish to be inns some the mere dupes of the agitators or of their own party passions while the maratists alone are in the real secret but they have very different materials to work on the yeomanry of the united states are not the canaille of paris we might safely give them leave to go through the united states recruiting their ranks and i am satisfied they could not raise one single regiment gambling merchants and silkstocking clerks excepted who would support them in any effort to separate from the union the cement of this union is in the heartblood of every american i do not believe there is on earth a government established on so immovable a basis let them in any state even in massachusetts itself raise the standard of separation and its citizens will rise in mass and do justice themselves on their own incendiaries if they could have induced the government to some effort of suppression or even to enter into discussion with them it would have given them some importance have brought them into some notice but they have not been able to make themselves even a subject of conversation either of public or private societies a silent contempt has been the sole notice they excite consoled indeed some of them by the palpable favors of philip have then no fears for us my friend the grounds of these exist only in english newspapers endited or endowed     by the castlereaghs or the cannings or some other such models of pure and uncorrupted virtue their military heroes by land and sea may sink our oyster boats rob our hen roosts burn our negro huts and run off but a campaign or two more will relieve them from further trouble or expense in defending their american possessions you once gave me a copy of the journal of your campaign in virginia in      which i must have lent to some one of the undertakers to write the history of the revolutionary war and forgot to reclaim i conclude this because it is no longer among my papers which i have very diligently searched for it but in vain an author of real ability is now writing that part of the history of virginia he does it in my neighborhood and i lay open to him all my papers but i possess none nor has he any which can enable him to do justice to your faithful and able services in that campaign if you could be so good as to send me another copy by the very first vessel bound to any port in the united states it might be here in time for although he expects to begin to print within a month or two yet you know the delays of these undertakings at any rate it might be got in as a supplement the old count rochambeau gave me also his memoire of the operations at york which is gone in the same way and i have no means of applying to his family for it perhaps you could render them as well as us the service of procuring another copy i learn with real sorrow the deaths of monsieur and madame de tessé they made an interesting     part in the idle reveries in which i have sometimes indulged myself of seeing all my friends of paris once more for a month or two a thing impossible which however i never permitted myself to despair of the regrets however of seventythree at the loss of friends may be the less as the time is shorter within which we are to meet again according to the creed of our education this letter will be handed you by mr ticknor a young gentleman of boston of great erudition indefatigable industry and preparation for a life of distinction in his own country he passed a few days with me here brought high recommendations from mr adams and others and appeared in every respect to merit them he is well worthy of those attentions which you so kindly bestow on our countrymen and for those he may receive i shall join him in acknowledging personal obligations i salute you with assurances of my constant and affectionate friendship and respect p s february   th my letter had not yet been sealed when i received news of our peace i am glad of it and especially that we closed our war with the eclat of the action at new orleans but i consider it as an armistice only because no security is provided against the impressment of our seamen while this is unsettled we are in hostility of mind with england although actual deeds of arms may be suspended by a truce if she thinks the exercise of this outrage is worth eternal war eternal war it must be or extermination of the one or the other     party the first act of impressment she commits on an american will be answered by reprisal or by a declaration of war here and the interval must be merely a state of preparation for it in this we have much to do in further fortifying our seaport towns providing military stores classing and disciplining our militia arranging our financial system and above all pushing our domestic manufactures which have taken such root as never again can be shaken once more god bless you thomas jefferson march         monticello james madison to james madison j mss monticello march         dear sir —i duly received your favor of the   th and with it the pamphlet on the causes and conduct of the war which i now return i have read it with great pleasure but with irresistible desire that it should be published the reasons in favor of this are strong and those against it are so easily gotten over that there appears to me no balance between them   we need it in europe they have totally mistaken our character accustomed to rise at a feather themselves and to be always fighting they will see in our conduct fairly stated that acquiescence under wrong to a certain degree is wisdom and not pusillanimity and that peace and happiness are preferable to that false honor which by eternal wars keeps their people in eternal labor want and wretchedness   it is necessary for the people of england who have been deceived as to the causes and conduct of the war and do not entertain a doubt     that it was entirely wanton and wicked on our part and under the order of bonaparte by rectifying their ideas it will tend to that conciliation which is absolutely necessary to the peace and prosperity of both nations   it is necessary for our own people who although they have known the details as they went along yet have been so plied with false facts and false views by the federalists that some impression has been left that all has not been right it may be said that it will be thought unfriendly but truths necessary for our own character must not be suppressed out of tenderness to its calumniators although written generally with great moderation there may be some things in the pamphlet which may perhaps irritate the characterizing every act for example by its appropriate epithet is not necessary to show its deformity to an intelligent reader the naked narrative will present it truly to his mind and the more strongly from its moderation as he will perceive that no exaggeration is aimed at rubbing down these roughnesses and they are neither many nor prominent and preserving the original date might i think remove all the offensiveness and give more effect to the publication indeed i think that a soothing postcript addressed to the interests the prospects and the sober reason of both nations would make it acceptable to both the trifling expense of reprinting it ought not to be considered a moment mr gallatin could have it translated into french and suffer it to get abroad in europe without either avowal or disavowal but it would be useful to print some copies of an appendix     containing all the documents referred to to be preserved in libraries and to facilitate to the present and future writers of history the acquisition of the materials which test the truth it contains i sincerely congratulate you on the peace and more especially on the eclat with which the war was closed the affair of new orleans was fraught with useful lessons to ourselves our enemies and our friends and will powerfully influence our future relations with the nations of europe it will show them we mean to take no part in their wars and count no odds when engaged in our own i presume that having spared to the pride of england her formal acknowledgment of the atrocity of impressment in an article of the treaty she will concur in a convention for relinquishing it without this she must understand that the present is but a truce determinable on the first act of impressment of an american citizen committed by any officer of hers would it not be better that this convention should be a separate act unconnected with any treaty of commerce and made an indispensable preliminary to all other treaty if blended with a treaty of commerce she will make it the price of injurious concessions indeed we are infinitely better without such treaties with any nation we cannot too distinctly detach ourselves from the european system which is essentially belligerent nor too sedulously cultivate an american system essentially pacific but if we go into commercial treaties at all they should be with all at the same time with whom we have important commercial relations france spain portugal     holland denmark sweden russia all should proceed pari passu our ministers marching in phalanx on the same line and intercommunicating freely each will be supported by the weight of the whole mass and the facility with which the other nations will agree to equal terms of intercourse will discountenance the selfish higglings of england or justify our rejection of them perhaps with all of them it would be best to have but the single article gentis amicissimæ leaving everything else to the usages and courtesies of civilized nations but all these things will occur to yourself with their counterconsideration mr smith wrote to me on the transportation of the library and particularly that it is submitted to your direction he mentioned also that dougherty would be engaged to superintend it no one will more carefully and faithfully execute all those duties which would belong to a wagon master but it requires a character acquainted with books to receive the library i am now employing as many hours of every day as my strength will permit in arranging the books and putting every one in its place on the shelves corresponding with its order on the catalogue and shall have them numbered correspondently this operation will employ me a considerable time yet then i should wish a competent agent to attend and with the catalogue in his hand see that every book is on the shelves and have their lids nailed on one by one as he proceeds this would take such a person about two days after which doughertys business would be the mere     mechanical removal at convenience i enclose you a letter from mr milligan offering his service which would not cost more than eight or ten days reasonable compensation this is necessary for my safety and your satisfaction as a just caution for the public you know that there are persons both in and out of the public councils who will seize every occasion of imputation on either of us the more difficult to be repelled in this case in which a negative could not be proved if you approve of it therefore as soon as i am through the review i will give notice to mr milligan or any other person you will name to come on immediately indeed it would be well worth while to add to his duty that of covering the books with a little paper the good bindings at least and filling the vacancies of the presses with paper parings to be brought from washington this would add little more to the time as he could carry on both operations at once accept the assurance of my constant and affectionate friendship and respect thomas jefferson apr         monticello alexander j dallas to alexander j dallas secretary of the treasury j mss monticello apr         dear sir —your favor of feb    was received in due time i thought it a duty to spare you the trouble of reading an useless answer and have therefore delayed acknoleging it until now not having revised the library for many years i expected that books would be missing without being able to conjecture     how many and that in that case a deduction should be made for the deficient volumes i have gone through a rigorous review of them and find indeed some missing which were in the catalogue on which the estimate and price has been made but that considerably more both in number and value had been omitted by oversight in copying that catalogue from the original one which was done two years ago i have not thought it right to withdraw these from the library so that the whole delivered exceeds on the principles of the estimate the sum appropriated and of course there is no ground for any deduction the books being now all ready for delivery and their removal actually commenced i may with propriety now receive the payment entirely unacquainted as i am with the forms established at the treasury for the security of the public i must only say what i wish and so far as it may be inconsistent with the necessary forms you will have the goodness to correct me and inform me what is necessary if my convenience can be so far consulted i would request payments to be made  dollars  to william short of philadelphia of  0 00 in bills of such of the specified denominations  places of paiment as they shall chuse to john barnes of georgetown of    0  to myself    0 to be inclosed to me by mail      0  in    notes of  00 d each and    of  0 d each payable in richmond for which last sum i inclose my receipt and i forward to mr short and mr   0 barnes orders on the treasurer for the sums to be paid them for which they will give acquittals should these papers be deficient in form i will at a moments warning send on any others in whatever form shall be necessary should it be requisite that the whole should be payable at one and the same place then washington would be the most convenient for the whole as i wait only the completion of the delivery of all the books to set out on a journey of considerable absence and urgency it would be a great favor to me if the sum which i ask to be remitted to myself could be sent by as early a mail as the convenience of the treasury will admit i pray you to accept my friendly and respectful salutations thomas jefferson may        monticello david barrow to david barrow j mss monticello may        sir —i have duly received your favor of march  0th and am truly thankful for the favorable sentiments expressed in it towards myself if in the course of my life it has been in any degree useful to the cause of humanity the fact itself bears its full reward the particular subject of the pamphlet you enclosed me was one of early and tender consideration with me and had i continued in the councils of my own state it should never have been out of sight the only practicable plan i could ever devise is stated under the   th quaere of the notes on virginia and it is still the one most sound in my judgment unhappily it is a case for which both parties require long and difficult preparation the mind of     the master is to be apprized by reflection and strengthened by the energies of conscience against the obstacles of self interest to an acquiescence in the rights of others that of the slave is to be prepared by instruction and habit for self government and for the honest pursuits of industry and social duty both of these courses of preparation require time and the former must precede the latter some progress is sensibly made in it yet not so much as i had hoped and expected but it will yield in time to temperate and steady pursuit to the enlargement of the human mind and its advancement in science we are not in a world ungoverned by the laws and the power of a superior agent our efforts are in his hand and directed by it and he will give them their effect in his own time where the disease is most deeply seated there it will be slowest in eradication in the northern states it was merely superficial and easily corrected in the southern it is incorporated with the whole system and requires time patience and perseverance in the curative process that it may finally be effected and its progress hastened will be the last and fondest prayer of him who now salutes you with respect and consideration thomas jefferson june         monticello w h torrance to w h torrance j mss monticello june         sir —i received a few days ago your favor of may  th stating a question on a law of the state of georgia which suspends judgments for a limited time and asking my opinion whether it may be valid under the     inhibition of our constitution to pass laws impairing the obligations of contracts it is more than forty years since i have quitted the practice of the law and been engaged in vocations which furnished little occasion of preserving a familiarity with that science i am far therefore from being qualified to decide on the problems it presents and certainly not disposed to obtrude in a case where gentlemen have been consulted of the first qualifications and of actual and daily familiarity with the subject especially too in a question on the law of another state we have in this state a law resembling in some degree that you quote suspending executions until a year after the treaty of peace but no question under it has been raised before the courts it is also i believe expected that when this shall expire in consideration of the absolute impossibility of procuring coin to satisfy judgments a law will be passed similar to that passed in england on suspending the cash payments of their bank that provided that on refusal by a party to receive notes of the bank of england in any case either of past or future contracts the judgment should be suspended during the continuance of that act bearing however legal interest they seemed to consider that it was not this law which changed the conditions of the contract but the circumstances which had arisen and had rendered its literal execution impossible by the disappearance of the metallic medium stipulated by the contract that the parties not concurring in a reasonable and just accommodation it became the duty of the legislature to arbitrate between them and     that less restrained than the duke of venice by the letter of decree they were free to adjudge to shylock a reasonable equivalent and i believe that in our states this umpirage of the legislatures has been generally interposed in cases where a literal execution of contract has by a change of circumstances become impossible or if enforced would produce a disproportion between the subject of the contract and its price which the parties did not contemplate at the time of the contract the second question whether the judges are invested with exclusive authority to decide on the constitutionality of a law has been heretofore a subject of consideration with me in the exercise of official duties certainly there is not a word in the constitution which has given that power to them more than to the executive or legislative branches questions of property of character and of crime being ascribed to the judges through a definite course of legal proceeding laws involving such questions belong of course to them and as they decide on them ultimately and without appeal they of course decide for themselves the constitutional validity of the law or laws again prescribing executive action and to be administered by that branch ultimately and without appeal the executive must decide for themselves also whether under the constitution they are valid or not so also as to laws governing the proceedings of the legislature that body must judge for itself the constitutionality of the law and equally without appeal or control from its coordinate branches and in general that branch which is to     act ultimately and without appeal on any law is the rightful expositor of the validity of the law uncontrolled by the opinions of the other coordinate authorities it may be said that contradictory decisions may arise in such case and produce inconvenience this is possible and is a necessary failing in all human proceedings yet the prudence of the public functionaries and authority of public opinion will generally produce accommodation such an instance of difference occurred between the judges of england in the time of lord holt and the house of commons but the prudence of those bodies prevented inconvenience from it so in the cases of duane and of william smith of south carolina whose characters of citizenship stood precisely on the same ground the judges in a question of meum and tuum which came before them decided that duane was not a citizen and in a question of membership the house of representatives under the same words of the same provision adjudged william smith to be a citizen yet no inconvenience has ensued from these contradictory decisions this is what i believe myself to be sound but there is another opinion entertained by some men of such judgment and information as to lessen my confidence in my own that is that the legislature alone is the exclusive expounder of the sense of the constitution in every part of it whatever and they allege in its support that this branch has authority to impeach and punish a member of either of the others acting contrary to its declaration of the sense of the constitution it may indeed be answered that an act may still be valid     although the party is punished for it right or wrong however this opinion which ascribes exclusive exposition to the legislature merits respect for its safety there being in the body of the nation a control over them which if expressed by rejection on the subsequent exercise of their elective franchise enlists public opinion against their exposition and encourages a judge or executive on a future occasion to adhere to their former opinion between these two doctrines every one has a right to choose and i know of no third meriting any respect i have thus sir frankly without the honor of your acquaintance confided to you my opinion trusting assuredly that no use will be made of it which shall commit me to the contentions of the newspapers from that field of disquietude my age asks exemption and permission to enjoy the privileged tranquility of a private and unmeddling citizen in this confidence accept the assurances of my respect and consideration thomas jefferson june         monticello thomas leiper to thomas leiper j mss monticello june         dear sir —a journey soon after the receipt of your favor of april the   th and an absence from home of some continuance have prevented my earlier acknowledgment of it in that came safely my letter of january the  d      in our principles of government we differ not at all nor in the general object and tenor of political measures we concur     in considering the government of england as totally without morality insolent beyond bearing inflated with vanity and ambition aiming at the exclusive dominion of the sea lost in corruption of deeprooted hatred towards us hostile to liberty wherever it endeavors to show its head and the eternal disturber of the peace of the world in our estimate of bonaparte i suspect we differ i view him as a political engine only and a very wicked one you i believe as both political and religious and obeying as an instrument an unseen hand i still deprecate his becoming sole lord of the continent of europe which he would have been had he reached in triumph the gates of st petersburg the establishment in our day of another roman empire spreading vassalage and depravity over the face of the globe is not i hope within the purposes of heaven nor does the return of bonaparte give me pleasure unmixed i see in his expulsion of the bourbons a valuable lesson to the world as showing that its ancient dynasties may be changed for their misrule should the allied powers presume to dictate a ruler and government to france and follow the example he had set of parcelling and usurping to themselves their neighbor nations i hope he will give them another lesson in vindication of the rights of independence and selfgovernment which himself had heretofore so much abused and that in this contest he will wear down the maritime power of england to limitable and safe dimensions so far good it cannot be denied on the other hand that his successful perversion of the force committed to him for     vindicating the rights and liberties of his country to usurp its government and to enchain it under an hereditary despotism is of baneful effect in encouraging future usurpations and deterring those under oppression from rising to redress themselves his restless spirit leaves no hope of peace to the world and his hatred of us is only a little less than that he bears to england and england to us our form of government is odious to him as a standing contrast between republican and despotic rule and as much from that hatred as from ignorance in political economy he had excluded intercourse between us and his people by prohibiting the only articles they wanted from us that is cotton and tobacco whether the war we have had with england and the achievements of that war and the hope that we may become his instruments and partisans against that enemy may induce him in future to tolerate our commercial intercourse with his people is still to be seen for my part i wish that all nations may recover and retain their independence that those which are overgrown may not advance beyond safe measures of power that a salutary balance may be ever maintained among nations and that our peace commerce and friendship may be sought and cultivated by all it is our business to manufacture for ourselves whatever we can to keep our markets open for what we can spare or want and the less we have to do with the amities or enmities of europe the better not in our day but at no distant one we may shake a rod over the heads of all which may make the stoutest of them tremble but i hope our wisdom will     grow with our power and teach us that the less we use our power the greater it will be the federal misrepresentation of my sentiments which occasioned my former letter to you was gross enough but that and all others are exceeded by the impudence and falsehood of the printed extract you sent me from ralphs paper that a continuance of the embargo for two months longer would have prevented our war that the nonimportation law which succeeded it was a wise and powerful measure i have constantly maintained my friendship for mr madison my confidence in his wisdom and virtue and my approbation of all his measures and especially of his taking up at length the gauntlet against england is known to all with whom i have ever conversed or corresponded on these measures the word federal or its synonym lie may therefore be written under every word of mr ralphs paragraph i have ransacked my memory to recollect any incident which might have given countenance to any particle of it but i find none for if you will except the bringing into power and importance those who were enemies to himself as well as to the principles of republican government i do not recollect a single measure of the president which i have not approved of those under him and of some very near him there have been many acts of which we have all disapproved and he more than we we have at times dissented from the measures and lamented the dilatoriness of congress i recollect an instance the first winter of the war when from sloth of proceedings an embargo was permitted to run     through the winter while the enemy could not cruise nor consequently restrain the exportation of our whole produce and was taken off in the spring as soon as they could resume their stations but this procrastination is unavoidable how can expedition be expected from a body which we have saddled with an hundred lawyers whose trade is talking but lies to sow division among us is so stale an artifice of the federal prints and are so well understood that they need neither contradiction nor explanation as to myself my confidence in the wisdom and integrity of the administration is so entire that i scarcely notice what is passing and have almost ceased to read newspapers mine remain in our post office a week or ten days sometimes unasked for i find more amusement in studies to which i was always more attached and from which i was dragged by the events of the times in which i have happened to live i rejoice exceedingly that our war with england was singlehanded in that of the revolution we had france spain and holland on our side and the credit of its success was given to them on the late occasion unprepared and unexpecting war we were compelled to declare it and to receive the attack of england just issuing from a general war fully armed and freed from all other enemies and have not only made her sick of it but glad to prevent by peace the capture of her adjacent possessions which one or two campaigns more would infallibly have made ours she has found that we can do her more injury than any other enemy on earth and henceforward will better estimate the value of our peace but   0 whether her government has power in opposition to the aristocracy of her navy to restrain their piracies within the limits of national rights may well be doubted i pray therefore for peace as best for all the world best for us and best for me who have already lived to see three wars and now pant for nothing more than to be permitted to depart in peace that you also who have longer to live may continue to enjoy this blessing with health and prosperity through as long a life as you desire is the prayer of yours affectionately p s june the   th—before i had sent my letter to the post office i received the new treaty of the allied powers declaring that the french nation shall not have bonaparte and shall have louis xviii for their ruler they are all then as great rascals as bonaparte himself while he was in the wrong i wished him exactly as much success as would answer our purposes and no more now that they are wrong and he in the right he shall have all my prayers for success and that he may dethrone every man of them thomas jefferson aug      monticello phillip mazzei to phillip mazzei j mss monticello aug      my dear friend —your letter of sep    came inclosed to me in one of octob  0 from mr warden which did not get to my hands until the   th of the last month how the present answer will get to you i do not yet know but i shall confide it to the     secretary of state to be forwarded with his despatches either to paris or leghorn my letter of dc       stated to you the circumstances both here and abroad which rendered a remittance of the price of your lots impracticable the money might have been invested in the government loans but the principal would then have been payable only at the end of a long term of years it might have been vested in the stock of some of our banks but besides their daily fluctuations in value the banks had indulged themselves in such extravagant emissions of their paper notes that it was obvious they must be on the verge of bankruptcy and accordingly within a very few months every bank in the us stopt the payment of cash for their own notes have never since resumed it and everyone is satisfied they never can pay them so that with all the indulgencies of time which has been given them their insolvency is notorious there remained then only the resource of placing it on interest in private hands this the circumstances of the country rendered impracticable but in the usual way of repaiments by annual instalments we were then under the blockade of the enemy and an embargo of our own the sale of produce was as absolutely null as you remember it in the revolutionary war and the prospect of peace thought to be distant under these difficulties therefore i really thought it safest for you to retain the price in my own hands stating at the same time in my letter of dec       that the sum being considerable its repayment would require a delay of one or two years from the time you     should give notice that you preferred placing it there rather than here the distressing injury which every individual sustained during the war by the entire loss of the produce of their farms for want of a market the expences of the war and great advance of price on all foreign articles have left us in so exhausted a state that immediate paiments are known to be impossible i am sorry therefore my dear friend that the remittances must of necessity be delayed so much beyond your wish and that you must make up your account to receive one moiety only the next year and the other the year after according to the former advice this you may count on and if bills on london will be negociable with you that mode will be without difficulty through paris it would not be so easy we are ignorant with which of these powers you now have either peace or war our commissioners in london are endeavouring by a convention with england to put an end to their impressment of our seamen if they succeed it is probable we may continue in peace all things here are going on quietly except that we are in a great crisis as to our circulating medium a parcel of mushroom banks have set up in every state have filled the country with their notes and have thereby banished all our specie a twelvemonth ago they all declared they could not pay cash for their own notes and notwithstanding this act of bankruptcy this trash has of necessity been passing among us because we have no other medium of exchange and is still taken and passed from hand to hand as you     remember the old continental money to have been in the revolutionary war every one getting rid of it as quickly as he can by laying it out in property of any sort at double treble and manifold higher prices it was this which procured the extravagant price for your lots and in this paper the payment was made a general crush is daily expected when this trash will be lost in the hands of the holders this will take place the moment some specie returns among us or so soon as the government will issue bills of circulation the little they have issued is greatly sought after and a premium given for them which is rising fast in europe you are all at war again no man more severely condemned bonaparte than myself during his former career for his unprincipled enterprises on the liberty of his own country and the independence of others but the allies having now taken up his pursuits and he arrayed himself on the legitimate side i also am changed as to him he is now fighting for the independance of nations of which his whole life hitherto had been a continued violation and he has now my prayers as sincerely for success as he had before for his overthrow he has promised a free government to his own country and to respect the rights of others and altho his former conduct does not inspire entire faith in his promises yet we had better take the chance of his word for doing right than the certainty of the wrong which his adversaries avow my health continues firm and i am sorry to learn that yours is not good but your prudence and temperance may yet give you many years and     that they may be years of health and happiness is the sincere prayer of yours ever affectionately thomas jefferson august  0      monticello john adams to john adams j mss monticello august  0      dear sir —the simultaneous movements in our correspondence have been remarkable on several occasions it would seem as if the state of the air or state of the times or some other unknown cause produced a sympathetic effect on our mutual recollections i had sat down to answer your letters of june the   th  0th and   d with pen ink and paper before me when i received from our mail that of july the  0th you ask information on the subject of camus all i recollect of him is that he was one of the deputies sent to arrest dumourier at the head of his army who were however themselves arrested by dumourier and long detained as prisoners i presume therefore he was a jacobin you will find his character in the most excellent revolutionary history of toulongeon i believe also he may be the same person who has given us a translation of aristotles natural history from the greek into french of his report to the national institute on the subject of the bollandists your letter gives me the first information i had supposed them defunct with the society of jesuits of which they were and that their works although above ground were from their bulk and insignificance as effectually entombed on their shelves as if in the graves of their authors fiftytwo volumes in folio of the acta     sanctorum in doglatin would be a formidable enterprise to the most laborious german i expect with you they are the most enormous mass of lies frauds hypocrisy and imposture that was ever heaped together on this globe by what chemical process m camus supposed that an extract of truth could be obtained from such a farrago of falsehood i must leave to the chemists and moralists of the age to divine on the subject of the history of the american revolution you ask who shall write it who can write it and who will ever be able to write it nobody except merely its external facts all its councils designs and discussions having been conducted by congress with closed doors and no members as far as i know having even made notes of them these which are the life and soul of history must forever be unknown botta as you observe has put his own speculations and reasonings into the mouths of persons whom he names but who you and i know never made such speeches in this he has followed the example of the ancients who made their great men deliver long speeches all of them in the same style and in that of the author himself the work is nevertheless a good one more judicious more chaste more classical and more true than the party diatribe of marshall its greatest fault is in having taken too much from him i possessed the work and often recurred to considerable portions of it although i never read it through but a very judicious and wellinformed neighbor of mine went through it with great attention and spoke very     highly of it i have said that no member of the old congress as far as i knew made notes of the discussion i did not know of the speeches you mention of dickinson and witherspoon but on the questions of independence and on the two articles of confederation respecting taxes and votings i took minutes of the heads of the arguments on the first i threw all into one mass without ascribing to the speakers their respective arguments pretty much in the manner of humes summary digests of the reasonings in parliament for and against a measure on the last i stated the heads of the arguments used by each speaker but the whole of my notes on the question of independence does not occupy more than five pages such as of this letter and on the other questions two such sheets they have never been communicated to any one do you know that there exists in manuscript the ablest work of this kind ever yet executed of the debates of the constitutional convention of philadelphia in      the whole of everything said and done there was taken down by mr madison with a labor and exactness beyond comprehension i presume that our correspondence has been observed at the post offices and thus has attracted notice would you believe that a printer has had the effrontery to propose to me the letting him publish it these people think they have a right to everything however secret or sacred i had not before heard of the boston pamphlet with priestleys letters and mine at length bonaparte has got on the right side of     a question from the time of his entering the legislative hall to his retreat to elba no man has execrated him more than myself i will not except even the members of the essex junto although for very different reasons i because he was warring against the liberty of his own country and independence of others they because he was the enemy of england the pope and the inquisition but at length and as far as we can judge he seems to have become the choice of his nation at least he is defending the cause of his nation and that of all mankind the rights of every people to independence and selfgovernment he and the allies have now changed sides they are parcelling out among themselves poland belgium saxony italy dictating a ruler and government to france and looking askance at our republic the splendid libel on their governments and he is fighting for the principles of national independence of which his whole life hitherto has been a continued violation he has promised a free government to his own country and to respect the rights of others and although his former conduct inspires little confidence in his promises yet we had better take the chance of his word for doing right than the certainty of the wrong which his adversaries are doing and avowing if they succeed ours is only the boon of the cyclops to ulysses of being the last devoured present me affectionately and respectfully to mrs adams and heaven give you both as much more of life as you wish and bless it with health and happiness     p s august the   th—i had finished my letter yesterday and this morning receive the news of bonapartes second abdication very well for him personally i have no feeling but reprobation the representatives of the nation have deposed him they have taken the allies at their word that they had no object in the war but his removal the nation is now free to give itself a good government either with or without a bourbon and france unsubdued will still be a bridle on the enterprises of the combined powers and a bulwark to others thomas jefferson october         monticello spencer roane to spencer roane j mss monticello october         dear sir —i received in a letter from colonel monroe the enclosed paper communicated as he said with your permission and even with a wish to know my sentiments on the important question it discusses it is now more than forty years since i have ceased to be habitually conversant with legal questions and my pursuits through that period have seldom required or permitted a renewal of my former familiarity with them my ideas at present therefore on such questions have no claim to respect but such as might be yielded to the common auditors of a law argument i well knew that in certain federal cases the laws of the united states had given to a foreign party whether plaintiff or defendant a right to carry his cause into the federal court but i did not know that where he had himself elected the state judicature     he could after an unfavorable decision there remove his case to the federal court and thus take the benefit of two chances where others have but one nor that the right of entertaining the question in this case had been exercised or claimed by the federal judiciary after it had been postponed on the partys first election his failure too to place on the record the particular ground which might give jurisdiction to the federal court appears to me an additional objection of great weight the question is of the first importance the removal of it seems to be out of the analogies which guide the two governments on their separate tracts and claims the solemn attention of both judicatures and of the nation itself i should fear to make up a final opinion on it until i could see as able a development of the grounds of the federal claim as that which i have now read against it i confess myself unable to foresee what those grounds would be the paper enclosed must call them forth and silence them too unless they are beyond my ken i am glad therefore that the claim is arrested and made the subject of special and mature deliberation i hope our courts will never countenance the sweeping pretensions which have been set up under the words general defence and public welfare these words only express the motives which induced the convention to give to the ordinary legislature certain specified powers which they enumerate and which they thought might be trusted to the ordinary legislature and not to give them the unspecified also or why any specification they could not be so awkward in language as to mean as   0 we say all and some and should this construction prevail all limits to the federal government are done away this opinion formed on the first rise of the question i have never seen reason to change whether in or out of power but on the contrary find it strengthened and confirmed by five and twenty years of additional reflection and experience and any countenance given to it by any regular organ of the government i should consider more ominous than anything which has yet occurred i am sensible how much these slight observations on a question which you have so profoundly considered need apology they must find this in my zeal for the administration of our government according to its true spirit federal as well as republican and in my respect for any wish which you might be supposed to entertain for opinions of so little value i salute you with sincere and high respect and esteem thomas jefferson oct       monticello dr benjamin waterhouse to dr benjamin waterhouse j mss monticello oct       dear sir —i was highly gratified with the receipt of your letter of sep   by genl and mrs dearborne and by the evidence it furnished me of your bearing up with firmness and perseverance against the persecutions of your enemies religious political and professional these last i suppose have not yet forgiven you the introduction of vaccination and annihilation of the great variolous field of profit to them and none of them pardon the proof you have established that the condition of man may be     meliorated if not infinitely as enthusiasm alone pretends yet indefinitely as bigots alone can doubt in lieu of these enmities you have the blessings of all the friends of human happiness for this great peril from which they are rescued i have read with pleasure the orations of mr holmes  mr austin from the former we always expect what is good and the latter has by this specimen taught us to expect the same in future from him both have set the valuable example of quitting the beaten ground of the revolutionary war and making the present state of things the subject of annual animadversion and instruction a copious one it will be and highly useful if properly improved cobbets address would of itself have mortified and humbled the cossac priests but brother jonathan has pointed his arrow to the hearts of the worst of them these reverend leaders of the hartford nation it seems then are now falling together about religion of which they have not one real principle in their hearts like bawds religion becomes to them a refuge from the despair of their loathsome vices they seek in it only an oblivion of the disgrace with which they have loaded themselves in their political ravings and of their mortification at the ridiculous issue of their hartford convention no event more than this has shewn the placid character of our constitution under any other their treasons would have been punished by the halter we let them live as laughing stocks for the world and punish them by the torment of eternal contempt the emigrations you mention from the eastern states are what     i have long counted on the religious  political tyranny of those in power with you cannot fail to drive the oppressed to milder associations of men where freedom of mind is allowed in fact as well as in pretence the subject of their present clawings and caterwaulings is not without its interest to rational men the priests have so disfigured the simple religion of jesus that no one who reads the sophistications they have engrafted on it from the jargon of plato of aristotle  other mystics would conceive these could have been fathered on the sublime preacher of the sermon on the mount yet knowing the importance of names they have assumed that of christians while they are mere platonists or any thing rather than disciples of jesus one of these parties beginning now to strip off these meretricious trappings their followers may take courage to make thorough work and restore to us the figure in its original simplicity and beauty the effects of this squabble therefore whether religious or political cannot fail to be good in some way the visit to monticello of which you hold up an idea would be a favor indeed of the first order i know however the obstacles of age  distance and should therefore set due value on its vicarious execution should business or curiosity lead a son of yours to visit this sodom and gomorrah of parsons osgood parish  gardiner accept my wishes for your health and happiness and the assurance of my great esteem  respect     thomas jefferson january        monticello colonel charles yancey to colonel charles yancey j mss monticello january        dear sir —i am favored with yours of december   th and perceive you have many matters before you of great moment i have no fear but that the legislature will do on all of them what is wise and just on the particular subject of our river in the navigation of which our county has so great an interest i think the power of permitting dams to be erected across it ought to be taken from the courts so far as the stream has water enough for navigation the value of our property is sensibly lessened by the dam which the court of fluvana authorized not long since to be erected but a little above its mouth this power over the value and convenience of our lands is of much too high a character to be placed at the will of a county court and that of a county too which has not a common interest in the preservation of the navigation for those above them as to the existing dams if any conditions are proposed more than those to which they were subjected on their original erection i think they would be allowed the alternative of opening a sluice for the passage of navigation so as to put the river into as good a condition for navigation as it was before the erection of their dam or as it would be if their dam were away those interested in the navigation might then use the sluices or make locks as should be thought best nature and reason as well as all our constitutions condemn retrospective conditions as mere acts of power against right i recommend to your patronage our central college     i look to it as a germ from which a great tree may spread itself there is before the assembly a petition of a captain miller which i have at heart because i have great esteem for the petitioner as an honest and useful man he is about to settle in our county and to establish a brewery in which art i think him as skilful a man as has ever come to america i wish to see this beverage become common instead of the whiskey which kills onethird of our citizens and ruins their families he is staying with me until he can fix himself and i should be thankful for information from time to time of the progress of his petition like a dropsical man calling out for water water our deluded citizens are clamoring for more banks more banks the american mind is now in that state of fever which the world has so often seen in the history of other nations we are under the bank bubble as england was under the south sea bubble france under the mississippi bubble and as every nation is liable to be under whatever bubble design or delusion may puff up in moments when off their guard we are now taught to believe that legerdemain tricks upon paper can produce as solid wealth as hard labor in the earth it is vain for common sense to urge that nothing can produce nothing that it is an idle dream to believe in a philosophers stone which is to turn everything into gold and to redeem man from the original sentence of his maker in the sweat of his brow shall he eat his bread not quixot enough however to attempt to reason     bedlam to rights my anxieties are turned to the most practicable means of withdrawing us from the ruin into which we have run two hundred millions of paper in the hands of the people and less cannot be from the employment of a banking capital known to exceed one hundred millions is a fearful tax to fall at haphazard on their heads the debt which purchased our independence was but of eighty millions of which twenty years of taxation had in   0  paid but the one half and what have we purchased with this tax of two hundred millions which we are to pay by wholesale but usury swindling and new forms of demoralization revolutionary history has warned us of the probable moment when this baseless trash is to receive its fiat whenever so much of the precious metals shall have returned into the circulation as that everyone can get some in exchange for his produce paper as in the revolutionary war it will experience at once an universal rejection when public opinion changes it is with the rapidity of thought confidence is already on the totter and every one now handles this paper as if playing at robins alive that in the present state of the circulation the bank should resume payments in specie would require their vaults to be like the widows cruse the thing to be aimed at is that the excesses of their emissions should be withdrawn as gradually but as speedily too as is practicable without so much alarm as to bring on the crisis dreaded some banks are said to be calling in their paper but ought we to let this depend on their discretion is it not the duty of the legislature to     avert from their constituents such a catastrophe as the extinguishment of two hundred millions of paper in their hands the difficulty is indeed great and the greater because the patient revolts against all medicine i am far from presuming to say that any plan can be relied on with certainty because the bubble may burst from one moment to another but if it fails we shall be but where we should have been without any effort to save ourselves different persons doubtless will devise different schemes of relief one would be to suppress instantly the currency of all paper not issued under the authority of our state or of the general government to interdict after a few months the circulation of all bills of five dollars and under after a few months more all of ten dollars and under after other terms those of twenty fifty and so on to one hundred dollars which last if any must be left in circulation should be the lowest denomination these might be a convenience in mercantile transactions and transmissions and would be excluded by their size from ordinary circulation but the disease may be too pressing to await such a remedy with the legislature i cheerfully leave it to apply this medicine or no medicine at all i am sure their intentions are faithful and embarked in the same bottom i am willing to swim or sink with my fellow citizens if the latter is their choice i will go down with them without a murmur but my exhortation would rather be not to give up the ship i am a great friend to the improvements of roads canals and schools but i wish i could see some     provision for the former as solid as that of the latter—something better than fog the literary fund is a solid provision unless lost in the impending bankruptcy if the legislature would add to that a perpetual tax of a cent a head on the population of the state it would set agoing at once and forever maintain a system of primary or ward schools and an university where might be taught in its highest degree every branch of science useful in our time and country and it would rescue us from the tax of toryism fanaticism and indifferentism to their own state which we now send our youth to bring from those of new england if a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of civilization it expects what never was and never will be the functionaries of every government have propensities to command at will the liberty and property of their constituents there is no safe deposit for these but with the people themselves nor can they be safe with them without information where the press is free and every man able to read all is safe the frankness of this communication will i am sure suggest to you a discreet use of it i wish to avoid all collisions of opinion with all mankind show it to mr maury with expressions of my great esteem it pretends to convey no more than the opinions of one of your thousand constituents and to claim no more attention than every other of that thousand i will ask you once more to take care of miller and our college and to accept assurance of my esteem and respect     thomas jefferson january        monticello charles thomson to charles thomson j mss monticello january        my dear and ancient friend —an acquaintance of fiftytwo years for i think ours dates from      calls for an interchange of notice now and then that we remain in existence the monuments of another age and examples of a friendship unaffected by the jarring elements by which we have been surrounded of revolutions of government of party and of opinion i am reminded of this duty by the receipt through our friend dr patterson of your synopsis of the four evangelists i had procured it as soon as i saw it advertised and had become familiar with its use but this copy is the more valued as it comes from your hand this work bears the stamp of that accuracy which marks everything from you and will be useful to those who not taking things on trust recur for themselves to the fountain of pure morals i too have made a weelittle book from the same materials which i call the philosophy of jesus it is a paradigma of his doctrines made by cutting the texts out of the book and arranging them on the pages of a blank book in a certain order of time or subject a more beautiful or precious morsel of ethics i have never seen it is a document in proof that i am a real christian that is to say a disciple of the doctrines of jesus very different from the platonists who call me infidel and themselves christians and preachers of the gospel while they draw all their characteristic dogmas from what its author never said nor saw they have compounded from the heathen     mysteries a system beyond the comprehension of man of which the great reformer of the vicious ethics and deism of the jews were he to return on earth would not recognize one feature if i had time i would add to my little book the greek latin and french texts in columns side by side and i wish i could subjoin a translation of gosindis syntagma of the doctrines of epicurus which notwithstanding the calumnies of the stoics and caricatures of cicero is the most rational system remaining of the philosophy of the ancients as frugal of vicious indulgence and fruitful of virtue as the hyperbolical extravagances of his rival sects i retain good health am rather feeble to walk much but ride with ease passing two or three hours a day on horseback and every three or four months taking in a carriage a journey of ninety miles to a distant possession where i pass a good deal of my time my eyes need the aid of glasses by night and with small print in the day also my hearing is not quite so sensible as it used to be no tooth shaking yet but shivering and shrinking in body from the cold we now experience my thermometer having been as low as   ° this morning my greatest oppression is a correspondence afflictingly laborious the extent of which i have been long endeavoring to curtail this keeps me at the drudgery of the writingtable all the prime hours of the day leaving for the gratification of my appetite for reading only what i can steal from the hours of sleep could i reduce this epistolary corvée within the limits of my friends and affairs and give the time redeemed from  00 it to reading and reflection to history ethics mathematics my life would be as happy as the infirmities of age would admit and i should look on its consummation with the composure of one qui summum nec me tuit diem nec optat so much as to myself and i have given you this string of egotisms in the hope of drawing a similar one from yourself i have heard from others that you retain your health a good degree of activity and all the vivacity and cheerfulness of your mind but i wish to learn it more minutely from yourself how has time affected your health and spirits what are your amusements literary and social tell me everything about yourself because all will be interesting to me who retains for you ever the same constant and affectionate friendship and respect thomas jefferson january        monticello benjamin austin to benjamin austin j mss monticello january        dear sir —your favor of december   st has been received and i am first to thank you for the pamphlet it covered the same description of persons which is the subject of that is so much multiplied here too as to be almost a grievance and by their numbers in the public councils have wrested from the public hand the direction of the pruning knife but with us as a body they are republican and mostly moderate in their views so far therefore less objects of jealousy than with you your opinions on the events which have taken place in france are entirely just so far as these events are  0  yet developed but they have not reached their ultimate termination there is still an awful void between the present and what is to be the last chapter of that history and i fear it is to be filled with abominations as frightful as those which have already disgraced it that nation is too highminded has too much innate force intelligence and elasticity to remain under its present compression samson will arise in his strength as of old and as of old will burst asunder the withes and the cords and the webs of the philistines but what are to be the scenes of havoc and horror and how widely they may spread between brethren of the same house our ignorance of the interior feuds and antipathies of the country places beyond our ken it will end neverthless in a representative government in a government in which the will of the people will be an effective ingredient this important element has taken root in the european mind and will have its growth their despots sensible of this are already offering this modification of their governments as if of their own accord instead of the parricide treason of bonaparte in perverting the means confided to him as a republican magistrate to the subversion of that republic and erection of a military despotism for himself and his family had he used it honestly for the establishment and support of a free government in his own country france would now have been in freedom and rest and her example operating in a contrary direction every nation in europe would have had a government over which the will of the people would have had some control his atrocious  0  egotism has checked the salutary progress of principle and deluged it with rivers of blood which are not yet run out to the vast sum of devastation and of human misery of which he has been the guilty cause much is still to be added but the object is fixed in the eye of nations and they will press on to its accomplishment and to the general amelioration of the condition of man what a germ have we planted and how faithfully should we cherish the parent tree at home you tell me i am quoted by those who wish to continue our dependence on england for manufactures there was a time when i might have been so quoted with more candor but within the thirty years which have since elapsed how are circumstances changed we were then in peace our independent place among nations was acknowledged a commerce which offered the raw material in exchange for the same material after receiving the last touch of industry was worthy of welcome to all nations it was expected that those especially to whom manufacturing industry was important would cherish the friendship of such customers by every favor by every inducement and particularly cultivate their peace by every act of justice and friendship under this prospect the question seemed legitimate whether with such an immensity of unimproved land courting the hand of husbandry the industry of agriculture or that of manufactures would add most to the national wealth and the doubt was entertained on this consideration chiefly that to the labor of the husbandman a vast addition  0  is made by the spontaneous energies of the earth on which it is employed for one grain of wheat committed to the earth she renders twenty thirty and even fifty fold whereas to the labor of the manufacturer nothing is added pounds of flax in his hands yield on the contrary but pennyweights of lace this exchange too laborious as it might seem what a field did it promise for the occupations of the ocean what a nursery for that class of citizens who were to exercise and maintain our equal rights on that element this was the state of things in      when the notes on virginia were first printed when the ocean being open to all nations and their common right in it acknowledged and exercised under regulations sanctioned by the assent and usage of all it was thought that the doubt might claim some consideration but who in      could foresee the rapid depravity which was to render the close of that century the disgrace of the history of man who could have imagined that the two most distinguished in the rank of nations for science and civilization would have suddenly descended from that honorable eminence and setting at defiance all those moral laws established by the author of nature between nation and nation as between man and man would cover earth and sea with robberies and piracies merely because strong enough to do it with temporal impunity and that under this disbandment of nations from social order we should have been despoiled of a thousand ships and have thousands of our citizens reduced to algerine slavery yet all this has taken place  0  one of these nations interdicted to our vessels all harbors of the globe without having first proceeded to some one of hers there paid a tribute proportioned to the cargo and obtained her license to proceed to the port of destination the other declared them to be lawful prize if they had touched at the port or been visited by a ship of the enemy nation thus were we completely excluded from the ocean compare this state of things with that of    and say whether an opinion founded in the circumstances of that day can be fairly applied to those of the present we have experienced what we did not then believe that there exists both profligacy and power enough to exclude us from the field of interchange with other nations that to be independent for the comforts of life we must fabricate them ourselves we must now place the manufacturer by the side of the agriculturist the former question is suppressed or rather assumes a new form shall we make our own comforts or go without them at the will of a foreign nation he therefore who is now against domestic manufacture must be for reducing us either to dependence on that foreign nation or to be clothed in skins and to live like wild beasts in dens and caverns i am not one of these experience has taught me that manufactures are now as necessary to our independence as to our comfort and if those who quote me as of a different opinion will keep pace with me in purchasing nothing foreign where an equivalent of domestic fabric can be obtained without regard to difference of price it will not be our fault if we do not soon  0  have a supply at home equal to our demand and wrest that weapon of distress from the hand which has wielded it if it shall be proposed to go beyond our own supply the question of    will then recur will our surplus labor be then most beneficially employed in the culture of the earth or in the fabrications of art we have time yet for consideration before that question will press upon us and the maxim to be applied will depend on the circumstances which shall then exist for in so complicated a science as political economy no one axiom can be laid down as wise and expedient for all times and circumstances and for their contraries inattention to this is what has called for this explanation which reflection would have rendered unnecessary with the candid while nothing will do it with those who use the former opinion only as a stalking horse to cover their disloyal propensities to keep us in eternal vassalage to a foreign and unfriendly people i salute you with assurances of great respect and esteem   0  thomas jefferson jan  0    monticello horatio gates spafford to horatio gates spafford j mss monticello jan  0    dear sir —of the last   months   have been passed at my distant possession to which no letters are carried to me because the crosspost is too circuitous and unsafe to be trusted on my return i find an immense accummulation of them calling for answers  among these your favor of the   th ult in this you request me to examine the ms tract it covered to suggest amendments or alterations give my remarks  opinion of the propriety of the sentiments  0  point out improvements and say whether it should be published now from this undertaking my good sir i must pray you to excuse me in the first place i really have not the time to spare my other occupations are incessant and indispensable within doors and without there is something ever pressing insomuch that i have not a moment to read the papers of the day and if to read anything else it must be in hours stolen from those of sleep in the next place i have made it a point not to meddle with the writings of others it is unpleasant to ones self and generally injurious to the composition reviewed the train in which a man commits his own thoughts to paper has in it generally a certain method and order if this be altered interrupted chequered by the ideas of another the composition becomes a medley of different views on the same subject incoherent  deformed so few are my spare moments that i have not been able even to read it through because the ms is in a handwriting extremely difficult to me and i shall read it with more pleasure and more understanding in print i concur with you in its design and as far as i have penetrated i find the matter good and am sure it will be useful i hope therefore to see it in your next magazine to be followed by many others having the same object you judge truly that i am not afraid of the priests they have tried upon me all their various batteries of pious whining hypocritical canting lying  slandering without being able to give me one moment of pain i have contemplated their  0  order from the magi of the east to the saints of the west and i have found no difference of character but of more or less caution in proportion to their information or ignorance of those on whom their interested duperies were to be plaid off their sway in new england is indeed formidable no mind beyond mediocrity dares there to develope itself if it does they excite against it the public opinion which they command  by little but incessant and teasing persecutions drive it from among them their present emigrations to the western country are real flights from persecution religious  political but the abandonment of the country by those who wish to enjoy freedom of opinion leaves the despotism over the residue more intense more oppressive they are now looking to the flesh pots of the south and aiming at foothold there by their missionary teachers they have lately come forward boldly with their plan to establish a qualified religious instructor over every thousand souls in the us and they seem to consider none as qualified but their own sect thus in virginia they say there are but  0 qualified and that     are still wanting of the full quota all besides the  0 are mere nominal ministers unacquainted with theology now the  0 they allude to are exactly in the string of counties at the western foot of the blue ridge settled originally by irish presbyterians and composing precisely the tory district of the state there indeed is found in full vigor the hypocrisy the despotism and anticivism of the new england qualified religious instructors the country below the  0  mountains inhabited by episcopalians methodists  baptists under mere nominal ministers unacquainted with theology are pronounced destitute of the means of grace and as sitting in darkness and under the shadow of death they are quite in despair too at the insufficient means of new england to fill this fearful void with evangelical light with catechetical instructions weekly lectures  family visiting that yale cannot furnish above  0 graduates annually and harvard perhaps not more that there must therefore be an immediate universal vigorous  systematic effort made to evangelize the nation to see that there is a bible for every family a school for every district and a qualified i e presbyterian pastor for every thousand souls that newspapers tracts magazines must be employed the press be made to groan  every pulpit in the land to sound its trumpet long and loud a more homogeneous ie new england character must be produced thro the nation that section then of our union having lost its political influence by disloyalty to its country is now to recover it under the mask of religion it is to send among us their gardiners their osgoods their parishes  pearsons as apostles to teach us their orthodoxy this is the outline of the plan as published by messrs beecher pearson  co it has uttered however one truth that the nation must be awaked to save itself by its own exertions or we are undone and i trust that this publication will do not a little to awaken it and that in aid of it newspapers tracts and magazines must sound the   0 trumpet yours i hope will make itself heard and the louder as yours is the nearest house in the course of conflagration  i have not sent your tract to the president as you requested fearing that if any further delay be added     to that already incurred it will be too late for your purpose of inserting it in the january magazine from contest of every kind i withdraw myself entirely i have served my hour and a long one it has been tranquility is the object of my remaining years and i leave to more vigorous bodies  minds the service which has rightfully  in succession devolved on them accept the assurances of my great respect and esteem thomas jefferson january         monticello dabney carr to dabney carr j mss monticello january         dear sir —at the date of your letter of december the  st i was in bedford and since my return so many letters accumulated during my absence have been pressing for answers that this is the first moment i have been able to attend to the subject of yours while mr girardin was in this neighborhood writing his continuation of burkes history i had suggested to him a proper notice of the establishment of the committee of correspondence here in      and of mr carr your father who introduced it he has doubtless done this and his work is now in the press my books journals of the times c being all gone i have nothing now but an impaired memory to resort to for the more particular statement you wish but i give it with the more confidence as i find that i remember old things better than new the transaction took place in the session of assembly of march      patrick henry richard henry lee frank lee your father and myself met     by agreement one evening about the close of the session at the raleigh tavern to consult on the measures which the circumstances of the times seemed to call for we agreed in result that concert in the operations of the several colonies was indispensable and that to produce this some channel of correspondence between them must be opened that therefore we would propose to our house the appointment of a committee of correspondence which should be authorized and instructed to write to the speakers of the house of representatives of the several colonies recommending the appointment of similar committees on their part who by a communication of sentiment on the transactions threatening us all might promote a harmony of action salutary to all this was the substance not pretending to remember the words we proposed the resolution and your father was agreed on to make the motion he did it the next day march the   th with great ability reconciling all to it not only by the reasonings but the temper and moderation with which it was developed it was adopted by a very general vote peyton randolph some of us who proposed it and who else i do not remember were appointed of the committee we immediately despatched letters by expresses to the speakers of all the other assemblies i remember that mr carr and myself returning home together and conversing on the subject by the way concurred in the conclusion that that measure must inevitably beget the meeting of a congress of deputies from all the colonies for the purpose of uniting all in the     same principles and measures for the maintenance of our rights my memory cannot deceive me when i affirm that we did it in consequence of no such proposition from any other colony no doubt the resolution itself and the journals of the day will show that ours was original and not merely responsive to one from any other quarter yet i am certain i remember also that a similar proposition and nearly cotemporary was made by massachusetts and that our northern messenger passed theirs on the road this too may be settled by recurrence to the records of massachusetts the proposition was generally acceded to by the other colonies and the first effect as expected was the meeting of a congress at new york the ensuing year the committee of correspondence appointed by massachusetts as quoted by you from marshall under the date of    0 must have been for a special purpose and functus officio before the date of      or massachusetts herself would not then have proposed another records should be examined to settle this accurately i well remember the pleasure expressed in the countenance and conversation of the members generally on this debut of mr carr and the hopes they conceived as well from the talents as the patriotism it manifested but he died within two months after and in him we lost a powerful fellowlaborer his character was of a high order a spotless integrity sound judgment handsome imagination enriched by education and reading quick and clear in his conceptions of correct and ready elocution impressing every hearer with the     sincerity of the heart from which it flowed his firmness was inflexible in whatever he thought was right but when no moral principle stood in the way never had man more of the milk of human kindness of indulgence of softness of pleasantry of conversation and conduct the number of his friends and the warmth of their affection were proofs of his worth and of their estimate of it to give to those now living an idea of the affliction produced by his death in the minds of all who knew him i liken it to that lately felt by themselves on the death of his eldest son peter carr so like him in all his endowments and moral qualities and whose recollection can never recur without a deepdrawn sigh from the bosom of any one who knew him you mention that i showed you an inscription i had proposed for the tomb stone of your father did i leave it in your hands to be copied i ask the question not that i have any such recollection but that i find it no longer in the place of its deposit and think i never took it out but on that occasion ever and affectionately yours thomas jefferson february        monticello james monroe to james monroe j mss monticello february        dear sir —your letter concerning that of general scott is received and his is now returned i am very thankful for these communications from forty years experience of the wretched guesswork of the newspapers of what is not done in open daylight and of their falsehood even as to that i rarely     think them worth reading and almost never worth notice a ray therefore now and then from the fountain of light is like sight restored to the blind it tells me where i am and that to a mariner who has long been without sight of land or sun is a rallying of reckoning which places him at ease the ground you have taken with spain is sound in every part it is the true ground especially as to the south americans when subjects are able to maintain themselves in the field they are then an independent power as to all neutral nations are entitled to their commerce and to protection within their limits every kindness which can be shown the south americans every friendly office and aid within the limits of the law of nations i would extend to them without fearing spain or her swiss auxiliaries for this is but an assertion of our own independence but to join in their war as general scott proposes and to which even some members of congress seem to squint is what we ought not to do as yet on the question of our interest in their independence were that alone a sufficient motive of action much may be said on both sides when they are free they will drive every article of our produce from every market by underselling it and change the condition of our existence forcing us into other habits and pursuits we shall indeed have in exchange some commerce with them but in what i know not for we shall have nothing to offer which they cannot raise cheaper and their separation from spain seals our everlasting peace with her on the other hand so long as they are dependent spain     from her jealousy is our natural enemy and always in either open or secret hostility with us these countries too in war will be a powerful weight in her scale and in peace totally shut to us interest then on the whole would wish their independence and justice makes the wish a duty they have a right to be free and we a right to aid them as a strong man has a right to assist a weak one assailed by a robber or murderer that a war is brewing between us and spain cannot be doubted when that disposition is matured on both sides and open rupture can no longer be deferred then will be the time for our joining the south americans and entering into treaties of alliance with them there will then be but one opinion at home or abroad that we shall be justifiable in choosing to have them with us rather than against us in the meantime they will have organized regular governments and perhaps have formed themselves into one or more confederacies more than one i hope as in single mass they would be a very formidable neighbor the geography of their country seems to indicate three   what is north of the isthmus   what is south of it on the atlantic and   the southern part on the pacific in this form we might be the balancing power a propos of the dispute with spain as to the boundary of louisiana on our acquisition of that country there was found in possession of the family of the late governor messier a most valuable and original ms history of the settlement of louisiana by the french written by bernard de la harpe a principal agent through the whole of it it     commences with the first permanent settlement of      that by de la salle in      having been broken up and continues to      and shows clearly the continual claim of france to the province of texas as far as the rio bravo and to all the waters running into the mississippi and how by the roguery of st denis an agent of crozat the merchant to whom the colony was granted for ten years the settlements of the spaniards at nacadoches adais assinays and natchitoches were fraudulently invited and connived at crozats object was commerce and especially contraband with the spaniards and these posts were settled as convenient smuggling stages on the way to mexico the history bears such marks of authenticity as place it beyond question governor claiborne obtained the ms for us and thinking it too hazardous to risk its loss by the way unless a copy were retained he had a copy taken the original having arrived safe at washington he sent me the copy which i now have is the original still in your office or was it among the papers burnt by the british if lost i will send you my copy if preserved it is my wish to deposit the copy for safe keeping with the philosophical society at philadelphia where it will be safer than on my shelves i do not mean that any part of this letter shall give to yourself the trouble of an answer only desire mr graham to see if the original still exists in your office and to drop me a line saying yea or nay and i shall know what to do indeed the ms ought to be printed and i see a note to my copy which shows it has been in contemplation and that     it was computed to be of twenty sheets at sixteen dollars a sheet for three hundred and twenty copies which would sell at one dollar apiece and reimburse the expense thomas jefferson apr      monticello leroy bayard to leroy and bayard j mss monticello apr      gentlemen —i received by our last mail only your favor of mar    reminding me of a very ancient and very just debt to messrs van staphorsts and which i ought certainly long ago to have replaced to them unasked but engaged constantly in offices of more expence than compensation our means are ever absorbed as soon as received by the needy who press while the indulgent lie over for a moment of greater convenience yet ancient and just as is this debt it presents itself at a moment when i am not prepared to meet it i am a landholder and depend on the income of my farms three years of war  close blackade of the chesapeak compleatly sunk the produce of those three years and the year of peace which has followed has barely met arrearages and taxes commerce and free markets being now restored to us we may count on the future with more certainty i shall be able to pay off one of my bonds torn at the date of a year from this time and one other each year after until the three are discharged i hope that this arrangement will be acceptable to messrs van staphorsts and that their indulgence will not be withdrawn     suddenly and all at once with the forbearance i ask i shall replace their money from annual income which i can spare and be saved the regret of injuriously mutilating my landed property it will give me great pleasure to learn that the measure of kindness hitherto shewn will be filled up by so much further forbearance as will make it in the end as it was in the beginning a salutary accommodation accept the assurances of my great esteem  respect  thomas jefferson april         poplar forest p s dupont de nemours to p s dupont de nemours j mss poplar forest april         i received my dear friend your letter covering the constitution for your equinoctial republics just as i was setting out for this place i brought it with me and have read it with great satisfaction i suppose it well formed for those for whom it was intended and the excellence of every government is its adaptation to the state of those to be governed by it for us it would not do distinguishing between the structure of the government and the moral principles on which you prescribe its administration   0 with the latter we concur cordially with the former we should not we of the united states you know are constitutionally and conscientiously democrats we consider society as one of the natural wants with which man has been created that he has been endowed with faculties and qualities to effect its satisfaction by concurrence of others having the same want that when by the exercise of these faculties he has procured a state of society it is one of his acquisitions which he has a right to regulate and control jointly indeed with all those who have concurred in the procurement whom he cannot exclude from its use or direction more than they him we think experience has proved it safer for the mass of individuals composing the society to reserve to themselves personally the exercise of all rightful powers to which they are competent and to delegate those to which they are not competent to deputies named and removable for unfaithful conduct by themselves immediately hence with us the people by which is meant the mass of individuals composing the society being competent to judge of the facts occurring in ordinary life they have retained the functions of judges of facts under the name of jurors but being unqualified for the management of affairs requiring intelligence above the common level yet competent judges of human character they chose for their management representatives some by themselves immediately others by electors chosen by themselves thus our president is chosen by ourselves directly in practice for we vote for a as elector only on the condition he will     vote for b our representatives by ourselves immediately our senate and judges of law through electors chosen by ourselves and we believe that this proximate choice and power of removal is the best security which experience has sanctioned for ensuring an honest conduct in the functionaries of society your three or four alembications have indeed a seducing appearance we should conceive primâ facie that the last extract would be the pure alcohol of the substance three or four times rectified but in proportion as they are more and more sublimated they are also farther and farther removed from the control of the society and the human character we believe requires in general constant and immediate control to prevent its being biased from right by the seductions of selflove your process produces therefore a structure of government from which the fundamental principle of ours is excluded you first set down as zeros all individuals not having lands which are the greater number in every society of long standing those holding lands are permitted to manage in person the small affairs of their commune or corporation and to elect a deputy for the canton in which election too every ones vote is to be an unit a plurality or a fraction in proportion to his landed possessions the assemblies of cantons then elect for the districts those of districts for circles and those of circles for the national assemblies some of these highest councils too are in a considerable degree selfelected the regency partially the judiciary entirely and some are for life whenever therefore     an esprit de corps or of party gets possession of them which experience shows to be inevitable there are no means of breaking it up for they will never elect but those of their own spirit juries are allowed in criminal cases only i acknowledge myself strong in affection to our own form yet both of us act and think from the same motive we both consider the people as our children and love them with parental affection but you love them as infants whom you are afraid to trust without nurses and i as adults whom i freely leave to selfgovernment and you are right in the case referred to you my criticism being built on a state of society not under your contemplation it is in fact like a critic on homer by the laws of the drama but when we come to the moral principles on which the government is to be administered we come to what is proper for all conditions of society i meet you there in all the benevolence and rectitude of your native character and i love myself always most where i concur most with you liberty truth probity honor are declared to be the four cardinal principles of your society i believe with you that morality compassion generosity are innate elements of the human constitution that there exists a right independent of force that a right to property is founded in our natural wants in the means with which we are endowed to satisfy these wants and the right to what we acquire by those means without violating the similar rights of other sensible beings that no one has a right to obstruct another exercising his faculties innocently for the relief of sensibilities     made a part of his nature that justice is the fundamental law of society that the majority oppressing an individual is guilty of a crime abuses its strength and by acting on the law of the strongest breaks up the foundations of society that action by the citizens in person in affairs within their reach and competence and in all others by representatives chosen immediately and removable by themselves constitutes the essence of a republic that all governments are more or less republican in proportion as this principle enters more or less into their composition and that a government by representation is capable of extension over a greater surface of country than one of any other form these my friend are the essentials in which you and i agree however in our zeal for their maintenance we may be perplexed and divaricate as to the structure of society most likely to secure them in the constitution of spain as proposed by the late cortes there was a principle entirely new to me and not noticed in yours that no person born after that day should ever acquire the rights of citizenship until he could read and write it is impossible sufficiently to estimate the wisdom of this provision of all those which have been thought of for securing fidelity in the administration of the government constant ralliance to the principles of the constitution and progressive amendments with the progressive advances of the human mind or changes in human affairs it is the most effectual enlighten the people generally and tyranny and oppressions of body and mind will vanish like evil spirits at the     dawn of day although i do not with some enthusiasts believe that the human condition will ever advance to such a state of perfection as that there shall no longer be pain or vice in the world yet i believe it susceptible of much improvement and most of all in matters of government and religion and that the diffusion of knowledge among the people is to be the instrument by which it is to be effected the constitution of the cortes had defects enough but when i saw in it this amendatory provision i was satisfied all would come right in time under its salutary operation no people have more need of a similar provision than those for whom you have felt so much interest no mortal wishes them more success than i do but if what i have heard of the ignorance and bigotry of the mass be true i doubt their capacity to understand and to support a free government and fear that their emancipation from the foreign tyranny of spain will result in a military despotism at home palacios may be great others may be great but it is the multitude which possess force and wisdom must yield to that for such a condition of society the constitution you have devised is probably the best imaginable it is certainly calculated to elicit the best talents although perhaps not well guarded against the egoism of its functionaries but that egoism will be light in comparison with the pressure of a military despot and his army of janissaries like solon to the athenians you have given to your columbians not the best possible government but the best they can bear bythebye i wish you had called them the columbian     republics to distinguish them from our american republics theirs would be the most honorable name and they best entitled to it for columbus discovered their continent but never saw ours to them liberty and happiness to you the meed of wisdom and goodness in teaching them how to attain them with the affectionate respect and friendship of thomas jefferson may       monticello dr george logan to dr george logan j mss monticello may       it gives me the greatest pain dear sir to make a serious complaint to you from the letter which i wrote you on the  d of oct      an extract was published with my name in the newspapers conveying a very just but certainly a very harsh censure on bonaparte this produced to me more complaints from my best friends and called for more explanations than any transaction of my life had ever done they inferred from this partial extract an approbation of the conduct of england which yet the same letter had censured with equal rigour it produced too from the minister of bonaparte a complaint not indeed formal for i was but a private citizen but serious of my volunteering with england in the abuse of his sovereign it was incumbent on me to explain by declaring to a member of the government that the extract was partial and its publication unauthorised notwithstanding the pain which this act had cost me considering it on your part but as a mere inadvertence on the receipt     of your letter of aug       i wrote an answer of oct     again on receipt of that of the   th ult i had begun an answer when the arrival of our mail put into my hands a newspaper containing at full length mine of oct    it became necessary then to ask myself seriously whether i meant to enter as a political champion in the field of the newspapers he who does this throws the gauntlet of challenge to every one who will take it up it behoves him then to weigh maturely every sentiment every fact every sentence and syllable he commits to paper and to be certain that he is ready with reason and testimony to maintain every tittle before the tribunal of the public but this is not our purpose when we write to a friend we are careless incorrect in haste perhaps under some transient excitement and we hazard things without reflection because without consequence in the bosom of a friend perhaps it may be said that the letter of oct    contained nothing offensive to others nothing which could injure myself it contained reprobation of the murders and desolations committed by the french nation under their leader bonaparte it contained a condemnation of the allied powers for seizing and taking to themselves independent  unoffending countries because too weak to defend themselves in this they had done wrong but was it my business to become the public accuser and to undertake before the world to renounce their iniquities and do you not think i had a right to decide this for myself and to say whether the sentiments i trusted to you were meant for the whole world i am sure     that on reflection you will perceive that i ought to have been consulted i might have manifested my dissatisfaction by a silent reserve of all answer but this would have offered a blank which might have been filled up with erroneous imputations of sentiment i prefer candid and open expression no change of good will to you none in my estimate of your integrity or understanding has taken place except as to your particular opinion on the rights of correspondence and i pray you especially to assure mrs logan of my constant and affectionate esteem  attachment the just tribute of a respect for the virtues of her heart  head  thomas jefferson may         monticello john taylor to john taylor j mss monticello may         dear sir —on my return from a long journey and considerable absence from home i found here the     copy of your enquiry into the principles of our government which you had been so kind as to send me and for which i pray you to accept my thanks the difficulties of getting new works in our situation inland and without a single bookstore are such as had prevented my obtaining a copy before and letters which had accumulated during my absence and were calling for answers have not yet permitted me to give to the whole a thorough reading yet certain that you and i could not think differently on the fundamentals of rightful government i was impatient and availed myself of the intervals of repose from the writing table to obtain a cursory idea of the body of the work i see in it much matter for profound reflection much which should confirm our adhesion in practice to the good principles of our constitution and fix our attention on what is yet to be made good the sixth section on the good moral principles of our government i found so interesting and replete with sound principles as to postpone my letterwriting to its thorough perusal and consideration besides much other good matter it settles unanswerably the right of instructing representatives and their duty to obey the system of banking we have both equally and ever reprobated i contemplate it as a blot left in all our constitutions which if not covered will end in their destruction which is already hit by the gamblers in corruption and is sweeping away in its progress the fortunes and morals of our citizens funding i consider as limited rightfully to a redemption of the debt within the lives of a     majority of the generation contracting it every generation coming equally by the laws of the creator of the world to the free possession of the earth he made for their subsistence unincumbered by their predecessors who like them were but tenants for life you have successfully and completely pulverized mr adams system of orders and his opening the mantle of republicanism to every government of laws whether consistent or not with natural right indeed it must be acknowledged that the term republic is of very vague application in every language witness the selfstyled republics of holland switzerland genoa venice poland were i to assign to this term a precise and definite idea i would say purely and simply it means a government by its citizens in mass acting directly and personally according to rules established by the majority and that every other government is more or less republican in proportion as it has in its composition more or less of this ingredient of the direct action of the citizens such a government is evidently restrained to very narrow limits of space and population i doubt if it would be practicable beyond the extent of a new england township the first shade from this pure element which like that of pure vital air cannot sustain life of itself would be where the powers of the government being divided should be exercised each by representatives chosen either prohac vice or for such short terms as should render secure the duty of expressing the will of their constituents this i should consider as the nearest approach to a pure republic which is practicable on a   0 large scale of country or population and we have examples of it in some of our state constitutions which if not poisoned by priestcraft would prove its excellence over all mixtures with other elements and with only equal doses of poison would still be the best other shades of republicanism may be found in other forms of government where the executive judiciary and legislative functions and the different branches of the latter are chosen by the people more or less directly for longer terms of years or for life or made hereditary or where there are mixtures of authorities some dependent on and others independent of the people the further the departure from direct and constant control by the citizens the less has the government of the ingredient of republicanism evidently none where the authorities are hereditary as in france venice c or selfchosen as in holland and little where for life in proportion as the life continues in being after the act of election the purest republican feature in the government of our own state is the house of representatives the senate is equally so the first year less the second and so on the executive still less because not chosen by the people directly the judiciary seriously antirepublican because for life and the national arm wielded as you observe by military leaders irresponsible but to themselves add to this the vicious constitution of our county courts to whom the justice the executive administration the taxation police the military appointments of the county and nearly all our daily concerns are confided     selfappointed selfcontinued holding their authorities for life and with an impossibility of breaking in on the perpetual succession of any faction once possessed of the bench they are in truth the executive the judiciary and the military of their respective counties and the sum of the counties makes the state and add also that one half of our brethren who fight and pay taxes are excluded like helots from the rights of representation as if society were instituted for the soil and not for the men inhabiting it or one half of these could dispose of the rights and the will of the other half without their consent   what constitutes a state   not highraised battlements or labord mound   thick wall or moated gate   not cities proud with spires and turrets crownd   no men high minded men   men who their duties know   but know their rights and knowing dare maintain   these constitute a state in the general government the house of representatives is mainly republican the senate scarcely so at all as not elected by the people directly and so long secured even against those who do elect them the executive more republican than the senate from its shorter term its election by the people in practice for they vote for a only on an assurance that he will vote for b and because in practice also a principle of rotation seems to be in a course of establishment the judiciary independent of the     nation their coercion by impeachment being found nugatory if then the control of the people over the organs of their government be the measure of its republicanism and i confess i know no other measure it must be agreed that our governments have much less of republicanism than ought to have been expected in other words that the people have less regular control over their agents than their rights and their interests require and this i ascribe not to any want of republican dispositions in those who formed these constitutions but to a submission of true principle to european authorities to speculators on government whose fears of the people have been inspired by the populace of their own great cities and were unjustly entertained against the independent the happy and therefore orderly citizens of the united states much i apprehend that the golden moment is past for reforming these heresies the functionaries of public power rarely strengthen in their dispositions to abridge it and an unorganized call for timely amendment is not likely to prevail against an organized opposition to it we are always told that things are going on well why change them chi sta bene non si muove said the italian let him who stands well stand still this is true and i verily believe they would go on well with us under an absolute monarch while our present character remains of order industry and love of peace and restrained as he would be by the proper spirit of the people but it is while it remains such we should provide against the consequences of its deterioration and     let us rest in the hope that it will yet be done and spare ourselves the pain of evils which may never happen on this view of the import of the term republic instead of saying as has been said that it may mean anything or nothing we may say with truth and meaning that governments are more or less republican as they have more or less of the element of popular election and control in their composition and believing as i do that the mass of the citizens is the safest depository of their own rights and especially that the evils flowing from the duperies of the people are less injurious than those from the egoism of their agents i am a friend to that composition of government which has in it the most of this ingredient and i sincerely believe with you that banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies and that the principle of spending money to be paid by posterity under the name of funding is but swindling futurity on a large scale i salute you with constant friendship and respect thomas jefferson june        monticello francis w gilmer to francis w gilmer j mss monticello june        dear sir —i received a few days ago from mr dupont the enclosed manuscript with permission to read it and a request when read to forward it to you in expectation that you would translate it it is well worthy of publication for the instruction of our citizens being profound sound and short our legislators are not sufficiently apprized of the rightful     limits of their power that their true office is to declare and enforce only our natural rights and duties and to take none of them from us no man has a natural right to commit aggression on the equal rights of another and this is all from which the laws ought to restrain him every man is under the natural duty of contributing to the necessities of the society and this is all the laws should enforce on him and no man having a natural right to be the judge between himself and another it is his natural duty to submit to the umpirage of an impartial third when the laws have declared and enforced all this they have fulfilled their functions and the idea is quite unfounded that on entering into society we give up any natural right the trial of every law by one of these texts would lessen much the labors of our legislators and lighten equally our municipal codes there is a work of the first order of merit now in the press at washington by destutt tracy on the subject of political economy which he brings into the compass of three hundred pages octavo in a preliminary discourse on the origin of the right of property he coincides much with the principles of the present manuscript but is more developed more demonstrative he promises a future work on morals in which i lament to see that he will adopt the principles of hobbes or humiliation to human nature that the sense of justice and injustice is not derived from our natural organization but founded on convention only i lament this the more as he is unquestionably the ablest writer living on abstract subjects assuming the fact that the earth has been     created in time and consequently the dogma of final causes we yield of course to this short syllogism man was created for social intercourse but social intercourse cannot be maintained without a sense of justice then man must have been created with a sense of justice there is an error into which most of the speculators on government have fallen and which the wellknown state of society of our indians ought before now to have corrected in their hypothesis of the origin of government they suppose it to have commenced in the patriarchal or monarchical form our indians are evidently in that state of nature which has passed the association of a single family and not yet submitted to the authority of positive laws or of any acknowledged magistrate every man with them is perfectly free to follow his own inclinations but if in doing this he violates the rights of another if the case be slight he is punished by the disesteem of his society or as we say by public opinion if serious he is tomahawked as a dangerous enemy their leaders conduct them by the influence of their character only and they follow or not as they please him of whose character for wisdom or war they have the highest opinion hence the origin of the parties among them adhering to different leaders and governed by their advice not by their command the cherokees the only tribe i know to be contemplating the establishment of regular laws magistrates and government propose a government of representatives elected from every town but of all things they least think of subjecting themselves to the will of one man this the only     instance of actual fact within our knowledge will be then a beginning by republican and not by patriarchal or monarchical government as speculative writers have generally conjectured we have to join in mutual congratulations on the appointment of our friend correa to be minister or envoy of portugal here this i hope will give him to us for life nor will it at all interfere with his botanical rambles or journeys the government of portugal is so peaceable and inoffensive that it has never any altercations with its friends if their minister abroad writes them once a quarter that all is well they desire no more i learn though not from correa himself that he thinks of paying us a visit as soon as he is through his course of lectures not to lose this happiness again by my absence i have informed him i shall set out for poplar forest the  0th instant and be back the first week of july i wish you and he could concert your movements so as to meet here and that you would make this your head quarters it is a good central point from which to visit your connections and you know our practice of placing our guests at their ease by showing them we are so ourselves and that we follow our necessary vocations instead of fatiguing them by hanging unremittingly on their shoulders i salute you with affectionate esteem and respect thomas jefferson june  0      monticello william h crawford to william h crawford j mss monticello june  0      dear sir —i am about to sin against all discretion and knowingly by adding to the drudgery of     your letterreading this acknowledgment of the receipt of your favor of may the   st with the papers it covered i cannot however deny myself the gratification of expressing the satisfaction i have received not only from the general statement of affairs at paris in yours of december the   th      as a matter of history which i had not before received but most especially and superlatively from the perusal of your letter of the  th of the same month to mr fisk on the subject of drawbacks this most heterogeneous principle was transplanted into ours from the british system by a man whose mind was really powerful but chained by native partialities to everything english who had formed exaggerated ideas of the superior perfection of the english constitution the superior wisdom of their government and sincerely believed it for the good of this country to make them their model in everything without considering that what might be wise and good for a nation essentially commercial and entangled in complicated intercourse with numerous and powerful neighbors might not be so for one essentially agricultural and insulated by nature from the abusive governments of the old world the exercise by our own citizens of so much commerce as may suffice to exchange our superfluities for our wants may be advantageous for the whole but it does not follow that with a territory so boundless it is the interest of the whole to become a mere city of london to carry on the business of one half the world at the expense of eternal war with the other half the agricultural capacities of our country     constitute its distinguishing feature and the adapting our policy and pursuits to that is more likely to make us a numerous and happy people than the mimicry of an amsterdam a hamburgh or a city of london every society has a right to fix the fundamental principles of its association and to say to all individuals that if they contemplate pursuits beyond the limits of these principles and involving dangers which the society chooses to avoid they must go somewhere else for their exercise that we want no citizens and still less ephemeral and pseudocitizens on such terms we may exclude them from our territory as we do persons infected with disease such is the situation of our country we have most abundant resources of happiness within ourselves which we may enjoy in peace and safety without permitting a few citizens infected with the mania of rambling and gambling to bring danger on the great mass engaged in innocent and safe pursuits at home in your letter to fisk you have fairly stated the alternatives between which we are to choose   licentious commerce and gambling speculations for a few with eternal war for the many or   restricted commerce peace and steady occupations for all if any state in the union will declare that it prefers separation with the first alternative to a continuance in union without it i have no hesitation in saying let us separate i would rather the states should withdraw which are for unlimited commerce and war and confederate with those alone which are for peace and agriculture i know that every nation in europe would join in sincere amity with the latter     and hold the former at arms length by jealousies prohibitions restrictions vexations and war no earthly consideration could induce my consent to contract such a debt as england has by her wars for commerce to reduce our citizens by taxes to such wretchedness as that laboring sixteen of the twentyfour hours they are still unable to afford themselves bread or barely to earn as much oatmeal or potatoes as will keep soul and body together and all this to feed the avidity of a few millionary merchants and to keep up one thousand ships of war for the protection of their commercial speculations i returned from europe after our government had got under way and had adopted from the british code the law of drawbacks i early saw its effects in the jealousies and vexations of britain and that retaining it we must become like her an essentially warring nation and meet in the end the catastrophe impending over her no one can doubt that this alone produced the orders of council the depredations which preceded and the war which followed them had we carried but our own produce and brought back but our own wants no nation would have troubled us our commercial dashers then have already cost us so many thousand lives so many millions of dollars more than their persons and all their commerce were worth when war was declared and especially after massachusetts who had produced it took side with the enemy waging it i pressed on some confidential friends in congress to avail us of the happy opportunity of repealing the drawback and i do rejoice to find that you are in that sentiment   0 you are young and may be in the way of bringing it into effect perhaps time even yet and change of tone for there are symptoms of that in massachusetts may not have obliterated altogether the sense of our late feelings and sufferings may not have induced oblivion of the friends we have lost the depredations and conflagrations we have suffered and the debts we have incurred and have to labor for through the lives of the present generation the earlier the repeal is proposed the more it will be befriended by all these recollections and considerations this is one of three great measures necessary to insure us permanent prosperity this preserves our peace a second should enable us to meet any war by adopting the report of the war department for placing the force of the nation at effectual command and a third should insure resources of money by the suppression of all paper circulation during peace and licensing that of the nation alone during war the metallic medium of which we should be possessed at the commencement of a war would be a sufficient fund for all the loans we should need through its continuance and if the national bills issued be bottomed as is indespensable on pledges of specific taxes for their redemption within certain and moderate epochs and be of proper denominations for circulation no interest on them would be necessary or just because they would answer to every one the purposes of the metallic money withdrawn and replaced by them but possibly these may be the dreams of an old man or that the occasions of realizing them may     have passed away without return a government regulating itself by what is wise and just for the many uninfluenced by the local and selfish views of the few who direct their affairs has not been seen perhaps on earth or if it existed for a moment at the birth of ours it would not be easy to fix the term of its continuance still i believe it does exist here in a greater degree than anywhere else and for its growth and continuance as well as for your personal health and happiness i offer sincere prayers with the homage of my respect and esteem end of volume xi   jefferson further wrote to dearborn thomas jefferson may    0  monticello dearborn monticello may    0  dear sir —there is a subject on which i wished to speak with you before i left washington but an apt occasion did not occur it is that of your continuance in office perhaps it is as well to submit my thoughts to you by letter the present summer is too important in point of preparation to leave your department unfilled for any time as i once thought might be done and it would be with extreme reluctance that so near the time of my own retirement i should proceed to name any high officer especially one who must be of the intimate councils of my successor and who ought of course to be in his unreserved confidence i think too it would make an honorable close of your term as well as mine to leave our country in a state of substantial defence which we found quite unprepared for it indeed it would for me be a joyful annunciation to the next meeting of congress that the operations of defence are all compleat i know that new york must be an exception but perhaps even that may be closed before the  th of march when you  i might both make our bow with approbation  satisfaction nor should i suppose that under present circumstances anything interesting in your future office could make it important for you to repair to its immediate occupation in february my successor will be declared and may then without reserve say whom he would wish me to nominate to the senate in your place i submit these circumstances to your consideration  wishing in all things to consult your interests your fame  feelings it will give me sincere joy to learn that you will watch with me to the end i salute you with great affection and respect   from collections of the n y historical society for      p       the following letters from jefferson to monroe relate to this sore headedness of the latter thomas jefferson mar  0 0  washington monroe washington mar  0 0  dear sir —from your letter of the   th ultimo i perceive that painful impressions have been made on your mind during your late mission of which i had never entertained a suspicion i must therefore examine the grounds because explanations between reasonable men can never but do good   you consider the mission of mr pinckney as an associate to have been in some way injurious to you were i to take that measure on myself i might say in its justification that it has been the regular  habitual practice of the u s to do this under every form in which their government has existed i need not recapitulate the multiplied instances because you will readily recollect them i went as an adjunct to dr franklin  mr adams yourself as an adjunct first to mr livingston and then to mr pinckney  i really believe there has scarcely been a great occasion which has not produced an extraordinary mission still however it is well known that i was strongly opposed to it in the case of which you complain a committee of the senate called on me with two resolutions of that body on the subject of impressment  spoliations by g britain  requesting that i would demand satisfaction after delivering the resolutions the committee entered into free conversation and observed that although the senate could not in form recommend any extraordinary mission yet that as individuals there was but one sentiment among them on the measure and they pressed it i was so much averse to it  gave them so hard an answer that they felt it and spoke of it but it did not end here the members of the other house took up the subject and set upon me individually and these the best friends to you as well as myself and represented the responsibility which a failure to obtain redress would throw on us both pursuing a conduct in opposition to the opinion of nearly every member of the legislature i found it necessary at length to yield my own opinion to the general sense of the national council and it really seemed to produce a jubilee among them not from any want of confidence in you but from a belief in the effect which an extraordinary mission would have on the british mind by demonstrating the degree of importance which this country attached to the rights which we considered as infracted   you complain of the manner in which the treaty was received but what was that manner i cannot suppose you to have given a moments credit to the stuff which was crowded in all sorts of forms into the public papers or to the thousand speeches they put into my mouth not a word of which i had ever uttered i was not insensible at the time of the views to mischief with which these lies were fabricated but my confidence was firm that neither yourself nor the british government equally outraged by them would believe me capable of making the editors of newspapers the confidants of my speeches or opinions the fact was this the treaty was communicated to us by mr erskine on the day congress was to rise two of the senators inquired of me in the evening whether it was my purpose to detain them on account of the treaty my answer was that it was not that the treaty containing no provision against the impressment of our seamen and being accompanied by a kind of protestation of the british ministers which would leave that government free to consider it as a treaty or no treaty according to their own convenience i should not give them the trouble of deliberating on it this was substantially  almost verbally what i said whenever spoken to about it and i never failed when the occasion would admit of it to justify yourself and mr pinckney by expressing my conviction that it was all that could be obtained from the british government that you had told their commissioners that your government could not be pledged to ratify because it was contrary to their instructions of course that it should be considered but as a project and in this light i stated it publicly in my message to congress on the opening of the session not a single article of the treaty was ever made known beyond the members of the administration nor would an article of it be known at this day but for its publication in the newspapers as communicated by somebody from beyond the water as we have always understood but as to myself i can solemnly protest as the most sacred of truths that i never one instant lost sight of your reputation and favorable standing with your country  never omitted to justify your failure to attain our wish as one which was probably unattainable reviewing therefore this whole subject i cannot doubt you will become sensible that your impressions have been without just ground i cannot indeed judge what falsehoods may have been written or told you and that under such forms as to command belief but you will soon find my dear sir that so inveterate is the rancor of party spirit among us that nothing ought to be credited but what we hear with our own ears if you are less on your guard than we are here at this moment the designs of the mischiefmakers will not fail to be accomplished and brethren  friends will be made strangers  enemies to each other without ever having said or thought a thing amiss of each other i presume that the most insidious falsehoods are daily carried to you as they are brought to me to engage us in the passions of our informers and stated so positively  plausibly as to make even doubt a rudeness to the narrator who imposed on himself has no other than the friendly view of putting us on our guard my answer is invariably that my knoledge of your character is better testimony to me of a negative than any affirmative which my informant did not hear from yourself with his own ears in fact when you shall have been a little longer among us you will find that little is to be believed which interests the prevailing passions and happens beyond the limits of our own senses let us not then my dear friend embark our happiness and our affections on the ocean of slander of falsehood  of malice on which our credulous friends are floating if you have been made to believe that i ever did said or thought a thing unfriendly to your fame  feelings you do me injury as causeless as it is afflicting to me in the present contest in which you are concerned i feel no passion i take no part i express no sentiment whichever of my friends is called to the supreme cares of the nation i know that they will be wisely  faithfully administered and as far as my individual conduct can influence they shall be cordially supported for myself i have nothing further to ask of the world than to preserve in retirement so much of their esteem as i may have fairly earned and to be permitted to pass in tranquillity in the bosom of my family  friends the days which yet remain for me having reached the harbor myself i shall view with anxiety but certainly not with a wish to be in their place those who are still buffeting the storm uncertain of their fate your voyage has so far been favorable  that it may continue with entire prosperity is the sincere prayer of that friendship which i have ever borne you and of which i now assure you with the tender of my high respect  affectionate salutations thomas jefferson apr    0  washington monroe washington apr    0  dear sir —an indisposition of periodical headache has for some time disabled me from business and prevented my sooner acknowledging your letter of mar    and returning that of feb   0  which it inclosed the receipt of that of mar    has given me sincere pleasure conscious that i never felt a sentiment towards you that was not affectionate it is a great relief to find that the doubts you have entertained on that subject are removed by an explanation of the circumstances which produced them some matters however appearing from your letter not yet sufficiently understood i have conceived that a more minute detail of the facts bearing on them would compleatly disarm them of all misconstruction i will state them in their exact chronological order because that alone will resolve all doubts to which they may have given rise   0  while at madrid you signified your anxious wish  determination to return home on considerations respecting your private interests   0  feb    the senate passed their resolutions to demand satisfaction of england for spoliations  impressments these were accompanied by a pressure from that body informally to add to both the commissions at london and paris and were backed by such earnest solicitations from the individual members of the other house as showed the opinion to be general that such an enlargement manifesting our sense of the importance of the missions would make the greater impression    having at length yielded with a reluctance well remembered by all i nominated armstrong  bowdoin to treat with spain at paris and march about the beginning of the month mr pinckney was applied to accept the appointment as joint commissioner with you with a commission to succeed you when you should leave london march    mr madisons letter was written giving you notice of it    mr pinckney accepted    my first letter to you was written mentioning mr pinckney would be associated with you    my  d letter mentioning the possibility of adding a  d commissioner for having proposed to a particular individual to be added to armstrong  bowdoin at paris it was thought necessary if that should take place to make an equal addition for london but the refusal of that person prevented further addition at either place    apr     your letter of feb   is believed to have been received on one of these days being a private one the date of its receipt was not noted in the office but i presume it was received apr   because i find i received on that day letters from europe which probably came by the same conveyance apr    the nomination of pinckney  yourself was not made in form till this day because he was not ready to go and the answer of the  d commissioner proposed for paris was received but a few days before this i had as you conjectured really forgotten your letter of feb   by which the joining of an associate with you appeared to be unacceptable but you will perceive that before its receipt the measure was too far engaged to be undone even if i could have ventured to have undone it against the general wish of the legislature and consequently that it had not been adopted in opposition to your advice as that came too late to influence the decision another circumstance to wit why you did not receive the first information of this association from either mr madison or myself is explained by this statement of dates mr madisons letter of mar    gave the intimation with less positiveness perhaps because written before mr pinckneys acceptance was known and an unfortunate disappointment prevented the success of my attempt by the two original letters now inclosed to you the purpose of appointing mr pinckney was known about the beginning of march on the  th of that month mr john randolph came out with his first philippic against the administration on the subject of the resolutions respecting great britain which he followed up closely with others in close succession believing that an use was made of your name which was unjustifiable i felt great anxiety to put you on your guard a mr prentis was going to england and promised he would call at norfolk and take any letters i should lodge there for you i accordingly wrote that of mar    and another two days after showing you how little the h of r had been influenced by the desertion of their leader mentioning that mr pinckney would be associated with you and perhaps even a third and promising more detailed explanations by a confidential person mr beckley who meant to sail for london on the rising of congress unfortunately prentis never called on colo newton with whom my letters were deposited which therefore were returned to me but not till june the originals returned which i happened to preserve are now returned to you and beckley declined his voyage so that my effort to give you information was frustrated a third circumstance is to be noticed and will close these supplementary explanations to wit that the letters from hence containing no expression of a desire that you should come home or remain there  the facility afforded to your departure by the commissions to mr pinckney seemed to authorize an inference that you were considered as in the way of the administration the truth however was thus your letters from madrid in   0   expressed your anxious wish  intention to come home on your return to london my extreme wish was that you should remain there and i hoped by not being in a hurry to answer that manifestation of your desire time might produce a change in your mind but as soon as it was known during the session of   0   that yourself and mr madison were both contemplated as candidates for the succession to the presidency i became apprehensive that by declining longer to assent to your return i might be suspected of a partial design to keep you out of the way in fact it was openly said by some of those who were pressing your name and popularity into the service of their vindictive fashions this produced the acquiescence in your desire to come home which then took place and the commission to mr pinckney to succeed you whenever you should determine to come and these motives clearly show themselves in my letter of mar    which says i shall join mr pinckney of maryland as your associate for settling our differences with g britain he will be authorized to take your place whenever you think yourself obliged to return it is desirable for your own as well as the public interest that you should join in the settlement of this business and i am perfectly satisfied that if this can be done so as to be here before the next meeting of congress it will be greatly for your benefit but i do not mean by this to overrule your own determination i e either to stay or come home which measures to be taken here will place in perfect freedom here you will perceive how much i wished your aid in the joint commission and that your longer continuance there could not but in itself be desirable but that i did not ask it from an apprehension that your return before the next congress might be important to your higher interests i consider it now as a great misfortune that my letter of mar    did not go on to you it would i trust have corrected the inferences of a change in my affections towards you drawn from a combination of circumstances which circumstances were produced from very different causes and some of them from the strength of those very affections of which you thought that they noted a diminution a desire to conform your movements in point of time to what i deemed your best interests i have gone thus minutely into these details from a desire to eradicate from your mind every fiber of doubt as to my sentiments towards you and i am persuaded they will satisfactorily solve every circumstance which might at any time have occasioned doubt i have done it too the more cordially because i perceive from your letter that disposition to a correct view of the subject which i knew to be inherent in your mind what i have hitherto said has been confined to my own part only of these transactions yet it would be a criminal suppression of truth were i not to add that in the whole course of them mr madison has appeared to be governed by the most cordial friendship for you has manifested on every occasion the most attentive concern for whatever might befriend your fame or fortune and been as much alive to whatever regarded you as a brother could have been i must now introduce a different concern lafayettes difficulties are pressing you told us you thought barring would readily give him a delay of  0 years that term would so advance the value of his n orleans location that it would pay his debts without touching the mass of his grant barring is said to be arrived in this country you said you would write to him on the subject if you will send me such a letter it will give an opening for a negotiacion with him we are giving orders for the immediate location of his lands so as to make them a safe pledge i salute you with great  unchanged affections thomas jefferson oct    0  washington monroe washington oct    0  dear sir —such was the accumulation of business awaiting me here that it was not

details would be perverted  malignantly commented by our common enemies and have bearings which render them improper for publication pa   strike out the last paragraph respecting lafayettes affairs indeed the whole of these letters were written without the least idea that they would ever be before the public and therefore after stating the preceding omissions i would rather trust your judgment than my own in deciding whether there be anything more which had better be omitted whether as respects myself or others to me it is desirable that the public should know the high estimation in which i hold both you and mr madison  that no circumstance has abated my affection for either i salute you with sincere friendship  respect   madisons paragraph incapable of giving a valid consent to their

washington cornelia jefferson rudolph washington dec    0  i congratulate you my dear cornelia on having acquired the valuable art of writing how delightful to be enabled by it to converse with an absent friend as if present to this we are indebted for all our reading because it must be written before we can read it to this we are indebted for the iliad the ænead the columbiad henriad dunciad and now for the most glorious poem of all the terrapiniad which i now enclose to you this sublime poem consigns to everlasting fame the greatest achievement in war ever known to ancient or modern times in the battle of david and goliath the disparity between the combatants was nothing in comparison to our case i rejoice that you have learnt to write for another reason for as that is done with a goosequill you now know the value of a goose and of course you will assist ellen in taking care of the halfdozen very fine grey geese which i shall send by davy but as i do this i must refer to your mamma to decide whether they will be safest at edgehill or at monticello till i return home and to give orders accordingly i received letters a few days ago from mr bankhead and anne they are well i had expected a visit from jefferson at christmas had there been a sufficient intermission in his lectures but i suppose there was not as he is not come remember me affectionately to your papa and mamma and kiss ellen and all the children for me ps since writing the above i have a letter from mr peale informing me that jefferson is well and saying the best things of him   from a copy courteously furnished by mr john boyd thacher of albany n y   on the subject of this mission jefferson wrote to the secretary of the treasury thomas jefferson aug  0 0  monticello monticello aug  0 0  dear sir —mr madison  myself on repeated consultations and some of the other members of the executive expressed the same opinion before they left washington have concluded that the mission to petersburgh should not be delayed being special and not permanent the waiting the meeting of the senate is less important  if we waited that it could not go till spring and we know not what this summer  the ensuing winter may produce we think secrecy also important  that the mission should be as little known as possible till it is in petersburgh which could not be if known to the senate mr short goes therefore in the aviso from philadelphia to be engaged for sept    he is peculiarly distressed by sickness at sea  of course more so the smaller the vessel i think therefore the occasion justifies the enlargement of our vessel somewhat beyond what might be necessary for a mere aviso the season too by the time of her return might render it desirable for safety which circumstance may be mentioned in your instructions to the collector to prevent his suspicions of the real ground i salute you with affection  respect   the following papers relate to this message madison nov 0  madisons draft nov 0    to exercise the authority in such manner as would withdraw the pretext on which the aggressions were originally founded and open the way for a renewal of that commercial intercourse which it was alleged on all sides had been so reluctantly obstructed as each of these govts had pledged its readiness to concur in renouncing a measure which reached its adversary through the incontestable rights of neutrals only and as the measure had been assumed by each as a retaliation for an asserted acquiescence in the aggressions of the other it was reasonably expected that the occasion would have been seized by both for evincing the sincerity of their professions  for restoring to the commerce of the u s its legitimate freedom this course so clearly dictated by justice has been taken by neither by france no answer has been given nor is there any indication that a favorable change in her decrees is contemplated to that govt instead of a pledge for suspending our embargo as to france whilst left in operation as to g britain it was thought most consistent with the condition annexed to the authority vested in the executive requiring a sufficient safety to our commerce to hold out the obvious change resulting from such an act of justice by one belligerent and refusal of it by another in the relations between the u s  the latter to g b whose power on the ocean is so ascendant it was deemed not inconsistent with that condition to state explicitly that on her rescinding her orders in relation to the u s their trade would be opened with her and remain shut to her enemy in case of his failure to rescind his decrees also the unexceptionable nature of this proposition seemed to insure its being received in the spirit in which it was made and this was the less to be doubted as the british orders in council had not only been referred for their vindication to an acquiescence on the part of the u s no longer to be pretended but as the arrangement proposed whilst it resisted the illegal decrees of france involved moreover substantially the precise advantages professedly aimed at by the b orders the arrangement has nevertheless been explicitly rejected the controverted fact being assumed that the enemy of g b was the original aggressor and the extraordinary doctrine maintained that without regard to any just interpositions of the neutral the aggressor not specifically affecting a revocation of his acts the injured belligerent has a right to pursue his retaliations against the neutral and is to be inferred from the practice without regard to the measure of injury sustained through the neutral this candid and liberal experiment having thus failed and no other event having occurred on which a suspension of the embargo by the executive was authorized it necessarily remains in the extent originally given to it we have the satisfaction however to reflect that in return for the privations imposed by the measure and which our fellow citizens in general have borne with patriotism it has had the important effects of saving our vast mercantile property and our mariners as well as of affording time for prosecuting the defensive  provisional measures required on the part of the u s whilst on another hand the course pursued by them will have demonstrated to foreign nations the moderation and fairness which govern their councils and have confirmed in all their citizens the motives which ought to incite them in support of the laws  the rights of their country to these considerations may be added that the measure has thus long frustrated those usurpations  spoliations which if resisted involve war if submitted to sacrificed a vital principle of our national independence under a continuance of the belligerent measures which have overspread the ocean with danger it will lie with the wisdom of congress to decide on the course best adapted to such a state of things and bringing with them as they do from every part of the union the sentiments of our constituents my confidence is strengthened that in forming this decision they will with an unerring regard to the essential rights  interests of the nation weigh  compare the painful alternatives out of which a choice is to be made nor should i do justice to the virtues which on other occasions have marked the character of the american people if i did not cherish an equal confidence that the alternative chosen whatever it may be will be maintained with all the fortitude  patriotism which the crisis ought to inspire the documents containing the correspondence on the subject of the foreign edicts against our commerce with the instructions given to our ministers at london  paris are laid before you   the communications made to congress at their last session explain the posture in which the close of the discussions relating to the attack by a b ship of war on the frigate chesapeake left a subject on which the nation had manifested so honorable a sensibility every view of what had passed authorized a belief that immediate steps would be taken by the b govt for redressing a wrong which the more it was investigated appeared the more clearly to require what had not been provided for in the special mission it is found that no steps have been taken for the purpose on the contrary it will be seen in the documents laid before you that the inadmissible preliminary which obstructed the adjustment is still adhered to and moreover that it is now brought into connection with the distinct and irrelative case of the orders in council the instruction which had been given to our minister at london with a view to facilitate if necessary the reparation claimed by the u s are included in the documents communicated thomas jefferson october  0   0  gallatin jefferson to gallatin october  0   0  i enclose you the financial paragraph with your amendments i shall insert one on the militia but doubt whether i can say anything about the deficiency of the revenue if the embargo is continued having declined expressing any opinion on its continuance the whole of the paragraphs respecting our foreign affairs will be to be remodelled in consequence of the return of the hope the manufacturing paragraph is also remanufactured affectionate salutations i am puzzled about the martinique paupers gallatins draft of message first paragraph as the message will have a much more rapid  extensive circulation than the accompanying documents it seems desirable that the proposition made to the belligerent powers particularly to great britain should be more explicitly stated our disposition to exercise the authority in such manner as would withdraw the very pretexts on which their aggressions were founded—as the measure had been assumed by each merely as a retaliation for a pretended acquiescence in the aggressions of the other—the very pretext for obstructing which the commerce of the u s no longer existed from those sentences alone in the message it would be impossible to infer that the fair proposition to the belligerent had actually been made i am aware that a difficulty arises in making a brief  clear statement from the modified manner in which the overture was made to france which will be best explained by the documents yet so far as practicable it is of real importance that the message itself should at once  in an explicit manner apprize our citizens  the people of england of the candid impartial  clear proposition which was made how such a modification should be introduced cannot be suggested without recurrence to the instructions given to our ministers by the secretary of state would it be improper in order to repel some late false assertions to state the precise time  vessel by which the instructions were sent adding that when that vessel left europe no change had yet taken place c the definitive answer to our proposition which is every day expected not having at that time been yet given this would modify the disagreeable intelligence that no change had yet taken place  without raising improper expectations state the real fact  therefore that a possibility still existed of a change the arrival of the hope was not known when this page was written still i wish the president to read it first and second paragraphs the conduct of the belligerent affords certainly the most just ground of complaint yet those two paragraphs strike me as being too much in a tone of complaint  despondency if the president should on reading them over think the observation correct it will be easy to make a few verbal alterations but there are two additions at the end of the first  second paragraphs which would produce the effect i wish  be in other respects useful   when speaking of the advantages resulting from the embargo to add the opportunity thereby given of demonstrating to foreign nations the fairness of our conduct of placing our cause on irrefragable grounds of justice and of thereby uniting the whole of our nation who must now be convinced of the sincerity of the efforts of the executive  of the persevering injustice of the belligerent   in speaking of the painful alternatives out of which congress must choose to add the confidence of the executive that the crisis be it what it may will be met with fortitude c third paragraph i think this much too long considering the degree of importance now attached to it by the nation i would omit the opinion that the seamen will be restored seventh paragraph i would omit the sentence as the additional expense to affect this would be very considerable it will rest with congress to decide on its being undertaken for the fact is sufficiently evident without stating it and under existing circumstances the sentence might be misrepresented as intended to prevent the adoption of the measure tenth paragraph the conclusion of this paragraph announces i fear more than has been performed i would omit from and force has imposed to the end of the paragraph eleventh paragraph this paragraph appears to me the most objectionable in the message from the manner in which it is expressed it might be inferred as the presidents opinion that a positive benefit is derived from the introduction of manufactures caused by the annihilation of commerce i think the opinion if it did exist incorrect but be that as it may its avowal for it will be construed as an avowal will produce a pernicious effect  furnish a powerful weapon to the disaffected in the seaports  in all the eastern states all that seems important to be communicated and it is only in relation to the british govt  nation that it is important is that the situation in which we have been forced has compelled us to apply a portion of our industry  capital to manufactures  that those establishments will be permanent for the reasons mentioned but i would omit everything which looks like a contrast between commerce  manufactures  exultation at the result this result should it seems to me be given as consolation  not as matter of congratulation in the abstract nor have we any data which would justify the supposition that the mass of our future wants will be supplied from among ourselves the expressions which appear to me most objectionable are the nation at large will derive sensible advantage from the conversion c the extent is far beyond expectation—and the mass of our future wants c  the produce of the agriculturist c to the end of the sentence particularly the contrast with the necessity heretofore incurred to traverse the ocean exposed to its dangers  to rapine which is little less than a denunciation of commerce twelfth paragraph the balance in the treasury on  0th septr was about    00000 dollars but this great accumulation is due principally to our having redeemed but very little debt during the year the great bulk of reimbursement falling for this calendar year on   st decr next when we will have to pay near six millions chiefly principal of the eight pr cent stock those six millions must therefore be considered as a deduction from the balance in the treasury and as this is the last time that the president will address congress on that subject i would propose to include in the redemption of the debt what will be paid on    decr next stating it as such presenting thereby in a single view the total amount of debt extinguished during the eight years of the presidents administration for there will be no paiments on that account between the  st january  the  th march next i will be able tuesday or wednesday next to prepare a financial paragraph to that effect and to fill the blanks in round numbers the president may then either substitute it or fill the blanks of the present one but it follows that we cannot draw from this apparent accumulations the inferences next following in the message the words if we are to have war do also state the case in words which have been avoided in other parts of the message nor do they state all the contingencies under which the application of all our funds will be obvious for in case of the embargo being continued we will have still less revenue  will therefore still more want the money in hand than in case of war i would therefore submit the propriety of substituting to that part of the message in substance what follows the probable accumulation of the surpluses of revenue whenever the freedom  safety of our commerce shall be restored beyond what can be applied to the payment of the public debt merits the consideration of congress shall it be unproductive shall the revenue be reduced or shall it not c i would omit the words and at hazard in the public vaults when the subject of improvements was recommended two years ago by the president i prevailed on him to omit the idea of an apportionment amongst the several states for the same reason i wish extremely that the words securing to each of them the employment of their proportionate share within their respective states it may ultimately be necessary to insert such provision in the amendment in order to insure its success but it is very desirable that it should be adopted without such restriction a just apportionment will naturally result from the conflicting interests on the floor of congress but the strict rule in a constitutional provision would be very embarrassing  sometimes defeat the most important objects because it often happens that an improvement is as useful or more useful to an adjacent state than to that through which it passes thus the chesapeake  delaware canal is almost altogether in the state of delaware  does not touch pennsylvania to which it is more useful than to any other state according to the rule its expense should be considered as the apportionment of delaware and pennsylvania would receive her whole apportionment for other works as if that was not done principally on her account indeed as delaware is not   00 part of the union if the part of the canal which passes through that state costs  00000 dollars it never could be done unless sixty millions of dollars were expended in the whole i am clearly of opinion that without an amendment to the constitution nothing efficient can be done but in order to insure the execution of the great national communications the application should if possible be left by the amendment to congress unrestrained by special rules there are i think two omissions in the message  st in the case of war or continued embargo the revenue will be evidently insufficient to meet the expenses   although former recommendations have not been successful i would again call the attention of congress to improvement in the militia that defence which events have now so clearly demonstrated to be the only one on which nations can rely with safety   jefferson later wrote to colonel humphreys thomas jefferson january  0   0  washington colonel humphreys washington january  0   0  sir —i have to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of december   th and to return you my thanks for the cloth furnished me it came in good time and does honor to your manufactory being as good as any one would wish to wear in any country amidst the pressure of evils with which the belligerent edicts have afflicted us some permanent good will arise the spring given to manufactures will have durable effects knowing most of my own state i can affirm with confidence that were free intercourse opened again tomorrow she would never again import onehalf of the coarse goods which she has done down to the date of the edicts these will be made in our families for finer goods we must resort to the larger manufactories established in the towns some jealousy of this spirit of manufacture seems excited among commercial men it would have been as just when we first began to make our own ploughs and hoes they have certainly lost the profit of bringing these from a foreign country my idea is that we should encourage home manufactures to the extent of our own consumption of everything of which we raise the raw material i do not think it fair in the shipowners to say we ought not to make our own axes nails c here that they may have the benefit of carrying the iron to europe and bringing back the axes nails c our agriculture will still afford surplus produce enough to employ a due proportion of navigation wishing every possible success to your undertaking as well for your personal as the public benefit i salute you with assurances of great esteem and respect   his grandson   jefferson wrote later to dr eustis thomas jefferson oct   0  monticello dr eustis monticello oct   0  dear sir —solicited by a poor man in an adjoining county who states his case in the enclosed letter  truly as far as i can learn i take the liberty of putting it under cover to you in the hope you will be so good as to put it into the hands of the proper clerk that whatever is right may be done  if nothing can be done that the clerk may certify the grounds so as to inform the applicant  put him at rest the paper if inclosed to me shall be safely conveyed to him i am glad of an occasion of congratulating you as well as my country on your accession to a share in the direction of our executive councils besides the general advantages we may promise ourselves from the employment of your talents  integrity in so important a station we may hope peculiar effect from it towards restoring deeply wounded amity between your native state  her sisters the design of the leading federalists then having direction of the state to take advantage of the first war with england to separate the n e states from the union has distressingly impaired our future confidence in them in this as in all other cases we must do them full justice and make the fault all their own should the last hope of human liberty be destined to receive its final stab from them i salute you with great esteem  respect   drafted by thomas jefferson   on the subject of his financial straits jefferson further wrote to madison thomas jefferson may    0  monticello madison monticello may    0  dear sir —it is my duty to write to you on the subject of the note you were so kind as to endorse for me at the bank of the u s and i do it willingly altho painfully notwithstanding a fixed determination to take care that at the termination of my duties at washington my pecuniary matters should at least be square and my confidence that they would be so i found by an estimate made in december last that there would be a deficit in them of several thousand dollars i took immediate measures for transferring that debt to virginia and did it the more easily as i was enabled to pledge certain resources which i had in possession or not very distant however after this liquidation effected other demands which had not come under my view came upon me one after another and required to answer them the amount of the note you indorsed for me the forms of the bank requiring two indorsers for an absentee i asked of mr barnes to be the second which he very readily assented to the cashier previously assuring me that it would have no effect on their transactions with mr barnes on his private account  so i assured him but by a letter i have received from the old gentleman i find that he is made uneasy by some circumstance in the execution of the note which makes him liable in the first instance were the bank contrary to expectation to make a sudden demand of the money it would add much to my affliction to give him uneasy nights at his age which obliges me to ask you to satisfy him by interposing yourself between him  the first liability to the bank which i believe is done by your subscribing the words credit the drawer instead of his doing it he however can best say how this may be done i might without much delay have relieved you from this unpleasant responsibility had i not engaged my earliest resources on my first estimate which i then thought would discharge all demands it is this circumstance which renders me unable to fix any time with confidence i limit my expenses here to my income here leaving that of my bedford estate free which is about   00 d clear one year with another but as this would take an improper course of time i am endeavoring to sell several detached parcels of land unconnected with my possessions either here or in bedford  which i can spare without diminution of revenue or other inconvenience they amount to between two  three thousand acres  at the market prices would bring the double of these deficits i trust that the bank will find no interest in calling for a reimbursement before i shall have been able to avail myself of all my resources i had seen with much pleasure that the dispute with pennsylvania was likely to go off so smoothly but am much mortified to see the spirit manifested by the prisoners themselves as well as by those who participated in the parade of their liberation one circumstance in it struck my attention disagreeably but it admitted a different explanation i trust that no section of republicans will countenance the suggestions of the federalists that there has ever been any difference at all in our political principles or any sensible one in our views of the public interest after a most distressing drought of   or   weeks we had on the   th instant a very fine rain followed by calm  tolerably warm weather and yesterday  last night a plentiful rain has fallen again the coldness  backwardness of the spring however had not advanced plants sufficiently to enable the planters to avail themselves of them as seasons i tender always to mrs madison my affectionate respects  to yourself the assurances of my constant  cordial attachment thomas jefferson dec    0  monticello charles clay to charles clay monticello dec    0  dear sir —this will be handed you by my soninlaw mr randolph with the integrity and honor of whose character you are already acquainted an urgent occasion to raise a considerable sum of money in the course of a year and a part of it  000 d within the month of january has induced me to propose to him the curtailing the outskirts of my poplar forest lands as the most probable means of effecting it i did not know of this urgency when i had the pleasure of seeing you in bedford or i would have set on foot this expedient with the benefit of more time if the first sum could not have been otherwise procured your knowledge of the value of the land of the price it should command as prices go with you  of the characters who may be disposed to purchase  likely to fulfill their engagements induces me to ask your friendly information counsel  aid to him towards effecting his object which will be cordially acknowledged by me as a great obligation feeling as anxiously interested in his case as if it were my own i pray you to be assured of my constant esteem  respect   the following are jeffersons notes on fifth volume of marshalls life of washington page   the practicability of perpetuating his authority c i am satisfied that general washington had not a wish to perpetuate his authority but he who supposes it was practicable had he wished it knows nothing of the spirit of america either of the people or of those who possessed their confidence there was indeed a cabal of the officers of the army who proposed to establish a monarchy and to propose it to general washington he frowned indignantly at the proposition according to the information which got abroad and at rufus king and some few civil characters chiefly indeed i believe to a man north of maryland who joined in this intrigue but they never dared openly to avow it knowing that the spirit which had produced a change in the form of government was alive to the preservation of it page    the member of congress here alluded to was myself and the extracts quoted was part of a letter from myself in answer to one general washington wrote see both general washington called on me at annapolis where i then was a member of congress on his way to the meeting of the cincinnati in philadelphia we had much conversation on the institution which was chiefly an amplification of the sentiments in our letters and in conclusion after i had stated to him the modifications which i thought might remove all jealousies as well as dangers and the parts which might still be retained he appeared to make up his mind and said no not a fibre of it must be retained—no halfway reformation will suffice if the thing be bad it must be totally abolished and he declared his determination to use his utmost endeavors to have it entirely abolished on his return from philadelphia he called on me again at annapolis and sat with me until a very late hour in the night giving me an account of what passed in their convention the sum of it was that he had exerted his whole influence in every way in his power to procure an abolition that the opposition to it was extreme and especially from some of the younger members but that after several days of struggle within doors and without a general sentiment was obtained for its entire abolition whether any vote had been taken on it or not i do not remember but his affirmation to me was that within a few days i think he said two or three it would have been formally abolished just in that moment arrived major lenfant who had been sent to france to procure the eagles and to offer the order to the french officers who had served in america he brought the kings permission to his officers to accept it the letters of thanks of these officers accepting it letters of solicitation from other officers to obtain it and the eagles themselves the effect of all this on the minds of the members was to undo much of what had been done to rekindle all the passions which had produced the institution and silence all the dictates of prudence which had been operating for its abolition after this the general said the utmost that could be effected was the modification which took place and which provided for its extinction with the death of the existing members he declined the presidency and i think baron steuben was appointed i went soon after to france while there m de munier charged with that part of the encyclopedie methodique which relates to economie politique and diplomatique called on me with the article of that dictionary etats unis which he had prepared ready for the press and begged i would revise it and make any notes on it which i should think necessary towards rendering it correct i furnished him most of the matter of his fifth sixth eighth ninth and tenth sections of the article etats unis with which however he intermixed some of his own the ninth is that which relates to the cincinnati on this subject the section as prepared by him was an unjust and incorrect philippic against general washington and the american officers in general i wrote a substitute for it which he adopted but still retaining considerable of his own matter and interspersing it in various parts page    in a government constituted c here begins the artful complexion he has given to the two parties federal and republican in describing the first by their views and motives he implies an opposition to those motives in their opponents which is totally untrue the real difference consisted in their different degrees of inclination to monarchy or republicanism the federalists wished for everything which would approach our new government to a monarchy the republicans to preserve it essentially republican this was the true origin of the division and remains still the essential principle of difference between the two parties   on the subject of this vacancy in the supreme court jefferson further wrote to judge john tyler thomas jefferson may       0 monticello judge john tyler monticello may       0 dear sir —your friendly letter of the   th has been duly received although i have laid it down as a law to myself never to embarrass the president with my solicitations and have not till now broken through it yet i have made a part of your letter the subject of one to him and have done it with all my heart and in the full belief that i serve him and the public in urging that appointment we have long enough suffered under the base prostitution of law to party passions in one judge and the imbecility of another in the hands of one the law is nothing more than an ambiguous text to be explained by his sophistry into any meaning which may subserve his personal malice nor can any milkandwater associate maintain his own dependance and by a firm pursuance of what the law really is extend its protection to the citizens or the public i believe you will do it and where you cannot induce your colleague to do what is right you will be firm enough to hinder him from doing what is wrong and by opposing sense to sophistry leave the juries free to follow their own judgment i have long lamented with you the depreciation of law science the opinion seems to be that blackstone is to us what the alcoran is to the mahometans that everything which is necessary is in him and what is not in him is not necessary i still lend my counsel and books to such young students as will fix themselves in the neighborhood cokes institutes and reports are their first and blackstone their last book after an intermediate course of two or three years it is nothing more than an elegant digest of what they will then have acquired from the real fountains of the law now men are born scholars lawyers doctors in our day this was confined to poets you wish to see me again in the legislature but this is impossible my mind is now so dissolved in tranquillity that it can never again encounter a contentious assembly the habits of thinking and speaking offhand after a disuse of five and twenty years have given place to the slower process of the pen i have indeed two great measures at heart without which no republic can maintain itself in strength   that of general education to enable every man to judge for himself what will secure or endanger his freedom   to divide every county into hundreds of such size that all the children of each will be within reach of a central school in it but this division looks to many other fundamental provisions every hundred besides a school should have a justice of the peace a constable and a captain of militia these officers or some others within the hundred should be a corporation to manage all its concerns to take care of its roads its poor and its police by patrols c as the select men of the eastern townships every hundred should elect one or two jurors to serve where requisite and all other elections should be made in the hundreds separately and the votes of all the hundreds be brought together our present captaincies might be declared hundreds for the present with a power to the courts to alter them occasionally these little republics would be the main strength of the great one we owe to them the vigor given to our revolution in its commencement in the eastern states and by them the eastern states were enabled to repeal the embargo in opposition to the middle southern and western states and their large and lubberly division into counties which can never be assembled general orders are given out from a centre to the foreman of every hundred as to the sergeants of an army and the whole nation is thrown into energetic action in the same direction in one instant and as one man and becomes absolutely irresistible could i once see this i should consider it as the dawn of the salvation of the republic and say with old simeon nunc dimittas domine but our children will be as wise as we are and will establish in the fulness of time those things not yet ripe for establishment so be it and to yourself health happiness and long life   from a copy courteously furnished by dr j s h fogg of boston   on the question of this vacancy in its bearing on the batture case jefferson had already written to albert gallatin thomas jefferson september       0 monticello albert gallatin monticello september       0 dear sir —yours of the  0th came safely to hand and laid me under new obligations for the valuable observations it contained the error of    feet instead of   for the rise of the batture really sautoit aux yeux and how i could have committed it at first or passed it over afterwards without discovery and having copied pelletiers plan myself is unaccountable i have adopted also most of your other corrections you observe that the arguments proving the batture public yet prove it of such a character that it could not be within the scope of the law of march   against squatters i should so adjudge myself yet i observe many opinions otherwise and in defence against a spadassin it is lawful to use all weapons besides i have no pretensions to be exclusively the judge of what arguments are sound and what not i give them therefore that they may have weight and have a right to decide for themselves that act of congress moreover was evidently respected particularly in the order under which the removal was made with respect to the arrangement of materials in my statement i know it is not such as counsel would employ in pleading such a cause it is not such as i would have made myself in that character it was determined by other considerations i thought it possible the case might be dismissed out of court by a plea to the jurisdiction i determined on this event to lay it before the public either directly or through congress respect for my associates for myself for our nation would not permit me to come forward as a criminal under accusation to plead and argue a cause this was not my situation i had only to state to my constituents a common transaction this would naturally be by way of narrative or statements of the facts in their order of time establishing these facts as they occur and bringing forward the law arising on them and pointing to the executive the course he was to pursue i suppose it was selfrespectful to present it as a history and explanation of what had taken place it does not indeed in that form display the subject in one great whole but it brings forward successively a number of questions solving themselves as they arise and leaving no one unexamined and the mind after travelling over the whole case and finding as it goes along that all has been considered and all is right rests in that state of satisfaction which it is our object to produce in truth i have never known a case which presented so many distinct questions having no dependence on one another nor belonging even to the same branches of jurisprudence after all i offer this as explanation not justification of the order i adopted what the issue of the case ought to be no unbiased man can doubt what it will be no one can tell the judges inveteracy is profound and his mind of that gloomy malignity which will never let him forego the opportunity of satiating it on a victim his decisions his instructions to a jury his allowances and disallowances and garblings of evidence must all be subjects of appeal i consider that as my only chance of saving my fortune from entire wreck and to whom is my appeal from the judge in burrs case to himself and his associate judges in the case of marbury v madison not exactly however i observe old cushing is dead at length then we have a chance of getting a republican majority in the supreme judiciary for ten years has that branch braved the spirit and will of the nation after the nation has manifested its will by a complete reform in every branch depending on them the event is a fortunate one and so timed as to be a godsend to me i am sure its importance to the nation will be felt and the occasion employed to complete the great operation they have so long been executing by the appointment of a decided republican with nothing equivocal about him but who will it be the misfortune of bidwell removes an able man from the competition can any other bring equal qualifications to those of lincoln i know he was not deemed a profound common lawyer but was there ever a profound common lawyer known in one of the eastern states there never was nor never can be one from those states the basis of their law is neither common nor civil it is an original if any compound can be so called its foundation seems to have been laid in the spirit and principles of jewish law incorporated with some words and phrases of common law and an abundance of notions of their own this makes an amalgam sui generis and it is well known that a man first and thoroughly initiated into the principles of one system of law can never become pure and sound in any other lord mansfield was a splendid proof of this therefore i say there never was nor never can be a profound common lawyer from those states sullivan had the reputation of preeminence there as a common lawyer but we have his history of land titles which gives us his measure mr lincoln is i believe considered as learned in their laws as any one they have federalists say that parsons is better but the criticalness of the present nomination puts him out of the question as the great mass of the functions of the new judge are to be performed in his own district lincoln will be most unexceptionable and acceptable there and on the supreme bench equal to any one who can be brought from thence add to this his integrity political firmness and unimpeachable character and i believe no one can be found to whom there will not be more serious objections you seem to think it would be best to ascertain the probable result before making a proposition to congress to defend livingstons suit on mature consideration i think it better that no such proposition should be made the debates there would fix the case as a party one and we are the minority in the judiciary department and especially in the federal branch of it here till congress can be thoroughly put in possession of all the points in the case it is best they should let it lie livingston by removing it into the judiciary has fairly relinquished all claims on their interference i am confident that congress will act soundly whenever we can give them a knowledge of the whole case but i tire you with this business and end therefore with repeating assurances of my constant attachment and respect he also wrote to gideon granger thomas jefferson oct     0 monticello gideon granger monticello oct     0 dear sir —your two favors of sep    and oct   have been duly received the substance of the latter i immediately communicated to my friend at lynchburg where the information will be received with joy the former was a week before it got here about the   th of sep writing to two members of the cabinet on other business and having just heard of cushings death i reminded them of our friend lincoln in those terms which his worth  standing dictated after the receipt of yours of the  th writing again on other business and taking a review of supposed candidates i expressed with respect to yourself those sentiments of esteem  approbation which are sincerely mine and with as much earnestness as the laws i lay down for myself in these cases would permit and with the more in contemplation of an expression in your letter to wit had our friend lincoln remained capable my lips would have remained sealed for altho i have never heard any fact which explains the meaning of this to me yet i inferred that something had happened of which i had not heard i shall be perfectly happy if either of you are named as i consider the substituting in the place of cushing a firm unequivocating republican whose principles are born with him and not an occasional ingraftment as necessary to compleat that great reformation in our government to which the nation gave its fiat ten years ago they have compleated  maintained it steadily in the two branches dependent on them but the third unfortunately  unwisely made independent not only of the nation but even of their own conduct have hitherto bid defiance to the public will and erected themselves into a political body with the assumed functions of correcting what they deem the errors of the nation accept the assurances of my great esteem  respect   george jefferson   george wythe   jefferson later wrote rush thomas jefferson december        poplar forest rush poplar forest december        dear sir —while at monticello i am so much engrossed by business or society that i can only write on matters of strong urgency here i have leisure as i have everywhere the disposition to think of my friends i recur therefore to the subject of your kind letters relating to mr adams and myself which a late occurrence has again presented to me i communicated to you the correspondence which had parted mrs adams and myself in proof that i could not give friendship in exchange for such sentiments as she had recently taken up towards myself and avowed and maintained in her letters to me nothing but a total renunciation of these could admit a reconciliation and that could be cordial only in proportion as the return to ancient opinions was believed sincere in these jaundiced sentiments of hers i had associated mr adams knowing the weight which her opinions had with him and notwithstanding she declared in her letters that they were not communicated to him a late incident has satisfied me that i wronged him as well as her in not yielding entire confidence to this assurance on her part two of the mr — my neighbors and friends took a tour to the northward during the last summer in boston they fell into company with mr adams and by his invitation passed a day with him at braintree he spoke out to them everything which came uppermost and as it occurred to his mind without any reserve and seemed most disposed to dwell on those things which happened during his own administration he spoke of his masters as he called his heads of departments as acting above his control and often against his opinions among many other topics he adverted to the unprincipled licentiousness of the press against myself adding i always loved jefferson and still love him this is enough for me i only needed this knowledge to revive towards him all the affections of the most cordial moments of our lives changing a single word only in dr franklins character of him i knew him to be always an honest man often a great one but sometimes incorrect and precipitate in his judgments and it is known to those who have ever heard me speak of mr adams that i have ever done him justice myself and defended him when assailed by others with the single exception as to political opinions but with a man possessing so many other estimable qualities why should we be dissocialized by mere differences of opinions in politics in religion in philosophy or anything else his opinions are as honestly formed as my own our different views of the same subject are the result of a difference in our organization and experience i never withdrew from the society of any man on this account although many have done it from me much less should i do it from one with whom i had gone through with hand and heart so many trying scenes i wish therefore but for an apposite occasion to express to mr adams my unchanged affections for him there is an awkwardness which hangs over the resuming a correspondence so long discontinued unless something could arise which should call for a letter time and chance may perhaps generate such an occasion of which i shall not be wanting in promptitude to avail myself from this fusion of mutual affections mrs adams is of course separated it will only be necessary that i never name her in your letters to mr adams you can perhaps suggest my continued cordiality towards him and knowing this should an occasion of writing first present itself to him he will perhaps avail himself of it as i certainly will should it first occur to me no ground for jealousy now existing he will certainly give fair play to the natural warmth of his heart perhaps i may open the way in some letter to my old friend gerry who i know is in habits of the greatest intimacy with him i have thus my friend laid open my heart to you because you were so kind as to take an interest in healing again revolutionary affections which have ceased in expression only but not in their existence god ever bless you and preserve you in life and health   jefferson further wrote to col william duane thomas jefferson april  0      monticello col william duane monticello april  0      dear sir —when i wrote you my letter of march    i had great confidence that as much at least could have been done for you as i therein supposed the friend to whom i confided the business here and who was and is zealous had found such readiness in those to whom he spoke as left no other difficulty than to find the bank responsible but the auroras which came on while this was in transaction changed the prospect altogether and produced a general revulsion of sentiment the presidents popularity is high through this state and nowhere higher than here they considered these papers as a denunciation of war against him and instantly withdrew their offers i cannot give you a better account of the effect of the same papers in richmond than by quoting the letter of a friend who there undertook the same office and with great cordiality in a letter to me of april    he says yours of the   th in reply to mine of the  0th inst has been brought to me from the office this instant on showing it to — the effect of it was to dispose him to lend  00 and i wrote my letter of the  0th to you in a persuasion produced by that incident as well as by its effect on my own feelings that something important might be done for d in spite of the adverse spirit or at least distrust which the equivocal character of his paper has lately excited equivocal in relation to mr madison but ds three or four last papers contain such paragraphs in relation to mr madison that even your letter cannot now serve him the paper is now regarded as an opposition one and the republicans here have no sympathy with any one who carries opposition colors every gentleman who mentions this subject in my hearing speaks with the warmest resentment against d believe me sir it is impossible to do anything for him here now and any further attempts would only disable me from rendering any service to the cause hereafter i am persuaded that you will see this subject in its true light and be assured that it is the impracticability of serving him produced by himself as well as the violation which i feel it would be of my sentiments for mr madison that prevents me from proceeding the firm yet modest character of the writer of this letter gives great weight to what he says and i have thought it best to state it in his own terms because it will be better evidence to you than any general description i could give of the impression made by your late papers indeed i could give none for going little from home i cannot personally estimate the public sentiment the few i see are very unanimous in support of their executive and legislative functionaries i have thought it well too that you should know exactly the feelings here because if you get similar information from other respectable portions of the union it will naturally beget some suspicion in your own mind that finding such a mass of opinion variant from your own you may be under erroneous impressions meriting reexamination and consideration i think an editor should be independent that is of personal influence and not be moved from his opinions on the mere authority of any individual but with respect to the general opinion of the political section with which he habitually accords his duty seems very like that of a member of congress some of these indeed think that independence requires them to follow always their own opinion without respect for that of others this has never been my opinion nor my practice when i have been of that or any other body differing on a particular question from those whom i knew to be of the same political principles with myself and with whom i generally thought and acted a consciousness of the fallibility of the human mind and of my own in particular with a respect for the accumulated judgment of my friends has induced me to suspect erroneous impressions in myself to suppose my own opinion wrong and to act with them on theirs the want of this spirit of compromise or of selfdistrust proudly but falsely called independence is what gives the federalists victories which they could never obtain if these brethren could learn to respect the opinions of their friends more than of their enemies and prevents many able and honest men from doing all the good they otherwise might do i state these considerations because they have often quieted my own conscience in voting and acting on the judgment of others against my own and because they may suggest doubts to yourself in the present case our executive and legislative authorities are the choice of the nation and possess the nations confidence they are chosen because they possess it and the recent elections prove it has not been abated by the attacks which have for some time been kept up against them if the measures which have been pursued are approved by the majority it is the duty of the minority to acquiesce and conform it is true indeed that dissentients have a right to go over to the minority and to act with them but i do not believe your mind has contemplated that course that it has deliberately viewed the strange company into which it may be led step by step unintended and unperceived by itself the example of john randolph is a caution to all honest and prudent men to sacrifice a little of selfconfidence and to go with their friends although they may sometimes think they are going wrong after so long a course of steady adherence to the general sentiments of the republicans it would afflict me sincerely to see you separate from the body become auxiliary to the enemies of our government who have to you been the bitterest enemies who are now chuckling at the prospect of division among us and as i am told are subscribing for your paper the best indication of error which my experience has tested is the approbation of the federalists their conclusions necessarily follow the false bias of their principles i claim however no right of guiding the conduct of others but have indulged myself in these observations from the sincere feelings of my heart retired from all political interferences i have been induced into this one by a desire first of being useful to you personally and next of maintaining the republican ascendency be its effect what it may i am done with it and shall look on as an inactive though not an unfeeling spectator of what is to ensue as far as my good will may go for i can no longer act i shall adhere to my government executive and legislative and as long as they are republican i shall go with their measures whether i think them right or wrong because i know they are honest and are wiser and better informed than i am in doing this however i shall not give up the friendship of those who differ from me and who have equal right with myself to shape their own course in this disposition be assured of my continued esteem and respect p s be so good as to consider the extract from my friends letter as confidential because i have not his permission to make this use of it he also wrote to william wirt thomas jefferson march  0      monticello william wirt monticello march  0      dear sir —mr dabney carr has written to you on the situation of the editor of the aurora and our desire to support him this paper has unquestionably rendered incalculable services to republicanism through all its struggles with the federalists and has been the rallying point for the orthodoxy of the whole union it was our comfort in the gloomiest days and is still performing the office of a watchful sentinel we should be ungrateful to desert him and unfaithful to our own interests to lose him still i am sensible and i hope others are so too that one of his late attacks is as unfounded as it is injurious to the republican cause i mean that on mr gallatin than whom there is no truer man and who after the president is the ark of our safety i have thought it material that the editor should understand that that attack has no part in the motives for what we may do for him that we do not thereby make ourselves partisans against mr gallatin but while we differ from him on that subject we retain a just sense of all his other services and will not be wanting as far as we can aid him for this purpose i have written him the enclosed answer to his letter which i send for your perusal on supposition that you concur in the sentiment and would be unwilling he should misconstrue the service you may be able to render him as an encouragement to proceed in the mischievous undertaking of writing down mr gallatin be so good as to return the paper when read and to be assured of my sincere and constant attachment and respect thomas jefferson may        monticello mr gallatin monticello may        dear sir —the interest you were so kind as to take at my request in the case of duane and the communication to you of my first letter to him entitle you to a commission of the second which will probably be the last i have ventured to quote your letter in it without giving your name and even softening some of its expressions respecting him it is possible duane may be reclaimed as to mr madison—but as to mr gallatin i despair of it that enmity took its rise from a suspicion that mr gallatin interested himself in the election of their governor against the views of duane and his friends i do not believe mr gallatin meddled in it i was in conversation with him nearly every day during the contest and i never heard him express any bias in the case the ostensible grounds of the attack on mr gallatin are all either false or futile  st they urge his conversations with john randolph but who has revealed these conversations what evidence have we of them merely some oracular sentences from j r uttered in the heat of declamation and never stated with all their circumstances for instance that a cabinet member informed him there was no cabinet but duane himself has always denied there could be a legal one besides the fact was true at that moment towit early in the session of congress i had been absent from washington from the middle of july to within three weeks of their meeting during the separation of the members there could be no consultation and between our return to washington and the meeting of congress there really had arisen nothing requiring general consultation nothing which could not be done in the ordinary way by consultation between the president and the head of the department to which the matter belonged which is the way everything is transacted which is not difficult as well as important mr gallatin might therefore have said this as innocently as truly and a malignant perversion of it was perfectly within the character of john randolph but the story of the two millions mr gallatin satisfied us that this affirmation of j r was as unauthorized as the fact itself was false it resolves itself therefore into his inexplicit letter to a committee of congress as to this my own surmise was that mr gallatin might have used some hypothethical expression in conversing on that subject which j r made a positive one and he being a duellist and mr gallatin with a wife and children depending on him for their daily subsistence the latter might wish to avoid collision and insult from such a man but they say he was hostile to me this is false i was indebted to nobody for more cordial aid than to mr gallatin nor could any man more solicitously interest himself in behalf of another than he did of myself his conversations with erskine are objected as meddling out of his department why then do they not object to mr smiths with rose the whole nearly of that negotiation as far as it was transacted verbally was by mr smith the business was in this way explained informally and on understandings thus obtained mr madison and myself shaped our formal proceedings in fact the harmony among us was so perfect that whatever instrument appeared most likely to effect the object was always used without jealousy mr smith happened to catch mr roses favor and confidence at once we perceived that rose would open himself more frankly to him than to mr madison and we therefore made him the medium of obtaining an understanding of mr rose mr gallatins support of the bank has i believe been disapproved by many he was not in congress when that was established and therefore had never committed himself publicly on the constitutionality of that institution nor do i recollect ever to have heard him declare himself on it i know he derived immense convenience from it because they gave the effect of ubiquity to his money wherever deposited money in new orleans or maine was at his command and by their agency transformed in an instant into money in london in paris amsterdam or canton he was therefore cordial to the bank i often press him to divide the public deposits among all the respectable banks being indignant myself at the open hostility of that institution to a government on whose treasures they were fattening but his repugnance to it prevented my persisting and if he was in favour of the bank—what is the amount of that crime or error in which he had a majority save one in each house of congress as participators yet on these facts endeavours are made to drive from the administration the ablest man except the president himself because he is unwilling to part with so able a counsellor i believe duane to be a very honest man and sincerely republican but his passions are stronger than his prudence and his personal as well as general antipathies render him very intolerant these traits lead him astray and require his readers—even those who value him for his steady support of the republican cause to be on their guard against his occasional aberrations he is eager for war against england—hence his abuse of the two last congresses but the people wish for peace the reelection of the same men proves it and indeed war against bedlam would be just as rational as against europe in its present condition of total demoralization when peace becomes more losing than war we may prefer the latter on principles of pecuniary calculation but for us to attempt a war to reform all europe and bring them back to principles of morality and a respect for equal rights of nations would show us to be only maniacs of another character we should indeed have the merit of the good intentions as well as the folly of the hero of la mancha—but i am getting beyond the object of my letter and will therefore here close it with assurances of my great esteem and respect thomas jefferson may        monticello mr gallatin monticello may        i have rejoiced to see ritchie declare himself in favor of the president on the late attack against him and wish he may do the same as to mr gallatin i am sure he would if his information was full i have not an intimacy with him which might justify my writing to him directly but the enclosed letter to you is put into such a form as might be shown to him if you think proper to do so perhaps the facts stated in it probably unknown to him may have some effect but do in this as you think best be so good as to return the letter to duane being my only copy and to be assured of my affectionate esteem and respect he wrote too to madison thomas jefferson apr       monticello madison monticello apr       dear sir —yours of the   th is received i have carefully examined my letter files from july   0  to this day  find among them no such anonymous letter as you mention indeed the strong impression on my memory is that i never received an anonymous letter from england or from any other country than our own certain newspapers are taking a turn which gives me uneasiness before i was aware of it i was led to an interference which tho from just motives i should not at a later moment have shaped exactly as i did i cannot therefore repress the desire to communicate it fully to you on the   th of march i received a friendly letter from duane informing me of the distress into which he had been thrown by his former friends lieper  clay withdrawing their endorsements for him at the banks the latter expressly for his attacks on john randolph the former without assigning any particular cause  he concluded by asking whether in virginia where he had been flattered by the support of his paper  0 gentlemen could not be found who would advance him their hundred dollars apiece to be repaid at short periods i immediately engaged mr peter carr here  mr wirt in richmond to set the experiment afoot  one of these engaged a friend in baltimore to do the same but i mentioned to these gentlemen that to apprise duane of the grounds on which we interested ourselves for him to wit his past services to the cause of republicanism  that he might not mistake it as an approbation of his late attacks on mr gallatin of which we unequivocally disapproved i would write him a letter i accordingly wrote him the one now inclosed which i previously communicated to messrs carr  wirt it did not leave this till the  st of april the thing was going on hopefully enough when his papers of the  th   th arrived here the latter written probably after he had received my letter the effect at baltimore i have not learned but every person who had offered here or at richmond to join in aiding him immediately withdrew considering him as unequivocally joining the banners of the opposition federal or factious i have to give an account of this to duane but am waiting in expectation of an answer to mine of march    in that i shall make one effort more to reclaim him from the dominion of his passions but i expect it will be the last and as unavailing as the former i could not be satisfied until i informed you of this transaction and must even request you to communicate it to mr gallatin for altho the just tribute rendered him in the letter was certainly never meant to meet his eyes yet it is there among other things it must go to him ritchie has been under hesitation his paper of the   th decides his course as to yourself and i propose to set him to rights as to mr gallatin through a letter to wirt in which i shall expose the falsehood or futility of the facts they have harped upon all this however is confidential to yourself  mr gallatin because while i wish to do justice to truth i wish also to avoid newspaper observation with respect to the opposition threatened altho it may give some pain no injury of consequence is to be apprehended duane flying off from the government may for a little while throw confusion into our ranks as john randolph did but after a moment of time to reflect  rally  to see where he is we shall stand our ground with firmness a few malcontents will follow him as they did john randolph  perhaps he may carry off some well meaning antisnyderites of pennsylvania the federalists will sing hosannas  the world will thus know of a truth what they are this new minority will perhaps bring forward their new favorite who seems already to have betrayed symptoms of consent they will blast him in the bud which will be no misfortune they will sound the tocsin against the antient dominion and antidominionism may become their rallying point and it is better that all this should happen two than six years hence disregarding all this i am sure you will pursue steadily your own wise plans that peace with the great belligerents at least will be preserved until it becomes more losing than war  that the total extinction of the national debt  liberation of our revenues for defence in war and improvement in peace will seal your retirement with the blessings of your country for all this  for your health  happiness i pray to god fervently p s be so good as to return the inclosed as i have no other copy   from randalls life of jefferson iii       from the original in the possession of the virginia historical society   jefferson further wrote to stuart thomas jefferson nov       monticello stuart monticello nov       dear sir —we have safely received the cask of timothy seed as also the very excellent parcel of butter which you have been so kind as to send us for which be pleased to accept my thanks or properly request you to tender them with my respects to mrs stuart you have day since seen the most excellent national  dignified message of the president  the documents accompanying it in these you see the british government have openly avowed that they will enforce their orders of council that is will keep exclusive possession of the ocean until france will allow her manufactures to go in the ships of other nations into the continent of europe  france herself altho she does not permit even in time of peace the manufactures of any nation to be brought to england in other ships but of the nation manufacturing them in the meantime she is taking all our vessels which is all the war she can make on her side and indeed the style of fosters correspondence is altogether a style of defiance always affectionately yours   concerning this letter jefferson wrote to benjamin rush thomas jefferson jan       monticello benjamin rush monticello jan       dear sir —as it is through your kind interposition that two old friends are brought together you have a right to know how the first approaches are made i send you therefore a copy of mr adams letter to me  of my answer to avoid the subject of his family on which i could say nothing i have written him a rambling gossiping epistle which gave openings for the expression of sincere feelings  may furnish him ground of reciprocation if he merely waited for the first declaration for so i would construe the reserve of his letter in the course of the spring i can have a good occasion of writing to him again on sending him a law case of livingstons against myself which having been dismissed out of court for want of jurisdiction remains unexplained to the world this explanation i shall print for my own justification and a copy may not be unamusing to one who is himself a profound lawyer   the following is the paper alluded to my acqce with mr henry commenced in the winter of     – 0 on my way to college i passed the xmas holidays at colo dandridges in hanover to whom mr henry was a near neighbor during the festivity of the season i met him in society every day  we became well acquainted altho i was much his junior being then but in my   th year  he a married man the spring following he came to wmsbg to obtain a license as a lawyer  he called on me at college he told me he had been reading law only   weeks two of the examiners however peyton  john randolph men of great facility of temper signed his license with as much reluctance as their dispositions would permit them to shew mr wythe absolutely refused rob c nicholas refused also at first but on repeated importunities and promises of future reading he signed these facts i had afterwds from the gentlemen themselves the two randolphs acknoleging he was very ignorant of law but that they perceived him to be a young man of genius  did not doubt he would soon qualify himself he was some time after elected a representative of the county of hanover and brought himself into public notice on the following occasion which i think took place in      or a year sooner or later the gentlemen of this country had at that time become deeply involved in that state of indebtment which has since ended in so general a crush of their fortunes robinson the speaker was also treasurer an officer always chosen by the assembly he was an excellent man liberal friendly and rich he had been drawn in to lend on his own account great sums of money to persons of this description  especially those who were of the assembly he used freely for this purpose the public money confiding for its replacement in his own means  the securities he had taken on those loans about this time however he became sensible that his deficit to the public was become so enormous as that a discovery must soon take place for as yet the public had no suspicion of it he devised therefore with his friends in the assembly a plan for a public loan office to a certain amount from which monies might be lent on public acct  on good landed security to individuals this was accordingly brought forward in the house of burgesses and had it succeeded the debts due to robinson on these loans would have been transferred to the public  his deficit thus compleetly covered this state of things however was not yet known but mr henry attacked the scheme on other general grounds in that style of bold grand and overwhelming eloquence for which he became so justly celebrated afterwds he carried with him all the members of the upper counties and left a minority composed merely of the aristocracy of the country from this time his popularity swelled apace  robinson dying   years after his deficit was brought to light  discovered the true object of the proposition the next great occasion on which he signalised himself was that which may be considered as the dawn of the revoln in march      the british parliament had passed resolns preparatory to the levying a revenue on the colonies by a stamp tax the virginia assembly at their next session prepared  sent to england very elaborate representns addressed in separate forms to the king lords and commons against the right to impose such taxes the famous stamp act was however past in jan      and in the session of the virgi assembly of may following mr henry introduced the celebrated resolns of that date these were drawn by george johnson a lawyer of the northern neck a very able logical and correct speaker mr henry moved and johnston seconded these resolns successively they were opposed by randolph blood pendleton nicholas wythe  all the old members whose influence in the house had till then been unbroken they did it not from any question of our rights but on the ground that the same sentiments had been at their preceding session expressed in a more conciliatory form to which the answers were not yet received but torrents of sublime eloquence from mr henry backed up by the solid reasoning of johnston prevailed the last however  strongest resoln was carried but by a single vote the debate on it was most bloody i was then but a student and was listening at the door of the lobby for as yet there was no gallery when peyton randolph after the vote came out of the house and said as he entered the lobby by god i would have given  00 guineas for a single vote for as this would have divided the house the vote of robinson the speaker would have rejected the resolution mr henry left town that evening and the next morning before the meeting of the house i saw peter randolph then of the council but who had formerly been clerk in the house for an hour or two at the clerks table searching the old journals for a precedent while he was clerk of a resolution of the house erased from the journals by a subsequent order of the house whether he found it or not i do not remember but when the house met a motion was made  carried to erase that resoln and there being at that day but one printer  he entirely under the controul of the governor i do not know that this resoln ever appeared in print i write this from memory but the impression made on me at the time was such as to fix the facts indelibly in my mind i came into the legislature as a burgess for albemarle in the winter of       on the accession of ld botetourt to the government and about   years after mr henry had entered on the stage of public life the exact conformity of our political opinions strengthened our friendship and indeed the old leaders of the house being substantially firm we had not after this any differences of open in the h of b on matters of principles tho sometimes on matters of form we were dissolved by ld botetourt at our first session but all were reelected there being no divisions among us occasions became very rare for any display of mr hs eloquence in ordinary business he was a very inefficient member he could not draw a bill on the most simple subject which wd bear legal criticism or even the ordinary criticism which looks to correctness of style  ideas for indeed there was no accuracy of idea in his head his imagination was copious poetical sublime but vague also he said the strongest things in the finest language but without logic without arrangement desultoryly this appeared eminently  in a mortifying degree in the  st session of the  st congress which met in sep      mr henry  richard henry lee took at once the lead in that assembly and by the high style of their eloquence were in the first days of the session looked up to as primi inter pares a petition to the king an address to the people of g britain and a memorial to the people of british america were agreed to be drawn lee henry  others were appointed for the first  lee livingston  jay for the two last the splendor of their debut occasioned mr henry to be designated by his commee to draw the petn to the king with which they were charged and mr lee was charged with the address to the people of england the last was first reported on reading it every countenance fell and a dead silence ensued for many minutes at length it was laid on the table for perusal and considn till the next day when first one member and then another arose  paying some faint compliment to the composition observed that there were still certain considerns not expressed in it which should properly find a place in it at length mr livingston the govr of n j a member of the commee rose and observed that a friend of his had been sketching what he had thought might be proper for such an address from which he thought some paragraphs might be advantageously introduced into the draught proposed and he read an address which mr jay had prepared de bene ese as it were there was but one sentiment of admirn the address was recommitted for amendment and mr jays draught reported  adopted with scarce any altern these facts were stated to me by mr pendleton and colo harrison of our own delegation except that colo harrison ascribed the draught to govr livingston  were afterwards confirmed to me by govr livingston  i will presently mention an anecdote confirmative of them from mr jay and r h lee themselves mr henrys draught of a petn to the king was equally unsuccessful and was recommitted for amendment mr john dickenson was added to the commee  a new draught prepared by him was passed the occasion of my learning from mr jay that he was the author of the address to the people of gr britain requires explanation by a statement of some preceding circumstances the  d session of the  st congress met on their own adjmt in may      peyton randolph was their president in the mean time ld norths conciliatory proposns came over to be laid by the governors before their legislatures ld dunmore accdly called that of virginia to meet in june this obliged p randolph as speaker to return our other old members being at congress he pressed me to draw the answer to ld norths proposn i accdly did so and it passed with a little softening of some expressions for which the times were not yet ripe  wiredrawing  weakening some others to satisfy individuals i had been appointed to go on to congress in place of peyton randolph  proceed immediately charged with presenting this answer to congress as it was the first which had been given and the tone of it was strong the members were pleased with it hoping it would have a good effect on the answers of the other states a commee which had been appointed to prepare a declaration to be published by genl washington on his arrival at the army having reported one it was committed  dickinson  myself added to the commee on the adjournment of the house happening to go out with govr livingston one of the commee i expressed to him my hope he would draw the declaration he modestly excused himself  expressed his wish that i would do it but urging him with considerable importunity he at length said you  i sir are but new acquaintances what can have excited so earnest a desire on your part that i should be the draughtsman why sir said i i have been informed you drew the address to the people of gr brit i think it the first composition in the english language  therefore am anxious this declaration should be prepared by the same pen he replied that i might have been misinformed on that subject a few days after being in conversation with r h lee in congress till a little before the meeting of the house mr jay observing us came up  taking r h lee by a button of the coat said to him pretty sternly i understand sir that you informed this gentleman that the address to the people of gr br presented to the commee by me was drawn by govr livingston the fact was that the commee having consisted of only lee livingston who was fathin  of jay  jay himself  lees draught having been rejected  jays approved so unequivocally his suspicions naturally fell on lee as the author of the report  the rather as they had daily much sparring in congress lee being firm in the revolutionary measures and jay hanging heavily on their rear i immediately stopped mr jay and assured him that tho i had indeed been so informed it was not by mr lee whom i had never heard utter a word on the subject i found mr henry to be a silent  almost unmeddling member in congress on the original opening of that body while general grievances were the topics he was in his element  captivated all by his bold  splendid eloquence but as soon as they came to specific matters to sober reasoning and solid argumentation he had the good sense to perceive that his declamation however excellent in its proper place had no weight at all in such an assembly as that of coolheaded reflecting judicious men he ceased therefore in a great measure to take any part in the business he seemed indeed very tired of the place  wonderfully relieved when by appointment of the virginia convention to be colo of their  st regiment he was permitted to leave congress about the last of july how he acquitted himself in his military command will be better known from others he was relieved from his position again by being appointed governor on the first organization of the government after my service as his successor in the same office my appointment to congress in      mission to europe in     appointment in the new govmt in    kept us so far apart that i had no further personal knolege of him mr henry began his career with very little property he acted as i have understood as barkeeper in the tavern at hanover c h for sometime he married very young settled i believe at a place called the roundabout in louisa got credit for some little store of merchandize but very soon failed from this he turned his views to the law for the acquisition or practice of which however he was too lazy whenever the courts were closed for the winter session he would make up a party of poor hunters of his neighborhood would go off with them to the pinywoods of fluvanna and pass weeks in hunting deer of which he was passionately fond sleeping under a tent before a fire wearing the same shirt the whole time  covering all the dirt of his dress with a huntingshirt he never undertook to draw pleadings if he could avoid it or to manage that part of a cause  very unwillingly engaged but as an assistant to speak in the cause and the fee was an indispensable preliminary observing to the applicant that he kept no accounts never putting pen to paper wch was true his powers over a jury were so irresistible that he received great fees for his services  had the reputation of being insatiable in money after about  0 years practice in the country courts he came to the genl court where however being totally unqualified for anything but mere jury causes he devoted himself to these  chiefly to the criminal business from these poor devils it was always understood that he squeezed exorbitant fees of  0  00   00 from this source he made his great profits  they were said to be great his other business exclusive of the criminal would never i am sure pay the expenses of his attendance he now purchased from mr lomax the valuable estate on the waters of smiths river to which he afterwards removed the purchase was on long credit  finally paid in depreciated paper not worth oak leaves about the close of the war he engaged in the yazoo speculation  bought up a great deal of depreciated paper at       in the pound to pay for it at the close of the war many of us wished to reopen all accounts which had been paid in depreciated money and have them settled by the scale of depreciation but on this he frowned most indignantly  knowing the general indisposition of the legislature it was considered hopeless to attempt it with such an opponent at their head as henry i believe he never distinguished himself so much as on the similar question of british debts in the case of jones  walker he had exerted a degree of industry in that case totally foreign to his character and not only seemed but had made himself really learned on the subject another of the great occasions on which he exhibited examples of eloquence such as probably had never been exceeded was on the question of adopting the new constitution in      to this he was most violently opposed as is well known and after its adoption he continued hostile to it expressing more than any other man in the u s his thorough contempt  hatred of genl washington from being the most violent of all antifederalists however he was brought over to the new constitution by his yazoo speculation before mentioned the georgia legislature having declared that transaction fraudulent  void the depreciated paper which he had bought up to pay for the yazoo purchase was likely to remain on his hands worth nothing but hamiltons founding system came most opportunely to his relief and suddenly raised his paper from    to     the pound hamilton became now his idol and abandoning the republican advocates of the constitution the federal government on federal principles became his political creed genl washington flattered him by an appointment to a mission to spain which he declined  by proposing to him the office of secretary of state on the most earnest sollicitations of genl henry lee who pledged himself that henry should not accept it for genl washington knew that he was entirely unqualified for it  moreover that his selfesteem had never suffered him to act as second to any man on earth i had this fact from information but that of the mission to spain is of my own knolege because after my retiring from the office of secy of state genl washington passed the papers to mr henry through my hands mr henrys apostacy sunk him to nothing in the estimation of his country he lost at once all that influence which federalism had hoped by cajoling him to transfer with him to itself and a man who thro a long  active life had been the idol of his country beyond any one that ever lived descended to the grave with less than its indifference and verified the saying of the philosopher that no man must be called happy till he is dead printed in the philadelphia age july      from the original manuscript in the office of the paper it was sharply criticised in the new york world of august   and        by william wirt henry   called sulla   the two following letters of jefferson to eppes continue the subject of this thomas jefferson sep         poplar for eppes poplar for sep         dear sir —i turn with great reluctance from the functions of a private citizen to matters of state the swaggering on deck as a passenger is so much more pleasant than clambering the ropes as a seaman  my confidence in the skill  activity of those employed to work the vessel is so entire that i notice nothing en passant but how smoothly she moves yet i avail myself of the leisure which a visit to this place procures me to revolve again in my mind the subject of my former letter  in compliance with the request of yours of to add some further thoughts on it though intended as supplemental to that i may fall into repetitions not having that with me nor paper or book of any sort to supply the defect of a memory on the wane the objects of finance in the us have hitherto been very simple merely to provide for the support of the govmt on its peace establishment  to pay the debt contracted in the revolutionary war a war which will be sanctioned by the approbation of posterity through all future ages the means provided for these objects were ample and resting on a consumption which little affected the poor may be said to have been sensibly felt by none the fondest wish of my heart ever was that the surplus portion of these taxes destined for the payment of that debt should when that object was accomplished be continued by annual or biennial reenactments and applied in time of peace to the improvement of our country by canals roads and useful institutions literary or others and in time of war to the maintenance of the war and i believe that keeping the civil list within proper bounds the surplus would have been sufficient for any war administered with integrity and judgment for authority to apply the surplus to objects of improvement an amendment of the constitution would have been necessary i have said that the taxes should be continued by annual or biennial reenactments because a constant hold by the nation of the strings of the public purse is a salutary restraint from which an honest government ought not to wish nor a corrupt one to be permitted to be free no tax should ever be yielded for a longer term than that of the congress wanting it except when pledged for the reimbursement of a loan on this system the standing income being once liberated from the revolutionary debt no future loan nor future tax would ever become necessary and wars would no otherwise affect our pecuniary interests than by suspending the improvements belonging to a state of peace this happy consummation would have been achieved by another eight years administration conducted by mr madison and executed in its financial department by mr gallatin could peace have been so long preserved so enviable a state in prospect for our country induced me to temporize and to bear with national wrongs which under no other prospect ought ever to have been unresented or unresisted my hope was that by giving time for reflection and retraction of injury a sound calculation of their own interests would induce the aggressing nations to redeem their own character by a return to the practice of right but our lot happens to have been cast in an age when two nations to whom circumstances have given a temporary superiority over others the one by land the other by sea throwing off all restraints of morality all pride of national character forgetting the mutability of fortune and the inevitable doom which the laws of nature pronounce against departure from justice individual or national have dared to treat her reclamations with derision and to set up force instead of reason as the umpire of nations degrading themselves thus from the character of lawful societies into lawless bands of robbers and pirates they are abusing their brief ascendency by desolating the world with blood and rapine against such a banditti war had become less ruinous than peace for then peace was a war on one side only on the final and formal declarations of england therefore that she never would repeal her orders of council as to us until those of france should be repealed as to other nations as well as us and that no practicable arrangement against her impressment of our seamen could be proposed or devised war was justly declared and ought to have been declared this change of condition has clouded our prospects of liberation from debt and of being able to carry on a war without new loans or taxes but although deferred these prospects are not desperate we should keep forever in view the state of      towards which we were advancing and consider it as that which we must attain let the old funds continue appropriated to the civil list and revolutionary debt and the reversion of the surplus to improvement during peace and let us take up this war as a separate business for which substantive and distinctive provision is to be made that we are bound to defray its expenses within our own time and unauthorized to burden posterity with them i suppose to have been proved in my former letter i will place the question nevertheless in one additional point of view the former regarded their independent right over the earth this over their own persons there have existed nations and civilized and learned nations who have thought that a father had a right to sell his child as a slave in perpetuity that he could alienate his body and industry conjointly and a fortiori his industry separately and consume its fruits himself a nation asserting this fratricide right might well suppose they could burthen with public as well as private debt their nati natorum et qui nascentur at illis but we this age and in this country especially are advanced beyond those notions of natural law we acknowledge that our children are born free that that freedom is the gift of nature and not of him who begot them that though under our care during infancy and therefore of necessity under a duly tempered authority that care is confided to us to be exercised for the preservation and good of the child only and his labors during youth are given as a retribution for the charges of infancy as he was never the property of his father so when adult he is sui juris entitled himself to the use of his own limbs and the fruits of his own exertions so far we are advanced without mind enough it seems to take the whole step we believe or we act as if we believed that although an individual father cannot alienate the labor of his son the aggregate body of fathers may alienate the labor of all their sons of their posterity in the aggregate and oblige them to pay for all the enterprises just or unjust profitable or ruinous into which our vices our passions or our personal interests may lead us but i trust that this proposition needs only to be looked at by an american to be seen in its true point of view and that we shall all consider ourselves unauthorized to saddle posterity with our debts and morally bound to pay them ourselves and consequently within what may be deemed the period of a generation or the life of the majority in my former letter i supposed this to be a little over twenty years we must raise then ourselves the money for this war either by taxes within the year or by loans and if by loans we must repay them ourselves proscribing forever the english practice of perpetual funding the ruinous consequences of which putting right out of the question should be a sufficient warning to a considerate nation to avoid the example the raising money by tontine more practised on the continent of europe than in england is liable to the same objection of encroachment on the independent rights of posterity because the annuities not expiring gradually with the lives on which they rest but all on the death of the last survivor only they will of course overpass the term of a generation and the more probably as the subjects on whose lives the annuities depend are generally chosen of the ages constitutions and occupations most favorable to long life annuities for single lives are also beyond our powers because the single life may pass the term of a generation this last practice is objectionable too as encouraging celibacy and the disinherison of heirs of the modes which are within the limits of right that of raising within the year its whole expenses by taxation might be beyond the abilities of our citizens to bear it is moreover generally desirable that the public contributions should be as uniform as practicable from year to year that our habits of industry and of expense may become adapted to them and that they may be duly digested and incorporated with our annual economy there remains then for us but the method of limited anticipation the laying taxes for a term of years within that of our right which may be sold for a present sum equal to the expenses of the year in other words to obtain a loan equal to the expenses of the year laying a tax adequate to its interest and to such a surplus as will reimburse by growing instalments the whole principal within the term this is in fact what has been called raising money on the sale of annuities for years in this way a new loan and of course a new tax is requisite every year during the continuance of the war and should that be so long as to produce an accumulation of tax beyond our ability in time of war the resource would be an enactment of the taxes requisite to ensure good terms by securing the lender with a suspension of the payment of instalments of principal and perhaps of interest also until the restoration of peace this method of anticipating our taxes or of borrowing on annuities for years insures repayment to the lender guards the rights of posterity prevents a perpetual alienation of the public contributions and consequent destitution of every resource even for the ordinary support of government the public expenses of england during the present reign have amounted to the fee simple value of the whole island if its whole soil could be sold farm by farm for its present market price it would not defray the cost of governing it during the reign of the present king as managed by him ought not then the right of each successive generation to be guarantied against the dissipations and corruptions of those preceding by a fundamental provision in our constitution and if that has not been made does it exist the less there being between generation and generation as between nation and nation no other law than that of nature and is it the less dishonest to do what is wrong because not expressly prohibited by written law let us hope our moral principles are not yet in that stage of degeneracy and that in instituting the system of finance to be hereafter pursued we shall adopt the only safe the only lawful and honest one of borrowing on such short terms of reimbursement of interest and principal as will fall within the accomplishment of our own lives the question will be asked and ought to be looked at what is to be the resource if loans cannot be obtained there is but one carthago delenda est bank paper must be suppressed and the circulating medium must be restored to the nation to whom it belongs it is the only fund on which they can rely for loans it is the only resource which can never fail them and it is an abundant one for every necessary purpose treasury bills bottomed on taxes bearing or not bearing interest as may be found necessary thrown into circulation will take the place of so much gold and silver which last when crowded will find an efflux into other countries and thus keep the quantum of medium at its salutary level let banks continue if they please but let them discount for cash alone or for treasury notes they discount for cash alone in every other country on earth except great britain and her too often unfortunate copyist the united states if taken in time they may be rectified by degrees and without injustice but if let alone till the alternative forces itself on us of submitting to the enemy for want of funds or the suppression of bank paper either by law or convulsion we cannot foresee how it will end the remaining questions are mathematical only how are the taxes and the time of their continuance to be proportioned to the sum borrowed and the stipulated interest the rate of interest will depend on the state of the money market and the duration of the tax on the will of the legislature let us suppose that to keep the taxes as low as possible they adopt the term of twenty years for reimbursement which we call their maximum and let the interest they last gave of  ½ per cent be that which they must expect to give the problem then will stand in this form given the sum borrowed which call s a million of dollars for example the rate of interest 0   or    00 call it r—i and the duration of the annuity or tax twenty years   t what will be a the annuity or tax which will reimburse principal and interest within the given term this problem laborious and barely practicable to common arithmetic is readily enough solved algebraically and with the aid of logarithms the theorem applied to the case is a  tr    ×      rt the solution of which gives a         nearly  00000 or   0 of the sum borrowed it may be satisfactory to see stated in figures the yearly progression of reimbursement of the million of dollars and their interest at  ½ per cent effected by the regular payment of — dollars annually it will be as follows borrowed  000000 balance after  st paymt    000 balance after   th paymt     00 balance after  d paymt        balance after   th paymt      0 balance after  d paymt        balance after   th paymt        balance after  th

are curious to know the effect of the same annual sum on loans at lower rates of interest the following process will give it from the logarithm of a substract the logarithm r—i and from the number of the remaining logarithm substract s then substract the logarithm of this last remainder from the difference between the logarithm a and logarithm r—i as found before divide the remainder by logarithm r the quotient will be t it will be found that — dollars will reimburse a million    years   dollars at  ½ per cent interest in      costing in the whole     000   per cent interest in      costing in the whole     000  ½ per cent interest in      costing in the whole     000   per cent interest in      costing in the whole     000  ½ per cent interest in      costing in the whole     000   per cent interest in      costing in the whole    0000 0 per cent interest in  0 costing in the whole  000000 by comparing the  st and the last of these articles we see that if the united states were in possession of the circulating medium as they ought to be they could redeem what they could borrow from that dollar for dollar and in ten annual instalments whereas the usurpation of that fund by bank paper obliging them to borrow elsewhere at  ½ per cent two dollars are required to reimburse one so that it is literally true that the toleration of banks of paperdiscount costs the united states onehalf their war taxes or in other words doubles the expenses of every war now think but for a moment what a change of condition that would be which should save half our war expenses require but half the taxes and enthral us in debt but half the time two loans having been authorized of sixteen and seven and a half millions they will require for their due reimbursement two millions three hundred and fifty thousand dollars of the three millions expected from the taxes lately imposed when the produce shall be known of the several items of these taxes such of them as will make up this sum should be selected appropriated and pledged for the reimbursement of these loans the balance of six hundred and fifty thousand dollars will be provision for  ½ millions of the loan of the next year and in all future loans i would consider it as a rule never to be departed from to lay a tax of   0 and pledge it for the reimbursement in the preceding calculations no account is taken of the increasing population of the united states which we know to be in a compound ratio of more than   per cent per annum nor of the increase of wealth proved to be in a higher ratio by the increasing productiveness of the imports on consumption we shall be safe therefore in considering every tax as growing at the rate of   per cent compound ratio annually i say every tax for as to those on consumption the fact is known and the same growth will be found in the value of real estate if valued annually or which would be better   per cent might be assumed by the law as the average increase and an addition of     of the tax paid the preceding year be annually called for supposing then a tax laid which would bring in  00000 at the time it is laid and that it increases annually at the rate of   per cent compound its important effect may be seen in the following statement the  st year  0 0 0 and reduces the million to    000  d year  0 0 0 and reduces the million to      0  d year  0     and reduces the

per cent but if obtained from the circulation without interest it would be reimbursed within eight years and eight months instead of fourteen years or of twenty years on our first estimate but this view being in prospect only should not affect the quantum of tax which the former calculation pronounces necessary our creditors have a right to certainty and to consider these political speculations as makeweights only to that and at our risk not theirs to us belongs only the comfort of hoping an earlier liberation than that calculation holds out and the right of providing expressly that the tax hypothecated shall cease so soon as the debt it secures shall be actually reimbursed and i will add that to us belongs also the regret that improvident legislators should have exposed us to a twenty years thraldom of debt and taxes for the necessary defence of our country where the same contributions would have liberated us in eight or nine years or have reduced us perhaps to an abandonment of our rights by their abandonment of the only resource which could have ensured their maintenance i omit many considerations of detail because they will occur to yourself and my letter is too long already i can refer you to no book as treating of this subject fully and suitably to our circumstances smith gives the history of the public debt of england and some views adapted to that and dr price in his book on annuities has given a valuable chapter on the effects of a sinking fund but our business being to make every loan tax a sinking fund for itself no general one will be wanting and if my confidence is well founded that our original import when freed from the revolutionary debt will suffice to embellish and improve our country in peace and defend her in war the present may be the only occasion of perplexing ourselves with sinking funds should the injunctions under which i laid you as to my former letter restrain any useful purpose to which you could apply it i remove them preferring public benefit to all personal considerations my original disapprobation of banks circulating paper is not unknown nor have i since observed any effects either on the morals or fortunes of our citizens which are any counterbalance for the public evils produced and a thorough conviction that if this war continues that circulation must be suppressed or the government shaken to its foundation by the weight of taxes and impractibility to raise funds on them renders duty to that paramount to the love of ease and quiet when i was here in may last i left it without knowing that francis was at school in this neighborhood as soon as i returned on the present occasion i sent for him but his tutor informed me that he was gone on a visit to you i shall hope permission for him always to see me on my visits to this place which are three or four times a year thomas jefferson november        monticello eppes monticello november        dear sir —i had not expected to have troubled you again on the subject of finance but since the date of my last i have received from mr law a letter covering a memorial on that subject which from its tenor i conjecture must have been before congress at their two last sessions this paper contains two propositions the one for issuing treasury notes bearing interest and to be circulated as money the other for the establishment of a national bank the first was considered in my former letter and the second shall be the subject of the present the scheme is for congress to establish a national bank suppose of thirty millions capital of which they shall contribute ten millions in new six per cent stock the states ten millions and individuals ten millions one half of the two last contributions to be of a similar stock for which the parties are to give cash to congress the whole however to be under the exclusive management of the individual subscribers who are to name all the directors neither congress nor the states having any power of interference in its administration discounts are to be at five per cent but the profits are expected to be seven per cent congress then will be paying six per cent on twenty millions and receiving seven per cent on ten millions being its third of the institution so that on the ten millions cash which they receive from the states and individuals they will in fact have to pay but five per cent interest this is the bait the charter is proposed to be for forty or fifty years and if any future augmentations should take place the individual proprietors are to have the privilege of being the sole subscribers for that congress are further allowed to issue to the amount of three millions of notes bearing interest which they are to receive back in payment for lands at a premium of five or ten per cent or as subscriptions for canals roads and bridges in which undertakings they are of course to be engaged this is a summary of the case as i understand it but it is very possible i may not understand it in all its parts these schemes being always made unintelligible for the gulls who are to enter into them the advantages and disadvantages shall be noted promiscuously as they occur leaving out the speculation of canals c which being an episode only in the scheme may be omitted to disentangle it as much as we can   congress are to receive five millions from the states if they will enter into this partnership which few probably will and five millions from the individual subscribers in exchange for ten millions of six per cent stock one per cent of which however they will make on their ten millions of stock remaining in bank and so reduce it in effect to a loan of ten millions at five per cent interest this is good but   they authorize this bank to throw into circulation ninety millions of dollars three times the capital which increases our circulating medium fifty per cent depreciates proportionably the present value of a dollar and raises the price of all future purchases in the same proportion   this loan of ten millions at five per cent is to be once for all only neither the terms of the scheme nor their own prudence could ever permit them to add to the circulation in the same or any other way for the supplies of the succeeding years of the war these succeeding years then are to be left unprovided for and the means of doing it in a great measure precluded   the individual subscribers on paying their own five millions of cash to congress become the depositories of ten millions of stock belonging to congress five millions belonging to the states and five millions to themselves say twenty millions with which as no one has a right ever to see their books or to ask a question they may choose their time for running away after adding to their booty the proceeds of as much of their own notes as they shall be able to throw into circulation   the subscribers may be one two or three or more individuals many single individuals being able to pay in the five millions whereupon this bank oligarchy or monarchy enters the field with ninety millions of dollars to direct and control the politics of the nation and of the influence of these institutions on our politics and into what scale it will be thrown we have had abundant experience indeed england herself may be the real while her friend and trustee here shall be the nominal and sole subscriber   this state of things is to be fastened on us without the power of relief for forty or fifty years that is to say the eight millions of people now existing for the sake of receiving one dollar and twentyfive cents apiece at five per cent interest are to subject the fifty millions of people who are to succeed them within that term to the payment of fortyfive millions of dollars principal and interest which will be payable in the course of the fifty years   but the great and national advantage is to be the relief of the present scarcity of money which is produced and proved by   the additional industry created to supply a variety of articles for the troops ammunition c   by the cash sent to the frontiers and the vacuum occasioned in the trading towns by that   by the late loans   by the necessity of recurring to shavers with good paper which the existing banks are not able to take up and   by the numerous applications of bank charters showing that an increase of circulating medium is wanting let us examine these causes and proofs of the want of an increase of medium one by one   the additional industry created to supply a variety of articles for troops ammunition c now i had always supposed that war produced a diminution of industry by the number of hands it withdraws from industrious pursuits for employment in arms c which are totally unproductive and if it calls for new industry in the articles of ammunition and other military supplies the hands are borrowed from other branches on which the demand is slackened by the war so that it is but a shifting of these hands from one pursuit to another   the cash sent to the frontiers occasions a vacuum in the trading towns which requires a new supply let us examine what are the calls for money to the frontiers not for clothing tents ammunition arms which are all bought in the trading towns not for provisions for although these are bought partly in the immediate country bank bills are more acceptable there than even in the trading towns the pay of the army calls for some cash but not a great deal as bank notes are as acceptable with the military men perhaps more so and what cash is sent must find its way back again in exchange for the wants of the upper from the lower country for we are not to suppose that cash stays accumulating there forever   this scarcity has been occasioned by the late loans but does the government borrow money to keep it in their coffers is it not instantly restored to circulation by payment for its necessary supplies and are we to restore a vacuum of twenty millions of dollars by an emission of ninety millions   the want of medium is proved by the recurrence of individuals with good paper to brokers at exorbitant interest and   by the numerous applications to the state governments for additional banks new york wanting eighteen millions pennsylvania ten millions c but say more correctly the speculators and spendthrifts of new york and pennsylvania but never consider them as being the states of new york and pennsylvania these two items shall be considered together it is a litigated question whether the circulation of paper rather than of specie is a good or an evil in the opinion of england and of english writers it is a good in that of all other nations it is an evil and excepting england and her copyist the united states there is not a nation existing i believe which tolerates a paper circulation the experiment is going on however desperately in england pretty boldly with us and at the end of the chapter we shall see which opinion experience approves for i believe it to be one of those cases where mercantile clamor will bear down reason until it is corrected by ruin in the meantime however let us reason on this new call for a national bank after the solemn decision of congress against the renewal of the charter of the bank of the united states and the grounds of that decision the want of constitutional power i had imagined that question at rest and that no more applications would be made to them for the incorporation of banks the opposition on that ground to its first establishment the small majority by which it was overborne and the means practiced for obtaining it cannot be already forgotten the law having passed however by a majority its opponents true to the sacred principle of submission to a majority suffered the law to flow through its term without obstruction during this the nation had time to consider the constitutional question and when the renewal was proposed they condemned it not by their representatives in congress only but by express instructions from different organs of their will here then we might stop and consider the memorial as answered but setting authority apart we will examine whether the legislature ought to comply with it even if they had the power proceeding to reason on this subject some principles must be premised as forming its basis the adequate price of a thing depends on the capital and labor necessary to produce it in the term capital i mean to include science because capital as well as labor has been employed to acquire it two things requiring the same capital and labor should be of the same price if a gallon of wine requires for its production the same capital and labor with a bushel of wheat they should be expressed by the same price derived from the application of a common measure to them the comparative prices of things being thus to be estimated and expressed by a common measure we may proceed to observe that were a country so insulated as to have no commercial intercourse with any other to confine the interchange of all its wants and supplies within itself the amount of circulating medium as a common measure for adjusting these exchanges would be quite immaterial if their circulation for instance were of a million of dollars and the annual produce of their industry equivalent to ten millions of bushels of wheat the price of a bushel of wheat might be one dollar if then by a progressive coinage their medium should be doubled the price of a bushel of wheat might become progressively two dollars and without inconvenience whatever be the proportion of the circulating medium to the value of the annual produce of industry it may be considered as the representative of that industry in the first case a bushel of wheat will be represented by one dollar in the second by two dollars this is well explained by hume and seems admitted by adam smith b   c             0 but where a nation is in a full course of interchange of wants and supplies with all others the proportion of its medium to its produce is no longer indifferent ib     to trade on equal terms the common measure of values should be as nearly as possible on a par with that of its corresponding nations whose medium is in a sound state that is to say not in an accidental state of excess or deficiency now one of the great advantages of specie as a medium is that being of universal value it will keep itself at a general level flowing out from where it is too high into parts where it is lower whereas if the medium be of local value only as paper money if too little indeed gold and silver will flow in to supply the deficiency but if too much it accumulates banishes the gold and silver not locked up in vaults and hoards and depreciates itself that is to say its proportion to the annual produce of industry being raised more of it is required to represent any particular article of produce than in other countries this is agreed by smith b   c       the principle advocate for a paper circulation but advocating it on the sole condition that it be strictly regulated he admits nevertheless that the commerce and industry of a country cannot be so secure when suspended on the dædalian wings of paper money as on the solid ground of gold and silver and that in the time of war the insecurity is greatly increased and great confusion possible where the circulation is for the greater part in paper b   c       but in a country where loans are uncertain and a specie circulation the only sure resource for them the preference of that circulation assumes a far different degree of importance as is explained in my former letters the only advantage which smith proposes by substituting paper in the room of gold and silver money b   c       is to replace an expensive instrument with one much less costly and sometimes equally convenient that is to say page     to allow the gold and silver to be sent abroad and converted into foreign goods and to substitute paper as being a cheaper measure but this makes no addition to the stock or capital of the nation the coin sent out was worth as much while in the country as the goods imported and taking its place it is only then a change of form in a part of the national capital from that of gold and silver to other goods he admits too that while a part of the goods received in exchange for the coin exported may be materials tools and provisions for the employment of an additional industry a part also may be taken back in foreign wines silks c to be consumed by idle people who produce nothing and so far the substitution promotes prodigality increases expense and corruption without increasing production so far also then it lessens the capital of the nation what may be the amount which the conversion of the part exchanged for productive goods may add to the former productive mass it is not easy to ascertain because as he says page     it is impossible to determine what is the proportion which the circulating money of any country bears to the whole value of the annual produce it has been computed by different authors from a fifth to a thirtieth of that value in the united states it must be less than in any other part of the commercial world because the great mass of their inhabitants being in responsible circumstances the great mass of their exchanges in the country is effected on credit in their merchants ledger who supplies all their wants through the year and at the end of it receives the produce of their farms or other articles of their industry it is a fact that a farmer with a revenue of ten thousand dollars a year may obtain all his supplies from his merchant and liquidate them at the end of the year by the sale of his produce to him without the intervention of a single dollar of cash this then is merely barter and in this way of barter a great portion of the annual produce of the united states is exchanged without the intermediation of cash we might safely then state our medium at the minimum of onethirtieth but what is onethirtieth of the value of the annual produce of the industry of the united states or what is the whole value of the annual produce of the united states an able writer and competent judge of the subject in      on as good grounds as probably could be taken estimated it on the then population of four and a half millions of inhabitants to be thirtyseven and a half millions sterling or one hundred and sixtyeight and threefourths millions of dollars see coopers political arithmetic page    according to the same estimate for our present population it will be three hundred millions of dollars onethirtieth of which smiths minimum would be ten millions and onefifth his maximum would be sixty millions for the quantum of circulation but suppose that instead of our needing the least circulating medium of any nation from the circumstance before mentioned we should place ourselves in the middle term of the calculation towit at thirtyfive millions onefifth of this at the least smith thinks should be retained in specie which would leave twentyeight millions of specie to be exported in exchange for other commodities and if fifteen millions of that should be returned in productive goods and not in articles of prodigality that would be the amount of capital which this operation would add to the existing mass but to what mass not that of the three hundred millions which is only its gross annual produce but to that capital of which the three hundred millions are but the annual produce but this being gross we may infer from it the value of the capital by considering that the rent of lands is generally fixed at onethird of the gross produce and is deemed its nett profit and twenty times that its fee simple value the profits on landed capital may with accuracy enough for our purpose be supposed on a par with those of other capital this would give us then for the united states a capital of two thousand millions all in active employment and exclusive of unimproved lands lying in a great degree dormant of this fifteen millions would be the hundred and thirtythird part and it is for this petty addition to the capital of the nation this minimum of one dollar added to one hundred and thirtythree and a third or threefourths per cent that we are to give up our gold and silver medium its intrinsic solidity its universal value and its saving powers in time of war and to substitute for it paper with all its train of evils moral political and physical which i will not pretend to enumerate there is another authority to which we may appeal for the proper quantity of circulating medium for the united states the old congress when we were estimated at about two millions of people on a long and able discussion june   d      decided the sufficient quantity to be two millions of dollars which sum they then emitted according to this it should be eight millions now that we are eight millions of people this differs little from smiths minimum of ten millions and strengthens our respect for that estimate there is indeed a convenience in paper its easy transmission from one place to another but this may be mainly supplied by bills of exchange so as to prevent any great displacement of actual coin two places trading together balance their dealings for the most part by their mutual supplies and the debtor individuals of either may instead of cash remit the bills of those who are creditors in the same dealings or may obtain them through some third place with which both have dealings the cases would be rare where such bills could not be obtained either directly or circuitously and too unimportant to the nation to overweigh the train of evils flowing from paper circulation from eight to thirtyfive millions then being our proper circulation and two hundred millions the actual one the memorial proposes to issue ninety millions more because it says a great scarcity of money is proved by the numerous applications for banks to wit newyork for eighteen millions pennsylvania ten millions c the answer to this shall be quoted from adam smith b   c   page     where speaking of the complaints of the trader against the scotch bankers who had already gone too far in their issues of paper he says those traders and other undertakers having got so much assistance from banks wished to get still more the banks they seem to have thought could extend their credits to whatever sum might be wanted without incurring any other expense besides that of a few reams of paper they complained of the contracted views and dastardly spirit of the directors of those banks which did not they said extend their credits in proportion to the extension of the trade of the country meaning no doubt by the extension of that trade the extension of their own projects beyond what they could carry on either with their own capital or with what they had credit to borrow of private people in the usual way of bond or mortgage the banks they seem to have thought were in honor bound to supply the deficiency and to provide them with all the capital which they wanted to trade with and again page   0 when bankers discovered that certain projectors were trading not with any capital of their own but with that which they advanced them they endeavored to withdraw gradually making every day greater and greater difficulties about discounting these difficulties alarmed and enraged in the highest degree those projectors their own distress of which this prudent and necessary reserve of the banks was no doubt the immediate occasion they called the distress of the country and this distress of the country they said was altogether owing to the ignorance pusillanimity and bad conduct of the banks which did not give a sufficiently liberal aid to the spirited undertakings of those who exerted themselves in order to beautify improve and enrich the country it was the duty of the banks they seemed to think to lend for as long a time and to as great an extent as they might wish to borrow it is probably the good paper of these projectors which the memorial says the bank being unable to discount goes into the hands of brokers who knowing the risk of this good paper discount it at a much higher rate than legal interest to the great distress of the enterprising adventurers who had rather try trade on borrowed capital than go to the plough or other laborious calling smith again says page     that the industry of scotland languished for want of money to employ it was the opinion of the famous mr law by establishing a bank of a particular kind which he seems to have imagined might issue paper to the amount of the whole value of all the lands in the country he proposed to remedy this want of money it was afterwards adopted with some variations by the duke of orleans at that time regent of france the idea of the possibility of multiplying paper to almost any extent was the real foundation of what is called the mississippi scheme the most extravagant project both of banking and stock jobbing that perhaps the world ever saw the principles upon which it was founded are explained by mr law himself in a discourse concerning money and trade which he published in scotland when he first proposed his project the splendid but visionary ideas which are set forth in that and some other works upon the same principles still continue to make an impression upon many people and have perhaps in part contributed to that excess of banking which has of late been complained of both in scotland and in other places the mississippi scheme it is well known ended in france in the bankruptcy of the public treasury the crush of thousands and thousands of private fortunes and scenes of desolation and distress equal to those of an invading army burning and laying waste all before it at the time we were funding our national debt we heard much about a public debt being a public blessing that the stock representing it was a creation of active capital for the aliment of commerce manufactures and agriculture this paradox was well adapted to the minds of believers in dreams and the gulls of that size entered bonâ fide into it but the art and mystery of banks is a wonderful improvement on that it is established on the principle that private debts are a public blessing that the evidences of those private debts called bank notes become active capital and aliment the whole commerce manufactures and agriculture of the united states here are a set of people for instance who have bestowed on us the great blessing of running in our debt about two hundred millions of dollars without our knowing who they are where they are or what property they have to pay this debt when called on nay who have made us so sensible of the blessings of letting them run in our debt that we have exempted them by law from the payment of these debts beyond a given proportion generally estimated at onethird and to fill up the measure of blessing instead of paying they receive an interest on what they owe from those to whom they owe for all the notes or evidences of what they owe which we see in circulation have been lent to somebody on an interest which is levied again on us through the medium of commerce and they are so ready still to deal out their liberalities to us that they are now willing to let themselves run in our debt ninety millions more on our paying them the same premium of six or eight per cent interest and on the same legal exemption from the repayment of more than thirty millions of the debt when it shall be called for but let us look at this principle in its original form and its copy will then be equally understood a public debt is a public blessing that our debt was juggled from fortythree up to eighty millions and funded at that amount according to this opinion was a great public blessing because the evidences of it could be vested in commerce and thus converted into active capital and then the more the debt was made to be the more active capital was created that is to say the creditors could now employ in commerce the money due them from the public and make from it an annual profit of five per cent or four millions of dollars but observe that the public were at the same time paying on it an interest of exactly the same amount of four millions of dollars where then is the gain to either party which makes it a public blessing there is no change in the state of things but of persons only a has a debt due to him from the public of which he holds their certificate as evidence and on which he is receiving an annual interest he wishes however to have the money itself and to go into business with it b has an equal sum of money in business but wishes now to retire and live on the interest he therefore gives it to a in exchange for as certificates of public stock now then a has the money to employ in business which b so employed before b has the money on interest to live on which a lived on before and the public pays the interest to b which they paid to a before here is no new creation of capital no additional money employed nor even a change in the employment of a single dollar the only change is of place between a and b in which we discover no creation of capital nor public blessing suppose again the public to owe nothing then a not having lent his money to the public would be in possession of it himself and would go into business without the previous operation of selling stock here again the same quantity of capital is employed as in the former case though no public debt exists in neither case is there any creation of active capital nor other difference than that there is a public debt in the first case and none in the last and we may safely ask which of the two situations is most truly a public blessing if then a public debt be no public blessing we may pronounce a fortiori that a private one cannot be so if the debt which the banking companies owe be a blessing to any body it is to themselves alone who are realizing a solid interest of eight or ten per cent on it as to the public these companies have banished all our gold and silver medium which before their institution we had without interest which never could have perished in our hands and would have been our salvation now in the hour of war instead of which they have given us two hundred million of froth and bubble on which we are to pay them heavy interest until it shall vanish into air as morris notes did we are warranted then in affirming that this parody on the principle of a public debt being a public blessing and its mutation into the blessing of private instead of public debts is as ridiculous as the original principle itself in both cases the truth is that capital may be produced by industry and accumulated by economy but jugglers only will propose to create it by legerdemain tricks with paper i have called the actual circulation of bank paper in the united states two hundred millions of dollars i do not recollect where i have seen this estimate but i retain the impression that i thought it just at the time it may be tested however by a list of the banks now in the united states and the amount of their capital i have no means of recurring to such a list for the present day but i turn to two lists in my possession for the years of   0  and   0  in   0  there were thirtyfour banks whose capital was    0 000 in   0  there were sixtysix consequently thirtytwo additional ones their capital is not stated but at the average of the others excluding the highest that of the united states which was of ten millions they would be of six hundred thousand dollars each and add    00000 making a total of    0 000 or say of fifty millions in round numbers now every one knows the immense multiplication of these institutions since   0  if they have only doubled their capital will be of one hundred millions and if trebled as i think probable it will be one hundred and fifty millions on which they are at liberty to circulate treble the amount i should sooner therefore believe two hundred millions to be far below than above the actual circulation in england by a late parliamentary document see virginia argus of october the   th      and other public papers of about that date it appears that six years ago the bank of england had twelve millions of pounds sterling in circulation which had increased to fortytwo millions in      or to one hundred and eightynine millions of dollars what proportion all the other banks may add to this i do not know if we were allowed to suppose they equal it this would give a circulation of three hundred and seventyeight millions or the double of ours on a double population but that nation is essentially commercial ours essentially agricultural and needing therefore less circulating medium because the produce of the husbandman comes but once a year and is then partly consumed at home partly exchanged by barter the dollar which was of four shillings and sixpence sterling was by the same document stated to be then six shillings and nine pence a depreciation of exactly fifty per cent the average price of wheat on the continent of europe at the commencement of its present war with england was about a french crown of one hundred and ten cents the bushel with us it was one hundred cents and consequently we could send it there in competition with their own that ordinary price has now doubled with us and more than doubled in england and although a part of this augmentation may proceed from the war demand yet from the extraordinary nominal rise in the prices of land and labor here both of which have nearly doubled in that period and are still rising with every new bank it is evident that were a general peace to take place tomorrow and time allowed for the reestablishment of commerce justice and order we could not afford to raise wheat for much less than two dollars while the continent of europe having no paper circulation and that of its specie not being augmented would raise it at their former price of one hundred and ten cents it follows then that with our redundancy of paper we cannot after peace send a bushel of wheat to europe unless extraordinary circumstances double its price in particular places and that then the exporting countries of europe could undersell us it is said that our paper is as good as silver because we may have silver for it at the bank where it issues this is not true one two or three persons might have it but a general application would soon exhaust their vaults and leave a ruinous proportion of their paper in its intrinsic worthless form it is a fallacious pretence for another reason the inhabitants of the banking cities might obtain cash for their paper as far as the cash of the vaults would hold out but distance puts it out of the power of the country to do this a farmer having a note of a boston or charleston bank distant hundreds of miles has no means of calling for the cash and while these calls are impracticable for the country the banks have no fear of their being made from the towns because their inhabitants are mostly on their books and there on sufferance only and during good behavior in this state of things we are called on to add ninety millions more to the circulation proceeding in this career it is infallible that we must end where the revolutionary paper ended two hundred millions was the whole amount of all the emissions of the old congress at which point their bills ceased to circulate we are now at that sum but with treble the population and of course a longer tether our depreciation is as yet but about two for one owing to the support its credit receives from the small reservoirs of specie in the vaults or the banks it is impossible to say at what point their notes will stop nothing is necessary to effect it but a general alarm and that may take place whenever the public shall begin to reflect on and perceive the impossibility that the banks should repay this sum at present caution is inspired no farther than to keep prudent men from selling property on long payments let us suppose the panic to arise at three hundred millions a point to which every session of the legislatures hasten us by long strides nobody dreams that they would have three hundred millions of specie to satisfy the holders of their notes were they even to stop now no one supposes they have two hundred millions in cash or even the sixtysix and twothird millions to which amount alone the law compels them to repay one hundred and thirtythree and onethird millions of loss then is thrown on the public by law and as to the sixtysix and twothirds which they are legally bound to pay and ought to have in their vaults every one knows there is no such amount of cash in the united states and what would be the course with what they really have there their notes are refused cash is called for the inhabitants of the banking towns will get what is in the vaults until a few banks declare their insolvency when the general crush becoming evident the others will withdraw even the cash they have declare their bankruptcy at once and leave an empty house and empty coffers for the holders of their notes in this scramble of creditors the country gets nothing the towns but little what are they to do bring suits a million of creditors bring a million of suits against john nokes and robert styles wheresoever to be found all nonsense the loss is total and a sum is thus swindled from our citizens of seven times the amount of the real debt and four times that of the fictitious one of the united states at the close of the war all this they will justly charge on their legislatures but this will be poor satisfaction for the two or three hundred millions they will have lost it is time then for the public functionaries to look to this perhaps it may not be too late perhaps by giving time to the banks they may call in and pay off their paper by degrees but no remedy is even to be expected while it rests with the state legislatures personal motive can be excited through so many avenues to their will that in their hands it will continue to go on from bad to worse until the catastrophe overwhelms us i still believe however that on proper representations of the subject a great proportion of these legislatures would cede to congress their power of establishing banks saving the charter rights already granted and this should be asked not by way of amendment to the constitution because until threefourths should consent nothing could be done but accepted from them one by one singly as their consent might be obtained any single state even if no other should come into the measure would find its interest in arresting foreign bank paper immediately and its own by degrees specie would flow in on them as paper disappeared their own banks would call in and pay off their notes gradually and their constituents would thus be saved from the general wreck should the greater part of the states concede as is expected their power over banks to congress besides insuring their own safety the paper of the nonconceding states might be so checked and circumscribed by prohibiting its receipt in any of the conceding states and even in the nonconceding as to duties taxes judgments or other demands of the united states or of the citizens of other states that it would soon die of itself and the medium of gold and silver be universally restored this is what ought to be done but it will not be done carthago non delibitur the overbearing clamor of merchants speculators and projectors will drive us before them with our eyes open until as in under the mississippi bubble our citizens will be overtaken by the crush of this baseless fabric without other satisfaction than that of execrations on the heads of those functionaries who from ignorance pusillanimity or corruption have betrayed the fruits of their industry into the hands of projectors and swindlers when i speak comparatively of the paper emission of the old congress and the present banks let it not be imagined that i cover them under the same mantle the object of the former was a holy one for if ever there was a holy war it was that which saved our liberties and gave us independence the object of the latter is to enrich swindlers at the expense of the honest and industrious part of the nation the sum of what has been said is that pretermitting the constitutional question on the authority of congress and considering this application on the grounds of reason alone it would be best that our medium should be so proportioned to our produce as to be on a par with that of the countries with which we trade and whose medium is in a sound state that specie is the most perfect medium because it will preserve its own level because having intrinsic and universal value it can never die in our hands and it is the surest resource of reliance in time of war that the trifling economy of paper as a cheaper medium or its convenience for transmission weighs nothing in opposition to the advantages of the precious metals that it is liable to be abused has been is and forever will be abused in every country in which it is permitted that it is already at a term of abuse in these states which has never been reached by any other nation france excepted whose dreadful catastrophe should be a warning against the instrument which produced it that we are already at ten or twenty times the due quantity of medium insomuch that no man knows what his property is now worth because it is bloating while he is calculating and still less what it will be worth when the medium shall be relieved from its present dropsical state and that it is a palpable falsehood to say we can have specie for our paper whenever demanded instead then of yielding to the cries of scarcity of medium set up by speculators projectors and commercial gamblers no endeavors should be spared to begin the work of reducing it by such gradual means as may give time to private fortunes to preserve their poise and settle down with the subsiding medium and that for this purpose the states should be urged to concede to the general government with a saving of chartered rights the exclusive power of establishing banks of discount for paper to the existence of banks of discount for cash as on the continent of europe there can be no objection because there can be no danger of abuse and they are a convenience both to merchants and individuals i think they should even be encouraged by allowing them a larger than legal interest on short discounts and tapering thence in proportion as the term of discount is lengthened down to legal interest on those of a year or more even banks of deposit where cash should be lodged and a paper acknowledgment taken out as its representative entitled to a return of the cash on demand would be convenient for remittances travelling persons c but liable as its cash would be to be pilfered and robbed and its paper to be fraudulently reissued or issued without deposit it would require skilful and strict regulation this would differ from the bank of amsterdam in the circumstance that the cash could be redeemed on returning the note when i commenced this letter to you my dear sir on mr laws memorial i expected a short one would have answered that but as i advanced the subject branched itself before me into so many collateral questions that even the rapid views i have taken of each have swelled the volume of my letter beyond my expectations and i fear beyond your patience yet on a revisal of it i find no part which has not so much bearing on the subject as to be worth merely the time of perusal i leave it then as it is and will add only the assurances of my constant and affectionate esteem and respect  a lapse of memory not having the letter to recur to  the real cash or money necessary to carry on the circulation and barter of a state is nearly one third part of all the annual rents of the proprietors of the said state that is one ninth of the whole produce of the land sir william petty supposes one tenth part of the value of the whole produce sufficient postlethwait voce cash  within five months after this they were compelled by the necessities of the war to abandon the idea of emitting only an adequate circulation and to make those necessities the sole measure of their emissions   gideon granger   jefferson further wrote to wirt thomas jefferson may       monticello wirt monticello may       dear sir —among some queries you addressed to me some time ago was one on the case of josiah phillips which happened early in the revolution not aware that the propriety of the proceeding in that case had been questioned and reprehended my answer was general on that query an application from another quarter having informed me of the doubts which had been expressed on it i have bestowed more reflection on it and i send you an extract from my answer by way of supplement to what i said to you on the subject i was then thoroughly persuaded of the correctness of the proceeding and am more and more convinced by reflection if i am in error it is an error of principle i know of no substitute for the process of outlawry so familiar to our law or to its kindred process by act of attainder duly applied which could have reached the case of josiah phillips one of these or absolute impunity seems the only alternative ever and affectionately thomas jefferson august        monticello wirt monticello august        dear sir —your favor of july   th came to hand on the   st and i will proceed to answer your inquiries in the order they are presented as far as i am able i have no doubt that the fifth of the rhode island resolutions of which you have sent me a copy is exactly the one erased from our journals the mr lees and especially richard henry who was industrious had a close correspondence i know with the two adams and probably with others in that and the other eastern states and i think it was said at the time that copies were sent off by them to the northward the very evening of the day on which they were passed i can readily enough believe these resolutions were written by mr henry himself they bear the stamp of his mind strong without precision that they were written by johnson who seconded them was only the rumor of the day and very possibly unfounded but how edmund randolph should have said they were written by william fleming and mr henry should have written that he showed them to william fleming is to me incomprehensible there was no william fleming then but the judge now living whom nobody will ever suspect of taking the lead in rebellion i am certain he was not then a member and i think was never a member until the revolution had made some progress of this however he will inform us with candor and truth his eldest brother john fleming was a member and a great speaker in debate to him they may have been shown yet i should not have expected this because he was extremely attached to robinson peyton randolph c and at their beck and had no independence or boldness of mind however he was attentive to his own popularity might have been overruled by views to that and without correction of the christian name mr henrys note is sufficient authority to suppose he took the popular side on that occasion i remember nothing to the contrary the opposers of the resolutions were robinson peyton randolph pendleton wythe bland and all the cyphers of the aristocracy no longer possessing the journals i cannot recollect nominally the others they opposed them on the ground that the same principles had been expressed in the petition c of the preceding year to which an answer not yet received was daily expected that they were therein expressed in more conciliatory terms and therefore more likely to have good effect the resolutions were carried chiefly by the vote of the middle and upper country to state the differences between the classes of society and the lines of demarkation which separated them would be difficult the law you know admitted none except as to the twelve counsellors yet in a country insulated from the european world insulated from its sister colonies with whom there was scarcely any intercourse little visited by foreigners and having little matter to act upon within itself certain families have risen to splendor by wealth and the preservation of it from generation to generation under the law entails some had produced a series of men of talents families in general had remained stationary on the grounds of their forefathers for there was no emigration to the westward in those days the wild irish who had gotten possession of the valley between the blue ridge and north mountain forming a barrier over which none ventured to leap and would still less venture to settle among in such a state of things scarcely admitting any change of station society would settle itself down into several strata separated by no marked lines but shading off imperceptibly from top to bottom nothing disturbing the order of their repose there were then aristocrats halfbreeds pretenders a solid independent yeomanry looking askance at those above yet not venturing to jostle them and last and lowest a seculum of beings called overseers the most abject degraded and unprincipled race always cap in hand to the dons who employed them and furnishing materials for the exercise of their pride insolence and spirit of domination your characters are inimitably and justly drawn i am not certain if more might not be said of colonel richard bland he was the most learned and logical man of those who took prominent lead in public affairs profound in constitutional lore a most ungraceful speaker as were peyton randolph and robinson in a remarkable degree he wrote the first pamphlet on the nature of the connection with great britain which had any pretension to accuracy of view on that subject but it was a singular one he would set out on sound principles pursue them logically till he found them leading to the precipice which he had to leap start back alarmed then resume his ground go over it in another direction be led again by the correctness of his reasoning to the same place and again back about and try other processes to reconcile right and wrong but finally left his reader and himself bewildered between the steady index of the compass in their hand and the phantasm to which it seemed to point still there was more sound matter in his pamphlet than in the celebrated farmers letters which were really but an ignis fatuus misleading us from true principles landon carters measure you may take from the first volume of the american philosophical transactions where he has one or more long papers on the weavil and perhaps other subjects his speeches like his writings were dull vapid verbose egotistical smooth as the lullaby of the nurse and commanding like that the repose only of the hearer you ask if you may quote me first for the loan office second phillips case and third the addresses prepared for congress by henry and lee for the two first certainly because within my own knowledge especially citing the record in phillips case which of itself refutes the diatribes published on that subject but not for the addresses because i was not present nor know anything relative to them but by hearsay from others my first and principal information on that subject i know i had from ben harrison on his return from the first session of the old congress mr pendleton also i am tolerably certain mentioned it to me but the transaction is too distant and my memory too indistinct to hazard as with precision even what i think i heard from them in this decay of memory mr edmund randolph must have suffered at a much earlier period of life than myself i cannot otherwise account for his saying to you that robert carter nicholas came into the legislature only on the death of peyton randolph which was in      seven years before that period i went first into the legislature myself towit in      and mr nicholas was then a member and i think not a new one i remember it from an impressive circumstance it was the first assembly of lord botetourt being called on his arrival on receiving the governors speech it was usual to move resolutions as heads for an address mr pendleton asked me to draw the resolutions which i did they were accepted by the house and pendleton nicholas myself and some others were appointed a committee to prepare the address the committee desired me to do it but when presented it was thought to pursue too strictly the diction of the resolutions and that their subjects were not sufficiently amplified mr nicholas chiefly objected to it and was desired by the committee to draw one more at large which he did with amplification enough and it was accepted being a young man as well as a young member it made on me an impression proportioned to the sensibility of that time of life on a similar occasion some years after i had reason to retain a remembrance of his presence while peyton randolph was living on the receipt of lord norths propositions in may or june      lord dunmore called the assembly peyton randolph then president of congress and speaker of the house of burgesses left the former body and came home to hold the assembly leaving in congress the other delegates who were the ancient leaders of our house he therefore asked me to prepare the answer to lord norths propositions which i did mr nicholas whose mind had as yet acquired no tone for that contest combated the answer from alpha to omega and succeeded in diluting it in one or two small instances it was firmly supported however in committee of the whole by peyton randolph who had brought with him the spirit of the body over which he had presided and it was carried with very little alteration by strong majorities i was the bearer of it myself to congress by whom as it was the first answer given to those propositions by any legislature it was received with peculiar satisfaction i am sure that from      if not earlier to      you will find mr nicholas name constantly in the journals for he was an active member i think he represented james city county whether on the death of peyton randolph he succeeded him for williamsburg i do not know if he did it may account for mr randolphs error you ask some account of mr henrys mind information and manners in      0 when i first became acquainted with him we met at nathan dandridges in hanover about the christmas of that winter and passed perhaps a fortnight together at the revelries of the neighborhood and season his manners had something of the coarseness of the society he had frequented his passion was fiddling dancing and pleasantry he excelled in the last and it attached every one to him the occasion perhaps as much as his idle disposition prevented his engaging in any conversation which might give the measure either of his mind or information opportunity was not wanting because mr john campbell was there who had married mrs spotswood the sister of colonel dandridge he was a man of science and often introduced conversations on scientific subjects mr henry had a little before broke up his store or rather it had broken him up and within three months after he came to williamsburg for his license and told me i think he had read law not more than six weeks i have by this time probably tired you with these old histories and shall therefore only add the assurance of my great friendship and respect   from the debates in the virginia convention        th jefferson to bernard moore before you enter on the study of the law a sufficient groundwork must be laid for this purpose an acquaintance with the latin and french languages is absolutely necessary the former you have the latter must now be acquired mathematics and natural philosophy are so useful in the most familiar occurrences of life and are so peculiarly engaging  delightful as would induce every person to wish an acquaintance with them besides this the faculties of the mind like the members of the body are strengthened  improved by exercise mathematical reasonings  deductions are therefore a fine preparation for investigating the abstruse speculations of the law in these and the analogous branches of science the following elementary books are recommended   mathematics berout cours de mathematiques the best for a student ever published montucla or bossus

these are physics ethics religion natural law belles lettres criticism rhetoric and oratory the carrying on several studies at a time is attended with advantage variety relieves the mind as well as the eye palled with too long attention to a single object but with both transitions from one object to another may be so frequent and transitory as to leave no impression the mean is therefore to be steered and a competent space of time allotted to each branch of study again a great inequality is observable in the vigor of the mind at different periods of the day its powers at these periods

this new laws were added by the legislature and new developments of the old laws by the judges until they had become so voluminous as to require a new digest this was ably executed by matthew bacon

and produced the inimitable commentaries of blackstone in the department of the chancery a similar progress has taken place ld kaim has given us the first digest of the principles of that branch of

th is just now received i am in general extremely unwilling to be carried into the newspapers no matter what the subject the whole pack of the essex kennel would open upon me with respect however to so much of my letter of january  th as relates to manufactures i have less repugnance because there is perhaps a degree of duty to avow a change of opinion called for by a change of circumstance and especially on a point now become peculiarly interesting what relates to bonaparte stands on different ground you think it will silence the misrepresentations of my enemies as to my opinion of him no sir it will not silence them they had no ground either in my words or actions for these misrepresentations before and cannot have less afterwards nor will they calumniate less there is however a consideration respecting our own friends which may merit attention i have grieved to see even good republicans so infatuated as to this man as to consider his downfall as calamitous to the cause of liberty in their indignation against england which is just they seem to consider all her enemies as our friends when it is well known there was not a being on earth who bore us so deadly a hatred in fact he saw nothing in this world but himself and looked on the people under him as his cattle beasts for burthen and slaughter promises cost him nothing when they could serve his purpose on his return from elba what did he not promise but those who had credited them a little soon saw their total insignificance and satisfied they could not fall under worse hands refused every effort after the defeat of waterloo their present sufferings will have a term his iron despotism would have had none france has now a family of fools at its head from whom whenever it can shake off its foreign riders it will extort a free constitution or dismount them and establish some other on the solid basis of national right to whine after this exorcised demon is a disgrace to republicans and must have arisen either from want of reflection or the indulgence of passion against principle if anything i have said could lead them to take correcter views to rally to the polar principles of genuine republicanism i could consent that that part of my letter also should go into a newspaper this i leave to yourself and such candid friends as you may consult there is one word in the letter however which decency towards the allied sovereigns requires should be softened instead of despots call them rulers the first paragraph too of seven or eight lines must be wholly omitted trusting all the rest to your discretion i salute you with great esteem and respect   jefferson omitted the paragraph which he bracketed as above but he sent a transcript of it to thomas ritchie editor of the richmond enquirer with the following letter thomas jefferson january         monticello thomas ritchie monticello january         dear sir —in answering the letter of a northern correspondent lately i indulged in a tirade against a pamphlet recently published in this quarter on revising my letter however i thought it unsafe to commit myself so far to a stranger i struck out the passage therefore yet i think the pamphlet of such a character as not to be unknown or unnoticed by the people of the united states it is the most bold and impudent stride new england has ever made in arrogating an ascendency over the rest of the union the first form of the pamphlet was an address from the reverend lyman beecher chairman of the connecticut society for the education of pious young men for the ministry its matter was then adopted and published in a sermon by reverend mr pearson of andover in massachusetts where they have a theological college and where the address with circumstantial variations to adapt it to more general use is reprinted on a sheet and a half of paper in so cheap a form as to be distributed i imagine gratis for it has a final note indicating six thousand copies of the first edition printed so far as it respects virginia the extract of my letter gives the outline i therefore send it to you to publish or burn abridge or alter as you think best you understand the public palate better than i do only give it such a title as may lead to no suspicion from whom you receive it i am the more induced to offer it to you because it is possible mine may be the only copy in the state and because too it may be à propos for the petition for the establishment of a theological society now before the legislature and to which they have shown the unusual respect of hearing an advocate for it at their bar from what quarter this theological society comes forward i know not perhaps from our own tramontaine clergy of new england religion and politics perhaps it is the entering wedge from its theological sister in andover for the body of qualified religious instructors proposed by their pious brethren of the east to evangelize and catechize to edify our daughters by weekly lectures and our wives by family visits from these pious young monks from harvard and yale however do with this what you please and be assured of my friendship and respect   on august         jefferson wrote to leroy and bayard thomas jefferson aug       monticello leroy bayard monticello aug       gentlemen —your favor of the  th is received and i shall endeavor to comply as exactly as in my power with the instalments with which messrs van staphorsts are so kind as to indulge me my resources are those of a farmer depending on the produce of my farms which is usually sold in april or may but sometimes necessarily on some credit to avoid sacrificing it which i am sure the kind motives of the loan would spare were these causes at any time to oblige me to overrun the exact day accept my thanks for your friendly intermediation in this business and the assurance of my great esteem and respect   jefferson further wrote to logan thomas jefferson june  0      monticello logan monticello june  0      dear sir —your favor of the  th is now received i never doubted the purity of your intentions in the publications of which i complained but the correctness only of committing to the public a private correspondence not intended for their eye as to federal slanders i never wished them to be answered but by the tenor of my life half a century of which has been on a theatre at which the public have been spectators and competent judges of its merit their approbation has taught a lesson useful to the world that the man who fears no truths has nothing to fear from lies i should have fancied myself half guilty had i condescended to put pen to paper in refutation of their falsehoods or drawn to them respect by any notice from myself but let all this be forgotten knowing now my repugnance to take any part in public discussions i shall be confident in future of being spared that pain and avail myself freely of every occasion of renewing to mrs logan and yourself the assurance of my sincere  friendly remembrance respect and attachment
